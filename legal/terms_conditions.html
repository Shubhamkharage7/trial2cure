All amounts are non-refundable, non-cancellable and non-creditable.</p>
<p>In making payments, you acknowledge that you are not relying on future availability of the Service beyond the current agreed Term or any Service upgrades or feature enhancements. If you add End Users during your Term, we will charge you for the increased number of End Users pursuant to the then-currently applicable rates in your next billing cycle. You agree that we may bill your credit card for renewals, additional End Users, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>
<p>You must elect one of the following billing options when registering and placing an order for the Service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly Plan. If you select this option, you will pay for the Services on a monthly basis. We will bill you: (i) Fees based upon the number of End User Accounts you are using. We will provide you with the monthly rate for the Services when you order the Service, and will use this rate to calculate the Fees, for your monthly charges.</li>
<li>Annual Plan. If you select this option, you will pay for the Services on an annual basis. We will bill you: (i) Fees based upon the number of End User Accounts you are using.

<p>Fees for Orders where you are paying with a credit card, debit card or other non-invoice form of payment are due the month prior to which you received the Services. For credit cards, or debit cards, as applicable: (i) we will charge you for all applicable Fees when due and (ii) these Fees are considered overdue after the end of the month during which you received the Services.</p>

<p>We may enable other forms of payment by making them available on the Site. These other forms of payment may be subject to additional terms which you may have to accept prior using the additional forms of payment.</p>
<p>Overdue payments may bear interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including legal or collection fees) incurred by us in collecting such delinquent amounts, except where such overdue amounts are due to our billing inaccuracies.</p>
<p>You will have thirty days to pay overdue Fees. If you do not pay overdue Fees within thirty days, we will automatically suspend you use of the Service. The duration of this suspension will be until you pay all outstanding Fees.</p>
<p>If you have a monthly billing plan or an annual billing plan commitment, we will continue to charge you Fees during suspension for non-payment and you must pay all outstanding Fees in order to resume use of the Services.</p>
<p>If you remain suspended for non-payment for more than sixty days, we may terminate this Agreement.</p>
<p>You are responsible for any duties, customs fees, or taxes (other than our income tax) associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (<strong>Taxes</strong>), and you will pay us for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.

<p><strong>Data</strong> <strong>Protection Laws</strong> means the EU Data Protection Laws and the laws of other states and territories that create and regulate substantially similar concepts and legal principles as are contained in the EU Data Protection Laws in relation to the processing of personal data and sensitive personal data.</p>
<p><strong>EU</strong> <strong>Data Protection</strong> <strong>Laws</strong> means, up to and including 24 May 2018, any legislation in force from time to time which implements the EU Directive 95/46/EC and relevant national implementations of the same and, with effect on and from 25 May 2018, means the GDPR and any relevant national implementations of the same;</p>
<p><strong>personal data</strong>, <strong>sensitive personal data</strong>, <strong>consent</strong>, <strong>controller</strong>, <strong>processor, data subject</strong> and <strong>processing</strong> mean those concepts, roles and activities as defined in the applicable EU Data Protection Laws and on and from 25 May 2018 <strong>sensitive personal data</strong> means those classes of personal data that are described in Article 9 of the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679) or, where relevant, equivalent concepts, roles and activities as described in other Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>We are the controller in respect of personal data and sensitive personal data, such as account registration details, that we collect directly from users of the Services (<strong>End Users</strong>) and users of No-Charge Services, and which we use for the purposes of our business.</p>
<p>You are the controller and we are the processor in respect of any other personal data and sensitive personal data (including within Your Modifications) that is uploaded by End Users and/or users of No-Charge Services including data, templates, information, content, code, video, images or other material of any type (<strong>Materials</strong>), or which is provided by your administrators (see Section 10 above).</p>
<p>On and from 25 May 2018, to the extent that the Services and/or Non-Charge Services comprise the processing of personal data or sensitive personal data where we are the processor and you are the controller and the processing of personal data or sensitive personal data is subject to the GDPR:</p>
<ul><li>you will comply with the requirements of the GDPR as the same apply to you as controller of the personal data or sensitive personal data; and</li>
<li>the provisions of Appendix 2 (Data Processing Agreement) to these Terms shall apply</li></ul>
<p>We will present our Privacy Policy to you and to others who may download Materials where we are a controller.  To the extent that we do not have direct contact with End Users or the relevant data subjects, for example, where personal data or sensitive personal data is uploaded relating to your employees or customers, and where we are a processor and not a controller, it is your responsibility to ensure that in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR:</p>
<ul><li>There is a lawful basis for the collection and processing of personal data and/or sensitive personal data; and</li>
<li<u>You present our Privacy Policy to those End Users and other data subjects, as required</u></li></ul>
<h3><strong>Appendix 2 (Data Processing Agreement)</strong></h3>
<p>The provisions of this Appendix (<strong>Data Processing Agreement</strong>) form part of the Agreement to the extent that Section 6 of the Agreement applies.</p>
<p>JRS Innovation shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by European Union or the national law of an EU member state to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;</li>
<li>ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;</li>
<li>implement appropriate organisational and technical measures as required pursuant to Article 32 (security of processing) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. The measures that we consider appropriate are more fully described in JRS Innovation's Architecture and Security document (a copy of which is available on request). This document outlines:
<ul>
<li>our architecture and infrastructure through which Services and No-Charge Services are provided;</li>
<li>security controls employed by us and our service providers in protecting personal and/or sensitive personal data; and</li>
<li>security controls employed by our support channels which handle personal data or sensitive personal data.</li>

</li>
<li>respect the conditions for engaging another processor referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 28 (processor) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679;</li>

<li>assist the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the processor;</li>
<li>at the choice of the controller, delete or return all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and delete existing copies unless EU law or the national law of an EU member state or another applicable law, including any USA state or Commonwealth law to which the processor is subject requires storage of the personal data;</li>
<li>make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 (processor) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by the controller (in each case at the controller's cost).</li></ol>
