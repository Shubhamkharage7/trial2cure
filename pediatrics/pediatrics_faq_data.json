        "answer": "how to reduce pre diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes. It is often considered a warning sign for diabetes, but the good news is that it can be managed or even reversed with lifestyle changes. The management of pre-diabetes typically includes adopting a healthy diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins, coupled with regular physical activity to help regulate blood sugar levels. Weight loss, even a small percentage of body weight, can significantly reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. In some cases, doctors might recommend medications, but clinical trials have shown that lifestyle changes are the most effective intervention. Research in clinical trials also continues to explore new preventive strategies, which could potentially lead to better management options for those at risk of developing diabetes.",
