                        <p>Spina bifida is a congenital condition that occurs when the spine and spinal cord do not form properly during early pregnancy. It is a type of neural tube defect, which results from the incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes surrounding the spinal cord. Pediatric spina bifida can lead to various physical and neurological challenges, depending on the severity of the condition. It is one of the most common congenital disabilities, affecting approximately 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the United States. </p>
                        <h4>Types of Spina Bifida</h4>
                        <p>There are three primary forms of spina bifida, each varying in severity:
                        <ol>
                          <li>Spina Bifida Occulta:
                            <p>The mildest form, where there is a small gap in one or more of the vertebrae but no opening in the back. This type often goes undetected as it usually doesn’t cause any symptoms or disabilities.</p>
                            <p>Many individuals with spina bifida occulta are unaware they have the condition because it typically doesn't cause health problems.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>Meningocele:
                            <p>In this form, a sac of fluid pushes through an opening in the spine, but the spinal cord is not involved. This sac is visible outside the baby's body at birth.</p>
                            <p>Meningocele can cause mild disabilities, depending on where the malformation occurs, but it is generally less severe than other forms.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>Myelomeningocele:
                            <p>The most severe form of spina bifida, where both the spinal cord and nerves push through an open section in the vertebrae, forming a visible sac on the back.</p>
                            <p>This form often results in moderate to severe disabilities, including issues with mobility, bladder and bowel function, and sometimes cognitive challenges.</p>
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="h1 mb-4">Causes of Spina Bifida</h2>
                        <p>The exact cause of spina bifida is not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some contributing factors include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Folic Acid Deficiency: Lack of sufficient folic acid (vitamin B9) during pregnancy is a major risk factor for neural tube defects like spina bifida.</li>
                          <li>Genetics: A family history of neural tube defects increases the likelihood of a baby being born with spina bifida.</li>
                          <li>
                            Hormone receptor status: Hormone receptor-positive cancers often benefit from hormone therapy.
                          </li>
                          <li>Targeted Therapy: Targeted therapy focuses on specific proteins or genes that contribute to cancer growth. For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, drugs that target the HER2 protein are often used as part of adjuvant therapy.
                          </li>
                          <li>Environmental Factors: Certain medications, maternal diabetes, and obesity are known to increase the risk of spina bifida.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <!-- <p>Tumor size: Larger tumors often have a higher risk of recurrence, which makes adjuvant therapy more likely. </p>
                                                <p>A•	Lymph node involvement: If cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, there is a higher chance that it may return, warranting adjuvant therapy. </p> -->
                        <h2 class="h1 mb-4">Symptoms of Spina Bifida</h2>
                        <p>The symptoms of spina bifida vary depending on the type and severity of the condition:
                          <li>Spina Bifida Occulta: Usually has no noticeable symptoms, but some children may experience mild back pain or other minor symptoms.</li>
                          <li>Meningocele: May cause mild physical issues, though the spinal cord is usually undamaged.</li>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Myelomeningocele: This type typically causes severe disabilities, including:
                          <li>The most severe form of spina bifida, where both the spinal cord and nerves push through an open section in the vertebrae, forming a visible sac on the back.</li>
                          <li>This form often results in moderate to severe disabilities, including issues with mobility, bladder and bowel function, and sometimes cognitive challenges.</li>

                        <h4>Causes of Spina Bifida</h4>
                        <p>The exact cause of spina bifida is not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some contributing factors include:

                        </p>
                        <h4>Symptoms of Spina Bifida</h4>
                        <p>The symptoms of spina bifida vary depending on the type and severity of the condition:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Spina Bifida Occulta: Usually has no noticeable symptoms, but some children may experience mild back pain or other minor symptoms.</li>

                            <ul>
                              <li>Paralysis or weakness of the legs.</li>
                              <li>Bladder and bowel control problems.</li>
                              <li>Hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the brain), which may require a shunt to drain the excess fluid.</li>
                            </ul>
                            In some cases, learning difficulties or cognitive impairments may be present.
                          </li>

                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Diagnosis and Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Prenatal Diagnosis:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Prenatal Diagnosis: Spina bifida can often be diagnosed during pregnancy through ultrasound, amniocentesis, or maternal blood tests (such as the AFP test, which measures alpha-fetoprotein levels).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Postnatal Treatment:</h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Surgery: Newborns with myelomeningocele often require surgery shortly after birth to close the defect and prevent infection. In some cases, fetal surgery may be performed before birth to repair the spine.</li>
                          <li>Physical Therapy: Children with spina bifida may benefit from physical therapy to strengthen muscles, improve mobility, and maintain joint function.</li>
                          <li>Assistive Devices: Many children with spina bifida require devices such as braces, walkers, or wheelchairs to help with movement.</li>
                          <li>Ongoing Medical Care: Children with severe spina bifida may need lifelong care from specialists, including urologists, orthopedic surgeons, and neurologists, to manage complications such as hydrocephalus or bladder dysfunction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Prognosis and Quality of Life</h4>
                        <p>The outlook for children with spina bifida varies based on the severity of the condition. Many children with spina bifida occulta or meningocele lead normal lives with minimal or no disabilities. However, children with myelomeningocele may face more significant challenges and require lifelong medical care. With early intervention, assistive technologies, and appropriate medical support, many children with spina bifida can lead fulfilling lives, participate in school, and engage in social activities.</p>
