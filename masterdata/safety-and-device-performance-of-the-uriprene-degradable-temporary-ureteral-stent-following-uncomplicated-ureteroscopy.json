If, during the course of treatment of the target ureter with the Uriprene stent the patient's asymptomatic stone becomes symptomatic and requires treatment, the patient can only be managed with standard of care treatment including the use of an approved ureteral stent, if necessary.\n4. Subjects with a height and body size able to accommodate a 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30 mm long ureteral stent, as judged by the Investigator.\n5. Subjects with the ability to understand the requirements of the study, who have provided written informed consent, and are willing to undergo all follow-up assessments according to the specified schedule.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subjects with a history of an anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract.\n2. Presence of ureteral fistula.\n3. Presence of urothelial cancer, ureteral tumor, or renal tumor.\n4. Presence of extrinsic compression of the ureter.\n5. Presence of ureteral blockage or stricture.\n6. Bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder.\n7. Subjects with known/diagnosed overactive bladder (OAB).\n8. Subjects with known/diagnosed urge urinary incontinence (UUI).\n9. Subjects with a known, active upper or lower urinary tract infection at the time of stent insertion.\n10. Subjects with creatinine level of \u02c32.5 mg/dl.\n11. Pregnant or lactating women, or women of childbearing potential who do not employ a reliable method of contraception as judged by the Investigator, and/or are not willing to use reliable contraception for the duration of study participation.\n12. Impacted ureteral stones still in place and/or incomplete stone fragmentation.\n13. Ureteral perforation.\n14. Staghorn calculi.\n15. Subjects with a solitary kidney.\n16. History of bleeding diathesis or currently taking blood thinners such as warfarin (anti- platelet agents are allowed).\n17. Contrast allergy that cannot be adequately pre-treated.\n18. Subject has known severe psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, or other reason for being unable to follow trial follow-up instructions or unable to reliably complete patient questionnaires.\n19. Any condition, in the opinion of the investigator, that would deem a subject as ineligible for treatment with the Uriprene\u00ae Stent.\n20. Subject has a known significant concomitant illness with a life expectancy of \\<1 year.\n21. Subject is known to be currently enrolled in another investigational trial.",
