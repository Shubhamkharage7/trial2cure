            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two dose levels (2.5 mL and 5.0 mL) of Bludigo\u2122 (indigotindisulfonate Sodium Injection, USP) 0.8% when used as an aid in the determination of ureteral patency.\n\nSubjects scheduled for a surgical procedure in which the patency of the ureter must be assessed by cystoscopy following the procedure, age 18 to 85 years inclusive, will be screened for participation. Screening will occur within 30 days before study drug administration (Day of Surgery). After signing the informed consent, review of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be performed, the collection of concomitant medications, medical history, physical examination, baseline laboratory testing, 12-lead ECG, and vital sign measurements will be completed during the screening visit.\n\nOn the day of surgery (Day 1) subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for randomization. Eligible subjects will be stratified by BMI (\\<30.0 kg/m2or \u2265 30.0 kg/m2) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a dose of either Bludigo\u2122 high dose (5.0 mL) or Bludigo\u2122 low dose (2.5 mL). Each randomized subject will serve as his/her own control (i.e., intra-patient controlled) by receiving a dose of normal saline prior to receiving the randomized Bludigo\u2122 dose.\n\nAll treated subjects will have a follow-up visit 7 to 30 days (\u00b1 2 days) after the procedure. A final telephone follow-up call will occur on Day 30 (\u00b1 2 days) in subjects who have the follow-up visit before Day 28. Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs during and post the procedure, clinical laboratory tests, 12-Lead ECG, and vital sign measurements."
