            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a web-based parent training (Parenting Wisely) augmented with facilitated parent groups (referred to as PWRT). PWRT is designed to prepare parents for the reintegration of their adolescents in the home after intensive psychiatric residential treatment. Researchers will compare PWRT to treatment as usual to determine whether PWRT effects target mechanisms (i.e., family function, social support, parental self-efficacy, parenting practices) and adolescent outcomes (i.e., internalizing and externalizing behaviors, placement restrictiveness).",
            "detailedDescription": "A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is employed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, engagement of target mechanisms, and preliminary effects of PWRT in parents with adolescents transitioning from residential treatment (RT) to the community. Parents (n=60) will be randomly assigned to receive Parenting Wisely augmented with facilitated discussion groups (referred to as PWRT; n=30) or treatment-as-usual (TAU; n=30). In the PWRT condition, parents will complete 2 web-based modules in an online parent training program called Parenting Wisely. Parents will also attend a 90-minute discussion group via Zoom. The RCT will allow for testing of target mechanism engagement (i.e., parental self-efficacy, parenting behaviors, social support, family function) and the intervention's effects on adolescent outcomes (i.e., internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, placement restrictiveness). Parents will complete assessments at baseline (T1), six weeks post-baseline (T2), and six months post-baseline (T3) via REDCap. While adolescents (n=60) will not directly receive the intervention, they will complete assessments at baseline, six weeks post-baseline (T2), and six months post-baseline (T3).\n\nAim 1: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PWRT. 1a. Evaluate the feasibility of PWRT by tracking the frequency, dose, and duration. 1b. Evaluate the acceptability of PWRT for parents with adolescents in RT.\n\nAim 2: Determine the effects of PWRT on the target mechanisms compared to the TAU condition from baseline to 6-weeks and 6-months post-baseline.\n\nAim 3: Determine the effects of PWRT on adolescent outcomes compared to the TAU condition from baseline to 6-weeks and 6-months post-baseline. 3a. Determine if changes in the target mechanisms are associated with adolescent outcomes at six weeks and six months post-baseline.\n\nExploratory Aim: Explore the feasibility of collecting data from adolescents in an RT facility by tracking frequency (recruitment, enrollment, retention rates), duration (time between parent consent and assent; survey duration), and barriers to data collection."

In this study, data that will be deposited will include primary outcomes measures such as The Brief Problem Monitor, the Restrictiveness Evaluation Measure, Parenting Sense of Competence Scale, Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, and McMaster Family Assessment Device.
