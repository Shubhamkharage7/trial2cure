Pre-op MRI must be performed within 28 days prior to study enrollment.\n* Performance Score: (KPS/LS) \u2265 60. Participants who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n* Bone Marrow:\n\n  * ANC (Absolute neutrophil count) \u2265 1,500\u00b5l (unsupported)\n  * Platelets \u2265 100/\u00b5l (unsupported for at least 3 days)\n  * Hemoglobin \\> 8 g/dL\n* Renal:\n\n  * BUN \u2264 25 mg/dl\n  * Creatinine \u2264 1.7 mg/dl\n* Hepatic\n\n  * Bilirubin \u2264 2.0 mg/dl\n  * ALT \u2264 5 times institutional upper limits of normal for age\n  * AST \u2264 5 times institutional upper limits of normal for age\n* Signed informed consent. If the patient's age or mental status precludes his/her giving informed consent, written informed consent may be given by a legally authorized representative.\n* For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), negative serum/urine pregnancy test at enrollment.\n* WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable contraceptive methods to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Refer to Appendix B for definition of WOCBP and guidance on acceptable contraceptive methods.\n* Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use physician-approved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence, condoms, vasectomy) throughout the study and should avoid conceiving children for 24 weeks following the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known active infection (requiring treatment by antiviral or antibiotics) or immunosuppressive disease.\n* Patients with multifocal recurrent disease characterized by more than one enhancing lesion separated by noncontiguous T2/FLAIR signal abnormality. Patients with recurrence outside of the original tumor site are eligible if there is stability at the original site of disease.\n* Patients with uncontrolled seizure disorders\n* Any patients that have received any live vaccines within 30 days prior to enrollment\n* Tumors with primary localization to the brainstem or spinal cord\n* Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:\n\n  * Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization.\n  * Unstable cardiac arrhythmias, abnormalities, or transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous treatment at study treatment.\n  * Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at study treatment\n  * Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects.\n  * Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.\n  * Patients with autoimmune disease requiring medical management with immunosuppressants.\n  * Major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that, in the investigator's opinion, will prevent administration or completion of protocol therapy.\n  * Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception for the entire study period; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.\n* Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents or who have been treated on any other therapeutic clinical protocols within 30 days prior to projected first dose of study treatment.\n* Participants who are unwilling or unable to receive treatment and undergo follow-up evaluations",
