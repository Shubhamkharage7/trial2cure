Study details include:\n\n* Total Study duration: up to 38 weeks\n* Screening:\n\n  * Initial Screening duration: up to 4 weeks\n  * Pre-treatment Diet Standardization Period duration: up to 6 weeks\n* Blinded Treatment Duration: 24 weeks\n\n  * 2-week blinded dose titration period\n  * 22-week blinded assessment period\n* Safety Follow-Up: 4 weeks after last dose (as applicable for those not enrolling in the long term extension study, ENSEMBLE)",
            "detailedDescription": "Overall Design:\n\nThis global Phase 3 multi-center, multi-national, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in participants with classical CBS deficient HCU receiving standard of care who continue to have tHcy levels \u226550 \u03bcM. The total study duration will be up to 38 weeks. Approximately 70 participants (35 per arm) will be randomized to receive active drug or placebo (1:1 allocation).\n\nScreening:\n\nParticipants will enter into a 2-phase Screening period of up to 10 weeks:\n\n1. Initial Screening: up to 4-week period during which participants will be assessed for eligibility\n2. Pre-treatment Diet Standardization Period (DSP): After meeting initial eligibility criteria, participants will begin a pre treatment DSP of up to 6 weeks. The DSP is intended to help minimize variability in protein intake and supplements throughout the randomized portion of the study.\n\nThe baseline diet and compliance with HCU-related treatments will be recorded by the dietitian using the HCU-specific diet monitoring tool, called SING (Simplified Ingested Nutrients Guide). The baseline diet and treatment compliance will be used as a reference for future evaluation of daily intact protein intake (DIPI) and HCU treatments.\n\nBlinded Treatment Period:\n\nDuring the 24-week blinded treatment period, study visits will occur at regular intervals including home visits for study drug administration. Some study visits may be conducted remotely. Dietary protein intake and compliance with HCU treatments will continue to be monitored and recorded to ensure a stable diet and HCU treatment compliance."
