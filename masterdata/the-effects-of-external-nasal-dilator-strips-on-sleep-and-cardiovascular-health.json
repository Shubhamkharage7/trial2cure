            "briefSummary": "The goal of this interventional study is to learn if wearing an external nasal dilator strip while sleeping changes objective and perceived sleep quality, immediate post-waking blood pressure, and immediate-post waking heart rate variability.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nasal dilator strips are strips often made up of stiff plastic, placed on the lower bridge of the nose by an adhesive strip. They work by slightly pulling the nostrils and surrounding nose bridge area outward, dilating the nostrils, and decreasing air resistance. Nasal breathing is associated with lower diastolic blood pressure, an important marker of heart health, in comparison to mouth breathing. In addition to blood pressure, nasal breathing during sleep is potentially related with better sleep quality. Participating in this study will help us understand the effect nasal dilator strips have on cardiovascular and sleep health. Better understanding of the benefits of nasal dilator strips will provide important knowledge to researchers who study how the body works."
