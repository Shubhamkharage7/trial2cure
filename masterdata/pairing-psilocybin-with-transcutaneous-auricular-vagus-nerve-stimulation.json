            "briefSummary": "This study will examine whether combining a single dose of psilocybin with non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), a known inducer of neuroplasticity and enhanced memory formation, will enhance the long-term beneficial behavioral effects of psilocybin when compared to sham taVNS by allowing memory for insights gained during the psychedelic experience to remain vivid after they will have faded in subjects who receive psilocybin followed by sham taVNS.",
            "detailedDescription": "One hundred and eight adults will receive a single open-label 25 mg dose of psilocybin administered within a \"set and setting\" (SaS) framework of psychological support provided by trained facilitators, such as has been successfully employed in prior psychedelic studies at University of Wisconsin-Madison. The SaS protocol will include 2-4 hours of preparation, a 6- to 8-hour psilocybin dosing session and an hour-long integration session 1 day and 9 days post dosing. All subjects will receive various combinations of active taVNS or sham taVNS prior to, or following, psilocybin dosing.\n\nActive and sham taVNS sessions will last 20 minutes and will occur twice daily (morning and afternoon/evening) for 7 consecutive days, using an \"at home\" protocol that has been used safely and effectively by study collaborators. taVNS is a non-invasive low-risk procedure.\n\nSubjects will be randomized with equal allocation to one of four conditions: 1) seven days of sham taVNS prior to psilocybin dosing and 7 days of active taVNS post- psilocybin dosing (Group 1: n=27); 2) seven days of sham taVNS prior to psilocybin dosing and 7 days of sham taVNS post- psilocybin dosing (Group 2: n=27); 3) seven days of sham taVNS prior to psilocybin dosing and treatment as usual post- psilocybin dosing (Group 3: n=27); and 4) seven days of active taVNS prior to psilocybin dosing and 7 days of sham taVNS post- psilocybin dosing (Group 4: n=27). It is anticipated that a total sample of 108 subjects will be enrolled to provide 100 subjects who complete study activities/assessments sufficient to provide evaluable data for testing study primary and exploratory outcomes."

After reviewing a short proposal prepared by an external investigator, the PI will approve requests with appropriate experimental design, scientific merit, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and recommend revisions for proposals requiring further justification or modifications. Informed consent documents will provide sufficient detail about the intent to archive, share, and re-analyze data.\n\nMRI data will also be shared upon request using the same data sharing process described above. To facilitate interpretation of the data, imaging parameters, gender, age, and racial information will be shared and associated with the dataset."
