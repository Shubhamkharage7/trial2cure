            "briefSummary": "Prehabilitation refers to the process of improving a patient's functional capabilities prior to a surgical procedure with the goal of decreasing post-surgical inactivity and physical decline. This clinical trial evaluates the utility of a personalized home-based prehabilitation exercise intervention for the improvement of physical function and surgical outcomes in patients receiving chemotherapy before routine radical cystectomy for localized (non-metastatic) muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The exercise intervention includes at-home exercise sessions focused on the improvement of core strength and balance as well as personalized step count goals, delivered to patients remotely via a smart-device-based application (ExerciseRx). Encouraging physical activity before surgery may improve physical function and surgical outcomes in patients who are scheduled to undergo surgery for their non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms and are followed from enrollment through neoadjuvant chemotherapy receipt, radical cystectomy, and for 90 days following surgery (total estimated time on study: \\~7 months)\n\nARM A: Patients use the ExerciseRx application (app) to follow the (P)REHAB exercise program, which consists of four 20-30 minute home exercise sessions per week and personalized step count goal setting and tracking, while receiving standard of care (SOC) NAC prior to SOC radical cystectomy (RC), and for 90 days following surgery. Patients also wear a FitBit and use the FitBit app on study.\n\nARM B: Patients receive SOC educational materials and wear a FitBit and use the FitBit app while receiving SOC NAC prior to SOC RC.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 90 days following SOC RC."
