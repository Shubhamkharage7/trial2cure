Patients will be enrolled into one of the following cancer cohorts:\n\n* Cohort A: CRC\n* Cohort B: Gastric and GEJ cancer\n* Cohort C: TNBC\n* Cohort D: Platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (ovarian cancer)",
            "detailedDescription": "After completing all screening procedures, including the submission of a tissue sample, patients that meet eligibility requirements will be assigned to receive navicixizumab alone or in combination with another anticancer agent. Treatment is assigned based on the patients type of tumor and the cohort that is open at the time of enrollment. Patients will receive treatment in 4 week cycles, attend study visits and have their heart monitored through echocardiograms and daily blood pressure measurements. Patients will also have their tumors monitored regularly through CT scans. Patients receiving benefit may continue on study drug until their tumor progresses, they experience intolerable side effects, their physician decides it is in their best interest to discontinue therapy or they choose to withdrawal from the study. After discontinuing study treatments, all patients will receive regular follow up calls or visits to assess their status and other anticancer treatments they may start."
