            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well venetoclax, cladribine, low dose cytarabine, and azacitidine work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has previously not been treated. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax, cladribine, and low dose cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Azacitidine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving venetoclax, cladribine, low dose cytarabine induction followed by cladribine, low dose cytarabine, and azacitidine consolidation may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the complete response (CR/complete response with incomplete recovery \\[CRi\\]) rate of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with venetoclax combined with cladribine (2-CDA) plus low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) alternating with 5-azacytidine.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess overall survival (OS) of patients with AML treated with venetoclax added to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.\n\nII. To assess the disease free survival (DFS) patients with AML treated with venetoclax added to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine and achieved a complete response (CR/CRi).\n\nIII. To assess the overall response rate of patients with AML treated with venetoclax added to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.\n\nIV. To assess toxicity and induction mortality of patients with AML treated with venetoclax added to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate and determine venetoclax pharmacokinetics (pK) in presence or absence of concomitantly administered drugs such as posaconazole, voriconazole, isafuconazole, and fluconazole.\n\nII. Investigate the correlation between venetoclax pK with toxicities and efficacy.\n\nIII. Investigate the correlation of baseline cytogenetic and mutational data with likelihood of response and resistance to the regimen.\n\nIV. Evaluate the depth of response with minimal residual disease (MRD) testing and correlate with long term outcome.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION: Patients receive cladribine intravenously (IV) daily over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10, and venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Treatment continues for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve a CR or CRi after cycle 1 may receive a second induction cycle. Patients who do not achieve CR or CRi after second induction cycle may proceed to cycle 3 of consolidation per investigator.\n\nCONSOLIDATION/MAINTENANCE:\n\nPatients who achieve CR or CRi after cycle 1 of induction receive cladribine IV over 1-2 hours daily on days 1-3, cytarabine SC BID on days 1-10, and venetoclax PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycle 2. All patients receive cladribine IV daily over 1-2 hours of cycles 5-6, 9-10, 13-14, and 17-18, cytarabine SC BID on days 1-3 of cycles 5-6, 9-10, 13-14, and 17-18, venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21 of cycle 3-18, and azacitidine SC daily or IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-7 of cycles 3-4, 7-8, 1-12, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months for 5 years."
