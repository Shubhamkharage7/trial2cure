The response assessment during treatment holiday period will be based on PET/CT every 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess a potential survival benefit (2-year survival rate) of patients treated with Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-PSMA-617) therapy on a flexible dosing schedule including up to 12 cycles and potential \"treatment holiday\" periods in comparison to patients treated with the standard fixed dosing schedule of maximum 6 treatment cycles every 6 weeks.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety of the flexible/extended schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.\n\nII. To compare the overall survival (OS) of the flexible/extended schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy to the standard-of-care schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.\n\nIII. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of the flexible/extended schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy to the standard-of-care schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.\n\nIV. To compare the disease control rate (DCR) of the flexible/extended schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy to the standard-of-care schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.\n\nV. To compare the impact on bone pain level of the flexible/extended schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy to the standard-of-care schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.\n\nVI. To compare the impact on health-related quality of life of the flexible/extended schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy to the standard-of-care schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the dosimetry in organs and tumor lesions of the flexible/extended schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 intravenously (IV) once every 6 weeks on study. Beginning with the third cycle, treatments may be postponed beyond the 6 weeks interval based on defined response criteria (\"treatment holiday\" period). Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive gallium Ga 68 gozetotide (68Ga-PSMA-11) IV and undergo prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA PET/CT) throughout the trial. Patients also undergo single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT, PET/CT, or CT on the trial.\n\nARM II: Patients receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 IV once every 6 weeks on study. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 IV and undergo PSMA PET/CT throughout the trial. Patients also undergo SPECT/CT, PET/CT, or CT on the trial.\n\nUpon completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months from after first cycle of study treatment."
