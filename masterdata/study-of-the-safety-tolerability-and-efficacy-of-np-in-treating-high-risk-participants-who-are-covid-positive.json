            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase IIa/IIb multicenter, interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NP-101 in outpatient high-risk COVID-19 positive participants. Blinding roles: Participants, Investigators and Sponsor\n\nThe study is comprised of two parts (Phase IIa and Phase IIb) and four cohorts. The first part of the trial (IIa) involves three cohorts and is a dose escalation study designed to select the maximum tolerated dose for use in the second part (IIb) of the study. In the dose escalation (Phase IIa) portion of the trial (n= 60), qualified participants will be enrolled in a parallel dose escalation design and randomized in a 3:1 \\[active+best supportive care (BSC):placebo+BSC\\]ratio to one of three cohorts of 20 participants each (15 active +BSC, 5 placebo + BSC). Cohort 1 (15 participants taking 600 mg capsules for a total daily dose of 3 grams of NP-101 plus BSC and 5 participants taking placebo plus BSC), and Cohort 2 (15 participants taking 600 mg capsules for a total daily dose of 4.8 g of NP-101+ BSC and 5 participants taking placebo plus BSC will run concurrently since acceptable safety data for the 3 g dose was obtained in an earlier phase II study.\n\nCohort 1 will receive either 3 g Total Daily Dose (TDD) of NP-101 + BSC or Placebo+ BSC, Cohort 2 will receive either 4.8 g TDD of NP-101 +BSC or placebo + BSC) and Cohort 3 (15 participants taking 600 mg capsules for a total daily dose of 6 g of NP-101 + BSC and 5 participants taking placebo plus BSC.) Safety will be evaluated according to the terms of the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). In the second portion of the trial (Phase IIb), Participants enrolled in Cohort 4 (n= 248) will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 (active+BSC : placebo+BSC) and will receive the Maximum Tolerated Daily Dose (MTDD) as determined by the parameters set by the SAP and approved by the pharmacovigilance team."
