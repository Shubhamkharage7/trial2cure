            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of unseparated whole blood (referred to as Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood) and the separate components of whole blood (including red cells, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate) in critically injured patients who require large-volume blood transfusions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Trauma is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and disproportionately affects the young, killing those who might otherwise have lived long and productive lives. Injuries account for more years of potential life lost before age 75 than any other cause. Hemorrhage remains the most common cause of preventable death after injury, and blood transfusion is an essential part of treatment. Modern blood banking practices separate donated whole blood into components. The current standard of care in trauma transfusion is the balanced administration of equal numbers of units of blood components (packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets), effectively attempting to reconstitute whole blood. A renewed approach to blood transfusion therapy in trauma is to use whole blood from the outset, which has not been separated. Compared with component therapy, whole blood offers several potential advantages, but there are only a small number of, mostly observational, studies comparing whole blood and component therapy, and they are very heterogeneous.\n\nThe TROOP trial will include injured adults with hemorrhagic shock anticipated to require massive blood transfusions, who will be randomized to receive either whole blood (LTOWB) or blood components. This will allow a direct comparison to see if one type of transfusion is more strongly associated with improved clinical outcomes over the other.\n\nThe knowledge gained from this clinical trial will transform the way in which massively bleeding trauma patients are transfused. The trial is exceedingly well positioned to improve mortality from trauma and reduce the number of preventable deaths resulting from hemorrhagic shock."
