KIND T cells are a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory into KIND T cells so they will recognize certain markers found in tumor cells. Drugs such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are chemotherapy drugs used to decrease the number of T cells in the body to make room for KIND T cells. Giving KIND T cells after cyclophosphamide and fludarabine may be more useful against cancer compared to the usual treatment for patients with H3.3K27M-mutated diffuse midline glioma (DMG).",

To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of autologous anti-H3.3K27M T-cell receptor (TCR) -expressing T-cells (KIND T cells) in HLA-A\\*0201+ participants with H3.3K27M+ diffuse midline gliomas.\n\nII. To determine the safety profile of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of KIND T cells in HLA-A\\*0201+ participants with H3.3K27M+ diffuse midline gliomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate manufacturing feasibility of KIND T cells.\n\nII. To characterize KIND T cells with respect to their expansion and persistence.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.
