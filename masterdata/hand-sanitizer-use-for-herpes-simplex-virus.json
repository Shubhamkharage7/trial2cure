The duration of an HSV-1 (herpes) lesion is the primary endpoint for this study. Size, pain, and discomfort are the secondary endpoints.",
            "detailedDescription": "The participants will be divided into a control group (10 participants) and treatment group (10 participants) and will be given either the Purell hand sanitizer (treatment group) or medical grade mineral oil (control group) to treat the lesion. Participants will apply a large drop of the product (purell hand sanitizer or mineral oil) on a q-tip and will hold the q-tip on the lesion for 10 seconds. Participants will be instructed to apply a solution to lesion every waking hour for the next 14 days or until lesion has healed. Each day the participant will fill out the daily journal. The journal includes a measurement in millimeters of the lesion with graph paper, recorded number of applications for that day, and two visual analog scales- one measuring any discomfort from the lesion and the other recording the pain during the application process.\n\nDocumentation of changes to the lesion will be recorded in a daily journal until the lesion is healed. There are two days that the participants are expected to return to the clinic for re-examination at day three and the last day when the lesion has healed, or the crust has fallen off. Pictures of the lesion will taken at these two points in time.\n\nThe duration the HSV-1 lesion, level of pain and discomfort during treatment, and the size of the HSV-1 lesion will be statistically measured between the control group (mineral oil) and the treatment group (purell hand sanitizer) to determine if there is any statistical difference between the two groups."
