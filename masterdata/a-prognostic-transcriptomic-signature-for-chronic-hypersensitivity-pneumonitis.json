For unknown reasons, a subgroup of patients with HP without a known inciting antigen exposure develops chronic disease with progressive pulmonary fibrosis (the leading cause of death). Accurately identifying patients at risk of disease progression is necessary for prognosis and therapy.\n\nEnrolled subjects will be followed for 24 months and complete 5 visits to one of the study centers. Blood biomarkers will be collected in addition to other clinical data to determine if these biomarkers can predict disease progression."
