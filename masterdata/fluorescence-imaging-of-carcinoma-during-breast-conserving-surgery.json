            "briefSummary": "Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is performed on patients with breast cancer to resect and completely remove the cancer while conserving as much of the surrounding healthy tissue as possible. Current methods do not allow surgeons to determine the completeness of surgical resection in real-time. This often results in the need for a second surgical procedure, or in some cases more than two surgical procedures in order to have confidence that all cancer has been removed.\n\nThis Phase 3 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the fluorescent imaging agent PD G 506 A for the real-time visualization of cancer during standard of care breast conserving surgery. PD G 506 A is an investigational drug which is converted in the body into a fluorescent molecule that accumulates in cancer cells. Patients receiving PD G 506 A will undergo standard of care breast conserving surgery followed by fluorescence imaging and removal of any potentially cancerous tissue left behind in the surgical cavity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Re-operations due to positive margins following breast conserving surgery (BCS) increase poor cosmesis, complications, discomfort, stress, adjuvant delay, medical costs and risk of local recurrence. Reducing positive margin rates can be achieved through optimizing surgical procedures. This study evaluates a new method for surgeons to visualize carcinoma in real-time, both in the surgical cavity and on the margins of excised specimen(s) during the index BCS procedure.\n\nThe active ingredient of PD G 506A is aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA HCl). ALA HCl is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the fluorescent molecule protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The exogenous application of ALA HCl leads to a highly selective accumulation of PpIX in malignant tissues.\n\nThis Phase 3, 2-part, single-blind \\[pathologist(s)-blinded\\] randomized placebo-controlled trial study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD G 506 A to aid in the visualization of carcinoma during BCS. The Eagle V1.2 Imaging System will be used in this trial to visualize PpIX fluorescence.\n\nPart A is an open-label training phase of the study to optimize workflow and Part B of the study is randomized and single-blind and will serve as the pivotal portion of the study."
