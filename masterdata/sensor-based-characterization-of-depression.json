The study aims to develop an objective, sensor-based, algorithm able to detect the presence of depression as well as predict treatment response. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this longitudinal study 100 individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be monitored for 12 weeks. Data will include self-report surveys, in-person assessments, physiological features derived by wearable devices and socialization and activity data derived by mobile applications. The study will utilize advanced statistical methods to integrate different sources of passive sensor-based behavioral and physiological data to develop models able to detect depression and predict treatment response."
