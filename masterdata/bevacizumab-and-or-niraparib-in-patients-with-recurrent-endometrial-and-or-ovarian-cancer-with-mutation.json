If patients are in the second group, they will receive niraparib once daily taken by mouth and infusion of bevacizumab once every 3 weeks.\n\nPatients will receive the study treatment as long as there is evidence that the tumor is not growing or spreading and they are not having any unacceptable, bad side effects.\n\nPatients will be monitored during treatment with tests and exams and after treatment completion for up to 3 years."

Prior malignancy with no expected impact on overall survival are allowed.\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia history or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.\n* Patients receiving radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study treatment.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of starting study treatment.\n* Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT).\n* Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including niraparib.\n* Clinically significant (e.g. active) cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure defined as values \u2265160/100 or symptomatic, refer to CTCAE.\n* Previous Cerebro-Vascular Accident (CVA), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Sub- Arachnoids Hemorrhage (SAH) within 6 months prior to study treatment.\n* Patients with increased risk of bleeding or history or evidence of hemorrhagic disorders within 6 months prior to study treatment.\n* Resting ECG with QTc \\> 470 msec on 2 or more time points within a 24-hour period or family history of long QT syndrome\n* Persistent toxicities (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) \\> grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia.\n* Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days.\n* Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n* Pregnant or lactating woman.\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the chemotherapy course within 30 days prior to study treatment.\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication.\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to investigational drugs or excipients.\n* Clinical/radiological evidence of bowel obstruction (e.g. hospitalization) or symptoms of sub-acute bowel obstruction within 6 weeks prior to trial entry.",
