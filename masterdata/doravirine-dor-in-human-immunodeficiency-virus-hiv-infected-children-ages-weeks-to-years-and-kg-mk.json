The first primary objective is to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of doravirine (DOR) \\[MK-1439\\] when given in combination with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or as part of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of DOR/lamivudine (3TC)/tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF) in participants \u22656 to \\<12 years and weighing \u226514 to \\<45 kg. The second primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DOR when given with 2 NRTIs or as part of the FDC of DOR/3TC/TDF, in participants \u22656 to 12 years and weighing \u226514 to \\<45 kg, through Week 24.",
