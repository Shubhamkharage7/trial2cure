Mindfulness-based interventions focus on building awareness of thoughts, emotions/feelings, and the sensations. This study may help improve mental well-being and reduce stress and anxiety associated with having cancer or with a family member's cancer diagnosis.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Systematically and culturally adapt a mindfulness-based intervention to improve psychological wellbeing in Latino patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers.\n\nII. Evaluate the feasibility of the adapted mindfulness-based intervention and overall study procedures in Latino patient-family caregiver dyads.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the effects of the adapted mindfulness-based intervention on the secondary outcomes of patient and caregiver psychological distress, quality of life (QOL), and patient cancer symptoms, compared to a waitlist control.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients and their partners are randomized to 1 of 32 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients and their partners participate in mindfulness program together over 60 minutes consisting of meeting with a mindfulness coach to build awareness of thoughts, emotions, feelings, and sensations 1 time per week (QW) for 4 weeks.\n\nGROUP II: Patients and their partners participate in mindfulness program separately over 60 minutes consisting of meeting with a mindfulness coach to build awareness of thoughts, emotions, feelings, and sensations 1 time per week (QW) for 4 weeks.\n\nGROUP III: Patients and their partners participate in mindfulness program either separately or together, depending on participants' preferences, as in Group I beginning 12 weeks after starting the study and completing the third study visit."
