            "briefSummary": "Minoritized populations face mutually reinforcing levels of structural disadvantage that contribute to poor health. Despite recognition that social and economic stratification, environmental conditions, and policy are critical determinants of health disparities, there has been limited effort in expanding interventions beyond the individual level to disrupt systemic causes of health. This is in part due to the challenges of describing how racism and discrimination have become systematized over time and across place.68 Studies that do examine SRD and health and well-being, focus on one level of SRD at a time, rather than examining multiple levels simultaneously. Also, the measurement of SRD at all levels has not been very detailed and more research is needed on the nuances of these experiences (e.g., frequency, timeframe, intensity). Finally, there is a need for more prospective longitudinal studies, as most research to date has been cross-sectional. In addition to comprehensively examining the four SRD levels, the current study will examine these multi- level predictors of SRD simultaneously, longitudinally, and across two sites to identify targets for multi-level interventions that will be more likely to be effective and sustainable."
