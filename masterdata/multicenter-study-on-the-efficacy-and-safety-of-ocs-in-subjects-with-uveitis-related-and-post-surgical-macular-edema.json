            "briefSummary": "The goal of the LEOPARD clinical trial is to investigate a new kind of steroid eye drops, OCS-01.\n\nMacular edema is a condition in which there is collection of fluid (edema) in the back of the eye (Macula) and it can lead to severe loss of vision. Among other causes, macular edema can happen because of a disease of the eye called Uveitis, and also after eye surgery. Treatment of macular edema remains a challenge as the condition may persist for several months and may lead to irreversible changes in the eye and poor vision.\n\nIn the LEOPARD study the investigators wish to see how safe is the study drug (OCS-01) and how well it works, in resolving the fluid collection in the eye in patients with Uveitis or in patients who have had eye surgery.\n\nParticipants will undergo detailed eye exam, and record their eye and medical history to see what their disease status is and if they can be included in the study based on the study criteria. If included, they will take the study drug OCS-01 in different doses for 24 weeks. During the study period, they will have regular eye exams to ensure their safety and to assess the usefulness of the study drug.",
            "detailedDescription": "LEOPARD is a prospective, multi-center, single masked, randomized, controlled, study. At least 24 eligible subjects (12 with Uveitic macular edema and 12 with Post surgical macular edema) are to be enrolled in the study. There will be 5 sites and the total treatment period is 24 weeks.\n\nThe study will consist of 4 phases: Screening Phase, Loading Phase, Treatment Phase and Follow-up Phase. Subjects will receive their assigned treatments until week 04, get randomized into groups and continue their assigned treatments until week 12. Primary endpoint assessments will be performed at week 12.\n\nFrom week 12 to week 24, if there is still edema as demonstrated on OCT, subjects will receive treatment based on the retreatment criteria."

Can provide written informed consent prior to any study procedure being performed, able and willing to follow all instructions, and attend all study visits.\n4. UME of less than 1 years in duration or PSME of less than 1 year, with presence of intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid in the study eye, with CST of \u2265 320 \u00b5m by SD-OCT at baseline (as measured by the central reading center employing Heidelberg Spectralis spectral domain optical coherence tomography, SD-OCT). Note: Recurrent CME is also eligible if the current episode is of less than 1 year.\n5. An ETDRS BCVA letter score \u2264 70 (Snellen 20/40) and \u2265 35 (Snellen 20/200) in the study eye at baseline (Visit 2).\n6. A documented diagnosis of inactive/stable uveitis (for UME) at the screening visit.\n7. A trial of topical NSAID or topical corticosteroids (for PSME) for at least one consecutive month but less than 3 consecutive months before screening visit with documented treatment failure on SD-OCT or based on investigator's clinical evaluation.\n\nNote: If both eyes are eligible, the eye with the worse BCVA will be selected as the study eye. If both eyes have the same BCVA, the non-dominant eye will be selected.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be included in the study\n\n1. Macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than UME or PSME. An eye is not considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered to be related to diabetes (2) clinical exam and/or OCT suggests that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema, or (3) the macular edema is considered to be related to another condition such as age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, or drug toxicity.\n2. A decrease in BCVA due to causes other than UME or PSME (e.g., foveal atrophy, pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, previous vitreoretinal surgery, central serous retinopathy, non-retinal condition, substantial cataract, macular ischemia) that are likely to decrease BCVA by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).\n3. Use of other ophthalmic formulations during the study. However, intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering eye drops are allowed if they become necessary due to increased IOP.\n4. History of glaucoma and documented glaucomatous optic neuropathy or clinically significant ocular hypertension in the opinion of the investigator, involving an IOP \u2265 25 mmHg on \\> 3 anti-glaucoma medications in the study eye.\n5. Any other ocular disease that could cause substantial reduction in BCVA, including retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, vitreous hemorrhage or fibrosis involving the macula in the study eye, other retinal inflammatory or infectious diseases.\n6. Active peri-ocular or ocular infection (e.g., blepharitis, keratitis, scleritis, or conjunctivitis).\n7. History of infectious uveitis.\n8. High myopia (-8 diopter or more correction) in the study eye.\n9. Any form of diabetic retinopathy.\n10. History of increased intraocular pressure with topical steroid therapy.\n11. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding\n\nFor UME:\n\n1. Active uveitis as determined by the presence of anterior chamber cells or vitreous cells.\n2. Unstable (increasing) dose of immunosuppressives during 2 months prior to the baseline visit. Immunosuppressives are defined as antimetabolites (methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, among others) and biologics (including adalimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, golimumab, secukinumab and rituximab, and others).\n3. Treated with more than 2 types of immunosuppressives (excluding steroids) within 2 months prior to baseline visit.\n4. Unstable (increasing) dose of oral prednisone for 1 month before baseline visit.\n5. Oral prednisone therapy at dose \\> 10 mg daily (or equivalent) within 1 month prior to baseline visit.\n6. History of contact lens use within 2 weeks prior to baseline or at any time during the study.",
