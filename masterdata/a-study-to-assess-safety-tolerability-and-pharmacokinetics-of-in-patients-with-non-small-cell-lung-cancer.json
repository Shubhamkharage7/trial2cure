Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Or any surgical wound is infected, dehisced, or not completely healed before the screening.\n8.

Have current spinal cord compression (symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected by radiographic imaging) or leptomeningeal disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic).\n11. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease.\n12. Known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness, or positive test for HIV 1/2 antibody.\n13. Exclusion of hepatitis infection based on the following results and/or criteria:\n\n    1. Active hepatitis B infection: positive tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). A patient with positive tests for HbsAg or anti-HBc but with HBV-DNA measurements lower than detectable can be enrolled.\n    2. Active hepatitis C infection: positive Hepatitis C virus antibody. If positive antibody to hepatitis C Virus (anti-HCV) is detected, Hepatitis C virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is necessary. A patient with positive anti-HCV but with a negative test for HCV RNA can be enrolled.\n14. Patients with ascites or pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion which is refractory/uncontrolled, or requiring the intervention within 2 weeks prior to the first dose.\n15. Current evidence of radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment or unresolved drug-related pneumonitis, or current evidence or history of interstitial lung disease (ILD).\n16. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test within 7 days prior to the start of study drug.\n17. Vaccination with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment except for administration of inactivate vaccines (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines, inactivated influenza vaccines).\n18. Current evidence or previous history of corneal pathology such as keratopathy, corneal abrasion or ulceration, or any other abnormal changes that may increase the risk of corneal toxicity during the study treatment\n19. Any other clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active infection, or any other condition, which in the judgment of investigators, could compromise compliance with the protocol, interfere with the interpretation of study results, or predispose the patient to safety risks.\n20.
