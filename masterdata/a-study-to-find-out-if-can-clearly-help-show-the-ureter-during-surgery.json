            "briefSummary": "The ureter is the tube that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder. It is difficult for surgeons to see the ureter during abdominal surgery. This could lead to injuring the ureter which, although rare, could be serious.\n\nThis study is about a potential new medical dye, called ASP5354. This dye is injected into the person at the start of surgery and is detected in the ureter. This is done by an imaging machine which has an option called near infrared fluorescence, or NIR-F. Together they show live images of specific parts of the body. In this study, ASP5354 is used with an imaging machine with a NIR-F option to show live images of the ureter during surgery.\n\nPeople with kidneys that work properly and those with kidney problems can take part. The main aim of the study is to find out how clearly the ureter can be seen with ASP5354 during surgery in adults whose kidneys work properly or who have mild kidney problems. To do this, the surgeons will inject ASP5354 into the person having surgery. Then, the surgeons will compare images of the ureter with an imaging machine using normal white light and with the NIR-F option. Imaging using normal white light is the standard way surgeons see the ureter during surgery.\n\nPeople 12 years or older who were going to have certain abdominal surgeries may be able to take part.\n\nEveryone taking part will receive ASP5354 during surgery, but how the imaging is done will depend on which group they are in. Before surgery, the adults taking part whose kidneys work properly or who have mild kidney problems will be assigned into 1 of 2 groups by chance alone. Images of the ureter will be checked in 1 group using normal white light and the other group using normal white light and NIR-F. People 18 years and older with more severe kidney problems and all people under 18 years old will not be assigned to 1 of 2 groups: all images of the ureter will be checked using normal white light and NIR-F.\n\nAt the start of surgery, the surgeon will inject ASP5354 into the person having surgery, then will start recording a video. Then, after 30 minutes, the surgeon will record how well the ureter can be seen. This will be done by either using normal white light, or normal white light and NIR-F, depending which group each person having surgery is assigned to. For the group to be checked with normal white light and NIR-F, the surgeon will do this every 30 minutes until the end of surgery. For the group to be checked with normal white light only, the surgeon will only do this after the first 30 minutes.\n\nDuring the study, people will visit the study hospital 3 times. The first visit is to check if they can take part in the study. People will be asked about their medical history, have a medical examination, and their vital signs checked (blood pressure and pulse rate). Also, they will have some blood and urine tests. For women and girls this may include a pregnancy test. People will have their surgery at the second visit. This will be within 28 days of their first visit. This includes having some blood and urine tests before, during, and after surgery. Also, they will have a medical examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check their heart rhythm, and have their vital signs checked. After surgery, people will return to the clinic 15 days later for a final check-up. They will be asked if they have had any medical problems. Also, they will have a medical examination, have their vital signs checked, and have some blood and urine tests."
