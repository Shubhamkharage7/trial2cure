(PBI) Clinical Study. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n-What were the frequency, severity, duration, and outcome of clinically significant Clinical Events of Interest (CEI)?\n\nParticipants will visit a study center 3 times during the first year, and once per year after that for a physical exam and other assessments to check for CEI.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) observational study designed primarily to collect data regarding CEI for up to 15 years following participation in a PBI clinical study involving PBCAR product dosing. This study protocol does not include administration of a PBCAR product; however, subjects may receive investigational products other than a PBCAR product through participation in other clinical studies during the period of this observational study."
