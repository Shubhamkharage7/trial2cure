Participants return the next day for a brief breathing test, a blood draw and a procedure called bronchoscopy to evaluate the lung after the challenge.\n\nParticipants then return 18 - 20 days later to repeat the two-day series of testing to be challenged with the exposure not received on the first series, (FA or O3). Each visit will take about 3 - 3.5 hours. Follow-up phone calls from the study team will occur at 24 hours after each 2-day test series.\n\nTotal study duration is about one to one-and a half months."
