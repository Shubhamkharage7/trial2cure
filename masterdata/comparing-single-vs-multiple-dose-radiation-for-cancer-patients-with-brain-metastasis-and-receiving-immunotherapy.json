This study will compare the usual care treatment of single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) given on one day versus fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS), which is a lower dose of radiation given over a few days to determine if FSRS is better or worse at reducing side effects than usual care treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is an open-label, randomized, Phase III trial designed to ascertain whether fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) results in lower incidence of Grade 2 or higher adverse radiation effect (ARE) by 9 months compared to single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) in patients with large brain metastases who have received or will receive immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeted to the PD-1/PD-L1 axis within 30 days of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either SSRS or FSRS, using a minimization randomization strategy considering 5 prognostic factors of interest: radiosurgery platform (gamma knife vs. LINAC), timing of immunotherapy relative to radiation (ICI within 30 days prior to Day 1 of SRS or not), surgical status (any resection cavity vs intact metastases only), predominant tumor type (Melanoma vs. all others), and prior courses of SRS for brain metastases (yes vs. no)."

Prior SRS data upload is NOT required prior to enrollment and randomization. Both SSRS and FSRS are acceptable.\n  * Lesion volume will be approximated by measuring the lesion's three perpendicular diameters on contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted MRI and the product of those diameters will be divided by 2 to estimate the lesion volume (e.g., xyz/2). Alternatively, direct volumetric measurements via slice-by-slice contouring on a treatment planning software package can be used to calculate the total tumor volume.\n  * Any extent of non-CNS disease is allowed. There is no requirement for non-CNS disease to be controlled prior to study entry.\n  * For patients considered to be borderline or potentially eligible by size or volume criteria, sites have the option to send in DICOM films for central review screening.\n* Age \u2265 18 years at the time of enrollment.\n* Total number of brain metastases (including resection cavities) \u2264 15 on diagnostic MRI; all lesions must be amenable to SSRS and FSRS as determined by the treating radiation oncologist. Treatment must take place at a facility credentialed by the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) for SRS and that offers both SSRS and FSRS as treatment options.\n* Total gross tumor volume must be \u2264 30 cc. Lesion volume will be approximated by measuring each lesion's three perpendicular diameters on contrast-enhanced T1 MRI and the product of those diameters will be divided by 2 (V = xyz/2). Direct volumetric measurements by contouring all lesions on all visible slices on treatment planning software is also acceptable. If there is a cavity, only gross residual disease within or adjacent to the cavity is counted toward the 30 cc total volume.\n* Ability to tolerate MRI brain with gadolinium-based contrast.\n* Pathologically confirmed melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or breast cancer.\n* Has received, is currently receiving, or is planned to receive immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (defined as agent targeted to PD-1/PD-L1 axis) within 30 days of the planned first day of SSRS/FSRS. Dual ICI therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 targeted agents are allowed, but patients treated with a single agent CTLA-4 targeted agent only are ineligible.\n\n  o It is not mandatory to wait for the results of next generation sequencing (NGS) or other molecular tumor testing to determine if the patient is planned to receive ICI if the enrolling physician feels that identification of a mutation that would preclude ICI therapy (such as an EGFR mutation in a patient with NSCLC) is unlikely to be identified.\n* Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) \u2265 50. Refer to Appendix A.\n* Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days of randomization for women of child-bearing potential.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign written informed consent.\n* Patients must be able to provide informed consent.\n* Must be able to speak, read and understand English or Spanish\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior fractionated, whole, or partial brain radiation therapy. Prior fractionated SRS is acceptable.\n* Prior courses of SRS for benign tumors such as meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, schwannomas may be acceptable if the treatment is \\> 2cm away from the site of a metastatic lesion that would be treated on this study. The study PI or a designated co-PI must review this type of case to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment.\n* Prior diagnosis ARE, including pseudoprogression or radiation necrosis/radionecrosis, or previously treated lesions being actively evaluated for possible ARE or local failure such as concerning imaging findings currently being tracked with short interval MRI.\n* Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis established by lumbar puncture cytology, or MRI imaging. In the absence of a clinical indication, a lumbar puncture is not required to confirm eligibility.\n* A brain metastasis that is 5 mm or less from the optic chiasm or optic nerves\n* Inability to tolerate brain MRI or receive gadolinium-based contrast\n* Planned or prior therapy with bevacizumab (or bevacizumab biosimilar) within 30 days of the planned first day of SRS as part of a systemic therapy regimen at study enrollment.\n* Serious intercurrent illness or medical condition judged by the local investigator to compromise the patient's safety, preclude safe administration of the planned protocol treatment, or would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol guidelines.",

As of July 2018, the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de-identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN/NCORP data archive within 6 months of primary and non-primary publications of phase II/III and phase III trials to https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/. This will become the primary means for sharing raw data, and we will adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN/NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide. De-identified data from studies not covered by the agreement (e.g., phase II and observational studies) will be made available upon request. All data files will be de-identified.\n\nDe-identification procedures will meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 45, Section 164.514.",
