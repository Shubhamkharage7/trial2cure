            "detailedDescription": "Adult Patients ages 18 and older with a diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease will be given a Diet Plan that consist of an increase of Fruits and Vegetables. Baseline data will be collected after the subject has signed the consent and their most recent eGFR and potassium level that is within 90 days has been reviewed to determine they are within the inclusion criteria.\n\nBased on the approved Patiromer (Veltassa) package insert the subject will begin to take daily. During this control period of two weeks, the subject will document their normal daily consumption of fruits and vegetables in a provided food diary.\n\nOn the Second week, patient will receive dietary/nutritional counseling on the importance of potassium-rich fruits and vegetables. They will be instructed to increase their fruit and vegetable intake based on personal preferences and nutritional guides located inside the food diary. Choices will be documented daily in the supplied food diaries.\n\nThe Bowel Diary will be classified according to the Bristol Stool Chart and Quality of Life. Nutrition Survey Questionnaire will be documented in that supplied log.\n\nAt each subsequent visit, food diaries will be reviewed to evaluate fruit and vegetable consumption, vital signs will be documented and labs collected to measure effects on potassium metabolism. Bowel habits and questionnaires will be completed by the subject to determine how their diet has affected their quality of life.\n\nPatiromer (Veltessa) dosing will be adjusted based on their serum potassium values following the approved drug brochure guidelines and at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nSubject will return to the clinic at specified time points up to 52 weeks on study. The Patient can continue Veltassa while in the follow up period until week 52 at the discretion of the Principle Investigator."
