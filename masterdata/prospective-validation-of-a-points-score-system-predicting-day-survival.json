            "detailedDescription": "This is a one-stage single-arm phase II clinical trial designed to prospectively test the survival prediction tool as developed by Lee et al (section 10.0) on patients referred to radiation oncology for palliative treatments. Survival prediction score based on objective data including laboratory values, visits to emergency room, and primary cancer origin will be assigned to each patient at time of enrollment. The prediction tool assigns a score from 0-20, with 20 indicating the worst survival prognosis; the investigators have designated mortality risk groups as follows: low-risk (score 0-6), intermediate-risk (score 7-13), and high-risk (score 14-20). Patient survival and quality of life will then be monitored at 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day intervals. The study will test the hypothesis that patients with a score of \\>14 have a less than 20% chance of survival at 30 days.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n1. To evaluate 30-day survival of patients with a score of \\>14 (high-risk group)\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day survival of patients in low-risk (score 0-6), and intermediate-risk (score 7-13) groups, and to evaluate 90-day and 365-day survival of patients in high-risk group (score \\>14)\n2. To evaluate patient-reported quality of life at the above intervals using the validated FACIT-Pal-14\u00a9 questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative Care 14 Item Version)"
