Analysis will be attained via potassium hydroxide examination (KOH test), nail culture, PCR analysis, and photographic imaging. Subjects may have both hallux nails sampled at screening for culture and KOH testing if both hallux nails appear to meet the criteria for study inclusion. Only subjects with both a positive culture and KOH examination will start study treatment. Subjects may have repeat KOH and culture testing both performed if the first screening test results in at least one of the tests being negative. At investigator's discretion, other affected toenails besides the study target hallux nail may be treated but will not be included for analysis. Patients will come for in-clinic visits at screening, baseline/randomization visit/week 0, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 24, week 36, week 48, and week 52.\n\nIf subjects achieve complete cure (as defined by mycological cure and 0% nail involvement) prior to Week 48, patients will be encouraged to continue in the trial with active treatment for the full protocol."
