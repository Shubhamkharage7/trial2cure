Participants who experience at least moderate symptoms of depression will be invited to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two audio-based digital interventions. The experimental intervention based on behavioral activation treatment for depression. The control intervention is based on self-monitoring. Depression symptoms and related mental health symptoms, as well as experiences with the intervention, will be assessed at baseline (pre-randomization), mid-intervention (1 week post-randomization), post-intervention (2 weeks post-randomization) and follow-up (5 weeks post-randomization)"

The second session recaps the principles of behavioral activation and guides participants through methods of troubleshooting. After each session, participants are asked to create an activity schedule for the coming week. Then, each day in the week following each session, participants receive an email with a survey asking them to report on their activity and mood in the previous day.",
