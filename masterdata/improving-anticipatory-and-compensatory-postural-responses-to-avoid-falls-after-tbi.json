            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess a balance training program to see if it can be helpful to avoid falls in people who have had traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).\n\nThe study will include 3 groups: TBI Intervention group , TBI Control Group, and healthy control group.\n\nTBI Intervention group - These individuals will participate in 16 anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) and compensatory postural adjustments (CPA) training sessions using the Neurocom Balance Platform. Each session will last for 1 hour. During the APA portion, participants will be provided with a visual cue on the front screen in the form of a countdown timer showing the remaining seconds to the onset of the upcoming perturbation. This information will allow an opportunity for the participant to adjust their posture to handle the upcoming perturbation in the best possible way and also train them to anticipate upcoming disturbances and execute corrective motor outputs. In CPA, after a 5 second pause, the platform will oscillate at 1 Hz, with a constant amplitude, in the anterior-posterior direction for 50 seconds, followed by an additional 5 second quiet period. The participant will wear a safety harness at all times and a spotter will be present at all times.\n\nTBI Control Group- They do not receive any intervention. healthy control group- They do not receive any intervention.\n\nAll three groups will participate in two data collection sessions: Baseline and follow-up.\n\nAt baseline and follow-up, we will collect functional, clinical, biomechanical, and physiological metrics.\n\nDuring training and data collection, a spotter will be present at all times to prevent falls and participants will be allowed as much rest as needed by them.."
