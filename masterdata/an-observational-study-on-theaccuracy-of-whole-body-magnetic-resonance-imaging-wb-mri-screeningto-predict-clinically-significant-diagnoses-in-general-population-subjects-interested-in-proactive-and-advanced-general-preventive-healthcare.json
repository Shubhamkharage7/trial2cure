Study subjects must meet a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential subjects arriving at the study sites will be evaluated for enrollment. It is the Principal Investigator's (PI) responsibility to enroll only subjects who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Recruitment can occur by subject presentation at the sites for elective standard screening, word-of-mouth, flyers, healthcare professional (HCP) referrals, advertisement online, or any other means, subject to approval by the associated institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) when applicable."
