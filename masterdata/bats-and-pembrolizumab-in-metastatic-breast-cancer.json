            "briefSummary": "This proposal uses HER2Bi armed activated T-cells (HER2 BATs) to target breast cancer in combination with pembrolizumab (PBZ) in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Phase I will determine a safe dose of the combination of PBZ and HER2 BATs in 3 to 18 patients. In the phase II portion, an additional 12 patients will be treated at the selected dose to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy.\n\nStudy treatment includes a combination of 8 infusions of BATs using a previously established schedule and one to three infusions of PBZ (200 mg per dose). PBZ will be added to 8 infusions of BATs in 3 schedules: #1) after the 8th BATs infusion; #2) after the 4th and 8th BATs infusions; and then, #3) before the 1st and after the 4th and 8th BATs infusions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Once subjects are determined eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via leukapheresis procedure. Depending on arm/schedule, about 4-5 weeks later, study treatment will begin. For HER2 BATs, the white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins - OKT3 and IL-2 -- which activates the cells to multiply. After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with OKT3 and trastuzumab/Herceptin (HER2Bi), and washed to remove excess Herceptin in order to produce bispecific antibody armed T cells (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.\n\nFollow-up appointment schedule will include clinic visits 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the last dose of Pembrolizumab."

Lack of recovery (i.e., \u2264 Grade 1 or baseline prior to last line of cancer therapy) from non-laboratory adverse events except \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy\n5. Has history of another malignancy within the past 5 years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n6. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to leukapheresis. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n7. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n8. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n9. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n12. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.\n13. Has Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) or known history of Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C antibody is detected. Note: Patients may be eligible if HCV antibody is detected as long as HCV viral load is undetectable following an FDA approved treatment regimen\n14. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of apheresis. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n15. Has a history of significant cardiac disease, including:\n\n    * History of a recent myocardial infarction (within one year), a past myocardial infarction (more than one year ago) along with current coronary symptoms requiring medications and/or evidence of depressed left ventricular function (LVEF \\< 45% by MUGA or ECHO).\n    * Current history of angina/coronary symptoms requiring medications and/or evidence of depressed left ventricular function (LVEF \\< 45% by MUGA or ECHO)\n    * Clinical evidence of congestive heart failure requiring medical management (irrespective of ECHO results).\n16.
