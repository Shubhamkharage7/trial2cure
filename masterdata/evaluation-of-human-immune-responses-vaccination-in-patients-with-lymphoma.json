Evaluating immune response may increase the understanding of how the immune system changes when patients receive treatment for lymphomas by looking at the antibody levels and the level of the different cells that make up the immune system over time compared to those without lymphoma.",

To determine the seroprotection and seroconversion rates after influenza or SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize virus-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after vaccination in patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.\n\nII. To investigate the longevity of viral-specific humoral immunity to influenza virus in patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.\n\nIII. To assess the timing and strength of the peak immune response to vaccination.\n\nIV. To assess the effect of different lymphomas and treatment modalities in the immune response to vaccination.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at day 0.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 28, 90, 180, and 365."
