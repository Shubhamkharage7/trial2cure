Primary outcome measures include aerobic, anaerobic, and HIFT measures. Secondary measures include sleep, affect, and mood state questionnaires. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: with the RMT device and without the RMT device.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study assesses the impact of a ventilatory training device, similar to a sports mouth guard worn during exercise, on various performance outcomes. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the device improve fitness parameters: high-intensity functional training, anaerobic capacity, anaerobic peak and mean power output, maximal oxygen uptake, ventilatory threshold, and blood lactate responses to training?\n* Does the device improve spirometry measures?\n\nResearchers will compare 6 weeks of training with the ventilatory training device to those without the training device.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Take part in a total of 8 weeks of study-related activity.\n* Complete six total one- to two-hour pre- and post-testing sessions, which include a maximal oxygen uptake test, high-intensity functional training, body composition, spirometry, anaerobic power and capacity testing.\n* Complete six weeks of 45-minute high-intensity functional training, three days per week."
