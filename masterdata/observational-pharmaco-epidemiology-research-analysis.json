Real-world evaluations of treatments of chronic diseases in the context of comorbid conditions and special populations (minorities, women, mentally ill, and those with addiction) are limited. The purpose of the OPERA database is to help address this unmet need in clinical research.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objectives of OPERA\n\n1. To research numerous chronic diseases (HIV, HCV, HBV currently and IBD and RA in the near future, with others as identified for further consideration) utilizing the OPERA\u00ae longitudinal database that consists of de-identified EHR data from numerous clinical practices in a variety of settings (e.g. solo practitioners, small groups, and hospitals). Research will be ongoing and yield numerous individual analyses and reports that are authored by epidemiologists, practicing physicians, pharmaco-economists, and other researchers and will target scientific conferences and peer-reviewed medical journals for dissemination.\n2. To use epidemiological, statistical, and data analysis methods and related research findings to deliver a sophisticated healthcare analytics reporting solution (CHORUS\u2122) to clinicians.\u2020\n3. To enhance patient population management as well as disease management capabilities of the practicing physician.\n4. To provide anonymous, nation-wide benchmarking of quality measures and key performance indicators (KPI) for medical clinics.\n5. To enhance patient engagement with their physicians to deliver better health outcomes.\n6. To evaluate whether engagement in care by patients with their physicians results in better outcomes for patients with chronic illness."
