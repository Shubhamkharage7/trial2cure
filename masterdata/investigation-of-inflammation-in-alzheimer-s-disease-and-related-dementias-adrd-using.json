Investigators will complete imaging of the brain and neck in older adults with normal cognition and those with clinically diagnosed cognitive impairment from ADRD to characterize \\[11C\\]-CS1P1 uptake in the brain. Investigators will compare the normal cognition participants to patients with ADRD to collect preliminary data that will subsequently test the hypothesis that \\[11C\\]-CS1P1 uptake is elevated in patients with ADRD."
