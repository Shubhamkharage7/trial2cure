Participants will be randomized to standard care (usual diabetes care) or the intervention arm in which the participants will receive additional support from a Diabetes Navigator. Participants in the intervention group will receive assistance from a Diabetes Navigator who will help the participants address challenges in acquiring and optimally using advanced diabetes technology. The investigators will compare the group receiving Diabetes Navigator support with the standard care group to see if the additional support improves progression (increases uptake and/or optimization) in use of advanced diabetes technology and, consequently, improves glycemic control among patients."
