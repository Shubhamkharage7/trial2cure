            "briefSummary": "This is to study if neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy is beneficial for patients with recurrent glioblastoma and a low mutational burden.",
            "detailedDescription": "Recurrent glioblastoma represents one of the highest unmet medical needs in oncology. Overall prognosis remains poor for patients on standard of care therapies, with a 2-year survival rate of \\< 20%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to meet this unmet medical need, however such therapies have yet to be fully explored in clinical trials powered for efficacy nor in the neoadjuvant setting. The interplay between the immune system and glioblastoma is complex and shaped by a variety of factors. Certain molecular factors that suggest a promising response to immunotherapies, in non-CNS tumors, paradoxically indicate a worse response in glioblastoma. Atezolizumab has shown several properties that make it an ideal candidate for further investigation in rGBM. Interestingly, a low tumor mutational burden has been implicated in T cell inflammation and immunotherapy outcome in rGBM patients treated with atezolizumab.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will determine whether neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy provides a therapeutic benefit for patients with recurrent glioblastoma and a low mutational burden. Biological assessments of specimens collected in this trial will test the relationship between low TMB and features associated with immune-editing in rGBM. The investigators hypothesize that a low tumor mutational burden identifies immunologically engaged rGBM tumors and correlates with features previously linked to ICI response. By extensively studying the molecular factors influencing the response to immunotherapy, our goal is to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies in patients with glioblastoma."

Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n\n   ii) A woman is of childbearing potential if she is post-menarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\u2265 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., M\u00fcllerian agenesis). Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is of childbearing potential. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n\n   b) For men with pregnant female partners and/or with female partners of childbearing potential: Agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom and refrain from donating sperm.\n\n   i) With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period for 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.
