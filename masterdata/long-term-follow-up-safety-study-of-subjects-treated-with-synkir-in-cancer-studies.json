            "detailedDescription": "This study has been designed in adherence with the following Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance documents for Industry: the January 2020 Long-Term Follow-Up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products; the January 2020 Testing of Retroviral Vector-Based Human Gene Therapy Products for Replication Competent Retrovirus During Product Manufacture and Patient Follow-up; and the March 2022 Considerations for the Development of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Products. The study serves to collect data on delayed adverse events for up to fifteen (15) years following a single infusion of SynKIR-110 administered to advance cancer patients with mesothelin expressing tumors.\n\nFor subjects who have not progressed and have rolled onto this LTFU study at 12 months, data on long-term clinical activity will be collected from the subject's standard of care treatment/medical records.\n\nSafety monitoring for delayed adverse events related to SynKIR-110 will include physical examinations, laboratory assessments including complete blood counts, complete metabolic profile, RCL testing and testing for persistence of lentiviral mediated T cells.\n\nTesting for persistence of vector sequences by PCR in subjects' blood (and possibly other surrogate tissue) samples will be done at intervals no greater than 6 months for the first five years and then no greater than annually for the next 10 years, or until such time that no vector sequences are detectable in the subjects' sample.\n\nSubject samples will be collected for RCL (qPCR for VSV-G) assessment at 3, 6, and 12 months after SynKIR-110 infusion and yearly for up to fifteen (15) years. If all RCL tests within the first year are negative for an individual patient, collection of the yearly follow-up samples may be discontinued for that individual."
