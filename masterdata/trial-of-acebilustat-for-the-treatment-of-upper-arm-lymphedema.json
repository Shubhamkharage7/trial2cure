Participants will receive \"study drug\" (Acebilustat or placebo), for 9 months. For 3 of these months, the participant will receive placebo; for 6 of these months, the participant will receive active ingredient, acebilustat. The study is blinded which means that the participant will not be told which study pill they are taking.",

If eligible, and if they choose to continue, Visit 2, treatment start, will take place 2-7 days later. Study visits are every (approximately) 90 days. Physical exam, including limb measurements and skin measurements (with tape measure and dermal ultrasound) are performed. Phlebotomy for research samples and clinical labs will be performed at study start and end of study."
