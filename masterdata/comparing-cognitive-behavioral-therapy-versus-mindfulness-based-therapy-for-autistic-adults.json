            "briefSummary": "Autistic adults are at a greater risk for mental health problems compared to the general population, with 50% meeting criteria for a co-occurring psychiatric condition. Depression and anxiety are the most common of these conditions among autistic adults, contributing to long-term detrimental effects on health, day-to-day functioning, and quality of life. This study will conduct the first large-scale head-to-head comparison of the two most widely studied mental health interventions for autistic adults: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapy (MBT). Both interventions are well-established, empirically supported treatments for depression and anxiety in the general population, and both interventions have demonstrated efficacy among autistic adults. However, their comparative effectiveness and heterogeneity of treatment effects have not been established in autistic adults. Both interventions will be delivered by telehealth.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study includes three aims:\n\nAim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of two different mental health interventions, CBT versus MBT, to improve patient-centered mental health outcomes, quality of life, well-being, and functional impairment among autistic adults with co-occurring anxiety and/or depressive disorders.\n\nAim 2. Explore patient characteristics (e.g., expressive language ability, intellectual ability, alexithymia, sensory sensitivity) that may moderate the relationship between CBT or MBT and patient outcomes.\n\nAim 3. Compare implementation outcomes of acceptability and feasibility of CBT relative to MBT as reported by patients and clinicians using mixed methods."
