            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nPatients in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Patients must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called SGN-CEACAM5C. SGN-CEACAM5C is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of SGN-CEACAM5C in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study will have 3 parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much SGN-CEACAM5C should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if SGN-CEACAM5C is safe and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers."

For Part B (dose optimization) and Part C (dose expansion):\n\n     * Participants must have histologically- or cytologically-confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumor malignancy.\n     * The tumor types to be enrolled in dose optimization will be identified by the sponsor from among those specified in dose escalation.\n     * CRC\n\n       * Prior therapy: Participants must have received prior treatment (in 1 or more lines of therapy) containing fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.\n     * PDAC\n\n       * Prior therapy: Participants must have received 1 prior line of therapy and received no more than 3 prior lines of therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting.\n     * GC/GEJ\n\n       * Prior therapy: Participants must have received prior platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.\n     * NSCLC - non-squamous/squamous\n\n       * Prior therapy: Participants must have received platinum-based therapy. If eligible and consistent with local standard of care must have received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.\n     * Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)\n\n       * Prior therapy: Participants must have received platinum-based therapy for extensive-stage disease and no more than 3 prior lines of therapy\n* Participants enrolled in the following study parts should have a tumor site that is accessible for biopsy(ies) and agree to biopsy(ies) and/or submission of archival tissue\n\n  1. Dose optimization\n  2. Disease-specific expansion cohorts\n* An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1\n* Measurable disease per Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 at baseline.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous exposure to CEACAM5-targeted therapy.\n* Prior treatment with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a camptothecin payload\n* History of another malignancy within 3 years before the first dose of study intervention, or any evidence of residual disease from a previously diagnosed malignancy.\n* Active cerebral/meningeal disease related to the underlying malignancy. Participants with a history of cerebral/meningeal disease related to the underlying malignancy are allowed if prior central nervous system disease has been treated and the participant is clinically stable (defined as not having received steroid treatment for symptoms related to cerebral/meningeal disease for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment and with no ongoing related AEs).",
