            "briefSummary": "This study is a randomized Phase 2 trial to determine the feasibility of real-time electrocorticographic monitoring of spreading depolarizations (SD) to guide implementation of a tier-based protocol of intensive care therapies, aimed at SD suppression, for the management of patients who have undergone acute operative treatment of severe traumatic brain injury.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of acute TBI treatment is to minimize secondary damage that evolves over hours to days after the primary injury. Until now, however, there have been no methods for monitoring heterogeneous pathologic mechanisms to identify patients for appropriate neuroprotection therapies. Using invasive monitoring, investigators have documented that spreading depolarizations (SD), a cytotoxic dysfunction of cerebral gray matter that has been well-characterized through 60 years of research in animal models, are the dominant pathophysiologic process in peri-lesion cortex of many, but not all, severe TBI patients. Furthermore, it was found that the occurrence of SD as a secondary injury process in patients is an independent predictor of worse neurologic outcomes. Thus, monitoring of SD as a heterogeneous mechanism in TBI may allow selective use of therapy in only those patients who might benefit.\n\nHere the investigators will conduct a randomized Phase 2 feasibility trial that uses real-time SD monitoring to guide implementation of a tier-based protocol of intensive care therapies aimed at SD suppression. The study is based on the hypothesis that outcomes from severe TBI can be improved by targeting intensive care therapies to suppress the pathology of SDs as a brain marker and mechanism of secondary injury. The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of this approach to intensive care management of severe TBI in a Phase 2 trial that uses real-time SD monitoring to guide administration of prescribed therapies to suppress SD. The aims are to (1) determine the feasibility of real-time SD monitoring to guide intensive care management of severe TBI, and (2) determine the effect of SD-guided vs. standard care management to reduce secondary brain insults in severe TBI.\n\nThis is a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial enrolling approximately 72 patients at 3 sites. Patients requiring neurological surgery for emergency treatment of TBI will be enrolled. The need for surgery allows for the placement of an electrode strip on the brain during surgery for subsequent electrocorticography (ECoG). ECoG data will be monitored continuously in real-time for the occurrence of SDs during intensive care. When SDs are observed, these patients (\\~60%, or n=43) will be randomized 1:1 to either standard (control) or SD-guided care. In the standard care arm, treatment will follow local and national guidelines with blinding to further ECoG results. In the SD-guided arm, treatment will follow a tiered-based protocol with escalation and de-escalation based on efficacy to suppress further SD pathology. Treatments will include use of ketamine sedation and adjusted targets for plasma glucose, cerebral perfusion pressure, temperature, and end-tidal CO2.\n\nAs outcomes, the accuracy of real-time SD scoring and compliance with protocol tier assignment and therapy implementation will be assessed. The burden of SD pathology, other measures of cerebral physiology (intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures, and brain oxygenation), and medical complications will also be compared between the two study arms."
