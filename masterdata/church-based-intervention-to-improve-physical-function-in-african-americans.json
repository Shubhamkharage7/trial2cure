Churches in both arms (12 in each) will receive a virtual church-wide walking program which will be open to all church members, providing support for physical activity (PA) at interpersonal and community-levels. Churches will be randomized to either the church-wide walking program plus Keep it Movin' (KIM) intervention (intervention arm) or the church-wide walking program plus education (control arm). Using an active comparator will allow the assessment of whether the KIM intervention is more effective than a church-wide walking program along with improving PA individuals with PF limitations.\n\nIndividuals who meet study inclusion criteria, including limited PF and at least two chronic conditions will be recruited from churches in both arms.",
