Have other known disease-causing mutations documented in the participant's medical history or identified through a retinal dystrophy gene panel, that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with the potential therapeutic effect of the study agent or the quality of the assessments.\n2.

Have used systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 3 months prior to screening and/or intend to use during screening. Corticosteroids used on an as-needed basis administered by insufflation, inhalation or local administration to the skin and mucosa such as Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol), Flonase (fluticasone propionate), and skin creams and ointments containing corticosteroids shall not be exclusionary.\n6.

Have any active ocular/intraocular infection or inflammation (e.g., severe blepharitis, infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, endophthalmitis, idiopathic or autoimmune associated uveitis, or herpetic lesions).\n12. Have a history of corticosteroid-induced raised IOP of \\>25 mmHg following corticosteroid exposure, despite topical IOP-lowering pharmacologic therapy.\n13. Have any artificial retinal implant or prosthesis.\n14. Have absence of clear ocular media and/or inadequate pupil dilation to facilitate good quality SD-OCT images.\n15. Have any history of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.\n16. Have myopia (spherical equivalent) exceeding -10 diopters (or axial length of \\>30 mm if the Principal Investigator \\[PI\\] deems it appropriate to measure) or presence of pathologic myopia in the study eye.\n17. Have passed the Low Contrast Ora-VNC mobility course at \u22640.35 lux light level in either eye or binocularly at any screening visit.",
