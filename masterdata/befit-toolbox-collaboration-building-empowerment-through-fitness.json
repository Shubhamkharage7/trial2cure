            "briefSummary": "This project will identify the causative behavioral factors in low-income African American women leading to sedentarism, a major source of morbidity in HABD communities. Working with our partner, WUCN, we will engage with women in HABD housing to develop and (later) deliver a physical activity education program (BeFit) customized for this population.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite clear evidence of improved health outcomes with regular exercise (see Bliss et al., 2021; Kleinloog et al., 20,22 for recent reviews), national statistics suggest that a mere 48% of Americans meet the recommended levels of physical activity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\[CDC\\], 2018). Alarmingly, fewer than 30% of African American women living in public housing meet these recommended levels, marking the lowest rate among all demographic groups (Lee \\&amp; Im, 2010; Hilland et al., 2020). Cerebrovascular disease in this population is increasing in prevalence, as is early presentation underscoring the urgent need for innovative, culturally relevant strategies to promote and study the effects of physical activity engagement within this under-resourced community (Turney et al., 2022; Zuellsdorf et al., 2020). However, developing relevant research-based interventions requires understanding and adapting specific programs to local public housing challenges (Casagrande et al., 2008). Mistrust is the primary barrier to relationship development in this population, and engagement with an established community partner is critical for local implementation. This proposal aims to develop a physical activity education program for women at high risk of disease to promote healthy lifestyles and mitigate the risk of neurological pathology."
