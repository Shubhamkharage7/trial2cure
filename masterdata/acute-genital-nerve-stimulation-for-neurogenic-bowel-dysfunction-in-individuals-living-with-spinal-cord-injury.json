            "briefSummary": "Bowel issues occur in nearly all people after spinal cord injury (SCI) and one major complication is fecal incontinence (accidents). This complication has been repeatedly highlighted by people living with SCI as particularly life-limiting and in need of more options for interventions. This study will test the effect of genital nerve stimulation (GNS), with non-invasive electrodes, on the activity of the anus and rectum of persons after SCI. Recording anorectal manometry (ARM) endpoints tells us the function of those tissues and our study design (ARM without stim, ARM with stim, ARM without stim) will allow us to conclude the GNS effect and whether it is likely to reduce fecal incontinence. The study will also collect medical, demographic, and bowel related functional information. The combination of all of these data should help predict who will respond to stimulation, what will happen when stimulation is applied, and if that stimulation is likely to provide an improvement in fecal continence for people living with SCI.",
            "detailedDescription": "Time commitment: A person who participates in this study will have the option of coming in for one or two visits (for a total of about 7.5 hours). Descriptions below will separate the research activities into two visits for clarity.\n\nMinimizing barriers to participation:\n\n1. - If you live in the region (Cuyahoga, Lorain, Medina, Lake, or Geauga counties of Ohio) and need assistance with transportation to get to and from the research site for a visit, the study team will make these arrangements at no cost to you. If you live outside of the region, the study team will reimburse your transportation expenses up to a maximum of $556 per visit.\n2. - If you live a distance away from the research site for which it would be easier for you to spend the night closer for a research visit, accessible lodging is available at the Zubizarreta House. This house is right next door to the MetroHealth Rehabilitation Institute and is designed for people with spinal cord injuries. The overnight stay will be provided at no cost to you, but if you need a caregiver to stay with you that is your responsibility.\n\nVisit 1 (screening): When a person decides to participate in the study they will be scheduled to come in for a screening visit. During this visit they will: provide informed consent to participate, participate in the initial screening exams, and have genital nerve stimulation (GNS) applied briefly to determine if the nerve responds to electrical stimulation.\n\nIf a person completes the screening procedures and qualifies for the study they will be invited back to complete the manometry visit.\n\nVisit 2 (manometry):\n\n1. - Preparation: the participant will be asked to complete their typical bowel program the night before their manometry visit is scheduled. There are no restrictions on medications, eating, or drinking prior to the visit.\n2. - Instrumentation: the participant will have the study instrumentation applied.\n3. - Testing procedures with ARM and GNS: The London classification protocol will be used to assess ano-rectal function. This procedure uses a short (\\~12 minutes) procedure of actions to determine how the anus and rectum are functioning.\n\nOverall design: GNS and the London classification system will be used to assess bowel function in two different states, with stimulation and without stimulation. This will be applied in the order of no stimulation (condition A), stimulation (condition B), no stimulation (condition A repeated)."
