The objective of this trial is to investigate a patient-centered intervention, MyLungHealth, delivered through the patient portal. The intervention is designed to improve LCS rates through increased identification of eligible patients and informed decision making.",

The MyLungHealth intervention was developed using a user-centered design process, informed by patient and provider focus groups and interviews. The intervention's effectiveness will be evaluated through a patient-randomized trial, comparing the combined use of MyLungHealth and DecisionPrecision+ (a provider-focused clinical decision support and shared decision-making intervention) against DecisionPrecision+ alone."
