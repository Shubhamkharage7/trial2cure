Participation in the registry is voluntary and participants can withdraw their consent to participate at any time. Data will be collected from enrolled pregnant women and the healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in their care or the care of their infants, if applicable. The registry is strictly observational; the schedule of office visits and all treatment regimens will be determined by HCPs. Only data that are routinely documented in patients' medical records during the course of usual care will be collected. No additional laboratory tests or HCP assessments will be required as part of this registry. The design of this pregnancy registry follows current FDA guidance for designing and implementing pregnancy exposure registries."
