Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires before and after surgery. Researchers will compare using the laxative before and after surgery versus only after surgery to see if there is less discomfort with bowel movements after surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is a difference in bother related to constipation between a pre-operative versus post-operative start of a bowel regimen for patients undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse This will be a multi-institution, single-blind, randomized control trial utilizing questionnaires and chart review to evaluate effect of pre-operative bowel regimen on post-operative constipation.\n\n1. Study team and surgeons will be blinded to group assignments, participants will not be.\n2. Participants will be randomized after consent is obtained, and at least 1 week prior to planned surgery, via computer-generated blocks in a 1:1 ratio between study group (pre-operative and post-operative use) and control group (post-operative only use) of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG)"
