            "briefSummary": "Although most people recover from acute pain (such as pain caused by injury, surgery, repetitive motion, or unknown causes), many people do not fully recover and will experience chronic pain. Untreated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be a key risk factor for the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. However, few published studies have addressed the issue of preventing the transition from acute to chronic pain via PTSD reduction. This project will aim to test whether trauma-related PTSD symptoms can be reduced using either Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) treatment or Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), and whether reducing PTSD symptoms can prevent the transition from non-injury based acute pain to chronic pain.",
            "detailedDescription": "Untreated PTSD appears to be a key risk factor for the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. Thus, reducing PTSD symptoms during an acute pain episode may potentially decrease the likelihood of transitioning to chronic pain. CPT is an evidence-based trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatment that is hypothesized to reduce PTSD symptoms via reducing negative trauma-related cognitions about oneself, others, and the world. SGB treatment is an injection of a local anesthetic into the stellate ganglion, which is a bundle of nerves located at the base of the neck that is part of the sympathetic nervous system. Previous studies suggest that 1-week massed CPT and SGB treatment can both reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms in short periods of time via two distinct psychological and biological mechanisms.\n\nThis 4 year project will test study hypotheses in a sample of 345 individuals with PTSD symptoms who present to the Emergency Department (ED) with non-injury based acute pain. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1-week massed CPT, 2 SGB treatments, or usual care. All participants will complete identical self-report and/or clinician administered assessments at baseline (prior to randomization) and on study days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 56 (approximately 3 months after the initial ED presentation), and 112 (approximately 6 months after ED presentation)."
