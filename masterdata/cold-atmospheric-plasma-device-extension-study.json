While novel to the medical field, and especially to dermatology, there are already a number of publications regarding its use on human skin in adults and children. CAP devices utilize noble gases (such as helium) to deliver plasma state matter to the skin. As its name implies, the generated plasma stream is of near skin temperature and it exists on normal atmospheric pressure. During the generation of the plasma there is no electric contact with the patient. The treatment does not increase skin surface temperature and the used helium gas, the same as used for balloons, being a noble gas does not cause a chemical reaction with the skin. The flow of the gas is slow, thus there is no mechanical effect on the skin.",
