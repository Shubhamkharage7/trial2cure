            "briefSummary": "The pervasive impact of the opioid epidemic has touched all layers of society for the past two decades, resulting in over 115 deaths daily and imposing annual costs of $78.5 billion. Responding swiftly to overdoses, akin to various medical emergencies, poses a significant challenge, particularly in geographically dispersed rural areas and densely populated urban settings. Effectively delivering the life-saving drug naloxone, which counteracts the effects of overdoses, necessitates a well-coordinated and cost-efficient response system.\n\nSimply opting for widespread distribution of naloxone, even with citizen involvement, proves to be a financially burdensome approach when compared to more targeted strategies. Moreover, obstacles such as limited access, inadequate or unavailable naloxone training, and delayed response times from emergency responders compound the problem. Addressing these issues, the proposed Opioid Rapid Response System (ORRS) project seeks to advance prevention science by adopting an innovative approach that incorporates technology and contemporary communication theory.\n\nThe primary objective of the ORRS project is to mitigate opioid overdose deaths by enlisting and training citizens to administer naloxone in response to such events. Leveraging the PulsePoint health app, which connects citizens to cardiac events, the ORRS project will extend its capabilities to respond to overdose incidents. This initiative involves comprehensive development of ORRS, followed by a randomized clinical trial on a national scale to assess its effectiveness. The study aims to contribute to both prevention and implementation science by identifying optimal recruitment strategies and testing a model of online training. In pursuit of these objectives, the study is guided by the following Specific Aims:\n\nSA 1: Refine and complete the development of ORRS. SA 2: Conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. SA 3: Prepare ORRS for dissemination."

PulsePoint is an app that connects 911 requesting assistance for cardiac arrests to responders with Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) training. ORRS allows us to partner with PulsePoint users to expand its reach to opioid overdoses, which share the need for a quick response that emergency responders are often unable to provide. ORRS has the advantage of expanding the population of responders with NARCAN, rescue breathing, and CPR training that can be connected to overdose events, increasing the likelihood of saving overdose victims' lives through a quick, efficient response.
