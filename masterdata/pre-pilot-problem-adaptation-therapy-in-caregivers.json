Following the informed consent process, screening, and enrollment, participants will complete a baseline assessment, 8 PATH-Care sessions with short feedback interviews, tablet-based exercises, and a post-intervention assessment.\n\nPrimary Objective(s): To adapt the existing PATH intervention as a tool to mitigate negative emotions and stress experienced by informal CGs of individuals with ADRD, by employing an evidence-based user-center design protocol and obtaining additional suggestions for program refinement through an uncontrolled usability study."
