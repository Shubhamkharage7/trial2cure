Since the completion of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) for the Intracranial Treatment of Aneurysms trial, the field of flow diversion has undergone continuous evolution with the development and approval of several devices. While these devices share a similar mechanism for aneurysm occlusion, their design and delivery systems can vary significantly. Prior studies have demonstrated promising safety and efficacy profile; however, the available data for a direct comparison of the technical and clinical outcomes between these devices remains limited. This retrospective cohort study aims to investigate the technical and clinical outcomes of intracranial aneurysms treated with approved Flow diverter stents."
