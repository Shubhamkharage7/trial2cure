            "briefSummary": "This initial cohort of this phase II trial studied the outcomes of using a JAK inhibitor prior to reduced intensity haploidentical (Haplo) transplantation for the treatment of primary or secondary myelofibrosis (MF). The primary risk of using Haplo HCT in patients with MF is graft failure. In the first cohort, all patients engrafted. There were no instances of graft failure. However, a large number of patients did have graft versus host disease as a complication of their transplant. JAK inhibitors have since been approved for the indication of graft versus host disease treatment. And we are also using them for graft versus host disease prevention in a study of MF patients with sibling and unrelated donors. Therefore, we are opening a new cohort of the current study using the JAK inhibitor prior to, during and after Haplo transplant. Our goal is to decrease graft versus host disease in patients receiving a Haplo MF transplant without increasing the risk of graft failure.",
