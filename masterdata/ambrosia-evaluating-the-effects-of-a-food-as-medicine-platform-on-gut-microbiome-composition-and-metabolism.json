Whole genome sequencing, metabolite analysis, and immune profiling will be performed on the samples. Demographic data, general health information, diet and lifestyle information will be collected from the subjects (all self-reported). When applicable, notes from telenutrition appointments will also be collected. Diet information will be collected using the Picture Your Plate(TM) validated food questionnaire."
