            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether treosulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) work when given before a blood or bone marrow transplant (conditioning regimen) to cause fewer complications for patients with bone marrow failure diseases. Chemotherapy drugs, such as treosulfan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fludarabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. rATG is used to decrease the body's immune response and may improve bone marrow function and increase blood cell counts. Adding treosulfan to a conditioning regimen with fludarabine and rATG may result in patients having less severe complications after a blood or bone marrow transplant.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nCONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive treosulfan intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on days -6 to -4, fludarabine phosphate IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -2, and lapine T-lymphocyte immune globulin (rATG) IV over 4-6 hours on days -4 to -2.\n\nTRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.\n\nGVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously beginning on day -2 and a taper beginning on day 180. Patients may also receive tacrolimus orally (PO). Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.\n\nPatients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) as well as possible chest radiography (x-ray) or computed tomography (CT) at baseline and undergo bone marrow biopsy and aspiration at baseline and follow up. Patients also undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 year from transplant."

In these situations, treating physicians may submit their patient to the BMT CTN 1904 ERC for review in order to determine if the patient is eligible for this clinical trial based on additional clinical or laboratory information\n  * Many patients with BMFD can have bone marrow evaluations that raise concern for possible myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including but not limited to dysplastic bone marrow evaluations or cytogenetic abnormalities. However, in patients BMFD these findings are not necessarily diagnostic or consistent with MDS. Therefore, given the complexities of diagnosing MDS in patients with BMFD, all patients with bone marrow evaluations concerning for possible MDS should be submitted to the ERC for review to confirm or exclude MDS. This is particularly important as we do not want to exclude potentially eligible patients due to an incorrect diagnosis of MDS\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: HLA-matched sibling: Must be a minimum HLA-6/6 matched to the recipient at HLA-A, -B (serologic typing) and DRB1 (high-resolution typing)\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: HLA-matched related (phenotypic match): Fully matched for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and DQB1 by high-resolution typing.\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: If a genetic mutation is known for the patient, the HLA-matched related donor \\[either HLA-matched sibling or HLA-matched related (phenotypic match)\\] must be screened for the same genetic mutation if clinically appropriate and should be confirmed to not have the same genetic disease (this does not include patients with PNH). Consult the protocol team with questions\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: If a patient has an undefined BMFD (a patient with a BMFD for whom a genetic mutation responsible for their bone marrow failure phenotype has not been identified), the HLA-matched related donor \\[either HLA-matched sibling or HLA-matched related (phenotypic match)\\] must have an evaluation as directed by the treating physician to confirm that the donor does not have the same underlying disease. This will include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and potentially a bone marrow evaluation or other studies as directed by the treating physician\n* UNRELATED DONOR: Fully matched for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and DQB1 by high-resolution typing OR\n* UNRELATED DONOR: Mismatched for a single HLA-class 1 allele (HLA-A, -B, or -C) by high-resolution typing; OR\n* UNRELATED DONOR: Mismatched for a single HLA DQB1 allele or antigen by high-resolution typing\n\n  \\* Note: donor patient (DP) matching per institutional practice\n* DONOR SELECTION RECCOMENDATIONS: in the case where there are multiple donor options, donors should be selected based on the following priority numbered below:\n\n  * Unaffected fully HLA-matched sibling\n  * Unaffected fully phenotypically HLA-matched related donor\n  * Fully HLA-matched unrelated donor\n  * Unrelated donor with single allele or antigen level mismatch at DQB1\n  * Unrelated donor with single allele level mismatch at class 1 (HLA-A, -B, or -C)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, and congenital neutropenia\n* Patients with MDS as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) or leukemia\n* Prior allogeneic HCT\n* Patient's weight =\\< 10.0 kg (actual body weight and adjusted body weight) at time of study enrollment\n* Lansky (patients \\< 16 years of age) or Karnofsky (patients \\>= 16 years of age) performance \\< 70%\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction \\< 50% by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan\n\n  \\* For patients unable to obtain a left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular shortening fraction of \\< 26%\n* Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (corrected/adjusted for hemoglobin) \\< 50%, forced expiratory volume (FEV)1 \\< 50% predicted, and forced vital capacity (FVC) \\< 50% predicted\n* For patients unable to perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs) due to age or developmental delay: oxygen (O2) saturation \\< 92% on room air\n* On supplemental oxygen\n* Estimated creatinine clearance \\< 60 mL/minute/1.73m\\^2 (estimated per institutional practice)\n* Dialysis dependent\n* Conjugated bilirubin \\> 2 x upper limit of normal for age (ULN, unless attributable to Gilbert's syndrome)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\> 4 x ULN for age, or\n* Fulminant liver failure or cirrhosis\n* Iron overload - This exclusion criterion only applies to patients who are considered at risk for hepatic or cardiac iron overload. Therefore, not all patients enrolled on this protocol will undergo formal hepatic or cardiac iron assessment\n\n  \\* For patients with a history of significant transfusions defined as \\>= 8 packed red blood cell transfusions per year for \\>= 1 year or have received \\>= 20 packed red blood cell transfusions (lifetime cumulative) will require formal hepatic and cardiac iron measurement. In addition, patients with a prior history of hepatic or cardiac iron overload will also require formal assessment for iron overload. Patients are excluded if:\n  * Hepatic iron content \\>= 8 mg Fe/g dry weight by liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a validated methodology (such as T2 \\* MRI or ferriscan) or liver biopsy per institutional practice\n  * Cardiac iron content \\< 25 msec by cardiac T2 \\* MRI\n* Uncontrolled bacterial infection within 1 week of study enrollment. Uncontrolled is defined as currently taking medication with no clinical improvement or progression on adequate medical treatment\n* Uncontrolled viral or fungal infection within 30 days of study enrollment. Uncontrolled is defined as currently taking medication with no clinical improvement or progression on adequate medical treatment\n* Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Presence of clinically significant anti-donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-antibodies per institutional practice\n* Prior solid organ transplant\n* Patients with prior malignancies except resected non-melanoma skin cancer or treated cervical carcinoma in situ\n* Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Females and males of childbearing potential who are unwilling to practice an effective method of contraception or agree to abstinence from the time of signing informed consent through 12 months post-transplant or off tacrolimus whichever is later\n* Known hypersensitivity to treosulfan or fludarabine\n* Known life-threatening reaction (i.e. anaphylaxis) to Thymoglobulin that would prohibit use for the patient as this study requires use of the Thymoglobulin preparation of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)",
