            "briefSummary": "The study aims to assess the effect of music on the heart resulting in a change in their exercise capacity among systolic heart failure patients undergoing Cardiopulmonary Exercise testing.",
            "detailedDescription": "Studies have previously shown the positive impact of music on the autonomic nervous system, neurohormonal and cardiovascular system. In addition, a previously published study found a positive impact of music resulting in an improvement of quality of life (QOL) in heart failure patients. Proposed mechanisms of benefit of music in heart failure include a reduction in sympathetic activity, and modulation of parasympathetic activity. Further, reduction in anxiety and arterial relaxation are thought to be beneficial effects of music. It is hypothesized that heart failure patients listening to music would have better exercise stress test performance and increased exercise time.\n\nAdult patients with systolic heart failure scheduled to undergo Cardiopulmonary Exercise (CPX) testing at the Gill Heart and Vascular Institute will be recruited.\n\nWhile the patients are undergoing Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, patients randomized to the 'music arm' will listen to pre-selected upbeat music during their duration of the exercise testing via headphones that will be provided to patients by the study personnel. The patients who are randomized to 'non-music arm' in which their headphones will not play music and the patients will perform the cardiopulmonary exercise testing as usual.\n\nStandard clinical care is performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing without any music.\n\nThe investigators will then compare the results of CPX study of the two arms to assess the impact of music on exercise performance."
