The purpose of this study is to better understand how vaccines against typhoid fever and cholera affect the normal immune system and bacteria in the intestine. Patients having standard-of-care endoscopies (colonoscopy and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)) will be divided into 3 groups:\n\nGroup 1: Vivotif typhoid vaccination and/or Vaxchora cholera vaccination then endoscopy Group 2: Endoscopy, then Vivotif typhoid vaccination and/or Vaxchora cholera vaccination, then follow-up endoscopy Group 3: Endoscopy without vaccination.\n\nBoth vaccines used in this study are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for travelers to developing countries. Volunteers will be asked to donate tissue, blood, saliva and stool samples for studying how the body responds to the typhoid and/or cholera vaccine."
