Cancer genetic testing is a series of tests that finds specific changes in cancer cells and normal cells in the body. Researchers may request to access these data as they explore how to better prevent, screen, or treat cancer. This study is also being done to create a biobank (library) of samples and information to learn more about treating cancer. Discovery of genetic variants in patients with cancer could result in opportunities for cancer prevention, earlier diagnosis or better therapy for cancer."

Researchers across the field of genomic sequencing report findings about new variations in scientific publications and collect it in databases every day. Consequently, any patient's variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result could be reclassified by emerging findings, turning previously unresolved tests into diagnostic answers.
