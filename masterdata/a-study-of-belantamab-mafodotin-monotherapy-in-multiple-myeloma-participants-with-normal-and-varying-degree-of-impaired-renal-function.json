            "briefSummary": "Belantamab mafodotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) containing humanized anti- B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Renal impairment is a major complication of multiple myeloma (MM) and the majority of MM participants is either at risk or already has renal dysfunction at initial diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in participants with RRMM, who have had at least 3 lines of prior treatment (or at least 2 lines of prior treatment if ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation ) and have either normal or impaired renal functions. The study will consist of two parts: part 1 will include participants with normal/mildly impaired renal function and severe renal impairment and part 2 will include participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), where participants are either not undergoing or require hemodialysis. Participants will be administered belantamab mafodotin at a dose of 2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously once in three weeks (Q3W) dosing in Part 1. Based on the Part 1 Safety/Pharmacokinetic (PK) data, Part 2 participants will be administered the dose of either 2.5 mg/kg or 1.9 mg/kg (or other adjusted dose). Participants will be treated with belantamab mafodotin monotherapy until confirmed disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first. This study will include a screening phase, treatment phase, follow-up phase and a post analysis continued treatment (PACT) phase . The total duration of the study is approximately up to 48 months."
