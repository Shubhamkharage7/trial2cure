            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide. These cancers have different causes, with smoking/tobacco exposure and human papilloma virus infection being the most common. . When HNSCC occurs in people who are not infected with HPV, the cancers are more likely to return after treatment; when this happens, overall survival is only about 10 months, thus better treatments are needed.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a combination treatment using 2 drugs (valemetostat and pembrolizumab) in people with HNSCC. Phase 1b of the study will determine a recommended dose of the 2 drugs and evaluate how safe the combination is.; this will include patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC, as well as squamous cell NSCLC that have progressed on anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapies.Phase II will determine how effective the combination is and will focus on patients with HPV-negative HNSCC.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older with HPV-negative HNSCC, sinonasal carcinoma of the head and neck, or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests and tests of their heart function. They will have imaging scans. They may have a biopsy: A small sample of tissue will be removed from the tumor.\n\nTreatment will be given in 21-day cycles.\n\nPembrolizumab is administered through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm. Participants will receive pembrolizumab on the first day of each cycle.\n\nValemetostat is a tablet taken by mouth. Participants will take the tablet once a day at home. They will record the date and time of each dose in a diary. They will also write down any adverse effects they experience.\n\nParticipants may remain in the study up to 2 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide, with approximately 60,000 patients diagnosed annually in the United States.\n* Only 14% of HNSCC patients have structural defects in the genes encoding for the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I components, while a higher percentage of these tumors show downregulation of HLA class I components by immunohistochemistry supports those epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the deregulation of these genes.\n* Valemetostat (DS-3201) is an enhancer of zeste homolog 1 and 2 (EZH1/2) dual inhibitor that is actively being investigated in phase I and II trials for hematologic malignancies and is approved for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) indication in Japan.\n* Patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) pembrolizumab-na(SqrRoot) ve human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC have a low 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) (28%) with pembrolizumab monotherapy, thus novel interventions are needed to increase the efficacy of pembrolizumab.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPhase Ib:\n\n* To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of valemetostat in combination with pembrolizumab.\n* To evaluate the safety of valemetostat in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\nPhase II:\n\n-To determine the disease control rate (DCR)=partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) + stable disease (SD).\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Participants must have a diagnosis of locoregionally recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HPVnegative (Phase Ib and Phase II) or positive HNSCC (Phase Ib only): oral cavity, tonsil, pharynx, hypopharynx, larynx. Note: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are excluded\n\nOR\n\n(R/M) squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Phase Ib only)\n\nOR\n\n(R/M) sinonasal carcinomas of the head and neck (Phase Ib only).\n\n* Age \\>18 years.\n* Adequate organ and marrow function.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is an open-label multicenter phase Ib/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combined treatment of valemetostat and pembrolizumab.\n* During phase Ib we will estimate the RP2D of the valemetostat in combination with pembrolizumab.\n* During phase II we will examine the efficacy and continue to evaluate the safety of the study regimen at the RP2D of the valemetostat in combination with pembrolizumab.\n* Participants will receive treatment in cycles consisting of 21 (+/- 3) days for 2 years."

Cardiovascular diseases with the following criteria:\n\n   9.1 Evidence of prolongation of QT/corrected (QTc) interval (e.g., repeated episodes of QT corrected for heart rate using Fridericia s method \\[QTcF\\] \\>470 ms regardless of sex) (average of triplicate determinations) at screening\n\n   9.2 Diagnosed or suspected long QT syndrome, or known family history of long QT syndrome\n\n   9.3 History of clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsade de pointes\n\n   9.4 Uncontrolled arrhythmia (participants with asymptomatic, controllable atrial fibrillation may be enrolled), or asymptomatic persistent ventricular tachycardia at screening\n\n   9.5 Participant has clinically relevant bradycardia of less than 50 bpm at screening unless the participant has a pacemaker\n\n   9.6 History of second- or third-degree heart block. Candidates with a history of heart block may be eligible if they currently have pacemakers, and have no history of fainting or clinically relevant arrhythmia with pacemakers, within 6 months prior to treatment initiation\n\n   9.7 Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to treatment initiation\n\n   9.8 Angioplasty or stent graft implantation within 6 months prior to treatment initiation\n\n   9.9 Uncontrolled angina pectoris within 6 months prior to treatment initiation\n\n   9.10 History of New York Heart Association (NYHA), https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/multimedia/table/new-york-heart- association-nyha-classification-of-heart-failure) Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure\n\n   9.11 Coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft within 6 months prior to treatment initiation\n\n   9.12 Uncontrolled hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure \\>180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>110 mmHg) at screening\n\n   9.13 Complete left bundle branch block at screening\n10. History of autoimmune disease with the exception of controlled thyroid disease, psoriasis not requiring medications, vitiligo, and alopecia.\n11. Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for locally curable cancer that is currently considered as cured and does not require additional Standard of Care treatment, such as cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma, superficial bladder cancer, or cervical carcinoma in situ, or an incidental histological finding of prostate cancer.\n12. Ongoing uncontrolled systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection currently requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals.\n13.
