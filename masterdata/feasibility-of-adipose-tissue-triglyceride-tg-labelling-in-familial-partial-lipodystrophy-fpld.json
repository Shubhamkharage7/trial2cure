            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeople with familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) do not store fat in the body normally. This can lead to serious illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. To learn more about FPLD, researchers want to compare the fat tissue in people with this disease to the fat tissue of healthy people.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo collect and analyze samples of fat tissue in people with and without FPLD.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 to 65 years with FPLD. Healthy adults are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam. The size and shape of their body will be measured. They will have an imaging scan to measure their bones, muscle, and fat.\n\nParticipants will be given heavy water to drink at home. The water contains a tracer to help measure the fat in their blood. They will drink 1 vial 3 times a day.\n\nAfter drinking the water for 9 days, participants will come to the clinic for a 3-day stay. They will eat only foods provided by the hospital; the foods will contain tracers. A needle will be inserted into a vein in the arm; participants will receive infusions of other tracers through this needle into their blood; this needle will also be used to draw blood samples for testing.\n\nOn their third day in the clinic, participants will have biopsies: Small samples of fat will be removed from under the skin on the belly and thigh.\n\nParticipants may return for a follow-up visit 8 days after leaving the clinic. Blood draws and fat tissue biopsies will be repeated.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThe feasibility of adipose tissue triglyceride labeling in patients with FPLD will be assessed in this non-interventional protocol. Specifically, subjects with FPLD (n=5) and control subjects without FPLD (n=5) will undergo isotope administration followed by abdominal and femoral subcutaneous fat biopsies.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary objective:\n\n(1) To establish the technique of subcutaneous femoral adipose tissue biopsy in patients with FPLD, and subsequently, (2) to establish the feasibility of detecting labeled TG/FA in these adipose tissue biopsy samples.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n(1) To determine metabolic fluxes in healthy volunteers and patients with FPLD. (2) To determine if peripheral subcutaneous adipocytes are capable of fatty acid uptake and retention in patients with FPLD. (3) To assess standard metabolic parameters impacted by adipose fat storage capacity. (4) To assess different forms of circulating fat. (5) To determine feasibility of measuring adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n(1) Feasibility of performing subcutaneous femoral adipose tissue biopsy in patients with FPLD and (2) presence of detectable stable isotope labeling in adipose tissue specimens.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n(1) Blood labeling of glucose, glycerol, palmitate, and saponified fatty acids and other metabolites, as feasible; (2) quantity of stable isotope labeling in adipose tissue specimens; (3) blood glucose, insulin, NEFA, beta-OH-butyrate; (4) blood TG, VLDL, chylomicrons, NEFA and complete lipoprotein panel by NMR; (5) adipose tissue LPL activity and (6) adipose tissue histologic analysis."
