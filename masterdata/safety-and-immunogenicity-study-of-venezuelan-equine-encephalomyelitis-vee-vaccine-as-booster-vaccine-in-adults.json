Subjects who showed an initial immune response \u2265 1:20 to TC-83 and whose titer decreased over time or who rollover from a previous VEE C-84 protocol will receive a single 0.5 mL booster dose of C-84 vaccine. Subjects who were initial non-responders (\\< 1:20) to TC-83 will be given subcutaneous 0.5 mL injections on Days 0, 28-35, and 56-63.\n\nDuration of participation is 12-15 months if the subject demonstrates a PRNT80 of \u22651:20 at 1 year; if not, the vaccination procedure with C-84 will be repeated with a minimum of 28 days between doses. A maximum of four booster doses will be given in a year. If the PRNT80 titer is \\< 1:20 after four booster doses in any 12-month period, the subject's participation in the study will be placed on hold for 12 months; titers will be repeated at 1 year (\u00b1 30 days), and, if required, the subject will be given a booster dose of C-84 vaccine.\n\nSafety endpoint measurements will be evaluated for all subjects receiving at least one vaccination under this protocol regardless of compliance with the protocol. Immunogenicity endpoints will be evaluated for subjects who have been vaccinated in compliance with the protocol and who have had blood for titers drawn in compliance with the protocol."

Current administration of topical, inhalational, or intranasal glucocorticoids is not excluded.\n* Have confirmed HIV infection.\n* Have positive pregnancy test or be a breastfeeding female.\n* Have any known allergies to components of the vaccine:\n* Neomycin sulfate\n* Streptomycin\n* VEE virus, inactivated\n* Formaldehyde\n* Eggs\n* Human serum albumin\n* Guinea pig heart cells\n* Sodium bisulfite\n* Have had a previous serious allergic reaction to guinea pigs or guinea pig products. (Subjects who have known allergies to guinea pigs but whose allergic reactions were not severe may still participate in the study but should be referred to an allergy specialist for assessment and recommendation prior to vaccination).\n* Have received or plan to receive another vaccine or investigational product within 28 days of VEE vaccination.\n* Have any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.\n* Have a medical condition that, in the judgment of the PI, would impact subject safety.",
