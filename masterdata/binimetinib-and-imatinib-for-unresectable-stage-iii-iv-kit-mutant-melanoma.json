Binimetinib and imatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving binimetinib and imatinib may help treat patients with KIT-mutant melanoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of binimetinib plus imatinib in patients with advanced KIT-mutant melanoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of binimetinib plus imatinib in patients with advanced KIT-mutant melanoma.\n\nII. To estimate efficacy and survival parameters in patients with advanced KIT-mutant melanoma treated with binimetinib plus imatinib.\n\nIII. To estimate efficacy in patients with advanced KIT-mutant melanoma treated with binimetinib plus imatinib.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate association between changes in drug phosphorylated end products (p-KIT, p-MEK, p-ERK) and clinical response.\n\nII. To investigate association between clinical response and baseline Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and SPRED1 status.\n\nIII. To investigate pathologic correlates of acquired resistance. IV. To investigate whether NF1 and SPRED1 loss contribute to acquired resistance.\n\nV. To generate patient-derived xenograft models. VI. To determine the relationship between clinical outcomes and clinicopathologic features including KIT exon mutated, melanoma subtype, melanoma primary site, race/ethnicity, prior treatment history including immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-experienced versus (vs) - naive.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and imatinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and 100, and then every 3 months."

Note: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling catheters or other procedures may be enrolled\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because binimetinib and imatinib are small molecule inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with binimetinib and/or imatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to study drug start\n* Other severe, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for the study",
