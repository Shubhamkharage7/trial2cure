Each Stage 1 cohort that achieves an ORR of \u2265 20% (at least 2 out of 10 subjects with an objective response) will enroll up to an additional 20 subjects in Stage 2. Cohorts with an ORR of less than 20% will discontinue enrollment. However, additional factors will be considered in determining an expansion into Stage 2 (eg, enrollment rate, complete versus partial response, and DOR)."
