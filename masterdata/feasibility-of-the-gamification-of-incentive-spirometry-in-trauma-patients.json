Several studies have examined the addition of gamification e.g. virtual incentive spirometry devices. There is a paucity of data regarding the gamification of incentive spirometry, and there is no data involving trauma patients. Previous studies have enrolled either healthy volunteers or patients with specific lung pathology. This study to assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of respiratory interventions in chest trauma patients using a therapeutic gamification platform."
