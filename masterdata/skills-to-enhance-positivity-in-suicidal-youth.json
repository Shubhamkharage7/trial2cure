            "briefSummary": "This is a Hybrid Type I Effectiveness-Implementation design. Specifically, this study proposes to test the effectiveness of STEP in reducing suicidal events and ideation in 216 adolescents, admitted to inpatient psychiatric care due to suicide risk. Participants will be randomized to either STEP or ETAU. STEP involves 4 in-person sessions (3 individual, 1 family) focused on psychoeducation regarding positive and negative affect, mindfulness meditation, gratitude, and savoring. Mood monitoring prompts and skill reminders will be sent daily for the first month post-discharge and three times a week for the following two months. The ETAU condition will receive reminders to log into a safety resource app, matched in frequency to the STEP group. Effectiveness aspects of the design include using clinical staff as interventionists and having very few exclusion criteria.",
            "detailedDescription": "216 participants and their families (across two sites) will be randomized to either STEP or ETAU (as described in the research strategy). Aims and hypotheses are below:\n\nAim 1: Examine the effectiveness of STEP in reducing suicidal events (attempt or emergency intervention to intercede attempt), active SI (with intent or plan), and depression at 6-month f/u (primary) and suicidal events at 12-month follow-up (f/u). H1: It is hypothesized that those randomized to STEP, compared to ETAU, will have lower rates of suicide events (H1A), active SI (H1B), and depression (H1C) over the 6-month follow-up period; H1D: It is hypothesized that those randomized to STEP, compared to ETAU, will have lower rates of suicidal events at the 12-month, long term f/u.\n\nAim 2: Examine engagement of the hypothesized mechanisms at the 3- and 6-month f/u. It is hypothesized that those randomized to STEP, compared to ETAU, will have: H2A: higher attention to positive affect, assessed by implicit tasks; H2B: higher gratitude and satisfaction with life, assessed by self-report; H2C: lower negative affect, assessed by implicit tasks and self-report.\n\nAim 3: Examine whether hypothesized mechanisms mediate reduction of suicidal events and ideation. H3: Changes in attention to positive affect, gratitude, satisfaction with life, and negative affect at 3-month f/u will be related to improvements in suicidal ideation and suicidal events at the 6-month f/u.\n\nSecondary Aim Examine elements supporting external validity. Acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of STEP to patients, parents, clinicians, and administrators will be assessed by: 1) a survey consisting of brief, standardized measures of these items, and 2) qualitative interviews to further explore these perceptions. These findings will be used to: 1) modify STEP to address potential barriers, and 2) develop implementation strategies designed to overcome these challenges, for testing in a future Hybrid Type III effectiveness-implementation trial."
