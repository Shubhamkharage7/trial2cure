The screening period will last for up to 14 days prior to the first dose of ianalumab. All eligible participants will be treated with the same dose of ianalumab and will complete the primary endpoint assessment period. After completion of the primary endpoint assessment period, all participants will continue in safety monitoring and those with a platelet count \u226530 G/L in absence of a new line of ITP therapy and rescue therapy will also continue in efficacy monitoring. The trial includes an option to offer a second course of ianalumab treatment to participants who achieved confirmed response during the initial course of ianalumab and later lost response to explore the benefit of the second course of treatment. The study will end once all participants have completed 24 months of safety follow-up since their last dose of ianalumab (including the optional second course of ianalumab treatment),or discontinued the study earlier."
