            "briefSummary": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic lung disease resulting in increasing shortness of breath, cough, and low oxygen levels as a result of lung tissue scarring . The goal of this open-label (no placebo) study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of artesunate at three different doses in patients with IPF. The secondary goals are to explore the blood biomarkers present in IPF patients at the beginning of the study and to study how those biomarkers change following treatment with artesunate. Participants will have 7 visits to the study site over 20 weeks which will include physician exams, vital signs, questionnaires, research and safety blood samples, and taking artesunate capsules by mouth for 12 weeks.\n\nArtesunate is used world-wide for the treatment of severe malaria but has also been found to block specific proteins that cause lung scarring and may provide an additional treatment to slow the fibrotic process in the lung and improve survival and quality of life for patients with IPF."
