The project aims to collaborate with community partners to develop an infrastructure and iterative process to provide social support to community members that facilitates obtaining their follow-up LDCT for LCS. It utilizes novel population level data that includes geospatial analysis of neighborhood-level data of patients residing in Philadelphia who have received a LDCT for LCS. This allows for targeted community level interventions and the ability to evaluate impact on a population level.\n\nA Community Support Program Representative will reach out to eligible patients via telephone. The CSP Representative and Patient Navigator will communicate with consented patient directly, assist with travel and the appointment. The PN will log the date of the appointment, zip code of the patient and the adherence (or lack of) of the appointment completion. We will utilize Lyft transportation vouchers to provide rides to participants from their home location in West Philadelphia to and from the Penn Medicine downtown hospital locations on the day of their LDCT."

The control group would be individuals residing in the adjacent Southwest Philadelphia planning district which has a similar Yost score - a composite index of socioeconomic status.
