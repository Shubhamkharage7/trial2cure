Patient outcomes will be compared at the end of the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective, multi-center randomized controlled study designed to collect patient outcomes data for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. (DFU) All subjects will receive standard of care procedures (SOC) such as wound cleaning, appropriate sharp debridement, and appropriate offloading of the DFU (e.g., offloading Camboot or post op shoe with offloading/wound care insole).\n\nSubjects will be randomized and receive treatments to either of the following arms:\n\nArm 1 - Subject will receive SOC that will include AC5\u00ae Advanced Wound System as an active synthetic cellular tissue product, covered with a non-adherent dressing plus an appropriate outer dressing to maintain moisture balance, then wrapped with stretch gauze and self-adherent wrap. AC5 will be applied weekly and outer dressings will be redressed, if necessary, using the allowed secondary dressings.\n\nArm 2 - Subject will receive SOC that will include Fibracol Plus collagen dressing as an active dressing. This will be followed with an appropriate outer dressing to maintain moisture balance, then wrapped with stretch gauze and self-adherent wrap as needed. Fibracol Plus will be applied 3 x a week and any outer dressings will be redressed, if necessary, using the allowed dressings.\n\nThe study involves two phases: Screening and Treatment."
