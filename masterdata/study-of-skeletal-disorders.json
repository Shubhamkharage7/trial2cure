            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThere are 461 conditions that affect the bones (skeletal disorders). Many of these are not well understood and do not have any specific treatments. Researchers want to collect more data about these conditions.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo gain more information about the causes of skeletal disorders and how they progress over time.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 2 months or older with known or suspected skeletal disorders. Also, healthy family members of affected enrolled participants.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants can take part in the study either remotely or in person. Those who take part remotely may send in medical records, blood samples, photographs, and other materials.\n\nParticipants medical records will be reviewed. They may give blood and/or urine samples. They will give blood, saliva, or tissue samples for genetic tests. They may have genetic counseling.\n\nParticipants ages 2 years and older may have different kinds of imaging scans, such as x-rays. For these scans, they may have to lie still while machines take pictures of their bones.\n\nParticipants with skeletal disorders who come to the clinic will be examined. They may be asked to stay in the hospital for a few days to take extra tests. They may have a bone or skin biopsy.\n\nParticipants with skeletal disorders may be photographed to show the effects of their disorder and how it changes over time.\n\nFor participants with skeletal disorders, their blood or tissue samples may be used to make a special type of stem cell. These cells can be used in the laboratory to make many other types of cells. A large supply of these cells may be created for research.\n\nParticipation will last indefinitely.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is a clinical and laboratory study of rare skeletal disorders using a combination of both retrospective and prospective methods. This is a single site study taking place at the NIH Clinical Center with the added ability for participants to submit medical records and specimens remotely.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To provide a protocol in which subjects with rare skeletal disorders can be evaluated and studied and to allow for the receipt of tissues and clinical specimens from individuals and investigators outside of the NIH\n\nSecondary Objective: To perform genetic testing including genes currently known to cause skeletal disorders as well as those currently without association with skeletal disorders\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: To define or further define genetic etiologies of known and unknown skeletal disorders and create genotype-phenotype correlations when possible\n\nSecondary Endpoints: To describe natural history of individual disorders if enough data is collected on a particular condition(s)"
