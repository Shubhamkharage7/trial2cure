The study is being done to help investigators understand the link between long term effects of chest radiation and bleomycin for HL and brain function in survivors.\n\nPrimary Objective To evaluate dynamic changes in CBF and oxygenation during exercise with Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in HL survivors and non-cancer controls matched for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. .\n\nSecondary Objectives To examine the degree of CO2 clearance (DLCO/ETCO2) during rest and exercise in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) survivors compared to non-cancer controls matched for age, sex, race, and ethnicity.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nVolunteers are being asked to take part in this research study because they are non-first degree relative or friend of someone who received treatment for a childhood cancer or similar illness at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital or are an employee/affiliate of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and have agreed to be a St. Jude Life Cohort Study (SJLIFE) community control.",
