The overarching goal of this Registry is to rapidly advance research and understanding of the use of cannabis and hemp-based formulations, in the clinical community setting, when it is utilized to manage the symptoms of cancer treatment and other underlying health issues. These symptoms include nausea, neuropathy, and sleeplessness and chronic pain.",
            "detailedDescription": "The JuLi Registry seeks to fill some of the gaps associated with the clinical application of CBD (cannabidiol) and other cannabinoid formulations including THC and others. It will also serve as a platform for discovery, whereby observations of patient symptoms, specific cannabis formulations, delivery methods and clinical outcomes, become the source of more in-depth research projects.\n\nThe JuLi Registry is a prospective observational Registry documenting utility and patient experience for patients seeking to use therapeutic cannabis and hemp-based products as a means of symptom relief and management related to various diseases.\n\nTargeted symptoms and conditions include:\n\n* Chronic Pain\n* Neuropathy\n* Sleeplessness\n* Poor Appetite\n* Nausea\n* Anxiety\n* Menopausal symptoms\n\nData to be recorded includes:\n\n* Basic demographics of patients using cannabis-based or hemp-based products\n* Disease diagnoses and symptoms for which patients are seeking management\n* Cannabinoid formulation, chemical composition, amount (in milligrams), dose and utilization\n* Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) using, where possible, validated measures of sleep, pain, appetite, etc.\n* Physician and patient utilization of these data to manage prescription medication recommendations and usage, including discontinuation of opiates or reduction in use of opiates after initiation of cannabis- or hemp-based products\n* Overall impact on clinical or patient treatment plan\n\nThe purpose of this Registry is to provide a platform for physicians and patients to collaborate on hemp and cannabis research and advance the understanding of the application of cannabinoids for symptom relief associated with various medical conditions.\n\nPatients greater than or equal to 21 years of age seeking to use CBD or other cannabis-based formulations, where legal, will be invited to participate.\n\nData collected in the normal course of a patient's visit and follow up are entered. This is an observational study; no specific patient interventions are required. Patients must have requested a cannabis-based medicament from their provider. Or be otherwise deemed eligible per the research protocol and choose to participate in a self-directed manner.\n\nData will be collected at various time points, including:\n\n1. At the time patients first request cannabis or hemp based products\n2. At various recommended and voluntary time points, collected via PRO surveys\n3. Daily or whenever they are using their products via the use of a study app\n4. When patients return to their providers during the course of normal clinical care\n\nAll patients must sign an electronic informed consent form prior to their prospective data being entered into the Registry.\n\nAll demographic, diagnostic, hemp/cannabis formulation and follow up data will be entered by patients. Consented patients will record compliance with recommendations, usage and symptom relief. They will be asked to take symptom specific surveys."
