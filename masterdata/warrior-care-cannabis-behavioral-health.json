Veterans will be randomized into one of four different groups: THC (\u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol), CBD (cannabidiol), THC+CBD, and Placebo, and undergo a 12-week treatment phase where they will be asked to vaporize their assigned cannabis dose every day for 12 weeks. Participants will complete weekly questionnaires regarding their mood, behavior and drug consumption. Furthermore, there is a laboratory component that will assess cognition, fear conditioning, and other PTSD-related measures."
