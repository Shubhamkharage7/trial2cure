Bile and bile duct cells will be collected during clinically necessary Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Anticipated research will focus on multi-omics assessments of biospecimens to better define how these diseases start and progress in order to develop novel tests for early detection of complication and better disease prognostication."
