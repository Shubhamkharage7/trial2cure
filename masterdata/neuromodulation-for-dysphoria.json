            "briefSummary": "This is an open label prospective pilot study of two neuromodulation interventions for patients suffering from dysphoria. Dysphoria is a transdiagnostic symptom of unease or dissatisfaction experienced across a range of diagnoses, including mood disorders and pain. There is a significant gap of treatment options across conditions with dysphoria, particularly non-medicated and self-care alternatives.\n\nMany neuromodulation therapies require extensive medical resources or time to deliver. Thus, the investigators will test two non-invasive technologies administered in a manner that would reduce resources and/or time. Virtual Reality (VR) overlays the sensory system to block the external environment and provide vast range of meaningful sensory experiences. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) involves a magnetic pulse passing through the scalp to depolarize neurons in the outer cortex of the brain, and daily treatments over 6 weeks are currently FDA indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Accelerated TMS is the delivery of treatment in a shorter period of time.\n\nThe primary objective of this study to demonstrate the preliminary effectiveness, tolerability, and feasibility of these two interventions: Guided Meditation VR for Wellness and Accelerated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation."
