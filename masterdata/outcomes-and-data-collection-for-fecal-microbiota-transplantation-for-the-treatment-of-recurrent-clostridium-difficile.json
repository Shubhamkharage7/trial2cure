            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see if stool transplant performed by colonoscopy is effective at treating recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection of the colon. During the procedure a stool sample is taken from a healthy donor (usually family member or close friend) and transplanted directly into the colon of the patient with C. diff infection. The goal of this experimental procedure (called fecal microbiota transplantation) is to replenish the good bacteria in the colon that can help prevent C. diff infection from coming back after treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves administering fecal material from a healthy individual into the gastrointestinal tract of the patient. This has been done in the past for recurrent colitis secondary to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) using different methods such as through nasogastric tube, fecal retention enemas, and by colonoscopy. This method of treatment was introduced over 50 years ago with high success rates, although it has not been until recent that more case studies have been performed, with continued success rates of approximately 90%. Studies have found this therapy to be effective with resolution of symptoms in most patients, and have found it to be both cost effective and safe.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to use a standardized published protocol for fecal microbiota transplantation performed by colonoscopy and record the success rate and outcomes of FMT therapy for patients with recurrent CDI at the UMassMemorial Medical Center. In addition, the cost of this therapy will be compared to conventional antibiotic treatment. The reduction in hospitalizations will also be monitored compared with historical controls.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that FMT therapy will show resolution of infection in most patients with recurrent CDI, with an overall reduction in cost to the hospital for recurrent admissions for Clostridium difficile colitis as compared to historical controls. Historical controls will be defined as patients with recurrent positive Clostridium difficile stool samples treated in the traditional fashion with antibiotics."
