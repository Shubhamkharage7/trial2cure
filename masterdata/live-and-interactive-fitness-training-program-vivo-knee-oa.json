All participants will be followed for 12 months, and will be assessed at 3-,6-, and 12-months. All participants will complete functional assessments, OA patient reported outcomes measures, quality of life, exercise self-efficacy, and fall risk questionnaires, and health care utilization report at each testing visit. A subset of Vivo participants will be asked satisfaction questions at the 3 and 6 month time points."
