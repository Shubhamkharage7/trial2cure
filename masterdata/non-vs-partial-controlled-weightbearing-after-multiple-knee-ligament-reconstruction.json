            "detailedDescription": "Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two rehabilitation protocols for the first six weeks post-surgery:\n\n1. non-weightbearing\n2. partial weightbearing\n\nAn immobilizer brace in extension will be used from post-operative day 0 through 4 and a dynamic stabilizing posterior knee brace (Ossur) will be used from 5 days through 6 months post-surgery to protect against increased posterior translation forces due to gravity and while weightbearing for patients with PCL reconstructions.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\n1. Primary Aim: To determine if there is clinical equivalence in millimeters of posterior tibial translation on posterior stress radiographs at six months post-surgery between patients who are non-weightbearing versus partial controlled weightbearing during the first six weeks of post-surgical rehabilitation.\n2. Primary Aim: To determine if there is clinical equivalence in millimeters of valgus and/or varus compartment gapping on stress radiographs at six months post-surgery between patients who are non-weightbearing versus partial controlled weightbearing during the first six weeks of post-surgical rehabilitation.\n3. Secondary Aim: To determine if there is a difference in pain, edema, range of motion, gait, and quadriceps strength between groups.\n\nThe current standard of care for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and multiligament reconstruction is non-weightbearing for the first six weeks after surgery."
