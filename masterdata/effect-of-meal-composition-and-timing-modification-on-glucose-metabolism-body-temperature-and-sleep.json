            "detailedDescription": "Pilot data points to an effect of the time between waking up and first meal is important in blood glucose management through the rest of the day. The investigators are interested in understanding the effect of caloric distribution through the day, specifically consuming more later in the day versus earlier in the day. The investigators want to test the hypothesis that consolidating the meals during a shorter span in the day (time restricted eating) can ameliorate blood sugars and sleep parameters in the studied population. The researchers would also like to compare dynamic range of meal-induced sympathetic responses (e.g. temperature and heart rate changes) between different metabolic health conditions (e.g. insulin sensitive vs insulin resistant vs diabetes) while controlling for dietary intake. Previous research studies suggest that people with different metabolic health conditions would have different meal-induced sympathetic responses. Based on this, the primary goal of the study is to characterize metabolic health based on non-invasive wearable sensor data that measure these responses."

That will be followed by 4 interventional phases where they will be asked to limit their daily eating to 10 hours or less (Time Restricted Eating, TRE), with the eating window and the caloric distribution will be shifted during each of the next 3 phases, each phase lasting 20 days. The last phase will last 8 days and participants will be asked to consume provided meals with a determined amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Their body temperature will be measured using a continuous temperature device and a heart rate monitor to capture dynamic rage of the sympathetic response during and after the meal consumption (thermotyping).",
