            "briefSummary": "Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is a common and highly disabling consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in U.S. military service members and veterans. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for PTH has been shown to significantly improve disability outcomes in veterans with persistent PTH when delivered in-person. Telemedicine platforms can dramatically increase access to evidence-based care. However, whether CBT for PTH retains its effectiveness when delivered through a telemedicine platform has yet to be established. The purpose of this 3-arm randomized clinical trial is to compare Clinic-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) to Telemedicine-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TCBT) and to treatment as usual (TAU) in 525 service members and veterans with chronic posttraumatic headaches (PTH) at 3 VA medical centers and 4 military treatment facilities across the U.S. Participants will be assessed for headache-related disability, headache experience, and psychiatric comorbidities across multiple time points.",
            "detailedDescription": "Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is noticeably more common among military service members and veterans than among civilians, with an estimated 80-90% of veterans with TBI reporting new or exacerbated headaches. Unlike civilian PTH, military and veteran PTH is likely to become chronic and recalcitrant to most front-line interventions for primary headache (e.g., migraine, tension-type). Service members and veterans with PTH report significantly decreased productivity in work and home activities and high rates of military discharge and work absenteeism. Pharmacological treatments for chronic PTH have proven problematic (i.e., unwanted side effects; worsening of symptoms long term). However, prior to 2019, guidance for non-pharmacological treatment approaches for PTH was unclear. In 2019, the investigators completed a single-site randomized clinical trial comparing Clinic-based CBT for PTH to Treatment at Usual in 193 veterans with PTH. The study found that Clinic-based CBT for PTH led to a significant improvement in headache-related disability (as measured by the 6-Item Headache Impact Test; HIT-6) at follow-up. In contrast, headache disability scores for participants in the Treatment as Usual condition remained unchanged.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic led to widespread recognition of the need for distance-technology platforms to add meaningful infrastructure for extended service delivery without the limitations of in-office care. Telehealth-based care can decrease the cost and increase the convenience of treatment leading some to suggest that telehealth may eventually become a first option for treating patients.\n\nGiven the potential impact of CBT for PTH to improve the functioning of service members and veterans with PTH following TBI, it is important to determine whether the results of the single-site trial can be replicated across diverse geographic regions and whether CBT for PTH retains its efficacy in improving headache-related disability when delivered through telemedicine platforms."
