            "briefSummary": "Studies have shown that people who are more physically fit prior to surgery do better after surgery. For this reason, it may be helpful for people who are going to have abdominal surgery for cancer to exercise before surgery to increase fitness. In this study, patients will be assigned to either maintain their current activity, or increase activity to 5 days a week, 40 minutes per day, of either continuous moderate activity or intervals of moderate and vigorous activity (three groups). All participants will wear an Apple watch, and participants in the exercise groups will use a smartphone application to get feedback on activity and encouragement to reach activity goals.",
            "detailedDescription": "Research indicates that people who have better physical fitness at the time of surgery have a better chance of surviving the surgery and returning to normal function. An exercise intervention in the 3+ weeks before surgery (after the decision that surgery is necessary) may help people who are going to have abdominal surgery for cancer increase fitness prior to surgery. Devices that track physical activity, like smartwatches or Fitbits, allow the wearer to get feedback on physical activity information like steps taken, distance traveled, time in light, moderate or vigorous activity and on heart rate. Having this information and using a smartphone application designed to increase physical activity may help patients increase physical activity and thereby fitness, prior to abdominal surgery for cancer.\n\nThe main goal of this project is to test two physical activity interventions and also a \"control group\" to make sure that participants can do the interventions and to see whether there are changes in activity and fitness in each group:\n\n1. Control group - maintain current activity\n2. Moderate continuous activity group - increase activity to 5 days a week, 40 minutes per day, of continuous moderate activity\n3. High Intensity Interval Training group - increase activity to 5 days a week, 40 minutes per day, of intervals of moderate and vigorous activity\n\nAll participants will wear an Apple watch, and participants in the exercise groups will use a smartphone application to get feedback on activity and encouragement to reach activity goals.\n\nOptional: Participants will also be asked to provide a small amount of blood for research purposes."
