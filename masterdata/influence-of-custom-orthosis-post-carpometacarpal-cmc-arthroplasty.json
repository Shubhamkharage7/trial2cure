The orthosis and splint being used in this study are both considered standard practice. Subjects will be provided the splint or orthosis at the first post-operative appointment. Subjects who are assigned to Intervention A will be provided a pre-fabricated splint by a member of the surgical team. Subjects who are assigned to Invention B will be evaluated by an occupational therapist and a custom orthosis will be fabricated. Outcome measures include: QuickDASH, Pain Visual Analogue Scale, active range of motion measurements, the Applied Dexterity portion of the Arthritis Hand Function Test except for the putty cutting task, edema, Sandy Grading Score and the Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) Satisfaction with Device and Services. Data will be collected at the first, second, and third post-operative appointment."
