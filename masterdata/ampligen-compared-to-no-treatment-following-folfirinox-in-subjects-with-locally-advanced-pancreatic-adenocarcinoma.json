Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and Women not of child-bearing potential are eligible to participate. Both women of child-bearing potential and women of non-child-bearing potential should use an approved method of birth control and agrees to continue to use this method for the duration of the study and for 90 days after last treatment.\n\n   Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, female subject/partner's use of hormonal contraceptive (oral, implanted, or injected) in conjunction with a barrier method (WOCBP only), female subject/partner's use of an intrauterine device (IUD), or if the female subject/partner is surgically sterile or two years post-menopausal.

Subjects who have surgically resectable locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma following treatment with FOLFIRINOX.\n3. Subject has received prior treatment with Ampligen\u00ae.\n4. Therapy with investigational drugs within 6 weeks of beginning study medication.\n5. History of prior malignancy, except for adequately treated in situ cancer, basal cell, squamous cell skin cancer, or other cancers (e.g., breast, prostate) for which the subject has been disease-free for at least 3 years. Subjects with prior cancer that is adequately controlled per the judgement of the Investigator will not be excluded from the study.\n6. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, psychiatric illness, or comorbidity that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for the study.\n7.
