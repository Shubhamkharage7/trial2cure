Early research on physical activity variety has observed increased physical activity participation, motivation, and enjoyment as a result of physical activity variety. However, previous studies examining variety have not included home-based interventions, objective measures of physical activity, or cardiovascular fitness classes.\n\nForty low-active college students will be randomly assigned to either an eight-week physical activity variety intervention (n=20) or a physical activity consistency comparison condition (n=20). Physical activity will be assessed via an accelerometer (e.g., Actigraph) at baseline and eight weeks, and psychosocial variables at baseline, four weeks, and eight weeks (i.e., post-intervention). Affect will be assessed at one, four, and eight weeks. Participants will receive counseling sessions and access to a website containing workouts appropriate to their condition."
