            "briefSummary": "The study team developed an uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) protocol that preserves lungs for just over 3 hours after death using positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and supplemental oxygen. The study will assess lung uDCD program safety by continuous review of operations/clinical records from each case activation and transplantation. Attrition outcomes include rates of initial and continued lung preservation, donation authorization, lung recovery, passing ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) performance testing, and lung transplantation. Planned viability assessments also include macroscopic determination, radiology (X-ray), and fiber optic bronchoscopy before initiating EVLP. We expect \\~50% of lungs assessed with EVLP will be transplanted to meet sustainability targets. Safety outcomes include the primary outcome, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) grade III at 72 hours, and secondarily survival one year after transplantation."
