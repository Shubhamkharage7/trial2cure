Surveys following each session include closed and open-ended measures: six items rating how well the session conveyed core information (e.g., I am confident I can communicate more effectively \\[Session 3\\]; I have a better understanding of the effects of alcohol on making sexual choices, \\[Session 4\\]) and single-item scales to evaluate the facilitator's performance and the session overall. In open-ended measures, respondents will be prompted to elaborate on their survey responses to identify ways the session could be improved."

Each discussion group will consist of 12- 15 participants and each cycle will consist of one group. Participants will be asked to complete a follow up survey and two booster sessions.
