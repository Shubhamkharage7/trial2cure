Radiotherapy and temozolomide will be administered 7 to 10 days after the first administration of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Temozolomide will be administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day during the concomitant period, concurrently with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy will be delivered at a dose of 2 Gray (Gy)/day, 5 days per week followed by 2 days of rest, for 6 consecutive weeks with a total dose of 60 Gy (without interruption). During the maintenance period, there is an intra-patient dose escalation in temozolomide treatment. The dosage of temozolomide is 150 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 of maintenance period, and then to 200 mg/m2 in Cycle 2 and beyond in the maintenance period, if 150 mg/m2 temozolomide treatment is well tolerated in Cycle 1.\n\nEligible participants with recurrent glioblastoma will be assigned to Group 3 and will receive \\[177Lu\\]Lu-DOTA-TATE as single agent treatment every 3 weeks +/- 2 days.\n\nAn infusion of sterile 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each \\[177Lu\\]Lu-DOTA-TATE dose for renal protection."
