            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) can objectively measure changes in the tumor/vertebral body and adjacent spinal cord following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for painful metastatic spine disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Metastatic spine disease (MSD) can result in considerable morbidity from pain, spinal cord compromise and neurologic disability. Recent developments in image-guidance and immobilization have enabled more accurate target localization, which allows methods of precise high-dose radiation delivery such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT carries potential risks of radiation induced myelopathy (RIM) and vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive imaging modality that may be able to detect radiation-induced damage in the vertebral body or spinal cord following SBRT. Quantitative MR-based imaging methods may also help to quantify treatment response and help predict subsequent outcomes such as tumor control and VCF risk."
