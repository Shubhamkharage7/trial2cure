            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies the effectiveness of a group curriculum in improving survivorship outcomes in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. Many AYA survivors typically do not feel prepared to re-enter \"daily life\" and would likely benefit from structured interventions to offer education and support in a timely manner as to prepare them for the challenges of life in survivorship. A 6-week group curriculum, designed to specifically meet the needs of AYA cancer survivors and facilitated by licensed social workers, may meet the unique needs of young adults who have survived a cancer diagnosis, and if so, the curriculum could be licensed and used across Mayo Clinic sites and potentially at other cancer centers nationwide.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Social workers will develop a curriculum to facilitate psychoeducational, skill-based, and process-oriented group for patients who have entered survivorship.\n\nII. To determine if a specific 6 weeklong psychoeducational, skill-based, and process-oriented peer group curriculum results in improved quality of life for adolescents and young adult cancer survivors.\n\nIII. To demonstrate the feasibility of this curriculum to address the needs of this population.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants attend an online group facilitated by two oncology social workers and receive information regarding coping with cancer survivorship as a young adult, as well as discuss survivorship issues/concerns with peers."
