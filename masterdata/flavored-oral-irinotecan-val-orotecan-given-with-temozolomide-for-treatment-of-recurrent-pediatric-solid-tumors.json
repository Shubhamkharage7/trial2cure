            "briefSummary": "A pilot pharmacokinetic trial to determine the safety and efficacy of a flavored, orally administered irinotecan VAL-413 (Orotecan\u00ae) given with temozolomide for treatment of recurrent pediatric solid tumors including but not limited to neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, hepatoblastoma and medulloblastoma",
            "detailedDescription": "Up to 20 patients \u2265 1 year of age or \u2264 30 years of age with recurrent pediatric solid tumors will be enrolled. During the first cycle of treatment, each patient will receive 4 daily doses of VAL-413 (Orotecan\u00ae) and one daily dose of the intravenous preparation of irinotecan taken orally (IRN-IVPO), together with 5 days of concurrent temozolomide. During all subsequent cycles, only Orotecan\u00ae will be given with temozolomide in 5 day courses administered every 21 days as tolerated.\n\nThe dosing regimen in this study will be Temozolomide at 100 mg/m2/day with Orotecan\u00ae at either 90 or 110mg/m2/day, administered orally for 5 consecutive days at the beginning of every 21-day cycle. A single dose of IRN-IVPO will be substituted at the same dosage as Orotecan\u00ae during Cycle 1. Up to 17 cycles of treatment may be administered on this study.\n\nData collected from this study will allow for an assessment of Orotecan\u00ae safety and efficacy. Interval medical histories, targeted physical exams, complete blood counts, and other laboratory and safety assessments will be performed at Day 1 of each treatment cycle for all study subjects. At baseline and during study, disease status will be assessed by appropriate clinical and imaging evaluation (CT, MRI, or PET) and using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) for patients with neuroblastoma, or the Children's Oncology Group Response Criteria for CNS tumors. In addition, a single-response taste survey will be conducted on Day 1 and Day 4 of the first cycle, which will allow patients to evaluate the taste of Orotecan\u00ae. Serum samples will be collected at various time points on Days 1 and 4 during Cycle 1 to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of Orotecan\u00ae and conventional irinotecan given orally.\n\nAssessment of first-cycle toxicity will be used to identify the recommended phase II dose for Orotecan\u00ae. Toxicity will be evaluated and documented using NCI CTCAE guidelines. The recommended Phase II dose will be identified as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences a first cycle dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Additional study subjects may be enrolled at the recommended Phase II dose to ensure balanced safety and pharmacokinetic data is obtained for at least 3 patients \\< 12 years old and at least 3 patients \\> 12 years old."

Platelet count \u2265100,000/\u00b5L (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions within a 7-day period prior to first study treatment)\n11. Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 gm/dL (may receive RBC transfusions) NOTE: Patients with metastatic tumor in the bone marrow ARE eligible provided the above hematologic criteria are met.\n12. Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR \u2265 70mL/min/1.73 m2 or Serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n    Age Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Male Female 1 to \\< 2 years 0.6 0.6 2 to \\< 6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to \\< 10 years 1 1 10 to \\< 13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to \\< 16 years 1.5 1.4\n\n    \u2265 16 years 1.7 1.4\n\n    The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula for estimating GFR (Schwartz et al. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utilizing child length and stature data published by the CDC.\n13. Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) \u2264 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n14. SGPT (ALT) \u2264 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n15. Serum albumin \u2265 2 g/dL\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., more than simple rash) to dacarbazine or third-generation cephalosporins are ineligible.\n2. Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to potential risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events. A pregnancy test must be obtained prior to starting chemotherapy in post-menarchal female patients.\n3. Patients who are currently receiving investigational drugs, or who have received an investigational drug within the last 7 days prior to first study treatment, are ineligible.\n4. Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are ineligible.\n5. Patients taking strong inducers of CYP3A4, including but not limited to phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), rifampin, voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or other systemically-administered azole antifungal drugs, aprepitant (Emend) or St. John's Wort, in the 2 weeks prior to first study treatment are ineligible.\n6. Patients taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 in the 1 week prior to first study treatment are ineligible.\n7. Patients must not be receiving medications known to inhibit platelet function or known to selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase activity. Medicines in this class are excluded, with the exception of acetaminophen.\n8. Patients who have uncontrolled infections, require IV antibiotics at time of enrollment, or who are currently receiving treatment for Clostridium difficile infection are excluded.\n9. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.",
