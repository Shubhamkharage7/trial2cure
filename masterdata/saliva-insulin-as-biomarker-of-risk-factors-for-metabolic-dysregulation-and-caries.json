Public health programs may justify adding saliva collection to protocol already in place if saliva insulin data are found to be actionable, i.e. sensitive to risk and intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized controlled trial explores if saliva insulin is responsive to the kinds of obesity and caries intervention currently in progress in schools, namely drinking water intervention.\n\nThe specific aims of this randomized controlled trial are to:\n\nDetermine if the standard serving (500 ml) of drinking water normalizes saliva insulin to a greater extent, within 60 min, than no beverage or a standard serving (200 ml) apple juice in elementary school age children.\n\nDetermine if, in line with lower saliva insulin, 500 ml drinking water significantly alters macronutrient metabolism, within 60 min, relative to no beverage or 200 ml apple juice.\n\nDetermine if 500 ml drinking water reduces caries risk factors, improves saliva osmolality, pH, buffering capacity and immune response to a greater extent, within 60 min, than no beverage or 200 ml apple juice."
