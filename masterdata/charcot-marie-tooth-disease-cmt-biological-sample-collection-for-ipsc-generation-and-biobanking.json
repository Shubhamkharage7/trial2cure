            "detailedDescription": "Researchers at the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) Research Institute study diverse diseases, conditions, and traits by creating stem cells from biological samples. These \"pluripotent\" stem cells can become any cell in the human body, including cells that may be difficult, invasive, or impossible to obtain directly.\n\nAdditionally, researchers perform genetic testing to learn more about DNA, a material in most cells that contains instructions for the body's development and functions (such as traits like eye color and risk of certain diseases). A piece of DNA that determines the specific role of a cell is called a \"gene.\" If the instructions in a gene are abnormal, this can lead to disease.\n\nParticipation in the study involves: (1) completion of health questionnaires, (2) providing a skin and/or blood sample from which stem cells may be created, (3) collection of a saliva sample for genetic analysis, and (4) possible future followup to provide additional information or learn about other research studies.\n\nThis study is not a clinical trial."
