            "briefSummary": "Hypoglycemic complications are a major impediment to the maintenance of healthy glucose levels in persons with diabetes. The investigators recently completed a clinical pilot and feasibility study (GLIMPSE, NCT02690168), which identified a novel biomarker, glial acetate metabolism, that appears to predict the susceptibility to hypoglycemia. By providing an assay to predict hypoglycemic events and therefore diabetic complications, the development of this biomarker could significantly improve the treatment of persons with diabetes.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of our biomarker for predicting susceptibility to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In order to accomplish this goal the investigatiors will pair our 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy procedure to assess glial acetate metabolism, developed in the GLIMPSE study, with a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp procedure, developed in the HYPOCLAMP study (NCT03839511). The two procedures will be separated by a three day interval. The investigators will then correlate the participants' rates of glial acetate metabolism with their neuroendocrine responses to the hypoglycemic clamp. This proof of concept study will test the hypothesis that glial acetate metabolism is inversely proportional to the neuroendocrine response to hypoglycemia, that is, as glial acetate metabolism increases the neuroendocrine response will decrease."

A second catheter will be placed retrograde in a dorsal vein of the contra-lateral hand for blood withdrawal. The hand will be placed in a heating box or pad at 70\u00b0C for arterialization of venous blood. A primed infusion of regular insulin (120 mU/min/m2) will be initiated and continued for approximately 2 hours. Beginning 20 minutes prior to the start of the insulin infusion, arterialized venous blood glucose will be measured at 5 minute intervals via a Hemocue or YSI analyzer. Following initiation of insulin infusion, blood glucose will be allowed to fall to 50 mg/dL and then maintained at this level using a variable infusion of exogenous dextrose (20% solution). Our goal is to achieve steady-state (blood glucose stabilized at 50 +/- 5 mg/dL) within the first 45 minutes following the start of insulin infusion.",
