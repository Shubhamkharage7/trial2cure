            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the safety and feasibility of cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific CD19-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in combination with the CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) triplex vaccine following lymphodepletion in treating patients with intermediate or high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment (refectory). CAR T cells are a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added in the laboratory. The special receptor is called CAR. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. Vaccines such as CMV-MVA triplex are made from gene-modified viruses and may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving CMV-specific CD19-CAR T-cells plus the CMV-MVA triplex vaccine may help prevent the cancer from coming back.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess the safety and describe the toxicity profile of anti-CD19-CAR CMV-specific T-lymphocytes (CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cells) as monotherapy and when given in combination with a multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine (CMV-MVA Triplex) following standard of care lymphodepletion.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of autologous CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cell manufacturing, as assessed by the ability to meet the required cell dose and product release requirements.\n\nII. Estimate the overall and complete disease response rate at days 28 and 84 after CAR T cell infusion.\n\nIII. Determine short- and longer-term CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cell in vivo expansion and persistence.\n\nIV. Assess whether the CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cells respond to CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine.\n\nV. Estimate the rate of CMV reactivation after CAR T cell. VI. Estimate the one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and median overall survival (OS) post-CAR T cell infusion.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess whether the CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cells respond to CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine when administered to participants that received CAR T cells only in the safety lead-in portion in the expansion phased of the study (i.e., once safety of the CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine is established in the feasibility portion of the study).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cells followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients undergo leukapheresis on day -30 and receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy on days -10 to -3 per standard of care (SOC) on study. Patients then receive CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cells intravenously (IV) on day 0 and CMV-MVA triplex vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on days 28 and 56 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity on study. Patients also undergo x-ray during screening and on study, as well as positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood sample collection, and bone marrow biopsy on study and during follow-up."
