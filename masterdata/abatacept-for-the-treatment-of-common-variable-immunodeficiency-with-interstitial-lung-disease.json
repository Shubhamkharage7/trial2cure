Abatacept is a recombinant, human fusion protein of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and human IgG1 that blocks T cell activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking CD28 engagement- the \"second signal\" needed for T cell activation. Abatacept has recently looked promising for the treatment of patients with complex CVID.\n\nThis study is a multi-site, phase II, randomized, blinded/placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric subjects \u226550 kg and adult subjects (cohort 1), with an additional cohort (#2) of pediatric subjects \\<50 kg tested as a single arm, receiving open-label abatacept. Cohort 1 utilizes a 'delayed-start' design to obtain maximum statistical power from this cohort. Cohort 2 will be open label due to the lack of a suitable placebo for pediatric dose abatacept syringes. A total of 21-30 evaluable subjects will be treated in cohort 1 and 8 evaluable subjects in cohort 2."
