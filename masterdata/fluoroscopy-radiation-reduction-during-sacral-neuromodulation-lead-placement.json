Placement of the lead in the operating room with fluoroscopy is the standard of care in this procedure. Fluoroscopy is performed with a C-arm and there are settings that change the radiation exposure. Patients scheduled to undergo lead placement will be randomized to: a) the investigational (reduced radiation with fluoroscopic settings) or b. the control (conventional fluoroscopy).\n\nThe surgeon can change fluoroscopy radiation exposure by changing C-arm settings from the reduced radiation to conventional fluoroscopic options. During the surgery, the surgeon may change the settings from reduced radiation (intervention) to conventional fluoroscopy (control) to safely place lead. The surgeon will use their judgment to optimally place lead and maintain safety during placement. Any deviation from randomization will be recorded.\n\nThe intervention arm is defined: Reduced radiation fluoroscopy technique is performed by the C-arm set at 1 pulses-per-second and reduction of current.\n\nThe control arm is defined: The standard of care in the conventional fluoroscopy, the C-arm is set at 30 pulses-per-second and the current set at the default."
