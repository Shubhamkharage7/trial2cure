            "briefSummary": "Brain-Physical Optimization Conditioning (B-POC) aims to enhance physical performance by expanding the traditional focus of endurance training from purely physical training to the domain of cognitive endurance (Staiano et al., 2015; Dallaway et al., 2017). The current study seeks to isolate neurocognitive mechanisms of performance, particularly under high stress (e.g., physical or cognitive load) conditions, and to develop corresponding cognitive optimization tools.",
            "detailedDescription": "Brain-Physical Optimization Conditioning (B-POC) aims to enhance physical performance by expanding the traditional focus of endurance training from purely physical training to the domain of cognitive endurance (Staiano et al., 2015; Dallaway et al., 2017). B-POC uses an acute mentally fatiguing task during routine exercise with the aim of optimizing the effects of physical endurance (e.g., aerobic exercise). B-POC differs from other types of cognitive training by increasing the cognitive demands of a specific concurrent task rather than teaching a cognitive strategy and relying on task transfer effects. Similar to strengthening a muscle, cognitive trainings may be one means of increasing Soldier's cognitive capacity and improving performance (Walton et al., 2018)."
