To characterize epithelial cell phenotypes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and in lung transplant recipients at Houston Methodist who have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood samples and 3 brushings of the airway during standard of care (SOC) bronchoscopy. After the bronchoscopy, patients undergo 2 nasal brushings (swabs). Patients' medical records are also reviewed for data collection.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year."
