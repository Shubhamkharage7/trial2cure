STEMVAC may wake up the immune system in patients who have had a diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer and have been treated. STEMVAC targets proteins that are expressed on breast cancer cells and works by boosting the immune system to recognize and destroy the invader cancer cell proteins that are causing the disease. The purpose of this trial is to test the immune system's response to STEMVAC.",

Patients then receive STEMVAC vaccine with sargramostim ID booster injections 3 months after the 3rd vaccination and 6 months after the 1st booster vaccination.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, and then annually for 5 years."
