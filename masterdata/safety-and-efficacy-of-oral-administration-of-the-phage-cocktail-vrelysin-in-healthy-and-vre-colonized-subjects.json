            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine if VRELysin is safe and effective in adults in a continuous Phase 1/2a trial. Phase 1 will asses the safety of VRELysin in healthy adults, while Phase 2a will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VRELysin in adults colonized with VRE in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nVRELysin is a collection of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages (or phages) are viruses that infect only bacteria. The phages in VRELysin infect a specific type of bacteria called Enterococcus, which can cause gastrointestinal infections. VRELysin is intended to significantly reduce or eliminate vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) levels in the human gastrointestinal tract, which in turn, may prevent subsequent infection as well as nosocomial spread."
