Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis - Magnetic Resonance imaging (TMEM-MRI) has the ability to detect tumor areas with more leakiness (perfusion), where cancer cell enter blood vessels to travel to other sites. This novel TMEM-MRI has potential to be used in clinical practice to identify tumors with high leakiness that might have higher chances to recur after breast cancer treatment. In addition, TMEM-MRI can potentially be used to assess response to preoperative treatments (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy) over time."
