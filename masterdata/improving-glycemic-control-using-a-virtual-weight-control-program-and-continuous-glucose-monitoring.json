            "detailedDescription": "This study is a 12-month, two-arm, parallel controlled trial. Up to 396 adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes will be randomized to either 1) intervention, or 2) usual care. The intervention arm will participate in the WW program modified for people with T2D including weekly Virtual Workshops and use of the WW App plus FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose sensors. The WW program is a widely available, commercial weight management program that encourages healthy habits in the areas of food, activity, mindset, and sleep, with topics specific to diabetes. Participants in the usual care arm will receive their normal, usual care from their healthcare providers in addition to a session with a Registered Dietician at baseline. All participants will participate in the collection of patient-reported outcomes at baseline and at 6 and 12 months."
