            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a combination of art therapy (AT) and physical therapy (PT) to PT only in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Each child will receive daily AT and PT or only PT for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. These sessions will begin approximately on day 15 following the transplant. Prior to starting the sessions and following 2-weeks of sessions, self-care and mobility skills will be measured. During each session, the following variables will be measured: heart rate variability (i.e., time between heart beats) using a small monitor on the chest (about the size of a quarter), walking distance using an accelerometer (similar to wearing a watch), and self-reported happiness and excitability. Although results cannot be guaranteed, it is expected that each group will benefit and demonstrate improvements in emotional state, self-care, and mobility skills.",
            "detailedDescription": "This quantitative randomized clinical trial will examine the effect of a collaborative art therapy (AT) and physical therapy (PT) intervention as compared to a PT only intervention in children undergoing a hematopoietic cell transplant. We hypothesize that physiological, emotional, selfcare, and mobility as measured by heart rate variability, Self-Assessment Manikin, walking distance and steps, and Pediatric Disability Inventory Computerized Adapted Test will demonstrate greater improvement for the AT and PT group as well as identify media that more effectively impact these physiological and health outcomes. Findings from this project may provide scientific evidence for increasing the uptake of AT and PT in children undergoing HCT."
