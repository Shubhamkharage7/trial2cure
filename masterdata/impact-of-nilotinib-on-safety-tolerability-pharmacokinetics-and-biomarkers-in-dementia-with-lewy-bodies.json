            "briefSummary": "Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is an alphasynucleinopathy and the second most common form of dementia in the elderly. DLB shares striking neuropathological and clinical similarities with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nilotinib (Tasigna\u00ae, AMN107, Novartis, Switzerland) is approved by the FDA and is well tolerated for CML treatment at oral doses of 600-800mg daily. The Investigators propose to perform a phase II randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study to evaluate the impact of Nilotinib in patients with DLB.",

Sixty ( 60) participants will be recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo (arm 1) or 200 mg Nilotinib (arm 2).This study will be conducted in DLB patients with 2.5\u2265Hoehn \\& Yahr\u22643 and UPDRS I-III \u226450 and 15\u2265UPDRS III (motor) \u226540 (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score)and MoCA\u226518(Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Eligible participants must be stable on MAO-B inhibitors (Rasageline or Selegeline) for 4 weeks and must not be on \u2265800mg Levodopa daily. Participants must be stable on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and other medications for at least 6 weeks. Participants will be treated for 6 months and monitored every month ( 4 weeks) in a total of 9 visits that include screening , baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months follow up and 7 month washout. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected at baseline and at 6 months to determine Nilotinib effects on CSF biomarkers."

St. John's Wort and the concomitant use of strong other CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) must be avoided since these agents may reduce the concentration of Nilotinib.\n5. Abnormal liver function defined as AST and/or ALT \\> 100% the upper limit of the normal\n6. Renal insufficiency as defined by a serum creatinine \\> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal\n7. History of HIV, clinically significant chronic hepatitis, or other active infection\n8. Females must not be lactating, pregnant or with possible pregnancy\n9. Medical history of liver or pancreatic disease\n10. Clinical signs indicating syndromes other than DLB, including, PD, PD with Dementia (PDD), corticobasal degeneration, supranuclear gaze palsy, multiple system atrophy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, signs of frontal dementia, history of stroke, head injury or encephalitis, cerebellar signs, early severe autonomic involvement, Babinski sign\n11. Current evidence or history in past two years of epilepsy, focal brain lesion, head injury with loss of consciousness or DSM-IV criteria for any major psychiatric disorder including psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse\n12. Evidence of any significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that renders the participant unsuitable for receiving an investigational drug including clinically significant or unstable hematologic, hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, metabolic, renal or other systemic disease or laboratory abnormality\n13. Active neoplastic disease, history of cancer five years prior to screening, including breast cancer (history of skin melanoma or stable prostate cancer are not exclusionary)\n14. Contraindications to LP: prior lumbosacral spine surgery, severe degenerative joint disease or deformity of the spine, platelets \\< 100,000, use of Coumadin/warfarin, or history of a bleeding disorder\n15. Must not be on any immunosuppressant medications or IVIG\n16. Must not be enrolled as an active participant in another clinical study",
