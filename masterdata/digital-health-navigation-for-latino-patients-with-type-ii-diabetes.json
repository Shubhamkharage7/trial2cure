            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about digital literacy training in adult, Latino patient with type II diabetes. The main question it aims to answer is: Can providing digital literacy training during a hospital admission can help patients with their after-hospital care by using the patient portal and telehealth? Participants will receive digital literacy training by a digital navigator that focuses on the main patient portal functions. Researchers will compare patients who receive digital literacy training to those who receive standard of care (educational sheet) to see if it impacts their use of the patient portal after discharge.",
            "detailedDescription": "Latinos have the second-highest age-adjusted prevalence and among the highest incidence of diabetes. Latinos also experience worse glycemic control and diabetes-related complications, including diabetic retinopathy and chronic renal disease. These findings are concerning since Latinos are the largest minority group in the U.S and will account for 25% of the population by 2045.\n\nDigital tools, like patient portals and telemedicine, offer an opportunity to address some of the challenges that lead to these disparities, especially during care transitions. However, Latinos, especially those who are Spanish-speaking are less likely to use digital health tools. Findings from previous health information technology work have highlighted barriers, including 1) digital access and literacy, 2) interface usability, 3) privacy, and 4) patient preference. One promising intervention to address digital literacy gaps is the use digital navigators.\n\nThis study aims are to assess a digital health navigation intervention focused on increasing patient portal use after discharge among Latino patients with type II diabetes admitted to the general medicine inpatient floor."
