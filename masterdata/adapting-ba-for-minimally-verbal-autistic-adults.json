This procedure includes an intervention development group (IDG), for which MV autistic adults and their supporters (i.e., someone identified as a source of support they can work with) will be recruited. Aim 2. During the following phase of the project, a feasibility trial will be conducted. Using the treatment manual and study procedures adapted and refined in phase 1, the trial will examine the feasibility and acceptability of BeatIt-MV."
