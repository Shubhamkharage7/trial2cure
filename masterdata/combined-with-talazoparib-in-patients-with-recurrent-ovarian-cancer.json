ZEN003694 (and developed by Zenith Epigenetics Ltd.) has shown promising activity in the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic (blood) cancers by reducing the multiplication of cancer cells. Talazoparib is an extremely effective drug being developed for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. Talazoparib kills cancer cells by inhibiting and trapping the enzyme PARP, which is known to be involved in the development of many types of cancers. These two drugs are not FDA approved in the treatment of ovarian cancer."
