            "briefSummary": "We have developed a questionnaire to elucidate the dosing, frequency and indication for the use of emicizumab in patients with Hemophilia A (mild, moderate or severe) ages 0-3 years. We are also collecting data on any pre-, peri and post surgical practices while on emicizumab. More importantly, we are asking if pediatricians are planning to introduce factor 8 to children who are already on emicizumab for primary prophylaxis as well as how and when they are planning to do so. We hope that this data will help inform understanding of current use of emicizumab in infants and young children as a form of primary prophylaxis, especially when venous access has historically been a limiting factor.",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be a multi-institutional, retrospective review of pediatric patients ages 0 to 36 months of age who are currently receiving and/or have received emicizumab-kxwh as part of their treatment for hemophilia A with or without inhibitors. Participating sites are part of the New England Region (plus New Jersey and New York-Region II) of hemophilia treatment centers. Currently 11 out of the 23 regional centers have committed to collaborating on this study (Appendix A). Each institution will be contributing subjects who have been treated or who are currently being treated with emicizumab, from October 4th, 2018 up to the point of IRB approval. Additionally, each institution will determine the best way to identify eligible patients and keep track of patients enrolled in the study. The Children's Hospital at Montefiore will be the coordinating center."
