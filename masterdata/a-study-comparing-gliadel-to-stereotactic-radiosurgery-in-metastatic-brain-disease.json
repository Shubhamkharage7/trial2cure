Subjects with prior radiation, lymphoma, small cell, germ cell, unknown primary, or anaplastic thyroid diagnoses will be ineligible. Life expectancy should be greater than 3 months.\n\nSubjects will be randomized at the time of surgery to 1) GLIADEL placement at the time of resection or 2) SRS post-operatively to the resection cavity. Any other tumors (up to three) will have SRS as their primary treatment after surgery. SRS will take place within 6 weeks from surgery.\n\nSubjects will be evaluated pre-operatively with MRI brain and neuropsychological testing and will have immediate post-op MRI for extent of resection (EOR) determination. Subjects will have SRS to the resection cavity if no GLIADEL was placed and all will have SRS to any other lesions. They will be followed at set intervals to evaluate for local recurrence and neurocognitive changes. The genome of the metastatic brain tumor will be compared to their primary and germline for identification of alterations."
