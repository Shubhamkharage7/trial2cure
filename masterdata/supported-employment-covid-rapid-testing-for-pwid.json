The program is called Peer Connect2Test (PeerC2T). PWID will be recruited by a community partner who provides syringe exchange services. PWID will the trained by the community partner to become peer health workers (PHW) to distribute SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests to other PWID. Investigators expect that PeerC2T will improve knowledge, self-efficacy, and health behaviors among PHW (Aim 1). The study will use the RE-AIM framework in Aims 2 and 3 to evaluate whether PeerC2T improves SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake among other PWID (RE; Aim 2), and identify intervention considerations (AIM; Aim 3). The overall goal of this project is develop a transformative community-driven intervention in partnership with a community partner to promote widespread access to rapid testing among PWID."

The effect of the training on the Peer Health Worker themself will be evaluated (Aim 1). In addition, in Aim 2 they will distribute the rapid test kits in places of residence such as tents, shelters, apartments, trailers, or houses or locations where other PWID frequently engage with services such as syringe exchange. The kit is the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self Test, which is approved to be used as a lateral flow immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2. PWID community members will be offered a free test kit, and the Peer Health Worker will record whether the community member elected to take the test (yes/no), and they will also collect administrative demographic data on the PWID.",
