Genotype Characterization\n2. Cross-Sectional Phenotype Characterization (within gene)\n3. Establish a Link to My Retina Tracker Registry (MRTR)\n4. Ancillary Exploratory Studies - Pooling of Genes\n\nNatural History Study Objectives\n\n1. Natural History (within gene)\n2. Structure-Function Relationship (within gene)\n3. Risk Factors for Progression (within gene)\n4. Ancillary Exploratory Studies - Pooling of Genes",
            "detailedDescription": "This study includes multiple phases.\n\n1. Screening Phase\n\n   The patient's current genetic report will be reviewed. Genetic testing will not be performed in this study. A prior conclusive genetic test will be assessed for screening analysis. Having at least one gene on the RD Rare Gene List meets one of the eligible Genetic Screening Criteria and other eligibility criteria can be evaluated based on medical history.\n2. Genetic Screening Phase:\n\n   Genetic reports for participants enrolled into the genetic screening phase will be uploaded to study website for review and confirmation by Central Genetics Auditor (CGA) as meeting Genetic Screening Criteria.Participants confirmed as meeting those criteria will be considered enrolled into the Registry.\n3. Registry Phase:\n\n   The flow of participants who are enrolled into the Registry depends on whether their causal gene is designated as a Natural History Study (NHS) Target Gene. If they are not Designated as NHS Target Gene, they will receive annual phone calls up to 48 months from the Registry/Screening visit or until the gene is designated as NHS Target Gene. If they are Designated as NHS Target Gene participants will be considered pending enrollment into the NHS.\n\n   The Registry will establish genetically and clinically well-characterized cohorts of patients across hundreds of genetic variants associated with retinal dystrophy (RD). Characterization of these patients will accelerate eligibility screening for the Natural History Study, provide cross-sectional data on phenotype-genotype associations, and contribute to our knowledge of pathogenicity of these rare disease-causing variants.\n4. Natural History Study (NHS) Phase\n\nParticipants pending enrollment will return to the clinic for the NHS Enrollment/Baseline Visit and return to the clinic for follow-up visits.\n\nThe Natural History Study will accelerate the identification and development of sensitive, reliable outcome measures for clinical trials, which will facilitate development of treatments for retinal dystrophies due to disease-causing genetic variants. The expected impact of the Natural History Study is as follows:\n\n1. Describe the natural history of retinal degeneration in patients with rare disease-causing genetic variants\n2. Identify sensitive structural and functional outcome\n3. Identify well-defined subpopulations for future clinical trials of investigative treatments for rare inherited retinal degeneration"
