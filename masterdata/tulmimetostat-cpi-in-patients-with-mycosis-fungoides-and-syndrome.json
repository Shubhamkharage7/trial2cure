Infections (e.g., urinary tract infection) controlled on concurrent antimicrobial agents and antimicrobial prophylaxis per institutional guidelines are acceptable.\n* Current known active or chronic infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. All patients will require serologic testing to be performed within 6 months prior to C1D1.\n\n  * Patients with chronic HBV or HCV are defined as patients with positive hepatitis B serology: Patients with a negative HBsAg and a positive HBcAb require an undetectable/negative hepatitis B DNA test (e.g. polymerase chain reaction \\[PCR\\] test) to be enrolled, and will require prophylactic antiviral treatment initiated prior to the first dose of study drug, and continued until approximately 6 to 12 months after completion of study drug(s).\n* Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\>10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 7 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, steroids for physiologic or adrenal replacement doses \\<10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) and use of these agents does not require a washout period. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. Topical steroids for cutaneous manifestations of MF/SS will be permitted as per below:\n\n  * Continued use of select concomitant topical steroids is permitted if the patient has remained clinically stable for at least 4 weeks. Patients who are on low or moderate potency topical corticosteroids may participate if they are on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before enrollment. Local injections of corticosteroids are acceptable; all corticosteroids will be reported as concomitant medications. Patients prescribed prednisone 10 mg PO daily or less (or equivalent) will not be excluded.\n* Ongoing treatment with other immunosuppressive agent including, but not limited to, methotrexate, azathioprine, anti-TNF agents, etc. with the exception of steroids.\n* Clinically active or symptomatic chronic liver disease.\n* Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition or any important medical or psychiatric illness or abnormal laboratory finding that would, in the investigator's judgment, increase the risk to the patient associated with his/her participation in this study.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to first dose of study drug.",
