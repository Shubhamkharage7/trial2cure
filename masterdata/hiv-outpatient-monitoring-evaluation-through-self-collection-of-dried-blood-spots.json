            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to establish an operational framework for home self-collections of blood samples to be used for antiviral drug concentration measurements.\n\nParticipants will continue on their prescribed antiviral(s) for HIV treatment or prevention and followed for up to approximately 1 year. The investigators will compare drug concentrations of antivirals and relevant metabolites/anabolites in clinic-collected and self-collected blood samples.",
            "detailedDescription": "Up to 150 people receiving care at the UCH-IDGP will be enrolled in the study at a routine clinic visit where a standard of care (SOC) blood collection and/or SOC dose of LA antivirals (e.g., LA IM CAB\u00b1RPV) is planned. Once consented, demographic and clinical data will be obtained. Clinical data that will be collected from participant and medical records may include: age, sex at birth and gender identity, race, ethnicity, medication history, duration of current antiviral therapy, hematocrit, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV VL, and self-reported adherence.\n\nThe investigators will collect an extra \\~5 mL of blood in EDTA by venipuncture for DBS, plasma, whole blood, and blood cells at each clinic-collection visit. At the first clinic-collection visit, participants will be given home self-collection kits and instructed to self-collect samples at various timepoints prior to their next injection (if on LA antivirals), monitored by live video-streaming or time-stamped video. The investigators will go through how to self-collect, handle, and mail the blood samples by self-collecting together in the clinic (in-person training), and participants will be asked about their medical history and medications.\n\nParticipants on PO antivirals (e.g., TFV/FTC) may only complete one clinic-collection visit (and one at-home self-collection). At home self-collections and clinic-collections may continue for participants on LA antivirals (e.g., LA IM CAB\u00b1RPV) for up to approximately 1 year. All study visits will be linked to SOC visits; there will be no additional visits to the clinic beyond what is already required for SOC:\n\n* If continuing prescribed Q8W injections, up to 7 SOC clinic visits at (approximately) weeks 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48\n* If initiating prescribed Q8W injections, up to 7 SOC clinic visits at (approximately) weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44\n* If continuing or initiating prescribed Q4W injections, up to 13 SOC clinic visits at (approximately) weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48\n* If continuing or initiating prescribed Q26W injections, up to 3 SOC clinic visits at (approximately) weeks 0, 26, and 52\n\nParticipants will be asked to self-collect samples at home by two or more methods (self-collection kits): fingerstick and spotting onto Whatman 903 protein saver card, and/or use of one or more self-collection devices (e.g., Tasso-M20/Tasso+, Mitra, others). After sample collection, samples/devices will be shipped back to our laboratory in their provided box(es). All samples obtained by self-collection methods/devices are approved for shipping via mail or other carriers in the US. Participants may complete up to 25 at home self-collections (approximately once biweekly for the participants followed longitudinally)."
