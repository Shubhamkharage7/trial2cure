            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to learn if the prototype adjustable prone positioning frame is a feasible design for use during neurosurgical procedures which utilize intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI). The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the prototype prone positioning device design feasible for use during neurosurgical procedures which utilize intraoperative MRI?\n* Does use of the prototype device place the patient at increased risk of complications compared to the standard positioning pads? Researchers will place patients in the prone position on the prototype device during neurosurgical procedures that utilize intraoperative MRI and observe for any problems with the positioning device or complications attributable to the positioning device.",
            "detailedDescription": "Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) ablations are neurosurgical procedures which are performed for several indications including brain tumors and epilepsy. LITT procedures are performed utilizing intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Some of these procedures must be performed in the prone position and can last 8 hours or longer. Investigators have observed several minor skin breakdown complications as well as a few major thromboembolic complications during these long prone procedures. Investigators hypothesize that the cause of the major thromboembolic complications are a result of compression of the femoral veins by the gel pads used to support the patient in the prone position. Many long spine surgeries are performed in the prone position and fewer episodes of skin pressure wounds are experienced and no major intraoperative thromboembolic complications. The study team hypothesizes that the difference is the way that the spine surgery pads support the hips does not compress the femoral vein, therefore significantly decreasing the risk of developing a thrombus intraoperatively.\n\nThe aim of this project is to design a modular, adjustable plastic frame to support the spine surgery Jackson table chest and hip pads. Investigators will produce a prototype of the frame and test it during LITT procedures. The prototype of the frame will be 3D printed using the 3D printer owned by the Department of Neurosurgery. The hypothesis is that supporting the patient in the prone position using similar positioning methods to those used for spine surgeries will reduce the rate of skin pressure injuries and prevent future major thromboembolic complications."
