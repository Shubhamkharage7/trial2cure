Researchers want to collect samples from people with respiratory virus infections. The samples in this natural history study will be used in future research.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo obtain samples from people with respiratory viruses to learn more about respiratory virus infections and the immune responses against them.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 3 and older who have or are suspected to have a respiratory virus infection.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical record review.\n\nParticipants will give blood samples. Data from their medical records will be collected.\n\nParticipants will give nose samples. A soft plastic strip will be put into each nostril for a minute. They may also give nose, mouth (back of the throat), or saliva samples using swabs.\n\nParticipants may receive kits by mail to collect nose and blood samples at home. They will use soft plastic strips to collect nose samples. To collect blood, they will prick their finger and dab a few drops of blood on four plastic tips.\n\nIf a participant is in the hospital, air samples may be collected in their room.\n\nParticipation will last for up to 2 years. After 2 years, participants may be asked for their consent again to give new samples and new medical data.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nRetrospective and prospective samples from participants will be obtained to isolate respiratory viruses for use in laboratory assays, animal experiments, development of challenge virus, and development of vaccines. Samples will also be obtained to study respiratory virus-associated systemic and mucosal immunity and virus characteristics.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo isolate human respiratory virus specimens and maintain them in a repository for future use in laboratory assays, animal experiments, development of challenge viruses, and development of vaccines, described in a separate protocol.\n\nStudy Population: 1-200 (for each virus species/strain) adult and child participants aged 3 years and above with suspected or documented respiratory infection for a maximum of 20000 participants total. The total number of subjects enrolled will depend on the prevalence of infection with each virus/strain and on the geographic distribution of infections.\n\nDescription of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:\n\nNIH Clinical Center (CC).\n\nStudy Duration: 10 years"
