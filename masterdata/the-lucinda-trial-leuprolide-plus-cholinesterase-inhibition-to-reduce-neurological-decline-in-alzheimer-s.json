Its objective is to assess the efficacy of a 48-week regimen of leuprolide (22.5 mg per 12 weeks) compared to placebo on cognitive function, global function and plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers.",
            "detailedDescription": "This project aims to re-purpose the safe and well-tolerated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue Leuprolide Acetate for use in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Leuprolide Acetate is currently used in adults for prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and in preparation for in-vitro fertilization, and in children for central precocious puberty. The purpose of this study to confirm and extend results from a prior phase II study (Bowen et al, 2015) which demonstrated that Leuprolide halted cognitive and functional decline in a subgroup of women with mild-moderate AD who were also taking the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. Objectives are to replicate, in the same subgroup, Leuprolide's clinical EFFICACY in this prior trial and to add neuroimaging and plasma BIOMARKERS that will help elucidate Leuprolide's likely multiple mechanisms of action in AD. These mechanisms include decreasing levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) based on extensive preclinical evidence that decreasing LH preserves cognition and decreases amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation in animal models of AD, as well as new evidence that GnRH analogues may have anti-inflammatory effects."
