Investigators believe the intervention group will demonstrate improved treatment engagement and access to all treatments compared to controls. The second aim is to explore whether START leads to functional improvements across home, social and academic domains for the child and family. Investigators believe the intervention group will show better functioning including improved family and peer relationships and reduced parent stress compared to controls.\n\nBefore taking part in our study all participants will undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Eligible participants will be randomized to START while controls receive a pamphlet with ADHD information. Students and staff with related experience who are not mental health professionals will be trained to deliver START. START includes 6 modules, typically delivered over 6 sessions."

Developmental, adolescents and preschoolers are considerably different than school age children and may require a different approach for engaging them and their parents in ADHD care. Children under 6 with ADHD symptoms may not yet be diagnosed and may not have the same treatment access or options as children 6 and over. Adolescents over 12 are more independent and an intervention may need to be more focused on the adolescent than our current intervention which is primarily parent focused.\n* Children who were diagnosed over 3 months ago and already received treatment for ADHD will be excluded since our primary outcome is treatment engagement.\n* Because this is an intervention only available in English at this time, participants who are not able to complete study procedures in English will be excluded.",
