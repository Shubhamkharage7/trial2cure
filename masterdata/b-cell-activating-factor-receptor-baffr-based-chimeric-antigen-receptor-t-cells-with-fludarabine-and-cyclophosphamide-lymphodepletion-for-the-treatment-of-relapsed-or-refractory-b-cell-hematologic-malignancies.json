            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests safety, side effects and best dose of B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFFR)-based chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion, for the treatment of patients with B-cell hematologic malignancies that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory). BAFFR-based chimeric antigen receptor T-cells is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, helps ill cancer cells in the body and helps prepare the body to receive the BAFFR based chimeric antigen receptor T-cells. Giving BAFFR based chimeric antigen receptor T-cells with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for lymphodepletion may work better for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of (MC10029) autologous BAFFR-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells following lymphodepleting (LD) therapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory BAFFR expressing B-cell hematologic malignancies.\n\nII. To determine the recommended dose for phase 1b (dose expansion) and recommend phase 2 dose.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy and antitumor activity of MC10029 in subjects with relapsed or refractory BAFFR-expressing B-cell hematologic malignancies.\n\nII. To determine long-term toxicities in MC10029 recipients. III. To determine feasibility of manufacturing success rate of MC10029.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MC10029 in peripheral blood samples. II. To study the relationship between BAFFR expression and clinical activity of MC10029.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo leukapheresis. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV), over 60 minutes and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on day -5 to -3 or bendamustine IV over 10 minutes on days -4 and -3. Patients receive BAFFR based chimeric antigen receptor T-cells IV on day 0. Patients undergo echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening, computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, bone marrow biopsy/aspirate and blood sample collection throughout the study and tumor biopsy at progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients followed up at day 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, 14, 21, 28, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365, 545 and 730 and then periodically for up to 15 years."
