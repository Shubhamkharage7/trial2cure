            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a Thoracic Specimen Registry at Mayo Clinic. The purpose of the registry will be to support ongoing research in the etiology, early diagnosis, clinical management, and prognosis of lung cancer and other cancers and diseases of the thorax by developing a complete repository of specimens from patients with thoracic disease including but not limited to suspected lung cancer, mediastinal and pleural tumors, lung transplants and from patients at a very high risk of developing other thoracic cancers or other thoracic diseases. Collected specimens will include peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, pleural fluid, tissue (surgical resections \\& biopsies) and touch prep samples. The specimens will be stored in a central location at Mayo Clinic and managed by the Mayo Clinic Thoracic Specimen Registry Steering Committee. The registry will be a foundation for the development and implementation of research protocols and clinical trials that will enhance current knowledge of etiology and detection, discovery of new molecular and biochemical markers for screening, early diagnosis, and develop state-of-the-art therapeutic and preventive interventions for managing patients with, or at risk for, thoracic cancers or other thoracic diseases."
