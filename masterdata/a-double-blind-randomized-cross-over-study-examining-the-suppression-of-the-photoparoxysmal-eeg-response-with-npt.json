Subjects will be screened to ensure they have a stable PPR. Subjects will then return for 3 treatment visits, each lasting 1 day, with minimum 14-day washout period between visits. Subjects will be randomized to a treatment sequence in order to receive NPT 2042 (160 mg or 240 mg) or matching placebo on each treatment day. The PPR will be measured at predose (-0.5 hours) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours postdose. The PPR of the active treatments will be compared to the placebo response."

Subject has a clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, will exclude the subject from the study.\n4. Subject has an active central nervous system (CNS) infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease, or any CNS disease deemed to be progressive during the course of the study that may confound the interpretation of the study results.\n5. Subject has any clinically significant psychiatric illness, psychological, or behavioral problems which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n6. Subject has clinically significant active liver disease (i.e., liver function tests greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), porphyria, or has a family history of severe hepatic dysfunction.\n7. Subject has a history of alcoholism, drug abuse, or drug addiction within the past 12 months.\n8. Subjects who have participated in any other trials involving an investigational product or device within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever is longer) of Screening.\n9. Subject is currently using of any prohibited medication, food or supplement\n10. Inability of the investigator to reliably distinguish between spontaneous and provoked spike-wave burst discharges.\n11. Subject uses a benzodiazepine as rescue medication within 24 hours of screening. If, in the judgment of the investigator, the subject meets all of the inclusion and none of the other exclusion criteria, rescreening may be done after appropriate wash-out period. If no other rescue medications have been used within the past month, the subject may be eligible for rescreening.\n12. Subject has more than one use of rescue medications in the past 30 days.\n13. Subject has a history of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in the past 6 months or more than one lifetime suicide attempt.\n14. Subject is unable to complete ingestion of 12 placebo SGCs with a minimum of 8 ounces of water at screening.\n15. Subject has a clinically significant medical condition that would interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the study (e.g. active cancer, cardiac disease, renal insufficiency, or active infectious processes).",
