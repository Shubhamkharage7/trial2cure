To date, there are no diagnostics capable of detecting bladder cancer early, that is prior to clinical presentation. Because of this severe limitation, nearly 30% of patients initially present with stage 2 and higher bladder cancer. Stage 2 bladder cancer has a 5-year survival of 50%, while stage 3/4 have a 5-year survival of \\<20%. Ideally, bladder cancer would be preventable. Unfortunate, this has not come to fruition. If these stage 2-4 bladder cancer cases could be detected at Stage 1 (5-yr survival \\>94%), then its possible to see an improvement in bladder cancer survival rates (21-23).\n\nin this study, a urine-based diagnostic that possesses the potential to accurately identify patients who harbor bladder cancer prior to clinical manifestation will be tested."
