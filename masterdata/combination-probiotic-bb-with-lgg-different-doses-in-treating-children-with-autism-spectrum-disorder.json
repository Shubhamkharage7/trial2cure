The study is being conducted in order to assess safety and tolerability of the probiotic (BB-12 with LGG) at 2 different doses of BB-12 with LGG. Identifying effects on behaviors in healthy children with ASD using SRS-2 and ABC, GI symptoms using GI symptom severity index, and relevant biomarkers of inflammation, microbiota, and metabolites. Primary testing and procedures will be conducted at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Memorial Hermann.\n\nBiomarker identification includes Integrative analysis of plasma metabolome and stool microbiota will be conducted with the collaboration of Dr. Ruth Ann Luna and Dr. Jim Versalovic at Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research, Department of Molecular Virology \\& Microbiology of Baylor College of Medicine."
