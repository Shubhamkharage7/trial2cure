During Aim 1, the Northwestern research team will solicit opinions from key informants (patients, clinicians, practice administrators) to ensure PATTERN meets the needs of primary care.\n\nAim 2: Assess the PATTERN intervention's feasibility and acceptability for use in primary care. During Aim 2, the investigators will conduct a 2-arm, patient-randomized controlled trial at a Northwestern Medicine primary care practice. Participants will be recruited and randomly assigned, using a random number generator application, to either the PATTERN intervention or usual care. Usual care refers to the normal standard clinical practices at the participating practice. Participants will be followed for 6 months."
