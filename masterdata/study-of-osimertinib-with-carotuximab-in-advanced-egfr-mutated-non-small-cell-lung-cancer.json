Safety and tolerability will be measured by the number of dose-limiting toxicities, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5, to find the maximum tolerated dose. The secondary objectives include evaluating the rate of objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and disease control rate, along with assessing biomarkers through tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA."
