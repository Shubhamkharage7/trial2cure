This study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with an oral combination of THC/CBD will reduce agitation hospice care-eligible patients with agitation and dementia as measured by the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) when compared to placebo at 2 weeks.\n\nThis study will enroll approximately 150 participants of any gender at least 40 years of age who are hospice care-eligible with agitation and dementia (HAD). Participants will be randomized (50:50) to either active study drug (T2:C100) or placebo.\n\nThe double-blind period of this study is 12 weeks. A 12 week optional open-label extension will be offered to participants who complete the double-blind period."

The participant interviews that are a part of the mADCS-GGIC are not feasible in this study population and have been eliminated in the CGICa in favor of standard administration across all participants.

Score of 12 or more according to the Advanced Dementia Prognostic Tool (ADEPT) as implemented by the Mitchell Index.\n7.

In the opinion of the site PI, has a study partner (may be paid or unpaid caregiver) able and willing to provide accurate information about the participant, oversee the administration of study drug, and participate in study visits and informant-based assessments (usually requires at least 5 hours of contact per week).\n\n    NOTE: Other knowledgeable informants/informed caregivers may contribute to informant-based scales; however, the site should identify an informant who will be able to serve as the primary source of information.\n11.

Use of cannabinoids or other forms of marijuana in the 3 weeks prior to Baseline, as based on self-report.\n2.
