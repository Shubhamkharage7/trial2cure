This study will be comparing the IRRAflow\u00ae system to standard of care catheters used in the same procedure. The IRRAflow\u00ae system is FDA approved for this procedure.",
            "detailedDescription": "Intracranial hemorrhagic conditions can rapidly cause brain damage and often considered life- threatening. Of these, Intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke and is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality than all stroke subtypes.\n\nManagement of hemorrhagic patients is typically orchestrated by neurosurgeons and neuro-intensivists. Comprehensive care should include surveillance and monitoring of Intra Cranial Pressure (ICP), Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP), and hemodynamic function. Furthermore, prevention of infection, complications of immobility through positioning and mobilization within physiological tolerance play an important role in optimizing outcomes after ICH.\n\nThere are multiple approaches to facilitating Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) drainage and monitor ICP. Routinely, intracranial pressure is measured by use of devices inserted into the brain parenchyma or cerebral ventricles. A Ventricular Catheter (VC) inserted into the lateral ventricle allows for drainage of CSF to help reduce ICP. Although CSF drainage is a vital sequence in patient management, there are reported risks including infection and limitations related to erroneous readings associated with current ICP monitors. Physicians lack the appropriate tools to employ active intermittent aspiration and drainage with continuous ICP monitoring.\n\nThe current clinical study is being initiated to evaluate the hypothesis that active irrigation by IRRAflow will reduce the time needed for clearance of intraventricular blood from intraventricular space."
