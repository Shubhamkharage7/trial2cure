            "briefSummary": "This study is a 12-week randomized active control trial that is investigating the effects of Carnipure(R) AAS on muscle hypertrophy, body composition, and muscular strength adaptations in healthy men performing a resistance training program.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will enroll approximately 45 healthy males (18-40 year old and BMI 18.5-35kg/m2), who are recreationally trained and not presently taking any ergogenic nutritional supplements. Only male subjects will be selected to limit variability in lean mass at baseline as this is the primary variable of interest.\n\nThis study will be a 12-week exercise intervention, and will require experienced scientific staff for supervision of subjects. Below are a list of measures to be taken at 0, 6, and 12 weeks.\n\nPrimary Measures: these measures will be taken at time 0, 6, and 12-weeks post treatment\n\n* Body composition (Lean and Fat mass) as determined by DXA Secondary Measures: these measures will be taken at time 0, 6, and 12-weeks post treatment\n* Pectoral muscle thickness quantification via ultrasonography\n* Bench press strength\n* Muscle endurance (measured by reps to failure at 50 % 1RM assessed 5 minutes post strength testing)\n* Full body strength as assessed by isometric mid thigh pull\n* Lower body power as measured by a dual platform ground reaction force plate\n\nExercise Intervention The exercise intervention will be a 12-week periodized strength training program designed to promote muscle hypertrophy and enhance muscular strength. The 12-weeks will be divided into three 4-week mesocycles in which participants will perform the same exercise routine for 4-weeks before progressing to the next 4-week mesocycle. Participants will train 2x/week with 72-hours of rest between sessions to ensure adequate recovery. All training sessions are designed to last 45-60 minutes (including warmup) and all training sessions will be supervised by a certified personal trainer to ensure proper execution and safety. Two to three minutes of rest will be provided between each set to optimize training adaptations."
