            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a comprehensive intervention that combines breastfeeding support with a diabetes prevention-based program (DPP) on postpartum weight retention and lactation duration among women with pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity. This intervention, named eMOMS, is delivered by a certified health coach via a mobile health (mHealth) application.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a combined breastfeeding, diabetes prevention-based program (DPP) in a cohort of overweight or obese women to be followed during pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. The trial will have two study arms: DPP + breastfeeding (Tx1) and Usual Care (Tx2).\n\nAim 1: Quantify interest in use of the DPP-lactation mobile health (mHealth) application among target population. To accomplish this, we will: (1) measure research engagement including rates of screening, recruitment, and retention among users, especially rural and racially/ethnically diverse women; (2) assess barriers/facilitators to enrollment/retention through surveys and semi-structured in-depth interviews or focus groups; and (3) evaluate intervention uptake, delivery, and adherence via tracking/measuring use of the mHealth app.\n\nAim 2: Measure weight loss and duration of lactation through 3 months postpartum among target population. To accomplish this, we will measure pre-pregnancy weight, weight at study entry, weight immediately prior to and after delivery, and weight at specific postpartum time points. Lactation and infant feeding practices will be measured at similar postpartum time points."
