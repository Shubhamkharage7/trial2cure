            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this protocol is to obtain clinical information and facilitate the collection and distribution of specimens obtained during the course of clinical care or research participation.\n\n* Blood, buccal swabs, urine or tissue or other body fluids (including stool) may be specifically acquired for research in order to perform molecular and other types of analyses for research purposes.\n* These materials will be collected from all eligible participants who have a precursor lesion or an increased risk of cancer\n\nIt is expected that about 5,000 people will take part in this research study."
