The goal is to explore the capability of performing a remote, international AR simulation for the purpose of assessing NTS during a neonatal medical crisis. Simulation experts in the United States will facilitate the AR simulations with anesthesiology residents in Chile. The medical simulation itself is grounded in traditional best practices in accordance with the American Heart Association and Neonatal Resuscitation Program."
