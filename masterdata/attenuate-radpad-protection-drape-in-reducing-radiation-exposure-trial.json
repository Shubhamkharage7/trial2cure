Up to 1,000 patient-cases and up to 100 proximal operator-subjects expected to be enrolled across 1 site. The proximal operator cohort is expected to include a few interventional cardiologist attending physicians, interventional cardiology fellows, cardiovascular disease fellows and physician assistants performing multiple cases each, which in total would amount to 1,000 cases performed by 100 proximal operators. The primary outcome of interest was relative exposure of the proximal operator between the guideline directed radiation protocols and RADPAD use vs. guideline directed radiation protocols alone."
