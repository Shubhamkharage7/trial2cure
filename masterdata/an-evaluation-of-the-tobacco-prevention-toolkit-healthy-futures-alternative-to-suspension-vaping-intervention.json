The investigation aims to estimate the extent to which Healthy Futures: Alternative-to-Suspension changes high school student's knowledge of, attitudes towards, intentions to use, and actual use of tobacco/nicotine.",
            "detailedDescription": "Youth who use tobacco/nicotine products on school campuses are often detained, suspended, or expelled. Healthy Futures: Alternative-to-Suspension is an online curriculum that uses principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, incorporating a restorative practice and trauma-informed lens.\n\nThe goals of the study are three-fold: (1) Assess changes in the perspectives of school administrators, educators, counselors, and health staff around the feasibility, acceptability, and usefulness of implementing Healthy Futures: Alternative-to-Suspension as an appropriate and effective response to tobacco use on campus (including versus suspension or expulsion); (2) Assess high school students' acceptability and perceptions of Healthy Futures: Alternative-to-Suspension; and (3) Estimate the extent to which Healthy Futures: Alternative-to-Suspension changes high school students' knowledge of, attitudes towards, intentions/susceptibility to use, and actual use of tobacco/nicotine products. The Stanford REACH Lab and California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) will partner to evaluate Healthy Futures: Alternative-to-Suspension using a school-based randomized waitlist-controlled trial in 20 high schools in California (n = 10 Healthy Futures: Alternative-to-Suspension treatment schools and 10 control schools)."
