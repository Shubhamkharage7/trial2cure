            "briefSummary": "This research study is exploring the use of genomic sequencing in the newborn period to screen healthy babies for current and future health risks. The study will enroll a diverse cohort of 500 healthy infants and their parents from Boston, MA; New York City, NY; and Birmingham, AL. A small blood sample will be collected from each infant, and whole genome sequencing will be performed in 1/2 of the cohort following a randomized controlled trial design. 3 months later, the randomization status and sequencing results will be shared with parents and pediatricians. Investigators will study the medical, behavioral, and economic outcomes of genomic sequencing to better understand how this technology can be implemented in outpatient primary care settings.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this research protocol is to assess the impacts of genomic sequencing in healthy infants from ethnically and racially diverse communities as part of routine pediatric care.\n\nInvestigators will enroll a cohort of 500 healthy, ethnically and racially diverse infants from Boston, Massachusetts; New York City, New York; and Birmingham, Alabama, with planned expansion to other U.S. cities and recruitment sites. As part of this study, a stakeholder board comprised of diverse community members will provide early and regular feedback throughout the study on anticipated and ongoing community reaction to the work with sensitivity to historical injustices and cultural diversity\n\nPrimary care pediatricians from each recruitment site will be enrolled for a brief genomics education curriculum. Only infants whose healthcare providers have joined the study will be enrolled.\n\nA small blood sample will be obtained from each enrolled infant. Participants will randomized (1:1) to receive either a family history report or a family history report plus whole genome sequencing.\n\nGenome sequencing data will be analyzed for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in genes associated with childhood-onset disease risks, as well as highly actionable adult-onset disease risks. If infants have a dominant risk identified, parents may choose to be screened as part of the study.\n\nThe study team will disclose the infant's randomization status and study results during a consultation with each family, and results will be sent to the infant's pediatrician.\n\nParents will be surveyed at three time points over the 12 months after enrollment: baseline, immediately post-disclosure (approximately 3 months after enrollment), and 6 months post-disclosure. Surveys will assess psychosocial impacts of newborn sequencing.\n\nChart reviews will be performed to assess the medical outcomes and healthcare utilization costs of newborn genome sequencing."
