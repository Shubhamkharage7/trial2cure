            "briefSummary": "Parkinson's disease affects all the nerve cells in the body, including the ones in the gut. The gut contains its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and can be thought of as a \"second brain\". This second brain can reflect what is going on in the actual brain. This study is being done to look for biomarkers, or early indicators of developing Parkinson's disease, in the microbiome and in the gut tissue taken during routine screening colonoscopy. People aged 45 and over who are due for their routine screening colonoscopy are eligible to participate.",
            "detailedDescription": "Parkinson's disease affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 65, but the time between disease onset and diagnosis can be many months or years. Interestingly, the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies in the brain can also be seen in the nerve cells in the gut. Parkinson's disease may begin in the gut, at least in some people. Unlike the nerve cells in the brain, the nerve cells in the gut are accessible through routine colonoscopy, and so can be obtained by minimally invasive biopsy for the study in the laboratory. In addition, there are links between gut microbes, including bacteria, and the development of Parkinson's disease.\n\nThis research study is being done to discover whether the pathology in enteric nerve cells and the types of bacteria in the gut can serve as an indicator of Parkinson's disease. The goal of this research is to develop a biomarker that could help in earlier diagnosis. It also aims to improve the understanding of the link between the gut and brain in Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends screening colonoscopy starting from the age of 45 for the prevention of colon cancer. The study requires only one visit, and study samples will be collected as part of a colonoscopy needed for routine care."
