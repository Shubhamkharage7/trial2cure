The investigators hypothesize that the addition of CA-4948 will reduce the rate of distant intracranial failure and reduce the need for subsequent radiation therapy. The investigators also propose that it will have a significant reduction in radiation necrosis and improve patient-reported symptoms and quality of life. This trial represents the first time an oral IRAK-4 inhibitor has been used in combination with aPD1 therapy in MBM and will yield valuable insight into its synergistic potential both in MBM and additional sites of metastases."

Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* Has a history of non-infectious pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, such that it is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the trial's requirements.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Unable to discontinue medications contraindicated to CA-4948 or pembrolizumab.\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.",
