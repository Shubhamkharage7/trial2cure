In individuals who have exercise in a cold environment, it is unknown how this skin warming influence tolerance to simulated blood loss and whether there is an optimal temperature to warm the skin up to in order to lower blood pressure (permissive hypotension).\n\nAfter an initial study visit to examine exercise capacity (Visit 1), participants will complete four trials (Visits 2 through 5) After exercise in a cold environment, participants will have cold skin temperatures (\\~82\u00b0F; Visit 2). Researchers will examine how increasing skin temperature to normal (\\~90\u00b0F; Visit 3), warm (93\u00b0F; Visit 4) and hot (95\u00b0F; Visit 5) influences arterial blood pressure and tolerance to simulated blood loss compared to when the skin remains cold.\n\nThis project will test the hypothesis that skin rewarming to \\~95\u00b0F lowers arterial blood pressure without impairing tolerance to simulated blood loss (lower body negative pressure; LBNP) relative to when the skin is kept cold (82\u00b0F).\n\nPrimary data include core and skin temperatures, arterial blood pressure and LBNP tolerance time. Secondary variables include skin blood flow and heart rate. After completing visit 1 first, all participants will complete visits 2 through 5 in a randomized order and participants are blinded. The order will be counterbalanced between participants."
