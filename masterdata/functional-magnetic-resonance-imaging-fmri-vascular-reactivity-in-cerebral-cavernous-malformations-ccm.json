Subjects who have contraindications to MRI such as harboring incompatible ferromagnetic objects implanted in the body.\n4. Pregnant women (screening for pregnancy will be performed by oral questionnaire. MRI is safe in pregnancy but the study will exclude pregnant subjects, as the effects of respiratory challenge cannot be predicted in such subjects. Since these effects are proportional to the stage of gestation, oral history will be sufficient to assure safety.)\n5. Prisoners.\n6. People unable to consent.\n7. People unable to participate due to prior neurological deficits.\n8. Subjects with underlying pre-existing pulmonary illness; such as asthma, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, will be excluded.\n9. Cognitively impaired and/or participants not able to speak English language will not be included in the study (This pilot study involves performing motor and verbal tasks while in the MRI, in addition to undergoing a respiratory challenge, that requires understanding instructions clearly.
