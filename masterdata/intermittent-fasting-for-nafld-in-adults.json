            "briefSummary": "NAFLD is a growing threat to public health. Currently, there is a significant need for highly effective treatments for NAFLD. Non-obese NAFLD (BMI\\<30kg/m2) is an increasingly recognized condition, sometimes described as \"lean NAFLD\". Intermittent Fasting (IF) may be uniquely beneficial in non-obese NAFLD. The purpose of this study is to identify non-pharmacologic, lifestyle-based methods of NAFLD treatment within non-obese adults.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which encompasses a spectrum from simple steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis and cirrhosis, is the leading cause of liver disease in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic therapies for NAFLD and NASH, and standard low-calorie diets are often minimally effective, difficult to adhere to and to maintain. Thus, continued investigation of strategies to treat NAFLD and NASH is greatly needed. Non-obese NAFLD (BMI\\<30kg/m2) is an increasingly recognized condition, sometimes described as \"lean NAFLD\". It is estimated that 10-20% of American and Europeans without obesity have this condition. There is a pressing need for the study of lifestyle interventions independent of weight loss to treat this important subset of NAFLD patients. This protocol aims to investigate the utility of time restricted, intermittent fasting (TRF) as a potential method. Adults with non-obese NAFLD are at risk of progression to end-stage liver disease and development of cardiometabolic disease. Intermittent Fasting (IF) may be uniquely beneficial in non-obese NAFLD. IF is characterized by periods of dietary restriction leading to metabolic production and use of ketones from adipocytes rather than hepatically-derived glucose.\n\nThe goal of this study is to learn if time-restricted, intermittent fasting can help reduce the amount of fat in the liver in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Ideally, this study will yield more information about time-restricted, intermittent fasting as a potential lifestyle-based treatment for adults with NAFLD and a body mass index (BMI) between 23-30 kg/m\\^2."
