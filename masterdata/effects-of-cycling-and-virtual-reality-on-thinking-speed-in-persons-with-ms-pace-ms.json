In this study, we will compare the effects of cycling alone to cycling with two different types of virtual reality. Participants will complete all three cycling conditions, one per week. We are studying these types of cycling because there are currently no effective treatment options to improve processing speed in persons with MS and combining exercise with virtual reality is a promising technique."
