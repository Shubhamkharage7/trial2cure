Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring steroid hormone in the brain that has been implicated in treating various psychiatric conditions. The investigators hope to learn the effects and safety of using pregnenolone in reducing irritability and sensitivity to sensory differences and improving social communication in individuals with autism. The investigators hope by studying the effects of pregnenolone in more detail, the investigators can design better ways to treat individuals with autism."
