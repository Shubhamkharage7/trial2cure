For all patients, blood will be drawn to ensure the blinding of the patients, the fistula will be evaluated and debrided, and then the internal fistula opening will be suture-closed, and a water leak test will be performed to ensure sealing. Following the water leak test, In the treatment arm, the patient's own coagulating blood will be applied into the entire fistula tract, allowing it to clot and serve as a provisional matrix inside the fistula tract. In the control arm, the blood sample will be discarded and saline will be applied to the fistula tract."
