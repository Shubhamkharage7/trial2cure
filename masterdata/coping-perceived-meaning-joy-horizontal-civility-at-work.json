            "detailedDescription": "Workplace incivility in the nursing profession interferes with the establishment of a culture of safety, places patient safety at risk, and erodes job satisfaction and a positive staff environment (Kile, Eaton, deValpine, \\& Gilbert, 2019). Contemporary research among nurses in Magnet and Pathway to Excellence-designated hospitals reflects that 'nurse coworker incivility is sporadic on average but varies considerably across nurses (Smith, Morin, \\& Lake, 2018). However, there needs to be more administrative focus and attention on nurses' work environments to support civil workplaces where the nurses focuses on and provide patient care (Smith et al., 2018). Hence, the proposed study aims to examine intra-organizational incivility, that is incivility 'originating from within the organization' (Cortina, Magley, Williams, \\& Langhout, 2001), and will examine nurses' intrapersonal resourcefulness to support or promote proactive self-management in a self-efficacious manner, thus ameliorating workplace incivility, dissatisfaction, and detrimental outcomes. For this study, nursing staff will include registered nurses and other para-professionals employed under nursing services. The para-professionals employed under nursing services are Mental Health Technicians (MHT), Patient Care Technicians (PCT), Surgical Technicians (ST), and Emergency Medical Services (EMS)."
