All subjects will receive a standardized approach consistent with the core set of recommendation from the Department of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Administration (VA) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Non-Surgical Management of Knee Osteoarthritis. Follow-up will occur over a 1 year period.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are gaps between actual clinical practice and published guidelines for management of knee OA. The VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines leaves open the question of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early referral to PT alongside the core set of management strategies for patients with knee OA. Prior studies have failed to include robust cost-effectiveness analyses to understand the policy implications of a recommendation to routinely refer patients with knee OA to PT in addition to implementing the core set of recommended management strategies. A comparative effectiveness parallel-group randomized controlled clinical trial examining these questions will be extremely informative for future updates of the VA/DoD Practice Guideline.\n\nThe core components of the clinical practice guidelines include education on nutrition and the role of obesity in OA, as well as the role of physical activity and exercise. The physical therapy component will be based on best current evidence, and consist of manual therapy, education for self-management, and exercise."
