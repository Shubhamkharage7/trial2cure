            "detailedDescription": "This is a First-in-Human (FIH), open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion, Phase I study of ABM-168, for the treatment of advanced solid tumors in adult patients.\n\nThe study consists of two parts:\n\nPart A: Dose escalation. The starting dose of ABM-168 is 0.5 mq po qd, and dose escalation will be guided by a \"3+3\" design. ABM-168 will be administered once daily on a continuous schedule. Each treatment cycle consists of 28 days.\n\nPart B: Dose Expansion. Expansion will be conducted in the adult patients with advanced solid tumors that carry either RAS, RAF or NF-1 mutations. There are two cohorts for Dose Expansion: Patients will be enrolled into either Dose Expansion Cohort 1 (EX1) or Dose Expansion Cohort 2 (EX2).\n\n* Cohort EX1: Patients enrolled will have preferred indications (i.e., melanoma, colon cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic carcinoma) who had confirmed RAS, RAF or NF-1 mutations and measurable lesion(s) at the beginning of the study. Patients with measurable brain lesions(s) which have metastasized are highly preferred.\n* Cohort EX2: Patients enrolled will have primary CNS (Central Nervous System tumors with confirmed RAS, RAF or NF-1 mutations.\n\nDose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated and managed per the pre-defined DLT criteria and rules specified in the protocol. MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) and/or RP2D will be determined based on the totality of safety, clinical pharmacokinetics, and efficacy data from all evaluable patients enrolled and in treated in both dose escalation cohorts and dose expansion cohorts. The RP2D (recommended phase II dose) could be the MTD, or alternatively a dose recommended by the SMC (Safety Monitoring Committee) if no MTD is determined in the dose escalation and/or dose expansion."
