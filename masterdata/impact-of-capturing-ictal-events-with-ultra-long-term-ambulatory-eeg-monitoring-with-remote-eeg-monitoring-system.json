The main questions it aims to answer are: \u2022 Can more seizure events be recorded in fourteen (14) days than can be recorded in three (3) days? \u2022 Do treating clinicians find clinical value in extended fourteen (14) - twenty-eight (28) days of EEG? Participants will wear a portable EEG device (REMI) for fourteen (14) to twenty-eight (28) days in their home/community setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective study to quantify Epitel's\u2122 Remote EEG Monitoring System's (REMI\u2122) ability to record electroencephalography (EEG) of seizure events in an ambulatory setting for extended periods (14 - 28 days). Patients presenting with questionable seizure characterization that are scheduling a conventional at home ambulatory EEG (Amb EEG) and who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be prescribed a REMI system.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the REMI system is able to record EEG data that clinicians can use to identify ictal events over extended periods, and that extended clinical EEG data is valuable in the diagnosis and treatment of seizure related symptoms."
