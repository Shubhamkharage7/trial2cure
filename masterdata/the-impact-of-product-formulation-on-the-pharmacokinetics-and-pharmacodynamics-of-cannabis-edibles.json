Healthy adults (N=40) will complete 9 drug administration sessions, including an overnight stay prior to each session. Participants will consume THC containing products in a fasted state; following drug administration, the participants will complete cognitive and psychomotor tasks, subjective assessments, have blood collected, and vital signs monitored.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 3 popular types of cannabis edibles: THC-infused chocolates, gummies, and drinks. This study will utilize a rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. Healthy adults (N=40; 20 males, 20 females) will complete 9 outpatient drug administration sessions in a randomized order. After 8 hours of monitored fasting, participants will consume 1 of 3 types of edibles (chocolates, gummies, or drinks) that are representative of current retail cannabis products. Products will contain 0 (placebo), 10, or 25mg THC. PD assessments include a battery of cognitive/psychomotor performance tasks shown to be sensitive to oral cannabis at these doses and subjective drug effects. Blood samples will be drawn to measure THC and its primary metabolites. Vital signs will be recorded. These procedures will be completed during each of the 9 study sessions."
