            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in treating patients with ovarian, uterine, appendiceal, stomach (gastric), or colorectal cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneal carcinomatosis). Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil, mitomycin, and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PIPAC is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The study device consists of a nebulizer (a device that turns liquids into a fine mist), which is connected to a high-pressure injector, and inserted into the abdomen (part of the body that contains the digestive organs) during a laparoscopic procedure (a surgery using small incisions to introduce air and to insert a camera and other instruments in the abdominal cavity for diagnosis and/or to perform routine surgical procedures). Pressurization of the liquid chemotherapy through the study device results in aerosolization (a fine mist or spray) of the chemotherapy intra-abdominally (into the abdomen). Giving chemotherapy through PIPAC may reduce the amount of chemotherapy needed to achieve acceptable drug concentration, and therefore potentially reduces side effects and toxicities.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in 3 groups of patients: peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) due to primary ovarian, uterine, or gastric carcinoma (Arm 1); PC due to primary colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 2).\n\nII. To evaluate safety of PIPAC and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PIPAC with MMC in patients with PC due to colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 3).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Ability to proceed to cytoreduction with/without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) (Arm 3 patients).\n\nII. Efficacy will be assessed by:\n\nIa. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), if available, version 1.1 via computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline (week 10, and 6 weeks after completing treatment; and at 18 weeks).\n\nIb. Peritoneal regression grading score (PRGS) via biopsy at each cycle (both pre-PIPAC and post-PIPAC peritoneal samples will be obtained).\n\nIc. Peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) at the time of laparoscopy. II. Post-operative surgical complications by Claven-Dindo classification evaluated at 4, 10, and 16 weeks (4 weeks after each PIPAC).\n\nIII. Progression-free survival. IV. PIPAC technical failure rate. V. Patient-reported health state/quality of life and symptoms before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 weeks as measured by the European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).\n\nVI. Functional status, as measured by the number of daily steps before and after treatments (Vivofit 4 wristband pedometer - Garmin Company).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Correlative/translational studies to characterize the tumor microenvironment, subclonal evolution, genomics, and pharmacokinetics of peritoneal tumors.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients with ovarian, uterine, or gastric cancer, undergo PIPAC with doxorubicin intraperitoneally (IP), followed by cisplatin IP. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients with colorectal or appendiceal cancer undergo PIPAC with oxaliplatin IP. For cycles 2 and 3, patients receive leucovorin intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and fluorouracil IV over 15 minutes 1-24 hours before undergoing PIPAC. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM III: Patients with colorectal or appendiceal cancer who have undergo at least 4 months (or 8 cycles) of first-line standard of care chemotherapy but have not progressed on second line chemotherapy undergo PIPAC with mitomycin IP. Patients also receive standard of care irinotecan IV over 90 on day 1, leucovorin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and fluorouracil IV on days 1-2 during weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, 14 and 16. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 3 years."
