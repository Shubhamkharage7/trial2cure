However, accounting for uncertainties in treatment delivery remains a challenge for a variety of reasons, such as differences in patient anatomy from pre-planning to the day of treatment. Online adaptive planning is a process consisting of generating the original pre-plan on the patient on a treatment day, assessing the pre-plan's coverage and safety, and if changes are needed, the plan is changed in order to optimize the treatment while the patient is still on the treatment table. This study is assessing the feasibility and safety of this approach in order to gather data for a larger trial."

Mixed histologies with a predominantly small cell component are also exclusionary.\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\n* Medical contraindication to proton therapy or any other condition that in the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist, renders the patient unfit for SBRT\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
