Additional Criteria for Participants With Normal Renal Function\n\n   - Current or past history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, metabolic, genitourinary, endocrine (including diabetes mellitus), malignancy (except for surgically excised non-melanomatous skin cancers or in situ cervical cancer, at the discretion of the investigator), hematological, immunological, neurological, or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, could compromise either participant safety or the results of the trial.\n3. Additional Criteria for Participants With Renal Impairment\n\n   * Evidence of disease that is not explained by current/known medical history, i.e., organ dysfunction (including malignancies) or any clinically significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent with renal impairment and other underlying conditions.\n   * Participants who have received an organ transplant or are currently waiting for an organ transplant and are listed on the national transplant list.\n   * Participants who require dialysis\n   * Participants with nephrotic syndrome.\n\nNOTE: Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.",
