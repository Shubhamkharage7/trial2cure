To accomplish this, the investigators propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of an advance care planning (ACP) video intervention (vs. usual care) among older patients with CKD.",
            "detailedDescription": "The video intervention consists of a video decision aid along with a video declaration (ViDec), which is recorded by the patient. The video decision aid explores ACP options for medical care for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and reviews hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, as well as medical management without dialysis; it also reviews cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Patients will also audio- or video-record their preferences using a tablet. The video will be shared with their nephrologist. The patient will have a copy of the video to take with them and share with their loved ones.\n\nPatients will answer survey questions about their preferences, knowledge, decisional conflict, and ACP engagement. They will be surveyed every two months for one year or death (if they die before one year).\n\nPotential participants will be recruited from 10 nephrology clinics: Massachusetts General Hospital (n=75), Brigham and Women's Hospital (n=75), University of Pittsburgh (n=75), University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, University of Washington, Renal \\& Transplant Associates of New England, University of New Mexico and Boston Medical Center."
