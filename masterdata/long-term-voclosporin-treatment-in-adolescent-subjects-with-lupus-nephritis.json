Subjects completing treatment in Group 2 of the VOCAL study who were receiving placebo will switch to receive open-label voclosporin initially at the same number of capsules as was being administered at the End of Study (EOS) Visit in VOCAL.\n\nAll subjects will continue to receive background therapy of MMF and oral corticosteroids starting at the same dose as at completion of the VOCAL study. When clinically indicated, subjects are permitted to be titrated off oral corticosteroids."
