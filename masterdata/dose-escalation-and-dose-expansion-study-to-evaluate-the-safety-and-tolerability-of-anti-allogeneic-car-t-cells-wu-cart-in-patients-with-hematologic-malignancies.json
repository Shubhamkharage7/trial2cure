            "briefSummary": "Effective treatment options for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) represent a significant unmet medical need. CAR T therapy has offered durable remissions and potential cures in some forms of hematologic malignancy, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In AML, however, CAR T approaches have been limited by the lack of suitable antigens, as most myeloid markers are shared with normal hematopoietic stem cells and targeting of these antigens by CAR T therapy leads to undesirable hematologic toxicity. Similarly, T-NHL has not yet benefited from CAR T therapy due to a lack of suitable markers. One potential therapeutic target is CD7, which is expressed normally on mature T-cells and NK-cells but is also aberrantly expressed on \\~30% of acute myeloid leukemias. CAR T therapy for patients with CD7+ AML and T-NHL will potentially offer a new therapeutic option which has a chance of offering durable benefit.\n\nWU-CART-007 is a CD7-directed, genetically modified, allogeneic, fratricide-resistant chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product for the treatment of CD7+ hematologic malignancies. These cells have two key changes from conventional, autologous CAR T-cells. First, because CD7 is present on normal T-cells including conventional CAR T products, CD7 is deleted from WU CART-007. This allows for targeting of CD7 without the risk of fratricide (killing of WU-CART-007 cells by other WU-CART-007 cells). Second, the T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) is also deleted. This makes WU CART 007 cells incapable of recognizing antigens other than CD7 and allows for the use of an allogeneic product without causing Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD)."
