Prior solid organ or bone marrow transplantation (except cornea transplantation).\n10. History of clinically significant cardiovascular events (e.g. DVT \u2264 6 months, PE \u2264 12 months, MI or hospitalization for CHF \u2264 12 months, bleeding disorder or bleeding event \u2264 6 months, current clinically significant arrhythmia or unstable angina pectoris, current uncontrolled history of cerebrovascular accident in the past 6 months, current uncontrolled hypertension).",
