For each yearly cohort, participants of each phenotype will be randomly selected, resulting in two groups classified as the (i) adaptive, and (ii) maladaptive phenotypes.\n\nUsing the R package SeqAlloc, a covariate-adjusted randomization will be employed to randomize each of these two groups into two subgroups; the subgroups within each group (phenotype) will be balanced by age and gender. Thus, this will result in the generation of four groups:\n\n(i) adaptive-A (ii) adaptive-B (iii) maladaptive-A (iv) maladaptive-B",

The PI also assures that the key design elements of this protocol will be posted in clinicaltrials.gov. Prior to any submission, all manuscripts/abstracts may be presented to Regeneron for review.\n\nBefore the clinical trial commences, the PI will discuss authorship with the study team. The published international guidelines for authorship (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 1997) will be adhered to; i.e., \"All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for the content.\"",
