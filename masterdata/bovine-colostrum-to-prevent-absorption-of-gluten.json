At the second and fourth visit, they will either take gluten with colostrum powder or with a placebo. Follow-up duration will be until three days after the last study visit.\n\nEach participant will be given daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (omeprazole 20 mg) at least one week before the first intervention, and for the entire duration of the study.\n\nEach participant will be invited to fill a celiac disease patient reported outcomes questionnaire (Celiac Disease Symptoms Diary) for the 24 hours prior the study intervention and three days after. Blood and urine samples will be collected during the 24 hours following each study intervention (gluten + colostrum or gluten + placebo)\n\nAdverse events will be recorded during the entire study from enrollment to termination (termination will occur 3 days after the second challenge at the end of the patient reported outcome (PRO) recording period)."
