A double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover design will be used to examine the dose-effects of THC (0, 5mg, 30mg) on oculomotor performance tasks and a sustained attention task in frequent and infrequent cannabis users. Results from the study will advance the investigators' understanding of the effect of THC and cannabis use frequency on oculomotor function and sustained attention, and will directly inform the validity of the investigators' oculomotor platform for identifying acute THC- induced impairment in frequent and infrequent users."
