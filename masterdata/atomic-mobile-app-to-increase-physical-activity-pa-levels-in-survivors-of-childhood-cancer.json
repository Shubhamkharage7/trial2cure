The Technology Assessment Model (TAM), which theorizes the individuals' intentions to use information technology, is based on two driving factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Future studies will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this app."

Use a \"talking aloud\" approach as they encounter issues with completing a series of tasks related to using the app. The design team and the research team will develop a new iteration of the platform that will then be vetted by our app creation committee and the next interview participants.\n3. \"Real Life\" Usability Testing. 6 pediatric cancer survivors. Individualized aerobic and resistance exercise intervention. The social-cognitive-theory-based mobile app will support the exercise intervention. One-on-one messaging chats with a PA coach through the mobile app will facilitate exercise goal establishment and attainment.",
