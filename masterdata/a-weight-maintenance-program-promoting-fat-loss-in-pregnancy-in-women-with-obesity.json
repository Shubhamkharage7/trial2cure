            "detailedDescription": "One hundred pregnant women with obesity who are otherwise healthy will be studied from early pregnancy until approximately 2 weeks postpartum. Major assessments will occur at baseline (13-16 weeks gestation), 27-29 weeks gestation, 35-37 weeks gestation, and approximately 2 weeks postpartum. Safety assessments will be collected every 4 weeks after enrollment. Participants will be randomized within site (approximately 50 individuals at Pennington Biomedical Research Center and approximately 50 individuals at California Polytechnic University) and obesity to either: Provider Directed Group or Weight Maintenance Group."
