To document prospective eye pathology in the above subjects Investigators will also conduct a Natural History Study (OCU400-104)i\n\nThis is a multicenter study, which will be conducted in two phases and will enroll up to a total of 24 subjects in the OCU400-101 and 100 subjects in the OCU400-104 study.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be conducted in two phases enrolling up to 24 subjects. Treated subjects will receive a single subretinal injection of OCU400 in the study eye.\n\nThis is a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging study in two subgroups of subjects with three consecutive cohorts.\n\nA total of 18 adult RP subjects from each of the following subgroups with Biallelic autosomal recessive NR2E3 mutations, autosomal dominant NR2E3 mutations or Autosomal dominant RHO mutations will be selected for dose escalation.\n\nFor the Phase I portion of the study, the 3+3 design for sequential dose-escalating cohorts will be used with scheduled 3 dosing levels between 9 and 18 subjects will be used to follow the design.\n\n3 adult LCA patients with CEP290 mutations and 3 pediatric subjects with RP and LCA, will be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion.\n\nSample Size Justification:\n\nThe trial will enroll up to 24 patients (18 adult RP, 3 adult LCA, 2 pediatric RP, and 1 pediatric LCA) in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 components.\n\nNatural History Study (OCU400-104, A Prospective and Retrospective Natural History Study of RP and LCA):\n\nThis is an observatory study for the prospective natural history of RP and LCA in adult and pediatric subjects. The study will also collect and review retrospective data and ophthalmology examination of natural history and progression of disease for all subjects starting with the earliest timepoint on or after the date of their diagnosis of RP or LCA."
