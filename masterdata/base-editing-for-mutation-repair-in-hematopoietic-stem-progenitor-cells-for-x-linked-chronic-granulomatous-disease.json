            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare immune disorder caused by a mutation in the CYBB gene. People with CGD have white blood cells that do not work properly. This places them at risk of developing infections that may be life-threatening. Stem cell transplant can cure CGD but transplanting stem cells donated by other people can have serious complications. In addition, not everyone has a matched donor. Another approach is a type of gene therapy that involves base-editing to correct the mutation in a person s own stem cells. Researchers want to know if the base-edited stem cells can improve the white cells' functioning and result in fewer CGD-related infections.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if base-edited stem cells will improve white blood cells' ability to fight against infections in people with CGD.\n\nEligibility:\n\nMales aged 18 years and older with X-linked CGD.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is a non-randomized study. Participants with the specific mutation under study will be screened during the initial phase.\n\nDuring the development phase, participants will undergo apheresis to collect stem cells for base-editing correction of the mutation.\n\nDuring the treatment phase, participants will receive the base-edited cells after chemotherapy with busulfan. Participants will remain in the hospital until their immunity recovers.\n\nFollow-up visits will continue for 15 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nOpen-label, phase 1/2 trial to determine the safety, and efficacy of a single infusion of base-edited (BE) autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for treatment of X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD). Base editing is performed to repair CYBB missense gene mutations (eg, CYBB c.676C\\>T). The study hypotheses are that 1) base editing can efficiently repair gene mutations in HSPCs; and 2) BE HSPCs can engraft and differentiate into functional phagocytes with restored nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity.\n\nDuring the initial development phase each study participant will undergo apheresis for CD34+ HSPC collection for the development and validation of a mutation-specific BE system.\n\nDuring the treatment phase, participants will receive a one-time infusion of the BE autologous HSPC Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) after busulfan (total 12 mg/kg) conditioning.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up evaluations at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, and yearly thereafter until 5 years after treatment. Key study assessments include adverse event (AE) assessment, blood laboratory evaluations of functional protein made from the target gene (CYBB, encodes for gp91\\^phox), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing to identify rates of gene repair and off-target mutation.\n\nThe final study follow-up under this protocol will be at 5 years, but long-term follow-up under a separate NIH protocol will continue annually to 15 years after treatment.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n* To evaluate the safety of BE autologous CD34+ cells.\n* To evaluate the efficacy of BE autologous CD34+ cells.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n-To evaluate:\n\n* Efficiency of base editing (percentages of target nucleotide conversion).\n* Engraftment capability of BE HSPCs.\n* Efficiency in restoring gp91\\^phox expression\n* Efficiency in restoring NADPH oxidase function.\n* Clinical efficacy.\n* Stability of gene correction.\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\n-To evaluate:\n\n* Specificity of base editing by assessing rates of off-target edits at top predicted sites.\n* Random off-target edits by whole genome sequencing (WGS).\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n* Safety of gene therapy using BE autologous HSPCs as measured by study agent-related AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) through 2 years after treatment.\n* Efficacy of gene therapy determined as percentages of subjects who have \\>= 10% oxidase-positive granulocytes at 12 months after infusion.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n* Determine frequency of converted target nucleotide alleles.\n* Assess the frequency of gene-modified alleles compared to infusion product in peripheral blood at 12 months.\n* Evaluate efficacy of restoring gp91\\^phox expression.\n* Evaluate efficacy of NADPH oxidase functional restoration as measured by the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry oxidase assay at 12 months after treatment (\\>=10% oxidase-positive neutrophils), or by quantitative measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the ferricytochrome C assay on peripheral blood granulocytes.\n* Evaluate clinical benefit by improvement of baseline clinical problems such as recurrent infections, growth failure, malnutrition, inflammatory bowel disease, or antibiotic usage.\n* Assess stability of gene correction by serial measurement of percent of nucleotide-converted alleles.\n\nExploratory Endpoints:\n\n* Evaluate specificity by assessing for off-target edits at predicted sites with high-throughput sequencing of the 5 most common candidate off-target sites identified by a comprehensive in vitro screen, Circularization for High-throughput Analysis of Nuclease Genome-wide Effects by sequencing (CHANGE-seq), in peripheral blood cells.\n* Determine rate of random off-target edits WGS."
