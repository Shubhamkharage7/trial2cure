            "detailedDescription": "The monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is crucial in head injuries and pathologies such as brain edema, arachnoid cyst, craniosynostosis or, in very-low-birthweight infants, post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Some current methods of ICP are invasive and, in the case of lumbar puncture, require anesthesia, which can distort the measurement by 5-10 mmHg. The golden clinical standard is direct measurement using a surgically-implanted intraventricular drain connected to an external pressure transducer (\"ICP probe\"). However, this method carries risks such as hemorrhage, malfunction, obstruction or infection . The risk in pediatric patients is up to 5% and in adults the risk of fatal hemorrhage is 4-5% in patients with subdural and intraparenchymal monitoring devices. Due to these risks and the financial burden on patients, there have been attempts to develop tools for non-invasive ICP estimation. This study will test the use of a video ophthalmoscope that will calculate the relative waveform of intracranial pressure and provide information about intracranial compliance without the use of anesthesia, invasive methods or contact with the eye."
