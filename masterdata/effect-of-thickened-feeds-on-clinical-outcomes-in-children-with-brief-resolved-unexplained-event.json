These common events are resource-intensive and current management approaches inadequately address persistent symptoms. Infants with BRUE commonly have oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration, which is a modifiable risk factor for persistent symptoms, but there are no studies determining the mechanism behind this swallowing dysfunction and if swallowing interventions reduce morbidity. This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of infants who experienced brief resolved unexplained event receiving thickened feedings compared to those not receiving thickened feedings over 1 year."
