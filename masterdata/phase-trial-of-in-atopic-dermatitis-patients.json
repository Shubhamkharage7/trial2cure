Escalation to the next dose level will be decided by the Safety Monitoring Committee(SMC) that will review all available safety data of the planned dose level within the timeline specified on SMC charter after all enrolled subjects of each cohort complete 2-week treatment and determine the escalation to the next dose to be safe.\n\nBased on the interim analysis for 4-week safety and efficacy data collected from Part 1, two doses will be selected for use in Part 2, which will enroll up to 177 subjects in 3 treatment arms (59 subjects per treatment arm) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HY209gel, compared to placebo (vehicle) for 8-week treatment period."
