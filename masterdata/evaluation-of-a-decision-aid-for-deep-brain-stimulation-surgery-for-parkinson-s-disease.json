The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the Decision Aid acceptable to patients with Parkinson's disease considering Deep Brain Stimulation surgery?\n* Does the decision aid improve decision quality (informed, value-based decision) and uncertainty about the decision?\n\nResearchers will compare immediate use of the decision aid during the evaluation process for deep brain stimulation surgery to delayed introduction of the decision aid.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Receive the decision aid at the beginning of the evaluation process or towards the end\n* Complete surveys at 5 visits (remote or in-person) over approximately 6 months"
