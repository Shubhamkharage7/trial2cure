DeBakey VA Medical Center and VA Connecticut Medical Center to determine if Patient Priorities Care reduces treatment burden, increases priorities-aligned home and community services, and sets shared health outcome goals compared with usual care. The investigators will randomize at the patient level rather than clinic or clinician level to evaluate the effect of identifying patient priorities on clinician decision making and alignment of care with identified priorities."

Varying block size makes the sequence of assignments more difficult to predict. The random numbers will be generated in SAS PROC PLAN.
