            "briefSummary": "There is established evidence that patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) may have altered antibiotic pharmacokinetics compared with non-CF patients. Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is a novel broad spectrum intravenous beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic with potent activity against multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including imipenem non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Relebactam has also been shown to restore imipenem activity in Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of opportunistic multidrug resistant pathogens that commonly infect patients with CF. This study will determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in 16 adolescent and adult patients with CF acute pulmonary exacerbations at one of seven participating hospitals in the US, with exploratory aim of reporting relative percent increase in FEV1 from pre- to post-treatment and return to baseline FEV1 after treatment with imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam for acute pulmonary exacerbations due to P. aeruginosa in patients with CF. Patients will receive a 10-14 day course of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, dosed according to renal function every 6 hours over 30 mins, with or without adjunctive aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone therapy per local hospital guidelines. Blood will be sampled during one dosing interval at steady-state (i.e. after at least 3 doses) to determine concentrations and pharmacokinetics of imipenem and relebactam. Relative change in pulmonary function will be assessed two weeks after end of therapy. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the duration of the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will receive 10-14 days of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam every 6 hours with dose determined per renal function, with or without adjunctive aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone therapy as determined by local study site. After receiving at least 3 doses (i.e. steady-state), a total of eight blood samples will be collected over one dosing interval to measure imipenem and relebactam concentrations. Data will be fit to a population pharmacokinetic model. The final model will be utilized in a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of several different dosing regimens retaining both (1) free imipenem concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for at least 40% of the dosing interval and (2) free relebactam area under the concentration-time curve at least eight times greater than the MIC. These data will be utilized to determine an optimized dosing regimen for adults and adolescents with CF. Additionally, two weeks after treatment, as part of the exploratory clinical endpoint, patients will complete follow-up pulmonary function tests to determine relative percent increase in FEV1 and return to baseline FEV1 after treatment. These outcomes will be reported descriptively."
