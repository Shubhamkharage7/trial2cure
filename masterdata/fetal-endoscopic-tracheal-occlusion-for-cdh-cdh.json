The study will enroll pregnant women that meet study criteria. Participants will have placement of FETO between gestational age at 27 weeks plus 0 days and 29 weeks 6 days. The timing for removal of FETO will ideally be between 34 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks and 6 days but ultimately decided by the Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment Center at UC Davis Medical Center.\n\nThis study requires that study participants live within 30 minutes of the UC Davis Medical Center in order to maintain weekly follow up appointments while the balloon is in place and up to delivery. Additionally, there are lifestyle considerations where participants would be unable to carry on normal daily activities including exercise and sexual intercourse, not be able to work the remainder of the pregnancy, as well as have a support person that is available to stay with such as a spouse, friend, partner, parent."
