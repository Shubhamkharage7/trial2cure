A diagnosis of hepatic dysfunction due to hepatocellular disease (and not secondary to any acute ongoing hepatocellular process) documented by medical history, physical examination (PE), liver biopsy, hepatic ultrasound, computerized tomography scan, or magnetic resonance imaging.\n* Cohort 2: Will only enroll healthy volunteers with no hepatic impairment. \"Healthy\" is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, complete PE (including blood pressure \\[BP\\] and pulse rate measurement), 12-lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests performed during Screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy). Uncomplicated cholecystectomy is allowed.\n* History of or current positive results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), including hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or hepatitis C Virus antibody (HCVAb).\n* Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the Investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for participation in the study.\n* Participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value of \u226430 mL/min/1.73 m2, based on the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation during Screening. A single repeat assessment is permitted to assess eligibility, if needed.\n* Previous administration of drugs or supplements known to be strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 within 7 days of planned dosing of obicetrapib on Day 1.\n* Concurrent use of drugs or supplements that are known substrates of CYP3A that have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl including transdermal patch, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus) within 12 days prior to planned dosing of obicetrapib on Day 1.\n* Participants on oral contraceptives and hormonal based contraceptives including implantable, intrauterine, intravaginal, transdermal or injectable form.\n* Previous administration of an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or within 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, prior to planned dosing of obicetrapib on Day 1.\n* Known hypersensitivity to obicetrapib or its excipients.\n* A positive urine drug test. Participants with moderate hepatic impairment (Cohort 1) will be eligible to participate if their urine drug test is positive with a drug for a prescribed condition that is not expected to interfere with the PK of obicetrapib. Positive urine drug tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) will be allowed as long as the volunteer agrees to abstain from ingesting any THC-containing products for the duration of the study (including Out patient visits up to Day 28).\n* Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more within 60 days prior to planned dosing of obicetrapib on Day 1.\n* History of sensitivity to heparin or a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\n* Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle considerations listed in the protocol.",
