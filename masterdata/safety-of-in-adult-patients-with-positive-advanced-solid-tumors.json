Subjects with multiple primary malignancies within 2 years, except adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ disease, other solid tumors curatively treated, or contralateral breast cancer);\n3. Cardiovascular dysfunction or clinically significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to:\n\n   * Medical history of symptomatic chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II-IV) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment;\n   * Medical history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months of the first treatment;\n   * Corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) prolongation of \\> 450 milliseconds (ms) in males and \\> 470 ms in females;\n4. Medical history of clinically significant lung disease (e.g., interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and severe radiation pneumonitis), or patients who are suspected to have these diseases by imaging at screening or requirement for supplemental oxygen;\n5. Known hypersensitivity to either the drug substances or inactive ingredients in the drug product;\n6. Existing Grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy;\n7. Unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, Grade \u2264 1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic Grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per the discretion of the Investigator;\n8. Cumulative anthracycline dose \\> 360 mg/m2 doxorubicin or equivalent;\n9. Uncontrolled infection requiring i.v. of antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals;\n10. Active infection with hepatitis C (e.g., detectable antibodies to hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\]) or hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] positive) except subjects with occult or prior hepatitis B infection (defined as positive total hepatitis B core antibody and negative HBsAg) may be included if hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is undetectable at the time of screening, and these subjects must be willing to undergo monthly DNA testing and appropriate antiviral therapy as indicated;\n11. Patients with a history or current evidence of any concomitant condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation and compliance;\n12. Women who are lactating or pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test within 7 days before first treatment;\n13. Male and female subjects who are unwilling to use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., concomitant use of a spermicidal agent, barrier contraceptive, or/and intrauterine contraceptive) during the study and for at least 7 months after the last dose of GQ1001.",
