This drug is an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) isoforms. The investigators hypothesize the drug will decrease pulmonary injury due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NOX enzymes, which are believed to play an important role in the development of IPF. Treatment with GKT137831 could result in significant benefit for a lung disease that has, until now, been almost invariably inexorable.\n\nThis clinical trial represents the bedside application of a series of NOX translational and basic studies and discoveries, over several years, from the laboratory of Dr. Victor Thannickal."

History of malignancy, excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer and low-risk prostate cancer, the latter defined as stage T1 or T2a, with prostate specific antigen \\<10 ng/dl.

Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks of Screening (Visit 1) or 5 half-lives of the investigational medicinal product (whichever is longer).\n6. Fertile women who do not agree to contraception or abstinence, or who are breast feeding. IPF is a disease of older adults, and male predominant, so this will not be a frequent consideration.\n7.
