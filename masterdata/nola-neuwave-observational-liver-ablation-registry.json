All other patients will be enrolled and followed prospectively, enrolled retrospectively with prospective, longitudinal follow up, or enrolled retrospectively with all retrospective follow up.\n\nEnrollment for this study will include up to 1,500 patients throughout the world who underwent or are scheduled to undergo microwave ablation of one or more soft tissue liver lesions using the NEUWAVE Microwave Ablation System or the NEUWAVE Microwave Ablation System with Ablation Confirmation."
