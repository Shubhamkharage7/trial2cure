            "detailedDescription": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can non-invasively alter neuroelectric activity in the brain by applying weak time-varying electric currents via the scalp. Complex patterns of electric brain activity can take the form of traveling waves - spatially coherent brain rhythms that gradually propagate through the neocortex. Traveling waves are crucial for the temporal coordination of informational flow in the brain. Using the novel traveling-wave transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) approach, the investigators will explore the effects of frontal-to-parietal and parietal-to-frontal traveling waves on working memory performance and brain electrophysiology in adults."
