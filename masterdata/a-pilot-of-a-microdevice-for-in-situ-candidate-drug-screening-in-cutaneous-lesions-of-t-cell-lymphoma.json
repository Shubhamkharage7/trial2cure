            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Pilot and Feasibility Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this study microdevice loaded with drugs in patients with cutaneous lesions of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) or peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) patients.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the use of all the drugs contained in the microdevice as a treatment for cutaneous or peripheral T cell lymphoma. All drugs used in this study are FDA approved. Some drugs are for different cancer indications. Romidepsin, vorinostat, bexarotene, brentuximab vedotin, pralatrexate, and mogamulizumab have been FDA approved for CTCL. The FDA has not approved the use of the microdevice as a tool to identify what cancer treatment is best for any disease.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are investigating whether the microdevice loaded with 19 drugs can be safely inserted in and removed from cancerous skin lesion. The microdevice was developed as a tool with the ultimate goal to help screen several existing and investigational drugs directly within a patient's tumor to identify what drugs are the most effective for treating a patient's cancer.\n\nThis microdevice was investigated in laboratory studies and shown to help identify what drugs could be effective in treating a specific cancer type. The microdevice was able to release drugs only to the immediately surrounding tumor tissue in concentrations of one millionth of what is normally needed for a therapeutic dose. The microdevice can be retrieved along with a few millimeters of surrounding treated tumor tissue for analysis of tumor response to drug."
