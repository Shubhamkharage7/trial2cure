            "detailedDescription": "Name of Investigational Product: OCU410ST Name of Active Ingredient: Adeno-associated viral vector 5 human RORA (AAV5-hRORA)\n\nTitle of Study: A Phase 1/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of OCU410ST for Stargardt Disease.\n\nStudy Center(s): Approximately five clinical study centers in the US.\n\nBackground: Stargardt disease is an eye disease that causes vision loss in children and young adults. It is an inherited disease caused by faulty genes that cause buildup of fat deposits in the eye. Currently, there is no approved treatment available for Stargardt disease.\n\nOCU410ST Product Information:\n\nOCU410ST is an Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 5 containing human RORA for the treatment of Stargardt disease. Dysregulation in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are critical for pathogenesis and progression of Stargardt disease. The role of hRORA in regulating these gene pathways strongly suggests OCU410ST could restore homeostasis in the eye and thereby serve as a therapeutic candidate for Stargardt disease.\n\nThis study will be conducted in two phases. enrolling up to 42.\n\nPhase 1 is a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging/dose escalation study with a 3+3 design enrolling up to 18 subjects\n\nPhase 2 is a randomized, dose-expansion cohort in which 24 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in to either one of two treatment groups (adults and pediatric subjects) or to an untreated (adults and pediatric subjects) control group."
