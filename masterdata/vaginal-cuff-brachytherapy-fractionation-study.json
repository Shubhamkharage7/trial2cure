Radiation delivered 4-12 weeks after surgery OR HDR vaginal brachytherapy 4Gy in 6 fractions prescribed at the cylinder surface. Patients have the option to request to decline their randomization and switch to the alternate treatment ARM if they prefer.\n\nRadiation delivered 4-12 weeks after surgery. Participants in all Arms will receive standard vaginal dilator for use after treatment (to promote healing). 3 month, 1 year and 2 year follow up assessments are performed."
