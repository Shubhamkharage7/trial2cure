Samples from healthy individuals (non-cancer diagnosis) or from non-disease tissue will also be collected to be used as controls in this study.\n\nInformation and biospecimens may be transferred to NYSCF by external institution or NYSCF research personnel may prospectively enroll participants to have portions of samples or cells that were (or will be) collected for reasons other than this study transferred into the biobank.\n\nNYSCF's researchers hypothesize that the development of patient-specific models that can expand in vitro while capturing tumor complexity at the genotypic and phenotypic levels will enable accelerated discovery of more efficient treatments for patients and improve outcomes.\n\nThis study is not a clinical trial."
