Known concurrent malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, or history of other malignancy within 2 years of study entry after treatment with curative intent.\n18. Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265 Grade 3), known allergy or reaction to Immunoglobulins or NC525, and/or any of their excipients.\n19. Uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection despite appropriate anti-infection treatment at the time of eligibility confirmation.\n20. Has a known history of HIV infection.\n21. Has a known active chronic hepatitis B infection or chronic hepatitis C infection with the exception of those with an undetectable viral load within 3 months.\n22. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality, or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study or interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, such that it is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n23.
