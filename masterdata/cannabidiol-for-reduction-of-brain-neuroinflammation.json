The use of integrated PET/MRI will make it possible to simultaneously evaluate neuroinflammation (using \\[11C\\]PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for TSPO) and striatal function (using the Monetary Incentive Delay task, a validated fMRI task that probes behavioral and neural responses to rewards and losses)."

CNS depressants including all antipsychotics, benzodiazepines (except for alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam, which have low binding affinity to TSPO44-48), and non-benzodiazepine sleep aids that have a known unsafe reaction with CBD;\n21. Use of opioids \u2265 30 mg morphine equivalents on average per month;\n22. Actively suicidal, history of suicide attempt or an aborted attempt within the last 5 years, or engagement in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior within the last year;\n23. Allergy to sesame oil, and any other ingredients of EPIDIOLEX;\n24. Any other contraindications to CBD administration noted by the study physician;\n25. Any significant change in drug use and pain treatment from screening visit;\n26. In the opinion of the investigators, unable to safely participate in this study and/or provide reliable data (e.g., unable to reliably rate pain; unlikely to remain still during the imaging procedures, etc).",
