Exposure to these metals, principally uranium and arsenic, and metal mixtures is associated with dysregulation of immune function and other health effects. The objective of this study is to conduct an intervention trial to assess the effect of dietary zinc supplementation to mitigate the toxicity of metal exposures. The current project is part of a larger research effort funded by the NIH Superfund Program to study environmental metals exposures in tribal communities in New Mexico."
