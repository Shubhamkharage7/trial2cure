The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the clinical trial protocol feasible?\n* Is Vitamin D administration following burn injury safe?\n* How does vitamin D cause changes in the immune system in the aftermath of burn injury?\n\nFollowing informed consent, participants will be asked to:\n\n* Take 6 capsules by mouth one time following burn injury (Vitamin D or Placebo)\n* Provide a blood sample at baseline and 6 weeks following injury\n* Fill out surveys daily while in the hospital, weekly through 6 weeks, and at 3 months and 6 months.\n\nResearchers will compare Vitamin D and placebo groups to see if there are differences in adverse effects (side effects), chronic pain, and profiles of immune cells from collected blood samples."
