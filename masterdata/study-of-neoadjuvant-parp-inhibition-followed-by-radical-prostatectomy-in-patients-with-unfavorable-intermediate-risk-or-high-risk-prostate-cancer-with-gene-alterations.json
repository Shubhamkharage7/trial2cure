All patients must have confirmed germline or somatic BRCA1/2 gene mutation. Germline and somatic mutation testing will be performed as part of commercially available CLIA assays and will be validated on a uniform platform centrally all patients retrospectively.\n\nEligible patients will receive treatment with olaparib + LHRH agonist. Following 6 months of therapy, patients will undergo RP with mandatory lymph node dissection. The lymph node dissection template will be at the discretion of the treating urologist. RP specimens will undergo pathology blinded independent central review. Following RP, patients will be followed for testosterone recovery and PSA progression."
