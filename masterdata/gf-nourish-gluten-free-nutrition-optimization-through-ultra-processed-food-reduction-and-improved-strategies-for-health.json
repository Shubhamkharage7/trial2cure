            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose the Gluten Free Nutrition Optimization through Ultra-processed food Reduction and Improved Strategies for Health (GF-NOURISH) study to demonstrate the feasibility and success of a nutritional education program focused on naturally occurring gluten-free foods and minimizing ultra-processed gluten-free foods. The investigators hypothesize that nutritional educational (GF-NOURISH) intervention will have multiple health benefits",
            "detailedDescription": "Celiac Disease (CeD) is a gluten driven enteropathy that affects up to 3% of the population and typically develops in childhood. Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the primary treatment. Rice, the most common gluten-free substitute grain, naturally bioaccumulates inorganic arsenic. Chronic arsenic exposure may affect neurodevelopment, increase risk of cardiovascular disease and cause kidney damage. In a prior prospective cohort study, the investigators demonstrated that urine arsenic levels increased 2-3 times in newly diagnosed children 6 months after adoption of a GFD. This likely is a consequence of both impaired absorption of vitamin B12 and folate in the small intestine (both nutrients are part of the pathway to excrete arsenic from the body) and increased ingestion of rice products on a gluten-free diet. In particular, gluten-free ultra-processed free foods tend to be specialty products that are made predominantly from rice products, easy for families to identify as safe when avoiding gluten, and rarely fortified with vitamins. Ultra-processed food(UPF) consumption has also been associated with lower perceived quality of life in patients with CeD.\n\nGiven the risks associated with gluten-free ultra-processed food, the investigators propose the Gluten Free Nutrition Optimization through Ultra-processed food Reduction and Improved Strategies for Health (GF-NOURISH) study to demonstrate the feasibility and success of a nutritional education program focused on naturally occurring gluten-free foods and minimizing ultra-processed gluten-free foods. The investigators hypothesize that nutritional educational (GF-NOURISH) intervention will have multiple health benefits\n\nThe investigators propose to randomize (1:1) 120 children at celiac disease diagnosis to either a novel nutritional education (GF-NOURISH) focused on minimizing ultra-processed gluten free foods or to a conventional GFD nutritional education. Urine/Hair/Toenail arsenic, changes in percent fat free mass, household budgets, diet quality measurements will be evaluated after 6 months on the GFD."
