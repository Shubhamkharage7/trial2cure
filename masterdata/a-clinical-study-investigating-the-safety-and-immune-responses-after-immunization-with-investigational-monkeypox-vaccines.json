In substudy A and substudy B, dosing will start with an initial sentinel group, followed by the expansion cohort.\n\nThis study was initially planned to investigate two vaccine candidates (the quadrivalent BNT166a and the trivalent BNT166c).

Two doses will be given \\~31 days apart.\n\nSubstudy B is a Phase I substudy to assess the reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity of the multivalent vaccine candidate BNT166a in \\~16 healthy participants with prior history of smallpox vaccination (vaccinia-experienced).

A stable Grade 1 laboratory abnormality is defined as the value which is \u2264 Grade 1 upon repeated testing on a second sample from this individual during the screening period (prior to Visit 1). Individuals with abnormal but not clinically significant parameters not included in the toxicity guidance may be considered eligible at discretion of investigator.\n* Abnormal total bilirubin at Visit 0. Note: inclusion of volunteers with bilirubin \u22641.25 upper limit of normal (ULN) if due to Gilbert's syndrome is allowed.\n* Any abnormal troponin I value at Visit 0.\n* A 12-lead ECG at Visit 0 which is consistent with probable or possible myocarditis/pericarditis or which demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or are otherwise clinically significant findings (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, AV block, average corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF interval) \\>450 msec, signs of myocardial infarction, ST elevation consistent with myocardial ischemia, or serious brady- or tachyarrhythmias).\n* Febrile illness (body temperature \u226538.0\u00b0C) or other acute illness within 48 hours prior to Dose 1 and/or current (if presented at Visit 1, temporary deferral is allowed).\n* Participation or planned participation in strenuous or endurance exercise within 7 days before or after each IMP administration.\n* SSA only: Vaccination with any Orthopoxvirus-based vaccine including vaccines for prevention of smallpox, disease caused by vaccinia virus or mpox, or vector Orthopoxvirus-based vaccines.\n* SSB only: Vaccination for prevention of mpox or disease caused by vaccinia virus, or with vector Orthopoxvirus-based vaccine. Vaccination for prevention of smallpox done in or after 1980.\n* Any vaccination within 28 days before Dose 1.

If systemic corticosteroids have been administered short term (\u226414 days, at a dose of \u226420 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for treatment of an acute illness, individuals should be enrolled in the trial only after corticosteroid therapy has been discontinued for at least 28 days before Dose 1. Intraarticular, intrabursal, or topical (skin or eyes) corticosteroids are permitted.\n* Have a history of alcohol abuse within 1 year before Visit 0 or have a history of substance abuse within the past 5 years before Visit 0.\n* Are vulnerable individuals as per ICH E6 definition, i.e., are individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical trial may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate.",
