The study also seeks to further characterize (as possible) any other serious adverse reaction(s) in the long-term in adults with prostate cancer who received at least one dose of AAA617 from interventional, Phase I-IV Novartis sponsored clinical trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a global, prospective, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) safety study of adult participants with prostate cancer that have received at least one dose of AAA617 from interventional, Phase I-IV Novartis sponsored clinical trials.\n\nThere will be no study treatment administered to participants in this study. Participants will have visits every 6-8 months for monitoring of selected AEs and laboratory parameters. The study periods include a Baseline and Follow-up Period (up to 10 years after first dose of AAA617 in parent treatment study).\n\nParticipants should enroll into the LTFU study after parent treatment study requirements are fulfilled (refer to the parent treatment study protocol for requirements, including any additional requirements after participant enters this LTFU safety study).\n\nThe schedule of activities for this LTFU study is designed to start from date of informed consent for this LTFU study. Participants should be followed every 6 to 8 months for up to a total of 10 years starting from first dose of AAA617 in the parent treatment study. Participants entering the LTFU study will have already completed a variable portion of the required 10-year follow-up within the parent treatment study. The specific number of visits required in this LTFU study will depend upon the time of enrollment into this LTFU study following the first dose of AAA617 in the parent treatment study.\n\nThe total number of participants to be enrolled and the duration of this LTFU study will depend upon the total number treated in the parent treatment studies and their duration."
