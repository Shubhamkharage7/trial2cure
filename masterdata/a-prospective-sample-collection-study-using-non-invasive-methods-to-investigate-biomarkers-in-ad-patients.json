Samples collected will be analyzed to detect gene signatures and microbiome populations associated with AD and sub-populations of AD.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multicenter, sample collection study using DermTech's non-invasive skin collection kits to evaluate genomic biomarkers and microbiome information from pediatric and adult subjects with atopic dermatitis. Samples collected will be analyzed to detect gene signatures and microbiome populations associated with atopic dermatitis and sub-populations of AD.\n\nApproximately 500 pediatric and adult subjects with moderate to severe AD will be enrolled in this study. Non-invasive skin samples will be collected at baseline, before drug administration 16 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after treatment with biological therapy and a final visit at 26 weeks ((+/- 4 weeks).\n\nSubjects will enter the Screening Period once the informed consent and/or assent process has been completed.\n\nOnce patient eligibility is confirmed, non-invasive skin samples will be collected using DermTech's non-invasive sample collection kit.\n\nSamples will be collected from the following areas:\n\n* Target Lesion - lesional skin for genomic analysis. Please note the location for subsequent collections.\n* Lesional skin for microbiome analysis similar in size and severity to the target lesion noted above. Please note the location for subsequent collections.\n* Non-lesional skin at least 5 cm from any active lesion. The intervals for subsequent sample collection, if applicable, will be determined based on standard of care (SOC) treatment and the subject's willingness to undergo repeat non-invasive sampling.\n\nData to be collected includes eczema area and severity index (EASI), patient oriented eczema measure (POEM), investigator global assessment (IGA), peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PPNRS), and transepidermal water loss (TEWL).\n\nPhotographic documentation of the site(s) sampled should be obtained to confirm consistent sampling of the lesional and non-lesional sites. Each non-invasive sample collection will consist of sequential application of 4 individual patches to a site. If during active treatment the skin lesion disappears during active treatment, skin samples will still be obtained from the same location."
