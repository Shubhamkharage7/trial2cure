            "briefSummary": "The overall purpose of this study is to understand the role of disrupted sleep in the association of exposure to early life adversity (adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)) with vascular endothelial (dys)function.\n\nIn Aim 1 (The Iowa ACEs and Sleep Cohort Study), the investigators will utilize a cross-sectional cohort design with a state-of-the-art translational approach. Participants will be recruited to objectively characterize the degree to which lower sleep quality and quantity contribute to ACEs-related endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress in young adults using:\n\n1. rigorous at home sleep monitoring using 7-nights of wrist actigraphy and 2 nights of home-based polysomnography to objectively measure sleep quality (sleep efficiency, wakefulness after sleep onset and sleep depth), and total sleep duration,\n2. in vivo assessment of endothelial function via flow-mediated dilation testing, and\n3. in vitro determination of endothelial cell inflammation and oxidative stress from biopsied endothelial cells. This study to achieve this Aim.\n\nIn Aim 2, approximately 70 eligible participants from Aim 1 (The Iowa ACEs and Sleep Cohort Study) will then be randomized to either a 6-week behavioral sleep intervention (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) or a wait-list control to determine the mechanistic contribution of sleep disruption to vascular dysfunction in young adults with moderate-to-high exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Following the intervention, participants will again complete:\n\n1. rigorous at home sleep monitoring using 7-nights of wrist actigraphy and 2 nights of home-based polysomnography to objectively measure sleep quality (sleep efficiency, wakefulness after sleep onset and sleep depth), and total sleep duration,\n2. in vivo assessment of endothelial function via flow-mediated dilation testing, and\n3. in vitro determination of endothelial cell inflammation and oxidative stress from biopsied endothelial cells."

The cognitive component of CBT-I teaching individuals how to recognize and change the beliefs they hold about sleep that negatively impact sleep, such as negative thoughts and emotions. The behavioral component includes several strategies to help improve sleep, including: improved sleep hygiene, improving the sleep environment, relaxation training, stimulus control therapy (consistent wake/sleep times, using the bed only for sleep, etc), and sleep restriction. Sleep restriction consists of reducing the time spend in bed initially to increase sleep drive in subsequent nights. Once sleep has improved, the time in bed is gradually increased again.",
