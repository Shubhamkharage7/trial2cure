The purpose of this work is to explore whether the biomarkers may be used diagnostically to better understand radiographic changes following RT. The investigators hypothesize that ctDNA levels in combination with imaging biomarkers identified through radiomics will be a sensitive and specific tool for predicting histopathologic response to RT."

Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation and for up to 12 weeks following the study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior radiation or radiosurgery to the involved level of the spine.\n* Patients with metastatic disease will be excluded.\n* Prior malignancies are excluded except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, or other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for at least 1 year.\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements will be excluded.\n* Pregnant women are excluded. Women of child-bearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use and acceptable method of birth control to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and up to 12 weeks after the study are excluded.
