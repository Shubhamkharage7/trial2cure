            "detailedDescription": "Limb fluid volume changes that can occur in the residual limb of a lower-limb amputee can result in changes in socket fit that lead to discomfort, skin injuries, and reduced mobility. It is known that limb fluid volume fluctuations can be reduced for some people by intermittently removing (doffing) the socket throughout the day. It is believed that partially doffing the socket may have a similar benefit, and could be made more convenient thereby promoting easier compliance for prosthetic users.\n\nThe goal of the research is to create and evaluate a new technology for management of daily residual limb fluid volume fluctuation. The technology enables partial doffing through the release and relock of a socket panel and the prosthetic pin used to hold the limb in place. The expected outcomes are an enhanced understanding of how socket adjustments after activity facilitate limb fluid volume recovery, subsequent fluid retention, and improved socket fit."
