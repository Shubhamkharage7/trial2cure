The primary objective is to test whether the progression of the signs of Parkinson's disease is attenuated at 12 months in among persons who have not initiated medication for Parkinson Disease (PD) when they perform high-intensity endurance treadmill exercise.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a Phase 3 multi-site, randomized, evaluator-masked, study of endurance treadmill exercise on changes in the MDS-UPDRS Part III score at 12 months. 370 persons diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who have not yet initiated dopaminergic therapy, age 40-80, will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: 1)60-65% HRmax or 2)80-85% HRmax 4 times per week. Secondary objectives will test hypotheses related to striatal specific binding ratio (SSBR) at 12 months, MDS-UPDRS Part III score, ambulatory mobility (6-minute walk), daily walking activity (steps), cognition, quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness, blood-derived biomarkers of inflammation and neurotrophic factors at 12 and 18 months. Tertiary objectives will test hypotheses related to 2 characteristics of ambulation at 12 and 18 months. Exploratory objectives will test hypotheses related to the effects of removing the study support that was provided over 18 months on the sustainability and durability of the exercise effects at 24 months. Approximately 29 sites will enroll participants: 27 sites that cover all geographic regions of the USA and 2 sites in Canada. All sites will have a collaboration between movement disorders and exercise specialists."

Any subject with such a score will be referred to a PCP or physician for further evaluation and management of depression.\n* Individuals who have been exercising at greater than moderate intensity for 120 minutes or more per week consistently over the last 6 months will be excluded. Greater than moderate intensity is defined as a range greater than 60-65% HRmax. These individuals are excluded since their exercise activities are greater than the activities they would experience if they were assigned to the 60-65% treatment group.
