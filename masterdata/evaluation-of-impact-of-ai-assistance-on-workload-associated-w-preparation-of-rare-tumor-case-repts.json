Furthermore, this study evaluates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance as a tool to reduce cognitive burden among providers preparing and submitting case reports. If an AI-tool is helpful in this setting, it may potentially help increase reporting of rare medical events and thereby improve the evidence base for care of these patient populations. This study will occur at a single time point which is expected to last approximately 2 hours. This session will include reviewing two rare tumor cases and then writing a clinical vignette with and without AI assistance."

The NASA-TLX considers six dimensions-Mental, Physical, and Temporal Demands, Frustration, Effort, and Performance.
