Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) promotes a dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables (fruits and vegetables), low-fat dairy, lean meats with reduced saturated fat, and sweets, which is effective in lowering blood pressure. The proposed THRIVE intervention will enroll 60 Black adults with hypertension living in Healthy Food Priority Areas (HFPAs) in a 2-arm randomized pilot study. One group will receive Produce prescriptions, personalized dietitian coaching, and adaptive bi-directional messaging; the other group will receive standard produce bags. Both groups will be linked to needed social services.\n\nThe investigators will assess changes in overall DASH adherence, acceptability, and feasibility at 3- and 6-months post-randomization. The investigators will: 1) Develop and beta test THRIVE among Black adults with hypertension living in HFPAs; 2) Test feasibility and preliminary efficacy of THRIVE at 6 \\& 12 weeks; 3) Determine short-term sustainability of THRIVE at 6 months."
