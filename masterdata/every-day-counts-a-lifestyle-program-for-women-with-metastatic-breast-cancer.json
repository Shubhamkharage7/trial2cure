To examine the efficacy of the Every Day Counts intervention in producing significant post-intervention changes in multidimensional QOL in women with MBC.\n\nHypothesis 1: Women randomized to the immediate EDC intervention (n=88) will exhibit greater improvements in multidimensional QOL compared to women randomized to the attention control (n=88).\n\nAim 2. To investigate the mechanistic effects of the Every Day Counts intervention on body composition, adipokines, serum biomarkers of inflammation and insulin sensitivity.\n\nHypothesis 2: The EDC intervention leads to improved QOL through mediating factors including body composition, prognostic serum biomarkers of inflammation and/or insulin resistance.\n\nExploratory Aim 3: To explore if microRNA (miRNA) signatures associated with inflammation and/or Metabolomics are altered with the EDC intervention.\n\nHypothesis: miRNAs identified in our pilot study (miR-10a-5p, miR-205-5p, and miR-211-5p) that regulate inflammation and/or Metabolomics will be related to QOL improvements and can identify women more likely to respond to lifestyle changes."
