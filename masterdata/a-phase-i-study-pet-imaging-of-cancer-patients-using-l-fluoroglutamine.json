            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase I study. This study is the first time that a new experimental drug called 18FFluoroglutamine, or F-Glutamine, is being used in people. F-Glutamine is a drug designed to be used with PET scanners that can 'see' where F-Glutamine goes in the body, after its injected. PET scanners are one of the kinds of scanners you normally find in a hospital radiology department. The researchers have found that tumors in animals absorb F-Glutamine. The researchers believe that scans with F-Glutamine might be able to find tumors in patients.\n\nThis first in-human study is being done to see how long F-Glutamine lasts in the blood, when it is given to people in tiny amounts by an injection, and to see where F-Glutamine goes in the body. If the results of this trial are good, then the study doctors plan to use F-Glutamine in another trial to see if scans with F-Glutamine are better for finding tumors compared to the standard types of scans that doctors use."
