            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nEpilepsy affects about 1 percent of the U.S. population. Most people with epilepsy respond well to medicine, but some do not. Researchers want people who have diagnosed or suspected epilepsy to participate in ongoing studies. They want to learn more about clinical care for epilepsy. They want fellows and residents to learn more about the care of people with epilepsy.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo learn more about seizures and find ways to best treat people with drug-resistant epilepsy.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults and children ages 8 years and older with diagnosed or suspected epilepsy\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nPhysical exam\n\nMedical history\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nParticipants will have many visits. They may be admitted to the hospital for several weeks. Their medication might be stopped or changed.\n\nParticipants will have many tests:\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nEEG: Wires attached to the head with paste record brain waves. This may be videotaped.\n\nThinking and memory tests\n\nMRI: Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of a tube. They perform simple tasks in the tube.\n\nMEG: Participants lie on a table and place their head in a helmet to record brain waves.\n\nPET scan: Participants lie on a table that slides into a machine. A small amount of radioactive dye is injected into their arm with an IV. For the IV, a small tube is inserted into the arm with a needle.\n\nParticipants will stay enrolled in this study if they join other epilepsy-related studies. They may be contacted at intervals for follow-up. Their participation will end if they have not been seen clinically for their epilepsy for 3 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\\<TAB\\>\n\nThis protocol is designed to serve as a screening protocol that provides standard evaluation and treatment for patients with epilepsy. Clinical data collected through this protocol will be used in other NIH epilepsy-related research to screen for eligibility in the respective protocols and may also be used for descriptive and/or correlative research through this protocol.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nMaintain a cohort of patients who are referred to the NIH with a known or suspected diagnosis of epilepsy that can be accessed by other NIH studies to screen for eligibility to participate in ongoing epilepsy-related protocols.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* to follow the natural history of subjects with epilepsy and epilepsy and related disorders, and\n* to allow for descriptive and/or correlational studies based on the data collected through clinical care of these patients."
