            "detailedDescription": "The Mobile Apps for Preschool Parents (MAPP) Study addresses an important gap in the scientific literature, which is the need to evaluate the use of parent-targeted, guided goal-setting for childhood obesity risk reduction via a mobile application, specifically for parents of preschool-aged children for early intervention.\n\nObesity is a leading cause of multiple chronic diseases, including 13 types of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and type II diabetes. Major behavioral determinants of obesity are also independent risk factors for these chronic diseases, including unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, and poor sleep quality. Childhood obesity increases risk for adult obesity and early onset of conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, sleep apnea, and joint problems. Childhood obesity disproportionately affects children of lower socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority groups, and rural areas, thus exacerbating and contributing to health disparities among obesity-related health conditions. Children in low-income families that qualify for income-based public assistance programs represent a population that is at high risk for obesity. These programs include the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition Program; Head Start (preschool child care centers); the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); and Medicaid.\n\nWith the Attention Control Arm, the MAPP Study will also contribute valuable information about the effectiveness of using a mobile application with parent-targeted, guided goal-setting for reading to preschool-aged children. Previous studies have shown that adults reading to children is beneficial for child learning and development.\n\nAll parents/guardians (both samples and both arms) will be asked to use the respective apps for an 8-week intervention period. The primary outcome will be measured in the Baseline Survey and a Follow Up Survey after completing the 8-week intervention period. After completion of the Follow Up Survey, parents/guardians will be given the option to download and use the other app, if they are interested (i.e., information about the CHEW app for the Control Arm, and information about the Control app for the Intervention Arm). For both the Intervention Arm and those who choose to download the CHEW app in the Control Arm, usage of the CHEW app (i.e., app analytics) will be tracked for up to 20 weeks after the date of study enrollment."
