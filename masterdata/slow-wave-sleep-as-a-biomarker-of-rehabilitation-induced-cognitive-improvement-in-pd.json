            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of exercise rehabilitation on cognition and to evaluate slow wave sleep (SWS) as a biomarker and mediator of response to rehabilitation-induced improvement in cognitive performance among persons with Parkinson's disease (PwP), with the ultimate goal of maximizing rehabilitation efficacy at the individual level (i.e. precision rehabilitation).",
            "detailedDescription": "Sleep impairment adversely affects cognitive function and increases risk for dementia. Slow wave sleep (SWS) or delta sleep (non-rapid eye movement (REM) stage 3; N3) is especially important for cognition due to its association with synaptic plasticity, synaptic potentiation, synaptic renormalization, and cortical reorganization, especially in prefrontal cortex. Clinically, SWS contributes to memory consolidation and language performance. The investigators have previously shown that the amount of SWS in persons with Parkinson's disease (PwP) is related to cognitive performance, especially in the domain of executive function. The investigators have also shown that exercise increases SWS in some PwP and that participants who have an exercise-induced increase in SWS also have improvement in executive function. This study will evaluate changes in cognitive function and SWS due to progressive resistance training rehabilitation (PRT). Participants who do not have an increase in SWS with PRT (non-responders) over 12 weeks will be transitioned to an endurance training (ET) intervention, while those who do have an increase in SWS (responders) will continue in PRT for an additional 12 weeks."
