Anifrolumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits several processes that have been shown to be involved in the development of HS.\n\nThe study lasts approximately 40 weeks separated into a screening, treatment, and follow-up phase. Researchers determine if it is safe for the you to receive the drug and if you are eligible for the study during Screening. If eligible for the study, the treatment phase lasts 24 weeks (or six months) with one follow-up visit 12 weeks after the last visit in the treatment phase.\n\nDuring the treatment phase, participants will be asked to come to clinic every two weeks for the first month of treatment, and monthly thereafter for a total of eight treatment visits. Participants will be asked to:\n\n* Complete questionnaires asking about the effect of HS in their daily lives and their perception of HS and treatment received.\n* Receive related medical evaluation\n* Receive the study drug intravenously\n* Stay 20 minutes after the infusion for monitoring"
