The investigators hypothesize that an exam-based diagnostic tool will provide more information about the areas of injury related to pelvic radiation than patient-reported outcomes, and could be used in future studies of preventive strategies. An exam-based tool will also allow measurement of the pain dose-response to radiation treatment of specific areas, which could be excluded from radiation fields during treatment planning."
