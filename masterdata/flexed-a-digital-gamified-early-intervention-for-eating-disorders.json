Twenty-four young women and girls (between the ages of 15-25) with eating disorder (ED) symptoms will be randomized to different baseline durations (varying between 2-6 weeks). Participants will complete eight 20-30 minute sessions of a multimedia application over 10 weeks using their home computer or mobile device. Body Image Flexibility (BIF) will be measured repeatedly using a multimodal assessment strategy (behavior, physiological and self-report) during baseline and treatment phases. The investigators will estimate the effect of the intervention on BIF and examine when change occurs and plateaus (with no discernable benefit for additional sessions) to determine treatment dose."
