Participants will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 250, 500, 750 mg 2-HOBA acetate TID or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) will be collected to measure markers of protein modification by dicarbonyls (IsoLGs- \\& MDA), pTau-181, YKL-40, and NF-L.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1b/2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group dose finding and biomarker study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and biomarker activity of 2-HOBA in 48 MCI/AD participants. Participants will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 250, 500, 750 mg 2-HOBA acetate TID or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood and CSF will be collected to measure markers of protein modification by dicarbonyls (IsoLGs- \\& MDA), pTau-181, YKL-40, and NF-L. Investigators anticipate screening 120 subjects to randomize up to 60 subjects with the goal of 48 patients completing the study (allowing for up to 25% dropout) for the 16-week study.\n\nThe primary aims of this project are to 1) Provide proof-of-concept that 2-HOBA protects proteins from covalent modification by inhibiting lysine-reacting dicarbonyls in the human brain. Investigators hypothesize that 16 weeks of 2-HOBA treatment will significantly reduce CSF levels of the dilysyl-MDA and IsoLG adduct of CSF proteins in a dose-responsive relationship. 2) Evaluate whether 2-HOBA is safe for extended use in patients with early AD. Investigators hypothesize that 2-HOBA will be safe and well tolerated through 16 weeks of use. Tolerability will be assessed by monitoring symptoms, adverse events, vital signs, ECG, and safety labs during the study.\n\nThe secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of 2-HOBA treatment on AD biomarkers, brain inflammation, disease severity, and cognitive performance."
