The study will help the investigators learn more about how these medications affect the heart and how those effects relate to patients' medical history and social determinants of health (such as race, gender identity, education, occupation, access to health services and economic resources). Patients on this study will have echocardiograms, blood draws, and answer questions about their symptoms and activity level. Patients will be followed on this study for up to 5 years.",

Patients will be followed with serial echo, blood draw, and surveys prior to start of ADT and then 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years after start of ADT."
