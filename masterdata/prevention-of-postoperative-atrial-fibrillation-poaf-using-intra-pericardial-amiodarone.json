Four ampules of amiodarone (150mg/3ml; 12cc total volume) will be drawn into a syringe. 2cc will be dripped over the right atrium and a small CardiaMend patch placed to cover this area. Another 2cc will be used over the left atrium and covered with the CardiaMend. The anterior pericardial space will be closed without putting pressure on the underlying structures using the CardiaMend attached to the native pericardium utilizing running 4-0 monofilament suture. A small edge may be left open for drain placement and a small slit for the Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) in case of CABG. The remaining 8 cc of amiodarone will be instilled to the closed pericardial space.\n\nPatients will have continuous electrocardiogram (EKG) until discharge. If clinically indicated, patients will receive a monitor for home monitoring per standard of care."
