            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to examine whether stuttering is associated with a tendency to attend more quickly or for longer durations to threat-related information in the environment (threat-related attention bias). The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nDo adults who stutter, relative to adults who do not stutter, attend to threat-related stimuli more than neutral information? Are attentional biases observed across different types of threat or are they specific to threats related to stuttering experiences? Do measures of attention bias explain individual differences in psychological reactions among adults who stutter?",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of the project is to examine threat-related attentional processes associated with stuttering. In Aim 1, investigators will establish differences in attention bias (AB) in adults who do and do not stutter and the processing stage at which differences emerge. In Aim 2, investigators will compare AB effects across different categories of threat stimuli to determine whether threat-related AB in adults who stutter is general or disorder-specific. In Aim 3, the investigators examine the role of AB as a causal factor mediating effects of individual risk-factors (related to temperament and attention control) on stuttering impact and anticipation. Participants will include 35 adults who stutter and 35 adults who stutter between the ages of 18-30 years, all meeting specified eligibility criteria. All participants will complete three experimental tasks for measuring AB: (1) a free-viewing task, (2) dot-probe task, and (3) emotional Stroop task. Study procedures will be administered over two sessions (2-2.5 hours each) scheduled within three weeks of each other. Key outcomes will include reaction time and eye-tracking measures, which will be used to extract multiple AB indices. Data will be analyzed via mixed-effects regression analysis with a random intercept for subject and maximal converging random-slopes structure. Age, gender, socioeconomic status and various measures used for inclusion purposes will be included as covariates. Mediation analyses will assess four relationships (Temperament -\\> Stuttering impact, Temperament -\\> Anticipation, Attention control -\\> Stuttering impact, and Attention control -\\> Anticipation), with AB as the mediator variable in each analysis."
