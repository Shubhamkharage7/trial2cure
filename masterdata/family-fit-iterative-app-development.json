            "detailedDescription": "This study includes a 12-week active intervention period, following by a 6-week observational period for a total of 18 weeks. Interested participants will complete a study orientation webinar, then continue to a baseline visit and online questionnaires if interested. They will then complete 7-days of accelerometry monitoring to measure current physical activity levels. If eligible, they will then be randomized to a study group, and attend a brief kick-off meeting to receive their Fitbits and study apps. The intervention period is 12 weeks, all remotely delivered. Both intervention conditions focus on families working to increase their moderate- to-vigorous intensity physical activity. At 12 weeks, families will attend a brief in-person assessment visit and complete online questionnaires and 7 days of accelerometry. There is no active intervention between weeks 13-18. At week 18, families will attend a brief in-person assessment visit and complete online questionnaires and 7 days of accelerometry, as well as complete a semi-structured interview via Zoom to discuss their experiences and provide feedback for future program modifications."
