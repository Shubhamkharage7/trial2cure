EMC2 PrEP will adapt from the previous strategy to\n\n* educate cisgender women in primary care who have increased vulnerability to HIV about PrEP using an interactive, health literacy-appropriate educational tool securely delivered via the patient portal\n* facilitate, for those who express interest, the rapid and discrete scheduling of a dedicated PrEP clinic visit with a primary care clinician trained in PrEP delivery\n\nThe current study aims are to:\n\nAim 1: Refine and implement an electronic health record (EHR)-based strategy as a potential quality improvement activity that supports informed decision-making and PrEP uptake among women with increased HIV vulnerability in primary care (the EMC2 PrEP strategy).\n\nAim 2: Pilot-test the EMC2 PrEP strategy in primary care to determine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy among women with increased vulnerability to HIV.\n\nAim 3: Develop a standard operating protocol (SOP) for disseminating the EMC2 PrEP strategy to a national network of federally qualified health centers."
