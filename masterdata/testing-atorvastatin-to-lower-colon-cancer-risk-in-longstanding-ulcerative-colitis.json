            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of atorvastatin in treating patients with ulcerative colitis who have a dominant-negative missense P53 mutation and are at risk of developing large intestinal cancer. Patients with ulcerative colitis are known to have an increased risk of developing large intestinal cancer. Better ways to control ulcerative colitis and more knowledge about how to prevent colon cancer are needed. Atorvastatin is a drug used to lower the amount of cholesterol in the blood and to prevent stroke, heart attack, and angina (chest pain). It blocks an enzyme that helps make cholesterol in the body. It also causes an increase in the breakdown of cholesterol. The information gained from this study may help doctors learn more about atorvastatin as an agent in cancer prevention, and may help to improve public health.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the effect of atorvastatin calcium (atorvastatin) treatment on reducing the fraction of colonic epithelial cells expressing mutant p53 protein detected via immunohistochemical staining in biopsy samples of colorectal mucosa obtained during colonoscopies done before and after atorvastatin intervention and compared to placebo control.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Examination of the effect of atorvastatin on the levels of biomarkers including Ki-67 (cell proliferation), Waf1p21 (wild type p53 allele reactivated signal), and cleaved caspase-3 (wild type p53-induced cell apoptosis) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach for colorectal biopsy specimens.\n\nII. Examination of the effect of atorvastatin on the spectrum, hotspot and load of TP53 gene mutations using next generation sequencing and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nIII. Examination of the effect of atorvastatin on the severity of histologic inflammation in colorectal biopsies using the Geboes grading system.\n\nIV. Examination of the effect of atorvastatin on the plasma concentration of cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) for monitoring atorvastatin effect on lowering cholesterol and its correlation with the levels of biomarkers in the colorectal biopsies.\n\nV. Examination of the effect of atorvastatin on the clinical efficacy on ulcerative colitis (UC) related symptoms using the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (i.e. the Mayo score).\n\nVI. Will bank colorectal biopsies and blood samples and ribonucleic acid (RNA) and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for future analyses, particularly on proteomics/prenylated protein profile, cytokine/chemokine profile, inflammatory lipid-mediator profile, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and Chaperon/Co-chaperon proteins, etc.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive atorvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 months. Patients also undergo colonoscopy with biopsy, and collection of blood on the trial.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 12 months. Patients also undergo colonoscopy with biopsy, and collection of blood on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks."
