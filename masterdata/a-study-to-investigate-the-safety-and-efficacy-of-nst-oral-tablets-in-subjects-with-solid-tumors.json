            "detailedDescription": "The study includes two parts, a dose escalation part (Part A) followed by a dose expansion part (Part B). Part A will estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in dose escalation cohorts in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom no standard therapy is available in order to establish the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Successive cohorts of subjects will receive escalating doses of NST-628 orally once daily in 28-day cycles.\n\nBayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) method will be used for dose escalation.\n\nOnce MTD is reached or dose escalation is stopped prior to reaching MTD and provisional RDE selected, the provisional RDE level will be expanded. If warranted by dose/toxicity/anti-tumor activity observations, additional, lower dose level(s) may also be expanded.\n\nPart B of the study will include up to 6 cohorts of approximately up to 30 subjects each with select MAPK pathway mutant solid tumors enrolled at the RDE in order to explore benefit from treatment as suggested by preclinical findings and will better define the safety profile of NST-628 at the RDE. Additional safety information gathered in Part B may be used to modify the dose recommended for future studies.\n\nThe end of the study is the last visit of the last subject."
