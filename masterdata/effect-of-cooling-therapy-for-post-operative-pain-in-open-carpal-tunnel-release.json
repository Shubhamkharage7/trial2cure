            "detailedDescription": "Post-operative pain control is paramount to all operative procedures and involves several modalities. Both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures are frequently used. Carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery is one of the most common surgeries performed in the U.S. with over 400,000 procedures per year.2 Frequently, ice is used as a treatment modality following surgical CTR.3 Several products have been developed in the past decades to improve ice therapy in the rehabilitation period. One such product is the Polar Care which provides up to 6-8 hours of continuous icing.\n\nWhile there is good data supporting the use of cooling therapy (ice) for post-operative pain, there is lack of data surrounding the use of continuous cooling therapy machines such as the PolarCare following carpal tunnel release (CTR). The two papers that evaluated the efficacy of continuous cooling therapy following CTR had conflicting results on any added benefit of continuous cooling therapy over traditional icing.\n\nThere is no standard of care for post-operative icing at UCMC following CTR. Clinicians currently decide whether to give patients a PolarCare machine on the day of surgery without any algorithm. All other patients are encouraged to use traditional icing methods. This study seeks to perform an appropriately-powered study to evaluate any clinical difference between continuous cooling therapy and traditional ice for treatment of post-operative pain in open CTR surgery.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that participants receiving continuous cooling therapy will have a statistically significantly lower pain score compared to those receiving traditional ice therapy."
