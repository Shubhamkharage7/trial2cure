            "detailedDescription": "The present study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multi-center study of the efficacy of Daromun neoadjuvant intratumoral treatment followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy versus surgery and adjuvant therapy in clinical stage III B/C melanoma patients. 186 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Daromun treatment followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy (Arm 1) or surgery and adjuvant therapy (Arm 2).\n\nIn both arms, follow-up for assessing recurrence-free survival will be performed up to five years after randomization. Survival information will also be collected in the following year (up to six years in total after randomization).\n\nThis is an open-label study, so there is no blinding.\n\nPatients who successfully complete the screening evaluations and are eligible for participation in the study will be enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to two parallel treatment arms: Daromun plus surgery and adjuvant therapy (Arm 1) or surgery and adjuvant therapy (Arm 2).\n\nTo ensure a balance across treatment groups, stratified randomization with permuted block will be used and separate randomization list for each subgroup (stratum) will be produced. Patients will be stratified on the basis of the following prognostic factors:\n\n* Stage of disease (2 levels): Stage IIIB vs. Stage IIIC\n* Planned post-surgical adjuvant therapy (2 levels): anti-PD-1 and other adjuvant therapies.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun treatment followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy improves in a statistically significant manner the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of Stage IIIB/C melanoma patients with respect to the standard of care (surgery and adjuvant therapy).\n\nPrimary endpoint of the study is RFS in a time-to-event analysis in the Daromun plus surgery and adjuvant therapy treatment group (Arm 1) versus the surgery plus adjuvant therapy control group (Arm 2). Analysis will be based on the \"Intention To Treat\" population.\n\nThe key secondary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun treatment followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy improves in a statistically significant manner the overall survival (OS) of patients with resectable Stage IIIB/ or C melanoma patients with respect to the standard of care (surgery and adjuvant therapy).\n\nFor patients enrolled in both arms, local approved post-surgery adjuvant therapies (as part of the standard of care) are allowed and decided at the investigator's discretion. These include high-dose interferon- \u03b12b, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (e.g. Ipilimumab), anti-PD1 antibodies (e.g. Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab), targeted therapies (e.g. Dabrafenib + Trametinib), or other new local approved treatments."
