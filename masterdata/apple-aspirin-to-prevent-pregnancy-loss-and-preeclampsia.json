Does this dose and timing of aspirin reduce the risk of pregnancy loss compared to standard recommendations? Participants will begin taking at no later than 6 weeks 6 days gestational age, either 162mg of aspirin through delivery or placebo until 12 weeks and then 81mg of aspirin through delivery."
