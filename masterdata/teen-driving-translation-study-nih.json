            "detailedDescription": "For this study, 290 teen and parent/guardian dyads will be randomized into one of three study groups for 12 months with 6 months of active data collection. Teens will be aged 16-17 who committed a moving-related traffic violation and their parent/legal guardian who is most involved with their driving. Dyads will be recruited from both urban and rural counties in Ohio following the teen's moving violation conviction. The study will determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention on teens' risky driving events, unsafe driving behaviors, traffic violation recidivism, and motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), as well as frequency and quality of parent-teen communications about safe driving practices. Additionally, the study will determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the peer-delivered intervention vs. expert-delivered intervention on the outcomes of the interest. Finally, the study will assess the barriers/facilitators to the adoption and implementation of the intervention in rural and urban families."
