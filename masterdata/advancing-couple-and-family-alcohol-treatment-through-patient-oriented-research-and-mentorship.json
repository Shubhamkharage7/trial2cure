            "briefSummary": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health problem that results in significant health and economic burdens including mortality, morbidity, and poor treatment outcomes. A well-developed field of research suggests that alcohol misuse and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can lead to IPV. Individuals with PTSD and/or problematic drinking behaviors are at risk for IPV because of several factors that are common symptoms of PTSD. Because individuals with PTSD often drink alcohol to \"self-medicate\" or cope with distressing PTSD symptoms, PTSD co-occurs with alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder at extraordinarily high rates. However, few studies have examined the combined effects of alcohol misuse and PTSD on any form of violence.\n\nThis study will examine the effects of alcohol misuse and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on alcohol-related intimate partner violence (IPV). We will examine these associations among couples (N=70) in a controlled laboratory setting using validated, standardized methods in a 'real-world' settings using 28 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA).",
            "detailedDescription": "Alcohol misuse has a salient precipitous effect on intimate partner violence (IPV), which is a persistent public health crisis affecting approximately one-third of the U.S. population. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent, has a clear causal effect on alcohol misuse, and it is a robust independent predictor of IPV. However, few studies have examined the combined effects of PTSD and alcohol misuse on IPV. This question is critical to address because effective prevention and treatment approaches for alcohol-related IPV are scant. Integrating these two siloed areas of the literature can help inform the development of novel, trauma-informed modalities for couples to produce stronger and more sustainable outcomes. Dr. Flanagan is the ideal candidate to advance the clinical science in this area. Under the proposed mid-career development award, she will accelerate her thriving patient-oriented alcohol research program by enhancing her skills with 1) oral alcohol administration, 2) intensive ambulatory assessment, and 3) psychophysiology. She will achieve these goals through expert consultation, didactic training, and implementation of the proposed research project. Her team will examine the combined effects of alcohol misuse and PTSD on alcohol-related IPV among couples (N=70) in both a controlled laboratory setting and in naturalistic settings. The study, which was designed to complement mentees' independent research interests, will also compare outcomes across settings and explore heart rate variability as a physiological mechanism underlying the hypothesized relations. The invaluable protected time and resources provided by this K24 will enable Dr. Flanagan to achieve her primary goal of expanding her mentoring availability and skillset at this pivotal mid-career stage. She will engage a program of didactics and expert coaching to amplify her investment in diversity, equity, and inclusion in mentoring, leadership, and science. Achieving these synergistic objectives will accelerate the science of couple and family alcohol research and set the stage for innovative new dyadic treatments. This award will also ensure that Dr. Flanagan is equipped to support the next generation of enthusiastic new investigators and to ensure the longevity of this vital yet underrepresented area of the alcohol field."
