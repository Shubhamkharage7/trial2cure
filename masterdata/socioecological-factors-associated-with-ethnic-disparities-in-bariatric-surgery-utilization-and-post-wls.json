Compare the relationship between the blood and the gut microbiomes among a sample of (1) pre-WLS and (2) 6-month post-WLS participants.\n\nHypothesis: Blood bacterial composition will resemble that of the gut microbiome among pre-WLS participants. Because the effect of WLS on the blood microbiome is not known, our post-WLS results will be mostly exploratory.\n\n* Aim 2. Determine racial differences in the blood microbiome of the pre- and post-WLS groups.\n\nHypothesis2: Ethnic differences will be detected in both the pre- and post-WLS groups.",

A total of 100 participants will be recruited, 50 participants will be recruited from the \"non-completers\" and the other 50 participants will be recruited from the \"6 months post-WLS\" follow-up group of our main project."
