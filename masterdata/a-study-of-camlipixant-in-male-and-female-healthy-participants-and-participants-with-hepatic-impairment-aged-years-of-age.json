Simultaneous use of condom and a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide for the female partner.\n\nb. No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy has been performed 4 months or more prior to dosing.

A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test urine or serum as required by local regulations) within specify timeframe before the first dose of study intervention. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.\n3. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.\n\n   * Participants must weigh at least 50 kilogram (kg) and have a Body mass index (BMI) \\>= 18.0 and \\<= 40.0 kilograms per square meter (kg/m\\^2), at the screening visit.\n   * Continuous non-smoker who has not used nicotine- and tobacco-containing products or light smoker (\\<= 5 cigarettes/day or the equivalent) for the last 3 months prior to study screening.\n   * Participant who understands the study procedures in the informed consent form (ICF) and is willing and able to comply with the protocol.\n\nAdditional inclusion criteria for hepatic impaired participants.\n\n* Participants aside from HI, be sufficiently healthy for study participation based upon medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, and screening clinical laboratory profiles, as deemed by the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee, including the following:\n\n  1.
