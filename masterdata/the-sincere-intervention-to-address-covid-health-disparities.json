With statewide community service providers, existing health information technology, and piloted methods, we seek to determine the effectiveness of universal social needs screening and community service referrals - the SINCERE intervention - in improving health outcomes of COVID-19 vulnerable and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and whether intensive follow-up and collaborative goal-setting helps overcome barriers to community service use by patients seen in the emergency department and seeking COVID testing at community-based and mobile clinic locations."
