            "briefSummary": "Given the likelihood of COVID-19 remaining an endemic disease among high-risk populations, establishing effective mitigation interventions will be critical to stemming community transmission. Criminal justice-involved individuals are extremely important to reducing community-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to their increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 while incarcerated and their likelihood of living in congregate settings after incarceration. The investigators will evaluate an onsite Point-of-Care SARS-CoV-2 testing and education strategy in a corrections-focused community-based organization and its impact on improving testing uptake, mitigation behaviors(e.g. mask wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing, vaccine uptake when available), and cost-effectiveness.",
            "detailedDescription": "The United States(U.S.) has experienced higher mortality than any other nation due to COVID-19 with nearly 13.5 million cases and over 268,103 deaths. Due to the limited ability to socially distance, poor ventilation, and limited hygiene supplies, U.S. prisons and jails have observed explosive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 accounting for the 10 largest U.S. outbreaks. Because 95% of criminal justice-involved individuals reenter societyCOVID-19 transmission extends beyond those who are currently incarcerated. As justice-involved individuals reenter the community, they face high rates of homelessness, and many others live in other congregate settings such as converted hotels and halfway houses. The increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 while incarcerated coupled with the likelihood of living in congregate settings after incarceration, create conditions ripe for rapid COVID-19 transmission that will be critical to address in order to gain control of COVID-19 in the U.S. The goal of this study is to test the impact and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among justice-involved individuals recently released from incarceration. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of an onsite Point-of-Care SARS-CoV-2 testing and education intervention with community health workers (CHWs) as a central component compared to the standard of care at a community-based organization (CBO) that provides services to justice-involved individuals in New York City. The investigators will measure costs of testing, education, and navigation, and explore the cost-effectiveness of the onsite Point-of-Care intervention compared to the standard of care. The specific aims are to:1) Test the effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-CoV-2 intervention in a corrections-focused CBO; 2) Model the cost-effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-CoV-2 intervention among CJIs compared to SoC. Because testing, education, and navigation will be provided by CHWs in a culturally-sensitive environment and test results will be received in minutes (rather than days), the investigators hypothesize that O-PoC will be associated with improved testing uptake and receipt of test results, mitigation behaviors (mask wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing), and those who attend more O-PoC sessions will have better adherence to mitigation behaviors."
