            "briefSummary": "In this research study, we will assess the safety, tolerability, comfort, and feasibility of lowering intraocular pressure using a novel Contact Lens Drug Delivery System with latanoprost. Latanoprost is a well-studied medication and has been used to treat glaucoma for decades. Currently, latanoprost is FDA-approved to be administered to patients as eye drops, but using eye drops has challenges (having to remember to take the drop, getting the drop in the eye). This clinical trial is being done to determine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of using latanoprost to deliver latanoprost in a new way (through a drug-eluting contact lens).\n\nThe study includes two phases. Phase A is intended to assess safety and tolerability and Phase B to assess safety and effectiveness.",
            "detailedDescription": "In Phase A of this study, five subjects will wear the latanoprost-eluting contact lens (L-CL) for one week. Phase A is designed to assess for safety and tolerability. In Phase B of this research study, we will compare the L-CL to placebo. Patients will be randomized to one of 2 groups. Subjects in Group 1 will receive the contact lens with latanoprost in it (latanoprost contact lens, or \"L-CL\") and placebo eye drops. Subjects in Group 2 will receive a standard, commercial contact lens (or \"C-CL) that contains no latanoprost but will be given latanoprost eye drops. The placebo contact lens (C-CL) is highly similar to the latanoprost-eluting contact lens but contains no latanoprost. The placebo eye drops look just like latanoprost eye drops but contain no latanoprost."

The study has two phases. Phase A is an open-label study with 5 participants; these individuals will wear the L-CL in one eye for one week during which time they will be closely followed with examinations for evaluation of safety. If the L-CL is found to be safe after review of the clinical data by a data and safety monitoring board, phase B will be initiated to assess the safety and effectiveness of delivering latanoprost through the L-CL. This is a double-masked double-dummy study. The L-CL arm will have the drug-eluting latanoprost contact lens (L-CL) and a sham drop, and the latanoprost arm will have a C-CL (no drug) with a nightly 0.005% latanoprost drop.",
