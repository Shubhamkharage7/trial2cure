            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well golimumab and apalutamide work in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer. Golimumab is in a class of medications called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of TNF, a substance in the body that causes inflammation. Apalutamide is in a class of medications called androgen receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male reproductive hormone) to stop the growth and spread of cancer cells. Giving golimumab and apalutamide may work better in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive golimumab subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks for 6 doses and apalutamide orally (PO) daily. Treatment with apalutaminde continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy at baseline and during cycle 4. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), and collection of blood samples at baseline, during cycle 4, and at end of treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months."
