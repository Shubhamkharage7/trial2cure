Fecal microbiota transplantation may effectively reduce the incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea/colitis.",

After 4 hours, patients undergo FMT via colonoscopy over 15-30 minutes.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and then at 3 months."
