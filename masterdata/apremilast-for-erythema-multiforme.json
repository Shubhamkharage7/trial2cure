            "briefSummary": "This study is recruiting patients with chronic, treatment resistant erythema multiforme (EM), which is a disease that can affect the skin and mucous membranes (mucocutaneous). EM often impacts quality of life with pain, anorexia, hospitalization, and related long-term issues. While there are medications used to treat EM, no single therapeutic agent has been consistently effective for long-term management of disease. Apremilast (trade name: Otezla) is approved to treat Bechet's Disease, a different but similar mucocutaneous disease. In this study, eligible patients will receive apremilast for 6 months of treatment so we can evaluate if there is a difference in pain and the number of EM flares compared to prior to treatment with apremilast."
