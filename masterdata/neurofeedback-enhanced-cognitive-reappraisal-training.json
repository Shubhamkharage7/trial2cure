The goal of this project is to understand how receiving feedback about one's own brain activity relates to emotion regulation ability. This work will help the study team understand the brain areas involved in emotion regulation and could lay the groundwork to test if psychotherapy outcomes can be enhanced using neurofeedback.\n\nThe study hypothesis include:\n\n* Participants receiving veritable-Neurofeedback (NF) will show a greater activation increase in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to sham-NF\n* Participants receiving veritable-NF will show greater cognitive reappraisal (CR) ability compared to those receiving sham-NF\n* Prefrontal cortex activation will positively correlate with CR ability\n* The veritable-NF group will report decreased symptom severity and increased CR use compared to the sham-NF group\n* Increase in NF-induced brain activation will correlate with decreased symptom severity and increased CR use at follow-up"
