Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive the STEP-YA intervention either, 1) alone (non-coaching condition), or 2) with the addition of 2 remote coaching sessions (coaching condition). Participants will also complete follow-up measures 4 and 8 weeks post-baseline.\n\nIt expected that about 74 people will take part in this study"
