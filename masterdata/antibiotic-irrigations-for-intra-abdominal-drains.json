Current standard of care includes drain placement in the abscess cavity to reach source control as well as administration of systemic antibiotics. It is common practice to flush the drain on a daily basis to ensure patency. This study aims to analyze the clinical impact of a higher local concentration of antibiotics (rather than normal saline) provided through drain irrigation with an antimicrobial agent (Gentamicin and/or Clindamycin) compare to normal saline.",
            "detailedDescription": "People with an abdominal abscess who undergo drain placement will have those drains irrigated twice/day with either normal saline (placebo group) or with the above antibiotic solution for a total of 7 days or less if the drain were to be removed earlier. Outcomes of interest are duration of systemic antibiotics, and WBC and temperature curve."
