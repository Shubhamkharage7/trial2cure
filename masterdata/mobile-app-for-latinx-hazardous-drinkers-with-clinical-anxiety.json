Next, Latinx hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety will assess program navigation and conduct usability testing. Finally, Latinx hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety will be recruited to complete the final prototype of the mobile health application in order to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial effects. Initial screening will be conducted via telephone; baseline and post-treatment data will be collected in-person; and 1-week, 1-month, and 3-months follow-up data will be collected remotely."
