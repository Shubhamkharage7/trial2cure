            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of an evidence-based parenting program, The Chicago Parent Program (CPP) adapted for foster and kinship caregivers of young children (CPP-FC). A parallel, two-arm, randomized controlled trial of 300 caregiver-youth dyads will be conducted, comparing the impact of CPP-FC versus a usual care control on caregivers and foster youth. Quantitative and qualitative data about CPP-FC will be collected from foster and kinship caregivers and through observations of caregivers and youth. The findings from this study will demonstrate whether CPP-FC is effective in reducing behavior problems in young foster children and whether that contributes to reduced caregiver stress, increased caregiver confidence, increased positive parenting behavior, and longer lengths of time that children remain with foster and kinship caregivers, preventing unnecessary moves from one caregiver to another and improving child wellbeing."
