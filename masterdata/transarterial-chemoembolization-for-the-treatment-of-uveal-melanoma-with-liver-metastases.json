            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of transarterial chemoembolization in treating patients with uveal melanoma that has spread to the liver (liver metastases). Transarterial chemoembolization involves the injection of a blocking agent (gelatin sponge, ethiodized oil) and a chemotherapy agent (carmustine) directly into the artery in the liver to treat liver cancers. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carmustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. transarterial chemoembolization with carmustine in combination with ethiodized oil and gelatin sponge may help cause the tumors in the liver to shrink or disappear.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nTo determine the efficacy (clinical response) in terms of disease control rate (DCR) (complete response \\[CR\\] + partial response \\[PR\\] + stable disease \\[SD\\]) with chemoembolization of hepatic metastases with 300 mg of carmustine (BCNU) in ethiodized oil in metastatic uveal melanoma patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo investigate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases.\n\nTo assess the toxicity of the above treatment regimen.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by receiving an infusion of carmustine dissolved in ethiodized oil and an injection of gelatin sponge. Treatment repeats once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for bilobar disease or once every 7 weeks (Q7W) for unilobar disease in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until maximum clinical benefit is obtained.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 2 months for up to 2 years."
