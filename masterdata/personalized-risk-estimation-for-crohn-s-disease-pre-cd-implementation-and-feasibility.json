We hypothesize that personalized risk disclosure via the PRE-CD educational tool is both feasible and successful in modifying behaviors associated with Crohn's disease risk and normalizing pre-clinical disease biomarkers when compared to standard Crohn's disease education. Broadly, completion of this project will also help elucidate the role of lifestyle and dietary factors in pre-clinical Crohn's disease development in high-risk individuals, and provide novel insight into potential strategies for disease prevention in this population."
