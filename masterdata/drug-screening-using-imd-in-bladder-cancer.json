            "briefSummary": "This research study involves implanting up to 4 microdevices, each small enough to fit inside the tip of a needle, into a tumor. These devices will release microdoses (many thousands of times less than a treatment dose) of different cancer drugs into the tumor. After approximately 72 hours, the devices and small regions of surrounding tissue will be removed and studied. There will be a follow-up visit within 42 days of device removal to assess for potential safety issues or side effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase I pilot study of microdevice implantation and retrieval in patients with primary bladder cancer. The microdevice is 5x1mm and can be deployed using a biopsy needle placed percutaneously using imaging guidance. The purpose of the microdevice is to measure local intratumor response to antitumor medications in patients with primary bladder cancer. The microdevice contains multiple, separate reservoirs that are each loaded with a specific drug or drug combination.\n\nCandidate patients will first be evaluated based on a CT or MRI, obtained as part of clinical care, and a physician who will determine whether the target lesion is amenable for microdevice implantation. Microdevice implantation will occur via cystoscopy using a flexible grasper (similar to that used for ureteral stent removal). Several independent microdevices will be placed per patient and target lesion. After implantation, the reservoirs release microdoses of each drug allowing the drug to interact with the tumor tissue in its native microenvironment. After device removal and before pathologic analysis, a repeat plain film X-ray of the bladder will be obtained to evaluate for microdevice migration. The microdevice(s) will be removed along with the target tumor as part of standard-of-care surgical excision. The tumor tissue surrounding the device will undergo pathologic and molecular analysis to assess local drug efficacy for each reservoir. These analyses will explore the impact of drug treatment on local cellular processes (e.g., apoptosis, pathway signaling).\n\nThe investigators will also investigate preliminary correlations between drug response as assessed by the microdevice and clinical outcomes and response to therapy. Collectively, these studies will establish the feasibility of clinical application of a drug-sensitivity microdevice in bladder cancer and the capacity of such a device to predict systemic response to cancer therapeutics."
