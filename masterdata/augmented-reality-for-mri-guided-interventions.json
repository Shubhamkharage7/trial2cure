            "detailedDescription": "This pilot clinical study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of using a needle guidance system during MRI-guided procedures in up to 12 patients. The MRI-compatible needle guidance system was developed under an NIH funded SBIR Phase II grant. This system has been evaluated by our Interventional Radiology team in phantom, volunteer, and cadaver studies which showed potential benefit of use in patients. Inclusion of the needle guidance system will not change the standard of care or substantively affect procedural technique as currently performed. This system provides the operator with an augmented reality (AR) display to better visualize the needle entry point and trajectory as it is inserted toward the target. This additional information could improve needle placement accuracy and shorten procedural time."
