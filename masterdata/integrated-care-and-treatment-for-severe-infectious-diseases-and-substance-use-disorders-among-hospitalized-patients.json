            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of an integrated infectious disease/substance use disorder (SUD) clinical team intervention approach in patients hospitalized with severe injection-related infections (SIRI) who use drugs. The main question this study aims to answer is whether this intervention approach will be associated with lower mortality and fewer hospital readmissions. Participants will participate in the integrated SUD/ID care team intervention (SIRI Team). Researchers will compare this intervention to treatment as usual (TUA) to see if there are any differences in health outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study intervention (\"SIRI Team\") consists of a hospital-based multidisciplinary (ID/SUD consult) team that will provide intensive, integrated care for participants' ID and SUD both during the hospital stay and post-discharge for up to four months post-randomization. The SIRI Team will provide low barrier access to medications and harm reduction services for SUD; streamline ID/SUD treatment; provide longitudinal care with familiar providers; leverage different areas of expertise between physicians, advance practice providers, and patient navigators; and create patient-centered treatment plans, tailored to the individual, and informed by each patient's social circumstances, substance use, and personal goals/desires. The SIRI Team intervention will be grounded in a harm reduction approach. The intervention duration is approximately 4 months. Participants will complete follow-up visits at 4-, 8-, and 12-months post-randomization."
