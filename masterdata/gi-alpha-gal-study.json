            "detailedDescription": "Each participant will be randomized to undergo two double-blind food challenges with at least a 10-day washout period between the challenges. One food challenge will contain pork meat with alpha gal sugar; one challenge will contain pork meat without the alpha gal sugar. During the challenges, participants will drink lactulose and C13 mannitol dissolved in water. The principal investigator and clinical research coordinators will be blinded to the challenges during the course of the study. The metabolic kitchen and a delegated research staff member will be unblinded.\n\nOn consenting patients, a transnasal upper endoscopy (TNE) will be performed on each challenge day, pre-challenge, at hour 0 and post-challenge, at hour 6. During the TNE, esophagus, stomach and small bowel samples will be collected. Gastrointestinal pathology samples will be evaluated for inflammatory cells and also biobanked for further messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing studies.\n\nBlood and urine will be collected during each challenge. Samples will be transported to a lab and analyzed for tryptase, basophil activation, and lactulose/ mannitol levels."
