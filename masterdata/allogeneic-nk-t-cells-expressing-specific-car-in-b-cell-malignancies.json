Subjects will be enrolled into 2 parallel cohorts (Cohort A \\[non-ALL\\] and Cohort B \\[ALL\\]). Each cohort will undergo dose escalation independently.\n\nThree (3) dose levels will be evaluated in the ANCHOR and ANCHOR2 studies combined (1\u00d7107/m2, 3\u00d7107/m2, 1\u00d7108/m2). Dose levels are defined based on the number of transduced KUR-502 cells. Body surface area (BSA) will be capped at 2.4 m2. Subjects will receive \\<1\u00d7104 allogeneic T cells/kg at any dose level.\n\nThe MTD will be determined once dose escalation is completed, and all subjects are evaluable for DLT. If there is no DLT that determines an MTD, a maximum dose level will be declared. Dose escalation will stop when 6 subjects have been treated at the MTD or highest dose level."
