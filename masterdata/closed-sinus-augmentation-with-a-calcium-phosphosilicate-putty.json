            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical study is to learn if cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) or 3-dimensional x-ray can help to let the investigator know if dental implant placement can be done after performing closed sinus surgery.\n\nThe study will look at the structure of your gum where the implant will be placed after performing the surgery using 3-D x-ray and compare that to how the structure of your gum looks 6 months later.\n\nThe 3-D imaging will happen after standard of care surgery to prepare your gum for an implant and then 6 months later to verify that the site is ready for the implant.",
            "detailedDescription": "While you are taking part in this study, participants will be asked to attend approximately two visits with the researchers or study staff. For research purposes, one visit is the surgical appointment and a postoperative visit at six months, these will likely be scheduled at standard of care visits.\n\nIf the participant elects a dental implant for tooth replacement, your sinus grafting will be performed, and the dental implant will be placed on the same appointment.\n\nStudy Procedures - as a participant in this research, you will undergo the following procedures:\n\n1. Immediately upon completion of your sinus grafting and dental implant placement a three-dimensional x-ray will be taken in the Graduate Periodontics clinic.\n2. At six months following your dental implant placement an additional three-dimensional x-ray will be taken in the Graduate Periodontics clinic."
