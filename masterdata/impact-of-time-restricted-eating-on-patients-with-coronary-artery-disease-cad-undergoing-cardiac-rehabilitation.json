The study also aims to assess changes in exercise capacity and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels in response to Time Restricted Eating (TRE) and Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation (ICR) versus ICR alone. TMAO is a metabolite, or a substance, produced during digestion and metabolism. Preliminary data illustrates a correlation between high levels of TMAO and higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. We will also be looking at participants' long-term cardiovascular health status after they complete the ICR program."
