The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does AIM-CBCT for PTSD improve PTSD symptoms?\n* Does AIM-CBCT for PTSD improve associated symptoms (e.g., depression), romantic partner distress, and couple relationship satisfaction?\n\nParticipants will participate in a two-day retreat in which they are taught and practice skills to decrease PTSD symptoms and enhance their relationships. Researchers will compare AIM-CBCT for PTSD to the Prevention and Relationship Education Program (PREP) to determine whether it is superior to an evidence-based relationship education curriculum that is also delivered in a two-day multi-couple group format."
