            "detailedDescription": "Abnormalities in brain chemistry can be responsible for the hallucinations and delusions; thus, by treating these abnormalities, physicians can reduce symptoms of schizophrenia. In this study, investigators aim to examine the characteristics of two investigational radiotracers, \\[18F\\]AZAN and \\[18F\\]ASEM, in the brains of people with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Radiotracers are drugs in which one or more atoms are \"labeled\" with a small amount of radioactivity that allows investigators to see how the drug works in humans using PET and MRI brain imaging techniques."
