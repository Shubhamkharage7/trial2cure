            "briefSummary": "People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at exceptionally high risk of frequent emergency department (ED) and hospital use, poor functional outcomes, and increased morbidity and mortality from poorly managed chronic health conditions and complex social needs. Evidence-based interventions of particular promise for reducing ED and hospital utilization and improving health outcomes and meeting social needs involve:1) providing care in the community to overcome barriers including transportation and fear of stigmatization; 2) coordination of care transitions following ED or hospital discharge to improve access to needed community supports and reduce the risk of readmission; and 3) using mHealth technology to link PEH with appropriate community-based health and social services. This project builds on evidence from two feasibility studies in order to integrate and test a mHealth intervention, comprised of GPS technology and text messaging components, into a community setting to connect PEH with a community-based case manager and healthcare and social services. Our hypothesis is that integrating the mHealth intervention into an established, trusted navigation center for PEH will mitigate barriers to care and gaps in the care continuum resulting in decreased ED and hospital use and improved health outcomes and attainment of social needs. The study aim is to conduct a stratified RCT to compare a mHealth intervention with usual care community-based case management to examine the impact on healthcare utilization (primary outcome), medication adherence, social support, psychological distress and social needs attainment (secondary outcomes) in PEH."

The purpose of the assessment is to identify relevant health and social needs that the case manager can assist the participant in addressing by connecting with other medical and social services in the community.
