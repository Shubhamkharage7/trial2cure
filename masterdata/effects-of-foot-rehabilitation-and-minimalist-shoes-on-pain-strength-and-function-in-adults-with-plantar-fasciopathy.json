            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effects of 8 weeks of foot rehabilitation exercises in conjunction with wearing minimalist shoes in individuals with plantar fasciopathy, compared to only performing foot rehabilitation exercises. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Will individuals with plantar fasciopathy be able to reduce their pain and improve their self-reported function by performing rehabilitation exercises and wearing minimalist shoes, compared to those only performing rehabilitation exercises?\n* Will individuals with plantar fasciopathy be able to increase their intrinsic foot muscle strength and size, their balance, and gait biomechanics by performing rehabilitation exercises and wearing minimalist shoes, compared to those only performing rehabilitation exercises?\n* What characteristics of individuals with plantar fasciopathy make them most suited to succeed in a protocol of performing rehabilitation exercises and wearing minimalist shoes?\n\nParticipants will be asked to come into the lab at the start of the intervention and after 8 weeks, where the following will be assessed:\n\n* Patient-reported outcomes\n* Foot morphology\n* Intrinsic foot muscle strength\n* Balance\n* Gait biomechanics\n\nFor the intervention, participants in both groups will perform the same rehabilitation exercises, including:\n\n* Massage to the bottom of the foot\n* Calf-raises\n* Calf and foot stretches",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of 8-weeks of wearing minimalist shoes and performing a home exercise program (intervention group) on pain, self-reported function, intrinsic foot muscle strength and size, balance, and gait biomechanics, as opposed to receiving a home exercise program alone (control group).\n\nAll participants will report to the Exercise and Sport Injury Laboratory for a baseline clinical assessment performed by a blinded assessor to determine their level of pain and their self-reported function using a variety of patient-reported outcomes. These include pain levels on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Global Rating of Change to assess perceived changes in function, Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) to gather general and foot-related health information, and a variety of scales that assess kinesiophobia, fear-avoidance belief, self-efficacy, and activity level. Functional measures include intrinsic foot muscle strength via diagnostic ultrasound, intrinsic foot muscle size via two different types of handheld dynamometer, balance via a single-leg balancing task on a force plate, and gait biomechanics via a walking task with insoles that can obtain measures of force and loading rate.\n\nAt the end of the first baseline visit, all participants will be taught how to perform the home rehabilitation exercise routine, and handed an informational sheet that will have pictures and links to supplemental videos to ensure that they understand the exercises and have the resources to review.\n\nImmediately following the first baseline visit, participants will meet with another member of the study team to ensure assessor blinding. They will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the intervention group of foot rehabilitation and minimalist shoes (intervention), or the control group of just rehabilitation exercises (control). The randomization sequence will be created a priori with a random-number generator stratified by sex, placed in sealed opaque envelopes by another member of the study team to blind the assessor. Participants in the intervention group will have a pair of shoes ordered for them, and they will begin the protocol when the shoes have arrived.\n\nParticipants in both groups will be instructed to fill out a daily survey that will be sent via text and stored in a secure server (REDCap), that will indicate if they have completed their rehabilitation exercises. Participants will also all wear Fitbit smart watches that will track their step count and some other health-related metrics. They will not be able to see their own data during the protocol.\n\nAt the 4-week mark of the study, all individuals will be sent a link to take surveys of patient-reported outcomes, including pain levels, self-reported function, kinesiophobia, fear-avoidance belief, self-efficacy, and activity level. They will also complete a phone call with a member of the study team (not the assessor, to maintain blinding) as a check-in to discuss pain levels and any other questions and concerns they have.\n\nAt the end of the 8-weeks, individuals will return to the lab to have the same measures as the baseline session completed. The investigators will then be able to determine if performing foot rehabilitation exercises and wearing minimalist shoes reduces pain, improves self-reported function, and increases intrinsic foot muscle strength and size, balance, and gait biomechanics, compared to baseline and to the control group."
