            "briefSummary": "This is the first study of AMT-130 in patients with early manifest HD and is designed to establish safety and proof-of-concept (PoC). CT-AMT-130-01 is a Phase I/II, randomized, multicenter, multiple dose, double-blind, imitation surgery, first-in-human (FIH) study.\n\nCohort 3 participants will receive either high or low dose (1:1 randomization). Participants enrolled in Cohort 3 will also receive an immunosuppression regimen consisting of dexamethasone, sirolimus, and rituximab.",
            "detailedDescription": "AMT-130 is an investigational, single administration gene therapy intended to modify the disease course for HD. Preclinical studies have shown that AMT-130 lowers huntingtin protein and is associated with decreased progression of Huntington's Disease signs in animal models.\n\nCohort 1 \\& 2 consists of a blinded 12-month Core Study Period to evaluate the safety and potential impact of AMT-130 on disease progression and an unblinded 4-year Long-Term Period with periodic follow-up visits to evaluate the safety of AMT-130 and disease progression in treated individuals. Cohort 2 Sham participants who do not cross over to receive AMT-130 treatment will have the opportunity to participate in the Optional Extended Follow-Up Period and will be followed for an additional 2 years.\n\nFollowing completion of the 12-month blinded post treatment follow-up period (Cohorts 1 \\& 2 only), once the crossover has been activated after review of data by the DSMB, subjects randomized to the imitation (sham) procedure who continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be allowed to crossover to receive AMT-130 treatment.\n\nCohort 3 participants will receive either high or low dose AMT-130. Following completion of the Month 36 visit, they will be unblinded to their treatment arm. Cohort 3 will further evaluate the safety and exploratory efficacy data of low or high dose AMT-130. Cohort 3 participants will also receive pre and post-operative immunosuppressant therapies composed of dexamethasone, sirolimus, and rituximab."
