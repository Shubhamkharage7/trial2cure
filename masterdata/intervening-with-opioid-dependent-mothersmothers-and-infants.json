            "briefSummary": "This study will assess the efficacy of the modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up (mABC) Intervention, adapted for use with peripartum mothers receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. The investigators expect that mothers who receive the modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up Intervention will show more nurturing and sensitive parenting and more adaptive physiological regulation than parents who receive a control intervention. The investigators expect that infants whose mothers receive the modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up will show better outcomes in attachment, behavior, and physiological regulation than infants of parents who receive the control intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pregnant mothers will be randomly assigned to receive the modified ABC intervention or the control intervention (modified DEF). Hypotheses relate to parent and child outcomes associated with the intervention. Hypothesis 1: Compared to mothers who receive the control intervention, mothers who receive the mABC intervention will show more nurturing and sensitive parenting, enhanced neural activity during parenting-relevant tasks, and more normative patterns of DNA methylation, autonomic nervous system activity, and cortisol production. Hypothesis 2: Compared to infants of mothers who receive the control intervention, infants of mothers who receive the mABC intervention will show more organized and secure attachment patterns, better behavioral regulation during stressors, more advanced social-emotional development, and more normative patterns of DNA methylation, autonomic nervous system activity, and cortisol production. Hypothesis 3: Enhanced maternal sensitivity will mediate effects of the mABC intervention on improved infant outcomes."
