The hypothesis is that combined ibuprofen and acetaminophen therapy will effectively provide better pain control than ibuprofen alone or a placebo after orthodontic appliance placement.",

This study will investigate two modes of pain management versus a placebo. Consented subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: Group A, a combined and simultaneous therapy of 200 mg ibuprofen and 650 mg acetaminophen (3 pills total) taken orally at set time intervals (0 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24h, 48h, 72h, and 96h); Group B, ibuprofen alone (200 mg) taken orally at same time intervals (1 ibuprofen and 2 placebo pills); Group C, placebo taken orally at the same time intervals (3 placebo pills).\n\nThe study will be blinded for the investigators, patients, and statisticians."
