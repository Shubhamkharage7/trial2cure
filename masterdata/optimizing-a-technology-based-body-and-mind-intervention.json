            "briefSummary": "Older adults may feel at risk for falling, but do not have a physical risk of falling. On the other hand, some older adults may not feel at risk for falling, but do have a physical risk of falling. This study is being done to test a preventative, in-home exercise program (called PEER) which may allow older adults to improve balance, align the perceived risk for falling with the physical risk for falling, and prevent falls. Participants will be asked to participate in this study for approximately 9 months. This study has three specific aims:\n\n1. Examine differences in balance, fall risk, and physical activity after program completion, follow-up 3 months and 6 months between older adults (OAs) in the Physio-fEedback Exercise pRogram (PEER) intervention and OAs in attention control (AC) condition.\n2. Explore differences in exercise adherence and the proportion of shifting in fall risk appraisal and negative self-perception on aging after program completion, follow-up 3 months and 6 months between OAs in the PEER intervention and OAs in AC condition.\n3. Explore participants' experiences with the PEER intervention and potential barriers to access and adoption of the technology-based PEER intervention to inform future research.\n\nParticipants will be asked to participate in this study for approximately 9 months. This includes the baseline assessment, 8 weeks of PEER activities or attention control activities, and follow-up assessments at 3 months and 6 months. After the informed consent and completion of the baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to either the PEER intervention or the attention control (AC) group. Participants in the PEER intervention group will be asked to participate in group exercises (60 minutes per week for 8 weeks) and home-based exercises (twice a week for 8 weeks) that focus on balance, strength training with a peer coach. Participants in the AC group will receive an information pamphlet developed by the CDC about falls called Simple Exercises for Improving Balance and Preventing Falls in Older Adults. Topics include information on fall risks, how to prevent falls, how to check for safety, postural hypotension, and chair rise exercises. The control group will be encouraged to discuss fall prevention with a primary care provider and continue normal activities."
