            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial compares the effect of malnutrition screening and dietary intervention to standard nutrition care on patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Fewer than 20% of patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer do not survive one year after diagnosis so treatment often focuses on improving quality of life. Many patients experience increasing pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss and weakness. Behavioral interventions use techniques to help patients change the way they react to environmental triggers that may cause a negative reaction. Screening for inadequate nutrition (malnutrition) and providing weekly nutritional support may be effective methods to improve nutritional status and improve overall quality of life for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the quality of life of subjects after 12 weeks between the intervention group with nutrition optimization with dietary prescription and nutrition support in comparison to standard care.\n\nII. To compare the frequency of hospitalization and length of stay (LOS) after 12 weeks between the intervention group with nutrition optimization with dietary prescription and nutrition support in comparison to standard care.\n\nIII. To compare the subject's functional status, body weight and dietary intake after 12 weeks between the intervention group with nutrition optimization with dietary prescription and nutrition support in comparison to standard care.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive standard nutrition care and record dietary intake and physical activity using Myfitness Pal smartphone application on study.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo malnutrition screening with a registered dietician at baseline and participate in 12 weekly nutrition support sessions and those at moderate to high risk for malnutrition receive a personalized diet prescription on study. Patients also record dietary intake and physical activity using Myfitness Pal smartphone application on study."
