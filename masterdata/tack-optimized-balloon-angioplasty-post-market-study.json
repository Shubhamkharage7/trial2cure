Additional data, such as clinical utility of the Tack Endovascular System with the combined use of adjunctive therapies - other than balloon angioplasty alone, is needed.\n\nPatients with claudication or CLI, who meet Rutherford classification 3, 4, or 5 criteria if ATK and Rutherford classification criteria 4 or 5 if BTK, who have undergone an above the knee (ATK) or below the knee (BTK) endovascular procedure utilizing adjunctive therapies other than balloon angioplasty alone which are then followed by PTA and IVUS, and have an arterial dissection requiring repair.\n\nApproximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in up to 10 sites. The enrollment will be capped as follows:\n\n* ATK: 50% of subjects\n* BTK: 50% of subjects\n\nAfter enrollment of planned 100 subjects and interim analysis, the study may enroll up to 200 additional subjects at up to 20 additional sites, with each site limited to 15% of total enrollment."
