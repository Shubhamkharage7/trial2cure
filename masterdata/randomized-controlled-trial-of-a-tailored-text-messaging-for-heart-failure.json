            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine whether an individually tailored text messaging intervention can improve self-care in older adult patients with heart failure. The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is a tailored text messaging intervention feasible and acceptable among older adult patients with heart failure?\n* Does tailored text messaging improve self-care in adult patients with heart failure?\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups for 12 weeks: 1) intervention (text messaging); or 2) control group. Both groups will receive usual care, which includes regular follow-up visits at the heart failure clinic (standard care), plus a \"Discharge Packet for Patients Diagnosed with Heart Failure\", developed by the American Heart Association. Both groups will be asked via text messages and/or telephone calls to complete questionnaires at baseline/start, 4 weeks and 12 weeks, about self-care, quality of life, health beliefs, medications, diet, etc.\n\nParticipants assigned to the intervention group will also receive 5 text messages/week targeting medication adherence, heart-healthy diet, and daily HF symptoms monitoring for 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Heart failure (HF) is a serious chronic condition and the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Almost 7 million Americans are diagnosed with HF and new cases are rapidly rising at a rate of nearly 1 million per year. This feasibility pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted using individually tailored text message (TM) intervention, delivered to improve HF self-care adherence.\n\nThis randomized controlled trial in older adult patients (\u226550 years of age) with HF to determine the feasibility (recruitment capability, acceptability), and preliminary efficacy of the Text4HF intervention compared with usual care over 12 weeks. Forty (n=40) patients from the University of Illinois Hospital \\& Health Sciences System (UIH) will be randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group. Patients in the TM intervention (TEXT4HF) will receive messages that target the most common self-care factors known to precipitate HF hospitalizations (medication adherence, heart-healthy diet, and daily HF symptoms monitoring)."
