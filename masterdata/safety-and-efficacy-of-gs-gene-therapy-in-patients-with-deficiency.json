            "detailedDescription": "This study is a first in human (FIH) open-label, dose escalation study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of administration of an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) carrying the gene encoding N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) in subjects with NGLY1 Deficiency. The study treatment will be delivered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. All outcomes (primary, secondary, exploratory) will be assessed at 52 weeks. Safety will be monitored continuously throughout the study for adverse / serious adverse events and dose limiting toxicities. Efficacy outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 52 weeks. The co-primary outcomes will be change from baseline in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GlcNAc-Asn (GNA, or N-acetylglucosamine), the NGLY1 Deficiency biomarker, and change in motor subdomain on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-4). Secondary outcomes will include weight (Z-score), clinical and caregiver impressions of change, and other neurocognitive assessment tools. Exploratory outcomes will include brain volumes as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), quality of life assessments (including sleep habits), liver function test results, and lacrimation assessments. Each participant will be followed for safety and efficacy for 5 years after treatment."

Oxygen saturation on room air \\< 92%\n* Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator or the study medical monitor would prevent the patient from fully complying with the requirements of the study (including the corticosteroid treatment outline in the protocol) and/or would impact or interfere with the evaluation and interpretation of patient safety or efficacy results\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to the GS-100 investigational product formulation\n* Prior treatment with gene therapy\n* Treatment with any investigational product (IP) within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the IP, whichever is longer, prior to screening period. For patients who have received a prior investigational product, all ongoing AEs experienced while receiving the investigational product must have been resolved prior to screening for this study\n* Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study that does not interfere with the requirements of the current protocol and does not have the potential to impact the evaluation of safety and efficacy of GS-100\n* Liver dysfunction at screening as defined by the following\n\n  1. ALT: \\> 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  2. aspartate aminotransferase (AST): \\> 3 x ULN\n  3. INR: \u22651.4 x ULN\n  4.
