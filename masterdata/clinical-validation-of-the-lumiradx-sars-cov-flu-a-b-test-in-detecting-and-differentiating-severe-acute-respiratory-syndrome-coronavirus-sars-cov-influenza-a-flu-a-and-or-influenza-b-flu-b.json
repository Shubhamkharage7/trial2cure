Up to 1,500 or more symptomatic subjects who are currently experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 and Influenza A \\& B may be enrolled.\n\nThe samples are obtained from each subject using standard collection methods and are processed and tested by untrained operators without laboratory training and with no prior experience using the candidate test.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance (positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement and 95% confidence intervals for upper and lower bounds) of the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 \\& Flu A/B test for the qualitative and differential detection of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A \\& B virus antigen using anterior nares samples collected by a healthcare professional, compared to a 510(k) cleared or Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) high-sensitivity reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 and a 510(k) cleared Influenza A/B test.\n\nThe secondary objective is to assess the usability and user accuracy/performance around limit of detection (LoD) of the investigational test using a questionnaire and accuracy study."
