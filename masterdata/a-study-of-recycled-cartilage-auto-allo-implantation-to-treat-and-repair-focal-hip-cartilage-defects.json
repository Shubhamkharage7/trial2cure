There are not enough cartilage cells to fill the defect so cartilage cells need to be mixed with MSCs. MSCs or Mesenchymal Stem Cells are naturally occurring cells that provide growth factors and cell signals that play a role in tissue repair. MSCs can be found in bone marrow and in the fatty tissues (i.e., area under the skin of the belly or breast) of patients. Fibrin glue is a product made from the naturally occurring compounds in blood which cause clotting. This glue hardens into a gel-like substance into which cells such as cartilage cells (chondrons) and AMSCs can be placed.",

Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will not be administered, and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit. Persons becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will be recorded.\n* Chronic (\\> 3 months), unilaterally symptomatic, ICRS Grade III or IV cartilage lesions ranging in size from 2 to 6 cm2. Patients with episodes of contralateral hip pain that is asymptomatic at the time of enrollment will be eligible for inclusion. However, patients with previous episodes of contralateral hip pain who experience a repeat episode of contralateral pain similar to their established pattern of pain during the course of the trial will not be considered as having experienced an adverse event.\n* Radiographic hip OA of T\u00f6nnis Grade 1 or less, consisting of normal hip radiographs (Grade 0) or doubtful narrowing of the joint space and possible osteophytic lipping (Grade 1) as agreed upon by two study co-investigators without underlying structural hip abnormalities\n* Previous 6 week or longer trial of one of the following conservative treatments: activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, or injection therapy (e.g. cortisone).
