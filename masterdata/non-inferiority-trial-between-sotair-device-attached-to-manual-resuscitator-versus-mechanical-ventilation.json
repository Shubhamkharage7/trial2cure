A disposable safety device, Adult Sotair\u00ae, was created to improve manual ventilation delivery. In this non-inferiority study, we will perform a pre-post study design (single group, within-group comparison) to test the non-inferiority of the Adult Sotair\u00ae device compared to mechanical ventilation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Poor manual ventilation technique is a well-documented problem which occurs irrespective of a provider's qualifications or experience. A disposable safety device, Adult Sotair\u00ae, was created to improve manual ventilation delivery among providers. The device is attached to a bag valve mask (i.e. manual resuscitator) and employs a flow limiting valve mechanism to minimize excessive pressure in the airway system without venting air by capping peak flow rates at 55 L/min. For an average adult with normal lung compliance and resistance, this corresponds to a maximum airway pressure of approximately 20 cmH2O which minimizes air entry into the stomach. In this non-inferiority study, a pre-post study design (single group, within-group comparison) to test the non-inferiority of the Adult Sotair\u00ae device compared to mechanical ventilation with respect to airway pressure."
