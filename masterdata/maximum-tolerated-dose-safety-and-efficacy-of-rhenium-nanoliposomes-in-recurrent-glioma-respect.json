The study uses a modified Fibonacci dose escalation, followed by an expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to determine efficacy. The starting absorbed dose is 1mCi in a volume of 0.660mL.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Phase I portion of the clinical study evaluates a single dose of 186RNL (radionuclide clinical study drug) administered through a convection enhanced delivery catheter (CED catheter) in participants with recurrent Glioma (GBM). The clinical study treatment consists of a single administered dose of 186RNL per participant. The clinical study will include the evaluation of multiple separate dose levels (dose escalation). Three to six participants may be treated at each dose. The maximum number of participants to be enrolled in the study is approximately 21. The clinical study treatment will be administered, following CED placement, by the clinical study physician. Participants will be followed for up to 36 months after the clinical study drug is administered.\n\nThe Phase II portion of the clinical study is a multicenter, single arm, prospective study utilizing a non-DLT dose obtained from the dose escalation portion of IND 116117, NIH-NCI Grant (22.3 mCi (total 186RNL activity) at a concentration of 2.5 mCi/mL and 8.8 mL total volume). The maximum number of participants to be enrolled in the Phase II study is approximately 34. The clinical study treatment will be administered, following CED placement, by the clinical study physician. Participants will be followed for up to 36 months after the clinical study drug is administered.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved 186RNL for this specific disease."
