The future primary outcome will be reduction in CNS PIMs 90 days after an ED visit. Secondary outcomes will include outpatient follow-up, repeat ED visits, and hospitalizations during the 90 days following an ED visit.\n\nAim 3: To demonstrate the acceptability of the PRIDE intervention to outpatient clinicians using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure and qualitative analysis of responses.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an embedded pragmatic clinical trial (ePCT) of the Pharmacist Reconciliation of Inappropriate medications and Deprescribing in the Emergency department (PRIDE) intervention which will be implemented as standard care for all community-dwelling adults (age 18+) in the ED with prior outpatient visits within the Northwestern Medicine (NM) healthcare system who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as clinical pharmacist availability allows. The PRIDE program did not exist prior to the initiation of this study. PRIDE is in the process of being implemented at all three hospitals and will continue beyond the end of the research study.\n\nThis study will take place at 3 hospital emergency departments within the Northwestern Medicine (NM) Healthcare System. Community-dwelling adults (age 18+) in the ED with prior outpatient visits within the NM system and a history of dementia or mild cognitive impairment recorded in the NM EHR will be eligible for the study.\n\nThe primary outcome is the number and percent of patients taking central nervous system potentially inappropriate medications (CNS PIMs) who have documented communication of pharmacist's recommendations for deprescribing on the day of the ED visit. The key secondary outcome is the number and percent of patients with ADRD or MCI in the ED who have documented medication reconciliation by the clinical pharmacist on the day of the ED visit.\n\nPharmacists present in the ED will perform medication reconciliation for eligible patients. This will be done to demonstrate the feasibility of the PRIDE intervention in the ED for patients with ADRD and MCI. Patients eligible for medication reconciliation will be enrolled in Aim 2 of the study.\n\nOutpatient prescribers of these patients who are discharged from the ED will be contacted by the ED pharmacist on the date of ED discharge and will receive a medication report including fill data 90-100 days after the ED visit.\n\nAt the completion of the study, the outpatient clinicians will also receive a questionnaire about the acceptability of the PRIDE program including the Acceptability of Intervention Measure to complete electronically.\n\nCommunity-dwelling adults (age 18+) in the ED with prior outpatient visits within the NM system and a history of dementia or mild cognitive impairment recorded in the NM EHR will be eligible for inclusion. We will include 290 patients across 3 sites to have medication reconciliation conducted by the clinical pharmacist. Patients who were previously prescribed CNS PIMs will have deprescribing recommendations communicated by the clinical pharmacist to the outpatient prescriber."
