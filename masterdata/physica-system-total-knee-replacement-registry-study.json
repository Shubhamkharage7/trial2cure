For ancillary arm, from baseline to 5-year follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a post-market registry study; the study device is FDA cleared and used according to the intended use.\n\nThis is a multi-centre, prospective, non-randomized study.\n\nSubjects will be implanted with one of the following configurations of the Physica system: Physica KR (Kinematic Retaining), Physica CR (Cruciate Retaining) or Physica PS (Posterior Stabilized). The assignment of any patient involved in the study is determined by the aetiology preoperatively evaluated by the Investigator and falls within current practice. The decision to use a specific prosthesis design is decided by the Investigators independently and clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study.\n\nFor the ancillary subgroup, investigators currently contributing to the primary patient group can also enroll additional patients to the ancillary subgroup. 3 existing sites and 2 additional sites are planned to be added to contribute to the additional 300 patients to be enrolled. These patients will follow the same study schedules as the main study, but follow-up is only up to 5 years.\n\nBaseline measurements (pre-operative clinical analysis and radiographic analysis at 6-week FU) will serve as internal control term during the assessment of post-surgery data out to 10 years."
