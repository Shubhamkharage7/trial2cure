            "detailedDescription": "Published Phase I data on repeat BCG vaccinations in long term adult type 1 diabetics showed specific death of some of the disease-causing bad white blood cells and also showed a short and small pancreas effect of restored insulin secretion. The BCG vaccine also had beneficial metabolic effects that resets the utilization of sugars and significantly improves blood sugars by stably lowering HbA1c values for up to 8 years in subjects in the treatment group and not in the placebo group. In this Phase II Pediatric study, the investigators will attempt to test if even more significant effects can be seen in a pediatric population.\n\nEligible volunteers will either be vaccinated with BCG twice, one month apart or receive a placebo treatment. Both groups will be followed for five years."
