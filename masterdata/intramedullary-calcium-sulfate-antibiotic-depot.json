            "detailedDescription": "This research is a randomized clinical trial aimed to reduce the frequency of fracture related infections following open tibia fracture. The proposed test methods for infection reduction is use of an antibiotic depot placed inside the bone at the time of final fracture treatment. This is in addition to standard of care wound care, fracture fixation with intramedullary nailing, and peri-operative systemic antibiotics.\n\nThis prospective randomized clinical trial will compare outcomes between patients treated with an antibiotic depot placed inside the bone at the time of final fracture fixation and those treated with traditional standard of care intramedullary nailing.\n\nThe target population for the proposed study is patients with severe open tibia fractures (Type II or III) who require definitive fixation with intramedullary nail recruited form one of the participating sites during the index hospitalization.\n\nOne group will be treated prophylactically suing a calcium sulfate antibiotic depot at the time of definitive fixation, while the second group will be treated with a standard of care intramedullary nail without the antibiotic depot.\n\nParticipants will be followed for 12 months (data capture includes patient interviews and clinical data capture from the treatment team and medical record at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months)."
