The study will have a double-blind treatment period until Week 24 for each participant and an open-label treatment period where each participant will receive open-label amlitelimab from Week 24 onwards. The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of amlitelimab for the treatment of adult participants with moderate-to-severe asthma who have previously been enrolled and completed the treatment period of the parent study. The study duration will be up to 156 weeks. The treatment duration will be up to 144 weeks. The number of visits will be 18.",
