This study consists of two parts: Part 1 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Part 2 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD). Part 1 will contain 9 cohorts, 8 intravenously (IV) administered dose levels and 1 subcutaneously (SC) administered dose level of AZD1163. Part 2 will contain 2 SC dose levels of AZD1163. A sentinel dosing approach will be taken. Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 70 weeks.\n\nThe study will comprise of:\n\n* A Screening Period of maximum 28 days for both Part 1 and Part 2.\n* Part 1: A single dose of AZD1163 with an in-clinic period of 7 to 8 days.\n* Part 2: Two doses of AZD1163, given 2 weeks apart both with an in-clinic period of 7 to 8 days.\n* An outpatient Follow-up Period of approximately 15 months."
