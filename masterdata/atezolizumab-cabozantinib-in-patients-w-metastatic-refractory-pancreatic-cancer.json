            "briefSummary": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the United States with limited treatment options, especially for those patients with metastatic disease. Combination treatment with cabozantinib and atezolizumab, has demonstrated safety for the treatment of other cancers and has shown promise in preclinical studies utilizing patient derived pancreas organoids. In this study, patients with refractory, metastatic pancreatic cancer will receive combination cabozantinib + atezolizumab and the efficacy of this treatment will be assessed through overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), median overall survival (mOS), and median progression free survival (mPFS). Safety and tolerability of combination cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients will also be assessed and immune profiling pre- and post-treatment will be explored."
