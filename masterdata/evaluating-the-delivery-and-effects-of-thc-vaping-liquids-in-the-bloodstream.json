            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial assesses differences in the delivery of THC to the bloodstream depending on whether nicotine vapes are used before or after THC. While there has been much recent publicity about vaping products and concern about their safety considering their increasing use for THC administration, the THC delivery profile associated with THC liquid vaping products in human subjects is currently unknown. Importantly, how the delivery to the bloodstream of THC vaping liquids compare to delivery from smoked cannabis, which is the most used method of cannabis delivery, will serve as an important benchmark for evaluating the delivery and effects of THC vaping products, and their relative safety.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of THC vaping liquids administered with co-use of vaped nicotine.\n\nII. Outcomes of interest will be assessed overall, and according to biological sex.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Safety. II. Assessment of differences in puffing behaviors. III. Short-term subjective drug effects, and cognitive performance following THC use without nicotine versus (vs.) THC use with pre-nicotine use vs. THC use with post-nicotine use in current consumers of both vaped cannabis and vaped nicotine products.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM A: Participants complete 3 vaping sessions separated by 7-14 days on study:\n\n* VISIT 1: Participants vape placebo nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then placebo nicotine again for 10 minutes.\n* VISIT 2: Participants vape nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then placebo nicotine for 10 minutes.\n* VISIT 3: Participants vape placebo nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then nicotine for 10 minutes.\n\nARM B: Participants complete 3 vaping sessions separated by 7-14 days on study:\n\n* VISIT 1: Participants vape nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then placebo nicotine for 10 minutes.\n* VISIT 2: Participants vape placebo nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then nicotine for 10 minutes.\n* VISIT 3: Participants vape placebo nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then placebo nicotine again for 10 minutes.\n\nARM C: Participants complete 3 vaping sessions separated by 7-14 days on study:\n\n* VISIT 1: Participants vape placebo nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then nicotine for 10 minutes.\n* VISIT 2: Participants vape placebo nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then placebo nicotine again for 10 minutes.\n* VISIT 3: Participants vape nicotine for 10 minutes, followed by THC for 10 minutes, and then placebo nicotine for 10 minutes.\n\nAll participants also undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, participants are followed up at 30 days."
