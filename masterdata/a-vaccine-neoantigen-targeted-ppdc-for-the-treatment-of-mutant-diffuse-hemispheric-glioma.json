            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety and side effects, and best dose of a vaccine (neoantigen-target ppDC) in treating patients with H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric glioma. Vaccines made from the patient's own white blood cells and peptide-pulsed dendritic cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving neoantigen-targeted ppDC may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with diffuse hemispheric glioma with a H3 G34 mutation.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of neoantigen-targeted ppDC in adult patients with diffuse hemispheric glioma (DHG).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the immunogenicity of neoantigen-targeted ppDC in adult patients with DHG.\n\nII. To determine whether neoantigen-targeted ppDC facilitates systemic T cell-mediated adaptive immune activation in DHG patients.\n\nIII. To determine whether neoantigen-targeted ppDC facilitates a target-specific anti-tumor T cell expansion in DHG patients.\n\nIV. To determine whether pro-inflammatory phenotypic changes in systemic immune cell populations are detected in peripheral blood in response to neoantigen-targeted ppDC vaccination in DHG patients.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the potential efficacy of neoantigen-targeted ppDC in DHG patients.\n\nII. To correlate physiologic and metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with systemic immunologic response after neoantigen-targeted ppDC in DHG patients.\n\nIII. To isolate and sequence immunodominant anti-tumor T cell T-cell receptor (TCRs) stimulated by neoantigen-targeted ppDC in DHG patients.\n\nIV. To explore whether study participants demonstrating immune-reactive responses to neoantigen-targeted ppDC harbor significantly different gastrointestinal microbiota profiles in comparison to unresponsive participants.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo leukapheresis 10 days prior to first injection. Patients then receive ppDC intradermally (ID) with poly ICLC intramuscularly (IM) in both arms every 2 weeks (Q2W) for total 3 doses and then every 6 months for up to 3 doses. Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial. Patients also undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial in addition to stool sample collection during screening and on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 120 days and then up to 24 months."

Note: no testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* Has a known history of active tuberculosis (Bacillus tuberculosis)\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Kidney dysfunction precluding administration of gadolinium-based contrast\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment",
