            "briefSummary": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in older Americans. COPD increases in frequency with age, and older adults with COPD often have significant unmet geriatrics-palliative care needs that results in reduced quality of life, high healthcare utilization, and care at the end of life that does not align with the values and wishes of patients and their care partners. Older adults with COPD could benefit from proactive geriatrics-palliative care before the end of life. However, no geriatrics-palliative care interventions have been systematically developed and tested in community-dwelling older adults with COPD and their care partners. As the number of older adults with COPD increases to levels unmatched by current palliative care workforce trends, innovative strategies are desperately needed to improve the delivery of geriatrics-palliative care in COPD before the end of life.\n\nProject EPIC (Empowering People to Independence in COPD) is a multiphase study to refine and pilot test the EPIC telephonic nurse coaching intervention in older adults with COPD and their care partners. EPIC is informed by the ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise Before Life Ends) early palliative care intervention that improved quality of life and mood for patients with advanced cancer and has been iteratively refined over decades and rigorous randomized controlled trial testing. In the intervention, palliative care-trained nurse coaches deliver the Charting Your Course Curriculum over the phone to patients (six sessions) and their care partners (four sessions), with activities and monthly telephone follow-up following a manualized curriculum. We conducted a formative evaluation in a diverse and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to refine ENABLE for patients with COPD and pilot tested the potential feasibility of the refined intervention, EPIC, in patients and their care partners.\n\nThe current study summatively evaluates EPIC through a hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot randomized controlled trial in dyads of community-dwelling older adults with moderate to very severe COPD and their care partners randomized to usual COPD care (control) versus usual COPD care + EPIC (intervention). The primary outcomes are trial and intervention feasibility and acceptability. Secondary geriatrics-palliative care outcomes include Life-Space mobility, quality of life, cognitive impairment, functional status, healthcare utilization, palliative care uptake, and care partner burden."
