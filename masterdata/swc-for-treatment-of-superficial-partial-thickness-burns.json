            "detailedDescription": "Current management options for burn wounds contain silver (nanoparticulate or ionic), hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, sulfa agents, chlorhexidine, iodine or other dilute antiseptics meant to provide some measure of antimicrobial protection. However, all of these materials have some proven limitations in facilitating wound healing and also have notable local and systemic adverse effects. None of the current clinical treatments enhance healing and/or reduce scar formation. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of SynePure\u2122 Wound Cleanser when used in combination with Catasyn\u2122 Advanced Technology Hydrogel for the treatment of superficial partial-thickness burn wounds.\n\nThis study is a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial comparing SynePure Wound Cleanser and Catasyn Advanced Technology Hydrogel (intervention group) to routine care, Silvadene (control group). Both groups will receive the same care other than the treating agent. Subjects will be recruited from the Burn Center/Clinic adult patient pool who have sustained superficial partial-thickness burn wounds that comprise \u226415% of total body surface area (TBSA)."
