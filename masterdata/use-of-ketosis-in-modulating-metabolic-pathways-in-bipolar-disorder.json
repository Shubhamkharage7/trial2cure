            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test how specific components of diet affect brain function and behavior for individuals with bipolar. The main question it aims to answer is how glucose and ketones each affect the brain's response to risk and reward. Participants will be asked to provide blood (to assess baseline measures of how the body uses energy), and then to receive two MRI scan sessions, on separate days. During each MRI scan session, participants will play three games, from which they can win money, before and after drinking glucose (on one day) or ketones (on the other day). Investigators will compare individuals with and without bipolar to test whether the two groups differ in how their brains use energy, and to test how the brain's use of energy affects behavior.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the study is to understand the impact of glucose vs. ketones on brain metabolism and function, in individuals with bipolar. The specific aims are to examine:\n\n1. Stability of the brain's signaling over time.\n2. Regulation of the neural circuits that process risk\n3. Regulation of the neural circuits that process reward\n\nStudy Procedures:\n\nBaseline Blood Samples: Blood will be taken at Massachusetts General Hospital (Translational and Clinical Research Center) to measure baseline levels of several key variables associated with metabolic function. These variables include insulin resistance (HbA1c), thyroid function (T3, T4, TSH), the efficiency of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (lactate/pyruvate), energy sensing (AMPK), mitochondrial regulation, and inflammation (IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha).\n\nScanning Procedure: The scanning procedure for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, on each day, will include 1) functional MR (fMRI) during cognitive task (three games), 2) MR spectroscopy (MRS), and 3) resting state. Following the scan, the participant will drink either glucose or ketones and repeat 1-3 above.\n\nBlood glucose and ketone monitoring: Using a finger-prick test, investigators will measure blood glucose and ketones three times during each scan session. This will be done immediately before starting the scan session, 10 minutes after consuming either glucose or ketones, and immediately after ending the scan session. Mild temporary pain/discomfort may occur at the site of finger-prick for blood glucose and ketone concentration measurements (pre-scan, post-drink, and post-scan), but no other side effects are expected from this test. Precision Xtra is a standard over-the-counter blood glucose and ketone monitoring system routinely self-administered by diabetic patients. Participants' fingers will be sanitized with alcohol wipes and a fresh lancet will be used to perform each finger prick test."
