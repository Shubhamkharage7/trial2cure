The main questions it aims to answer is whether the device will reduce clinical symptom burden, reduce cognitive deficits, and aid in the recovery of clinical symptoms.\n\nParticipants will wear the device daily for six weeks and complete a series of assessments.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Apollo Neuro Device on remediating clinical symptoms, cognitive deficits and physical symptoms of those patients struggling with persisting post-concussive symptoms. The Apollo Neuro Device offers a convenient novel, non-invasive, non-habit-forming solution to improve performance and recovery under stress by delivering gentle wave-like vibrations to the body that improve autonomic nervous system balance in real time. The investigators will carry out a prospective study including any individual over the age of ten years presenting with persisting post-concussive symptoms. An Apollo Neuro Device will be offered as part of a treatment plan to patients with chronic neurological symptoms and will be used as an adjunct along with typical treatment. Patients will follow-up for a comprehensive evaluation, per discretion of specialty physicians and weekly symptom surveys will also be emailed to patients to track status. The results of this study will further the understanding of autonomic dysfunction symptomology and recovery and evaluate the effect of nerve stimulation as a means of mediating autonomic nervous system dysfunction in these patients."
