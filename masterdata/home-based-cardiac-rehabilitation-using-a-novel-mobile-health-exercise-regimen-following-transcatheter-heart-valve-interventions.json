            "briefSummary": "The vast majority of cardiac rehabilitation eligible individuals do not participate in center based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR). While steps to encourage participation in CBCR are important, many individuals will still not participate for a variety of reasons. This randomized controlled trial is evaluating a home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) intervention delivered using a custom app and digital tools in patients undergoing transcatheter heart valve interventions (THVIs). After a brief roll-in period, participants not intending to participate in CBCR are randomized to one of three groups: (1) control, (2) HBCR mobile health intervention with hands-off delivery, and (3) HBCR mobile health intervention with interactive delivery. Participants in the intervention groups (hands-off/interactive delivery) will also be randomized to continue the intervention for 12 weeks or 24 weeks. The intervention targets key health behaviors and includes traditional cardiac rehabilitation components. The study will assess the effect of the intervention on clinical events, physical activity, quality of life, and other outcomes. Those who intend to participate in CBCR will be followed in a registry."
