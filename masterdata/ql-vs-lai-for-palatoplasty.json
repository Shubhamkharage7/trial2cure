The patients will be randomized to receive either a unilateral QL block by an anesthesiologist, or local anesthetic infiltration at the surgical incision by the surgeon. The primary aim will be assessing post-operative pain in the first 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes will include pain medication use in the first 48 hours after surgery, block resolution time, and evaluating any complications associated with the QL block or local anesthetic infiltration."
