            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ruxolitinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other blood diseases.\n\nIn this research study, investigators are trying to discover if ruxolitinib will decrease chances of relapse after having an allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n\nRuxolitinib is a medication that blocks certain proteins called tyrosine kinases. Specifically, it blocks tyrosine kinases called JAK2. Many cancers have over active \"cell signaling.\" What this means is that certain functions in the cancer cells never turn off and this makes them grow in an uncontrolled way. Ruxolitinib, shuts down the pathway that depends on the JAK2 tyrosine kinases. The JAK2 pathway is over active with acute myeloid leukemia. Ruxolitinib has also been shown to lower the rates of graft versus host disease, a complication of transplant. The exact way ruxolitinib does this is not yet clear but it may have to do with its ability to block the JAK2 pathway since this pathway can also lead to inflammation in the body."
