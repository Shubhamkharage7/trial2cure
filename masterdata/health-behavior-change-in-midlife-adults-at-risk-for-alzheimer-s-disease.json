This project will develop a new intervention that educates people about Alzheimer's disease risk factors and helps them understand how their personal health beliefs may prevent them from making long-lasting lifestyle changes. The goal is to help people sustain health behavior changes to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."
