The study population is Black men who have sex with men (MSM) or same-sex attraction, Black gender-diverse persons, and Black cis-gender women living with or at increased vulnerability to HIV.\n\nThe study team will be testing the hypotheses that dyadic case management that is focused on financial wellness, will have better outcomes for folks living with or vulnerable to HIV. Analyses will be used to assess the efficacy of the intervention as an emerging practice."
