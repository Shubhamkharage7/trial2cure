Patients in both study groups will receive 1 mg/kg of lidocaine intravenously, followed by an opioid such as fentanyl (1-2 mcg/kg), prior to administration of induction drugs. Patients assigned to MTPI will then be given rocuronium (0.6mg/kg), followed by propofol intravenously as a single bolus within 10 seconds. A typical propofol bolus for induction ranges from 1-2mg/kg, depending on the patient's age, medical history, and co-morbidities. Propofol dosing will be at the discretion of the care team. Patients will count down from one hundred. Once apnea occurs, as indicated by a lack of respiratory effort, the eyes will be taped, and intubation with C-MAC (Karl Storz 8403ZX, Tuttlingen, Germany) is initiated.",

Patients will also count down from one hundred. The medications used for induction of anesthesia in both arms of the study are those used for routine anesthesia care. In both study arms, dosing of medications for induction of anesthesia is standardized (lidocaine 1 mg/kg, fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg, propofol 1-2 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg). The only difference between the two arms will be the timing of the medication administration, and the order in which medications are administered. The documentation of induction and intubation will be the same as that of the MTPI group. Vital signs and other parameters will continuously be recorded in the intraoperative record. Emergence and extubation are not protocolized.",
