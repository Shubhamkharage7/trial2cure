            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate if prolonged antibiotics after pancreatoduodenectomy can prevent the development of a pancreatic fistula and related complications. Participants who are at high risk of pancreatic fistula will be administered an extended course of antibiotics. While inpatient, the patient will receive these antibiotics through the vein, and after discharge, the antibiotics will be taken by mouth.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is a commonly performed surgical procedure utilized in the treatment of either localized malignancies or benign conditions that involve the pancreatic head, 2nd/3rd portions of the duodenum, ampulla of Vater, and distal biliary system. Historically, there has been little improvement in the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), which occurs in approximately 10-40% of patients, and is influenced by a number of factors, including surgeon experience, pancreatic gland texture, pancreatic duct size, and underlying diagnosis. POPF is the leaking of enterically contaminated and amylase-rich fluid from the pancreatic-jejunal anastomosis created during PD. This leak may lead to serious complications. The concept of antibiotic mitigation prior to development of a CR-POPF in patients at higher risk of developing CR-POPF is an option that will be explored in this study."
