            "detailedDescription": "At the screening/baseline visit, potential subjects will be given the IRB-approved informed consent form to read and ask questions. After the subject signs and dates the consent, the study representative will sign and date the consent to confirm that the consent process was completed before initiating any study procedures. The subject will be given a copy of the signed consent. The study dentist will collect and review information related to the subject's demographic, medical, and concomitant medications. The subject will have a hard and soft tissue exam, as well as a clinical examination of the gums and dental plaque present using the comprehensive Loe \\& Silness Indes for gingivitis assessment and the Turesky modification of the Quigley and Hain plaque index.\n\nA total of 64 subjects who meet the study criteria will be enrolled and randomized into two groups. 32 subjects will be assigned to the control group (Brushing twice a day only and no flossing) and 32 to the experimental group (Brushing and Flossing with the stretchable loop floss twice daily). Each subject will be instructed to clean their teeth daily using only the provided toothbrush with an assigned ADA-accepted fluoride dentifrice. Subjects assigned to the control group will brush their teeth at least twice a day only, and subjects in the experimental group will brush and floss with the provided stretchable loop floss at least twice a day. To assess compliance, each subject will be asked to fill out a diary every time they brush/floss. On day 15 (+/- 2) day of product use, subjects will receive a phone call from the study coordinator or designee to assess brushing/flossing compliance. At day 30 (+/- 2), study hygiene and gum chewing restrictions as well as eating restriction will apply, and the efficacy assessments will be repeated, subjects will be dismissed, and the study will finish.\n\nAll clinical examinations will be performed by a single examiner who will be blind to the subject's oral hygiene procedures."
