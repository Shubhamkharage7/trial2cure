Contralateral neck progression will be measured by PET (positron emission tomography)/CT scans. Xerostomia will be measured by the EORTC QLQ (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) H\\&N35 at 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients will remain on study treatment for 6-7 weeks or until unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.
