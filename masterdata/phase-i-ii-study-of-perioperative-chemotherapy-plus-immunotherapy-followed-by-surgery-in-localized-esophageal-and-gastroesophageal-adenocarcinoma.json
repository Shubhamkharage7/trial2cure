(please see required contraception below)\n  * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) at screening, within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment. Women must not be breastfeeding.\n  * Availability of a representative tumor specimen that is suitable for determination of PDL-1 testing at MDA.\n\nA formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimen in a paraffin block (preferred) or at least 10 slides containing unstained, freshly cut, serial sections should be submitted along with an associated pathology report prior to study enrollment. If \\<10 slides are available, the patient may still be eligible for the study, after principal investigator approval has been obtained. For Cohort 1: If archival tumor tissue is unavailable or is determined to be unsuitable for required testing, tumor tissue must be obtained from a biopsy performed at screening. Refer to Section 4.5.6 for additional information on tumor specimens collected at screening.\n\nOptions for female contraception\n\nFor women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs, as defined below:\n\nWomen must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the last dose of Atezolizumab, 90 days after the final dose of Tiragolumab, 4-9 months after the final dose of oxaliplatin and 6 months after the final dose of 5-FU. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).\n\nExamples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n\nHormonal contraceptive methods must be supplemented by a barrier method. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nOptions for contraception in male patients with pregnant female partners and/or with female partners of childbearing potential. \"Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials\" and the Roche White Paper regarding contraception for males in clinical trials. Atezolizumab +/- Tiragolumab does require male contraception or condom use; guidelines below apply to other protocol-mandated study treatments.\n\n\u2022 For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, 6 months after the final dose of oxaliplatin and 5-FU to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n\nThe reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria (cohort 1 and cohort 2)\n\n* Patients with T1aN0, T4b, or metastatic cancer will be excluded.\n* Squamous cell carcinoma histology\n* Invasion into nearby organs (T4b) with or increased risk for fistula\n* Significant comorbid conditions (defined as uncontrolled diabetes, active angina or heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension (\\>160 mmHg systolic or \u2265100 mmHg diastolic) or increased risk of prolonged QTc (QTc \\> 500 ms), or active psychiatric condition that prevents consistent participation and compliance).\n* More than grade 1 neuropathy.\n* Unable to comprehend the requirements of the study or comply with it.\n* Active bleeding from primary tumor requiring radiation therapy.\n* History of leptomeningeal disease\n* Uncontrolled tumor-related pain Patients requiring pain medication must be on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions (e.g., bone metastases or metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be treated prior to enrollment. Patients should be recovered from the effects of radiation.
