Vincristine days 4 and 11, Doxorubicin day 4, dexamethasone days 1-4 and 11-14, Cytarabine day 7. Mesna is also given orally with cyclophosphamide, to reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis, a common side effect of cyclophosphamide. Methotrexate, an antimetabolite, may be given when necessary to get chemotherapy past the blood brain barrier.\n\nCourse B: Methotrexate Day 1 and Cytarabine Days 2 and 3. Dosage is individualized to the patient.",
