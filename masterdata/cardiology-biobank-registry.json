            "briefSummary": "In the present study, investigators intend to establish a large database of cardiovascular patients. More specifically, investigators will create a database of approximately 12,000 cardiac catheterization and heart failure patients from Emory University Hospital, the Emory Clinic, Emory University Hospital Midtown, Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta VA Medical Center, Organized/Planned Community Events in the Atlanta Metropolitan area, held at places of Worship, local Community Centers, shopping Malls, doctor's Offices and Health Clinics and any other miscellaneous locations, e.g. Parks, Leisure centers, Conference centers.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, investigators will run a variety of statistical analyses to which will help us to learn more about the factors that cause various cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, angina, heart failure, hypertension, and stroke. The statistical analyses will also help us to understand how these diseases can be treated more effectively.\n\nBy collecting a large amount of data on a large number of cardiovascular patients, investigators will be able to analyze, with a great deal of precision, those factors that influence the onset, course, and treatment of cardiovascular disease. The results of these precise analyses can then be used to help optimize clinical efforts to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Over the last several decades, scientists have made great progress in their understanding of cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, much remains to be learned about the causes, course, and treatment of cardiovascular disease. In order to learn more about this topic, it is important to establish large databases of cardiovascular patients. These databases allows scientists to investigate, in a rigorous and precise manner, those factors that influence cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn the present study, investigators intend to establish a large database of cardiovascular patients. More specifically, investigators will create a database of approximately 12,000 cardiac catheterization and heart failure patients from Emory University Hospital, the Emory Clinic, Emory University Hospital Midtown, Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta VA Medical Center, Organized/Planned Community Events in the Atlanta Metropolitan area, held at places of Worship, local Community Centers, shopping Malls, doctor's Offices and Health Clinics and any other miscellaneous locations, e.g. Parks, Leisure centers, Conference centers.\n\nInvestigators will collect a large amount of data on these patients. Data to be collected will include information on:\n\nMedical record data, including imaging Patient questionnaire data DNA and other biochemical data obtained and/or generated from patient blood samples or cheek (buccal) swabs Non-invasive measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and studies relating to assessment of the health of arteries\n\nThe data noted above will be collected by:\n\nadministering questionnaires/interviews to the patients accessing the medical records of the patients collecting blood samples from patients which will be analyzed by laboratories for their biochemical content.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, investigators will run a variety of statistical analyses to which will help us to learn more about the factors that cause various cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, angina, heart failure, hypertension, and stroke. The statistical analyses will also help investigators to understand how these diseases can be treated more effectively.\n\nHow the Research Will Advance Scientific Knowledge/Human Health:\n\nBy collecting a large amount of data on a large number of cardiovascular patients, investigators will be able to analyze, with a great deal of precision, those factors that influence the onset, course, and treatment of cardiovascular disease. The results of these precise analyses can then be used to help optimize clinical efforts to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease."
