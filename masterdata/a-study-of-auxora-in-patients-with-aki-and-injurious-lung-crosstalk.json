            "briefSummary": "Approximately 150 patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) will be randomized at up to 40 sites. Patients will be randomly assigned to either Auxora or matching placebo. Study drug infusions will occur every 24 hours for five consecutive days for a total of five infusions.",
            "detailedDescription": "This double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Auxora in patients with severe AKI who have associated AHRF. The definition of AKI and the stages of AKI will be based on the classification system proposed by the Acute Kidney Injury Working Group of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and incorporate both serum creatinine and urine volume criteria. AHRF will be defined as a P/F \u2264 300 that has been determined by either an arterial blood gas or imputed from the oxygen saturation (SpO2) recorded using pulse oximetry and is being treated with high flow nasal cannula with minimum flow rate \u2265 30 liters/min, or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation. Approximately 150 patients with severe AKI, defined as having developed either stage 2 or 3 AKI at the time of consent, who have associated AHRF will be randomized 1:1 into either the Auxora or placebo group using a computer-generated randomization scheme accessed through an interactive voice/web response system (IXRS). Randomization will be stratified by the use of invasive mechanical ventilation and by Stage 3 AKI.\n\nPatients who are randomized to the Auxora group will receive 1.25 mL/kg (2.0 mg/kg of zegocractin) IV over 4 hours at 0 hours and then 1.0 mL/kg (1.6 mg/kg of zegocractin) IV over 4 hours at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours for a total of 5 doses. Patients who are randomized to the placebo group will receive 1.25 mL/kg IV over 4 hours at 0 hours and then 1.0 mL/kg IV over 4 hours at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours for a total of 5 doses. Placebo will be a matching emulsion without the active pharmaceutical ingredient zegocractin. The sponsor, investigators, pharmacists, and patients will be blinded to the assigned group. The Start of First Infusion of Study Drug (SFISD) should occur no more than 24 hours of the patient or legally authorized representative (LAR) providing informed consent. A study physician or appropriately trained delegate will perform study-specific hospital assessments immediately prior to the SFISD, and then every 24 hours after the SFISD until 720 hours (Day 30), or until discharge if earlier. All patients, including those that are discharged from the hospital to home, or to a skilled nursing facility, or to an extended care facility, will be assessed at Day 90.\n\nAll AKI should be managed according to the KDIGO 2012 guidelines which recommends maintaining adequate organ perfusion, avoiding volume overload, avoiding hyperglycemia, discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, and adjusting dosing of renally excreted medications. AHRF/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) should be managed according to the 2023 European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) major recommendations."
