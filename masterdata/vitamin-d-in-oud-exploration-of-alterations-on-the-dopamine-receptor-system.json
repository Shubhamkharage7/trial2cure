            "briefSummary": "The research team is investigating Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), a disorder characterized by dysregulated dopaminergic tone, to evaluate the mechanisms of adjunctive treatment with calcitriol. The investigators will recruit 12 subjects with OUD and 12 healthy subjects to participate in a double-blind, randomized study design where subjects will complete up to 2 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans using \\[11C\\]-PHNO. The investigators will compare subjects in differences between their own study days and in differences between healthy control subjects and subjects with OUD.",
            "detailedDescription": "Previous research has indicated that Dopamine (DA) may play a role in withdrawal and dependence in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The present study will investigate dopamine receptor availability in 12 subjects with OUD compared with 12 HC subjects using \\[11C\\](+)-PHNO and the impact of calcitriol on these receptors.\n\nResearch has indicated that a common feature in substance use disorders (SUD) is a hypo-dopaminergic state. Further, preclinical and observational research has pointed to a possible benefit of calcitriol in individuals who have OUD and our research group has previously shown the potential benefits of calcitriol on addressing this hypo-dopaminergic state. If successful, the results of this research study may improve the standard treatment for OUD through calcitriol supplementation.\n\nSpecifically, the present study seeks to address the following aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: As part of a between-subject study design, to determine whether acute calcitriol (vs. placebo) administration is associated with greater dopamine (DA) release in the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum (VST), and substantia nigra / ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) of subjects with OUD compared to healthy control subjects (HCs).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: As part of a within-subject, two-day study design, to determine whether acute calcitriol (vs. placebo) administration is associated with greater dopamine (DA) release in the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum (VST), and substantia nigra / ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) of subjects with OUD.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To determine whether acute calcitriol (vs. placebo) administration is associated with higher spontaneous eyeblink rate, a non-PET indicator of higher dopamine activity, among subjects with OUD.\n\nSpecific Aim 4: To determine whether acute calcitriol (vs. placebo) administration is associated with better performance on neurocognitive measures (e.g., the Continuous Performance Task or CPT-IP and the Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task or PRLT) among subjects with OUD."
