This study will how effective the combination use of ubrogepant and atogepant is in treating adult participants with migraine. Change in migraine activity will be assessed.\n\nUrogepant (Ubrelvy) and Atogepant (Qulipta) are approved drugs for treatment of migraine in adults in the US. Approximately 432 adult participants who are prescribed Ubrogepant and atogepant by their doctors will be enrolled in this study in the United States.\n\nParticipants will receive ubrogepant oral tablets and atogepant oral tablets as prescribed by their physician. Participants will be followed for 30 days.\n\nThere is expected to be no additional burden for participants in this trial. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic according to their routine clinical practice."
