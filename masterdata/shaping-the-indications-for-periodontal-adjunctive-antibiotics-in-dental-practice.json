However, a clinical practice guideline on periodontal treatment adjuncts published in 2015 identified weak evidence on the use of systemic antibiotics and large heterogeneity across small scale studies, suggesting that larger pragmatic clinical trials would benefit clinical decision making. This will be a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, stratified by practice and practitioner. The study will investigate the effectiveness of adjunctive antibiotics as adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) compared to SRP with placebo for the treatment of generalized stage II-III, grades A-C periodontitis in approximately 544 patient participants from about 34 National Dental PBRN practices. Periodontal data will be collected at baseline, re-evaluation (6 weeks), and final (12 months) study visits. Changes in periodontal clinical and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed to determine the effectiveness of SRP plus adjunctive systemic Amoxicillin / Metronidazole antibiotics (AMXM) versus SRP with Placebo.",

Changes in periodontal clinical and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed to determine the effectiveness of SRP plus adjunctive systemic Amoxicillin / Metronidazole antibiotics (AMXM) versus SRP with Placebo.\n\nObjectives and Outcomes: Primary: The primary objective will assess the effectiveness of SRP plus adjunctive antibiotics compared to SRP with placebo in periodontitis individuals from baseline to 6 weeks and 12 months following non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) as determined by changes in site-level periodontal probing depth (PD).\n\nSecondary: To assess changes in: i) gingival inflammation (measured by bleeding on probing (BoP)), ii) periodontal tissue attachment (measured by clinical attachment level (CAL)), iii) reduction in diseased sites (measured by remaining sites with maximum probing depth \u22655 mm), and iv) disease remission (measured by number of participants with \u22644 sites with PD\u2265 5mm); comparing SRP plus AMXM to SRP with a placebo adjunctive in periodontitis individuals from baseline to re-evaluation (6 weeks) to final (12 month) study visit following intervention. The patient-reported impact of periodontal treatment (measured by the Oral Health Impact Profile-5 (OHIP-5)) and treatment-related adverse events between groups will also be assessed.\n\nPopulation: The sample size will be a target of approximately 544 patient participants enrolled from approximately 34 National Dental PBRN practices. All patient participants are indicated to receive SRP and have been diagnosed with periodontitis stages II-III, grades A-C.\n\nDescription of Intervention: The intervention will involve either SRP, which is considered the standard of care treatment for debriding root surfaces, in conjunction with 500 mg Amoxicillin and 500mg Metronidazole orally every 8 hours (q8h) for ten days following SRP or SRP with placebo."
