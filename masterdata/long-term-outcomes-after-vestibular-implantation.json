            "briefSummary": "Although cochlear implants can restore hearing to individuals who have lost cochlear hair cell function, there is no widely available, adequately effective treatment for individuals suffering chronic imbalance, postural instability and unsteady vision due to bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Prior research focused on ototoxic cases has demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve via a chronically implanted multichannel vestibular implant can partially restore vestibular reflexes that normally maintain steady posture and vision; improve performance on objective measures of postural stability and gait; and improve patient-reported disability and health-related quality of life. This single-arm open-label study extends that research to evaluate outcomes for up to 8 individuals with non-ototoxic bilateral vestibular hypofunction, yielding a total of fifteen adults (age 22-90 years at time of enrollment) divided as equally as possible between ototoxic and non-ototoxic cases.",
            "detailedDescription": "There is no widely available, adequately effective treatment for individuals suffering chronic imbalance, postural instability and unsteady vision due to loss of semicircular canal function despite vestibular rehabilitation exercises. The experience of 15 adults with bilateral vestibular hypofunction who underwent unilateral surgical placement of a vestibular implant and have received continuously motion-modulated electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve for \\>6 months revealed vestibular implantation (VI) and motion-modulated stimulation can partially restore vestibular sensation and reflexes that normally maintain steady posture and vision. This study will examine long-term outcomes after vestibular implantation. Within constraints on power and/or minimum detectable effect size due to limits on the number of study participants permitted under IDE G150198, the study will test the following hypotheses regarding unilateral vestibular implantation, activation and long-term (\u22653 years) continuous/daily use:\n\n1. It is safe, as determined by incidence of serious unanticipated adverse device-related events and as further quantified by proportions of:\n\n   1. implanted ears with preservation of 4-frequency pure tone average for 0.5,1,2,4 kHz air-conducted audiometric detection thresholds \u2264 50 decibel (dB) HL and ear-specific speech discrimination \u226550% (consistent with Class A or B per American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 1995 guidelines 13 ) or \u2264 30 dB change from preoperative baseline (if preoperative baseline is \u226520 dBHL) and ear-specific speech discrimination \u226430% worse than preoperative baseline (if preoperative baseline is \u226480%)\n   2. participants with preservation of useful sound-field hearing by the above criteria, and\n   3. implanted ears with preservation of otolith endorgan function, if present pre-operatively\n2. It is tolerable, as quantified by duration of compliance with use.\n3. It is efficacious, as defined by nonzero improvement with respect to preoperative baseline gait stability as quantified by Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) and vestibulo-ocular reflex gain during passive head impulse rotation (VHITG) ."
