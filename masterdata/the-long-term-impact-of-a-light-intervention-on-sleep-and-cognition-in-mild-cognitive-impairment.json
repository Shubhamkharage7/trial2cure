The goal is also to measure the impact of the lighting intervention on caregivers' sleep, cognition, depression, and quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "The current application proposes to investigate the impact of a long-term light treatment intervention on sleep physiology and sleep-dependent cognitive processes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The premise is that older adults, especially those with cognitive impairment, are often in continuous dim light, which leads to circadian misalignment. Circadian misalignment impacts the close relationship between homeostatic and circadian processes, which can reduce memory-related sleep features. The hypothesis is that a lighting intervention technology (LIT), designed to promote circadian entrainment, will improve sleep by aligning the two sleep processes (circadian and homeostatic) and, thus improve cognition. In addition to improving patients' lives, LIT has the potential to reduce the overnight burden on caregivers. Thus, an exploratory goal is to also measure the impact of LIT on caregivers' sleep, cognition, depression, and quality of life."

It assesses short-term memory, visuospatial abilities, executive functions, attention, concentration and working memory, language, and orientation to time and place. In a validation study, it was shown to be a promising tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease onset compared to the Mini Mental State Exam.",
