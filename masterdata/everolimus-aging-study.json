            "briefSummary": "The objective of this project is to determine if mTORC1 inhibition by 24 weeks of daily (0.5 mg/day) or weekly (5 mg/week) everolimus can safely improve physiological and molecular hallmarks of aging in humans. Participants who are 55-80 years old and insulin resistant or prediabetic will be randomized to treatment and can expect to be on study for up to approximately 38 weeks. Participants aged 18-35 will not receive the intervention and can expect to be on study for up to approximately 8 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pharmacological inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been repeatedly demonstrated to extend lifespan and prevent or delay several age-related diseases in diverse model systems. However, the risk of potentially serious side effects in humans have thus far prevented the long-term use of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a therapy for aging and age-related diseases. Therefore, it remains unknown whether rapamycin or rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) can safely improve healthy aging in humans.\n\nThe objective of this project is to determine if 24 weeks of daily low dose (0.5 mg/day) or weekly intermittent (5 mg/week) treatment with the rapalog everolimus can safely improve physiological and molecular hallmarks of aging in middle-aged to older insulin resistant adults who are at high risk for nearly every age-related condition.\n\nUsing a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the investigators will perform a battery of gold-standard and innovative techniques to test the hypothesis that daily low dose or weekly everolimus treatment will improve 4 inter-related domains of physiological aging: metabolic, cardiac, cognitive, and physical function. The investigators will also assess the incidence of adverse events and changes from baseline blood chemistry, blood cell counts, lipids, glucose, and insulin.\n\nTo comprehensively examine the molecular target specificity and the impact on mechanisms of aging by everolimus, the team will evaluate mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, assess mitochondrial bioenergetics, and perform a multi-omics approach (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics) in blood and/or muscle biopsy samples."

This study will follow a \"double-dummy\" design where participants will be randomized 1:1:1 in a double-blinded fashion to one of three groups: 1) everolimus once daily (0.5 mg/day) plus placebo once weekly, 2) placebo once daily plus everolimus once weekly (5mg/week) or 3) placebo once daily and placebo once weekly. The double dummy design preserves the double-blind for both placebo versus everolimus and for daily versus weekly dosing schedules. Everolimus and placebo will be over encapsulated to be indistinguishable from one another.\n\nThere will also be a group of young, healthy individuals who will complete baseline testing only and not the intervention. This group allows the determination if everolimus changes any molecular and physiological outcomes in older adults toward that of a young, healthy reference group.",
