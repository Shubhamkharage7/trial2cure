Twenty (20) participants will be enrolled over a 9-month enrollment period from an allergy and asthma medical specialty clinic. Should the participant meet all eligibility criteria, then following the Screening Period, the participant will be dosed with OMA and asked to continue to follow their food avoidance regimen.\n\nParticipants will return to the clinic every two weeks for 16-weeks, and then every 2 or 4-weeks (depending on dosing) for the remaining 36-weeks, for a total of 52-weeks. Primary endpoint analyses will occur at Week 16 and Week 52.\n\nDescription of XOLAIR treatment schedule:\n\nOmalizumab will be dosed according to the OUtMATCH Study dosing. Patients will be monitored for acute hypersensitivity reactions for at least 61 minutes after the end of the injection. Epinephrine and parenteral diphenhydramine must be readily available for immediate use if required to treat a hypersensitivity reaction; site personnel must be able to detect and treat such reactions. Patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., stridor, angioedema, life-threatening change in vital signs) must be withdrawn from study treatment.\n\nAll adverse events of systemic hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylactoid or anaphylaxis reactions must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor."
