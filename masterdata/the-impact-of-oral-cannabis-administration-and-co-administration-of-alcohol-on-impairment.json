Participants will complete 7 outpatient drug administration sessions that will consist of self-administration of oral cannabis (0, 10 or 25mg THC) and alcohol (either placebo or active; BAC of 0.05 percent); participants will always receive both an alcohol drink (active or placebo) and dose of cannabis (active or placebo). Participants will also complete a condition in which they administer alcohol (BAC: 0.08 percent) with placebo cannabis, as a positive control. Primary outcomes include performance on field sobriety tests, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, subjective drug effects, and simulated driving performance. Blood concentrations of THC and THC metabolites will also be determined."
