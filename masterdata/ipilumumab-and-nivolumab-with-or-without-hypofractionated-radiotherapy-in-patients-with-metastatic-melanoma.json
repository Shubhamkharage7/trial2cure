If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for two weeks before the time of the first dose of study medication, while on study, through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.

Prior adjuvant PD-1 blockade (but not prior adjuvant Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4 blockade) is permitted.\n* Concurrent treatment with any anticancer agent, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy.\n* Treatment with any other investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to first dose of nivolumab/ipilimumab.\n* Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy or other anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to first dose of nivolumab/ipilimumab or who has not recovered (i.e., \u2264 Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.\n\nNote: Subjects with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.\n\n* Known hypersensitivity to nivolumab, ipilimumab, monoclonal antibodies or immunoglobulin G.\n* Major surgical procedure (as defined by the investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab/ipilimumab or still recovering from prior surgery\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of nivolumab/ipilimumab with the exceptions of intranasal, topical and inhaled corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, or steroids used transiently to control contrast agent allergies for radiographic studies.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune disease (including inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis with the exception of diverticulosis, celiac disease, irritable bowel disease, Wegner syndrome, Hashimoto syndrome) within the past year. Subjects with vitiligo, alopecia, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past year) are not excluded. Patients with hypothyroidism stable on thyroid replacement therapy for the previous 3 months are not excluded.\n* History of primary immunodeficiency or tuberculosis.\n* Known true positive results for HIV or known active Hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) as determined by medical record review.\n* Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab/ipilimumab. (NOTE: subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine during the study or for 180 days after the last dose of both drugs)\n* Clinical contraindication to hypofractionated radiation as determined by the investigator (e.g., active systemic sclerosis, active inflammatory bowel disease if bowel is within radiation field.)\n* Prior radiotherapy that precludes the proposed treatment with HFRT or any radiotherapy within 28 days of first dose of nivolumab/ipilimumab.\n* Females who are pregnant, lactating, or intend to become pregnant during the participation of the study.\n* Uncontrolled inter-current illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, current pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent\n* Other active invasive malignancy. History of non-invasive malignancies such as cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin, or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast is allowed, as is history of other invasive malignancy that is in remission after treatment with curative intent.\n* Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results",
