            "briefSummary": "The Investigators will recruit 50 participants with acute SCI (within 72 hours of injury) Fasting blood collection and bowel function survey will be conducted 4 times: at baseline \\[the time of first stool sample, within 72 hours of injury\\] and 1, 6, and 12 months after SCI. Stool will be collected for gut microbiome analysis 4 times",
            "detailedDescription": "Stool and fasting blood collection will occur at the hospital (during in-patient stay) and at participants' homes. During the hospital stay, stool will be collected at the bedside by the research team and placed in a Para-pak\u00ae vial for sample preservation. Blood will also be collected by the research team.\n\nFor sample collection at home, a research nurse will travel to participants home to perform blood draws and bing back to the research lab for processing/analysis/storage.\n\nThe nurse may also collect the stool sample at the same time as the blood draw if available. If not, participants and their caregivers will be provided with a pre-paid/labeled FedEx package containing a stool collection kit (Para-pak\u00ae vial). Prior to bowel movement, participants and caregivers will be asked to clean the anal area using the sanitizing wipes; approximately 5-10 mL of stool will be transferred to the Para-pak\u00ae vial using the attached spatula in the Para-pak\u00ae vial. For participants who conduct their bowel management program in their beds, an additional sterile absorbent pad will be provided to use as a barrier between the bed and the participant to limit contamination. FedEx package containing the stool sample will be shipped to the investigators' lab\n\nFor each participant, the Investigators will record 1)diet (via 24-hour dietary recalls), 2) physical activity habits (via the rehabilitation therapies survey included in the SCI common data elements \\[CDEs\\], 3)Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire; 4)depression and anxiety (via Patient Health Questionnaire-9 \\[PHQ9\\] and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD7),respectively); 5)prescribed medications, including antibiotics (via RedCap and Twilio platform); 6)use of supplements and bowel routine components, including probiotics and laxatives (via self-report); and 7)any other comorbidities beyond GI dysfunction"
