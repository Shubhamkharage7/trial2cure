            "detailedDescription": "This study will consist of 3 periods: screening/baseline, treatment and follow-up.\n\nScreening/baseline period will take place up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\nIn the treatment period, starting at cycle 1, participants in cohorts 1 to 8 will receive enfortumab vedotin on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28-day cycle until one of the treatment discontinuation criteria are met. participants in cohort 9 will receive enfortumab vedotin on days 1, 8, and pembrolizumab on day 1 of every 21-day cycle until one of the treatment discontinuation criteria are met. Disease assessment will be performed at screening/baseline and repeated every 8 weeks (56 days \u00b1 7 days) for cohorts 1 to 8 and first assessment at week 9 and thereafter every 6 weeks (42 days \u00b1 7 days) for cohort 9 from the first dose of study treatment throughout the study until the participant has radiologically confirmed disease progression, initiates a new subsequent anticancer therapy, dies, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes, whichever occurs first.\n\nParticipants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically-confirmed disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1 will enter into a post treatment follow-up period and continue to receive imaging scans every 8 weeks (56 days \u00b1 7 days) for cohorts 1 to 8 and for cohort 9 first scan will be performed at 9 week and thereafter every 6 weeks (42 days \u00b1 7 days) until the subject has radiologically confirmed disease progression (for cohort 9 confirmed progressive disease \\[iCPD\\] per modified RECIST 1.1 for immune-based therapeutics \\[iRECIST\\]), initiates a new anticancer therapy, dies, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes, whichever occurs first.\n\nAfter 1 year on study treatment, the frequency of disease assessment will be reduced to every 12 weeks (84 days \u00b1 7 days) for cohorts 1 to 8.\n\nAfter 18 months on study treatment, the frequency of disease assessment will be reduced to every 9 weeks (63 days \u00b1 7 days) for cohort 9.\n\nParticipants in cohorts 1to 8 who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically-confirmed disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1 will enter into a post treatment follow-up period and continue to receive imaging scans every 8 weeks (56 days \u00b1 7 days).\n\nParticipants in cohort 9 who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically confirmed disease progression per iRECIST will enter into a post treatment follow-up period and have physical exams, ECOG and disease assessments every 6 weeks (\u00b1 7 days) up to 18 months after first dose, then every 9 weeks (\u00b1 7 days) until the subject has radiologically confirmed disease progression per iRECIST.\n\nAfter radiologically-confirmed disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, participants will be contacted every 12 weeks in the long-term follow-up period for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up or study closure, whichever occurs first."
