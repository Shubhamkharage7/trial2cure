            "briefSummary": "Women are often understudied in thermal physiology research, leaving recommendations for Soldier safety and performance in hot conditions based largely on data collected in men. Female sex hormones estradiol and progesterone clearly have non-reproductive physiological effects, including influences on thermoregulatory and cardiovascular function. However, mechanisms of differing physiological adaptations to repeated heat exposure (i.e., heat acclimation) as a function of reproductive hormone status have yet to be investigated in a systematic way. Understanding possible sex differences in adaptation or mechanisms for adaptation during heat acclimation is important to ultimately optimize interventions to maximize soldier health and safety during training and deployment in the heat. Our goals in the present study are to evaluate physiological and biophysical responses to a standard heat acclimation protocol in a group of young, healthy men and women. Thirty individuals (n=10 males, n=10 women with a low hormonal status (i.e. early follicular phase), n=10 women with a high hormonal status (i.e. midluteal phase)) will complete 10 consecutive days of exercise (treadmill walking: 3.1 mph/2% grade) in the heat (40\u00b0C /40% relative humidity) up to 3hr per day. Changes in core temperature, heart rate, and sex hormones will be assessed to examine differences in thermoregulatory response to heat acclimation."
