Subjects will receive the randomized treatments for up to 16 weeks or until progression. Both groups will receive either IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel or oral capecitabine following the 16-week treatment course until disease progression at the discretion of the Investigator and then followed for survival for five years."
