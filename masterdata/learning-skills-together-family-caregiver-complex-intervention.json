This study aims to test the efficacy of LST at reducing caregiver depression and negative appraisal of behavioral symptoms of dementia by building caregiver self-efficacy. To do this, eligible participants will be randomized into an intervention group (LST) or a control group condition focused on healthy living for family caregivers. Participants will be asked to complete surveys before and after participating in the intervention or the control condition to determine whether change in hypothesized outcomes can be attributed to the intervention condition."

Documentation, such as code names and original survey questions, will also be uploaded to the repository in compliance with NACDA requirements (e.g., code names usable across software packages). We will also document meta-data (e.g., study title, investigator team). While uploading, we will note any transformations applied to the data, and will include both raw and transformed variables.
