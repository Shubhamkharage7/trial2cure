            "briefSummary": "Over 64 million people in the U.S. have a permanent disability, with mobility-related disability (MRD) representing the most prevalent disability type (13.7%). Adults with MRD are 66% more likely to be overweight or obese than their non-disabled peers. Exercise in adults with MRD is important for weight management and is associated with improvements in obesity-related health conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin processing/sensitivity, etc. However, over half (57%) of adults with MRD do not exercise, while 22% engage in exercise of insufficient duration or intensity to obtain health benefits. Adults with MRD face numerous barriers to participation in community-based exercise, and exercise is frequently limited to short-term referrals for outpatient physical and/or occupational therapy. High-intensity functional training (HIFT) represents a potentially effective strategy for community-based exercise to support body weight and obesity-related health conditions, in addition to improving physical function and aspects of psychosocial health for people with disabilities. Preliminary evidence supports the effectiveness of HIFT to improve body composition, cardiovascular and muscular fitness, insulin processing and insulin sensitivity in non-disabled adults who are overweight/obese. To date, no study has systematically evaluated the feasibility or effectiveness of a community-based HIFT intervention for improving obesity-related health outcomes in overweight/obese adults with MRD. Thus, the proposed study will implement a 6-mo. pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a HIFT intervention (60 min sessions/3 days/wk.) in 25 adults with MRD and overweight/obesity.\n\nThis study will address the following aims:\n\nAim 1: Evaluate the intervention feasibility based on participant recruitment, session attendance, retention, outcome assessment completion, and the results of semi-structured exit interviews to obtain information regarding experience and overall satisfaction with the intervention.\n\nAim 2: Evaluate changes (baseline - 6 mos.) in weight and fat-mass/fat-free mass, and components of the metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose).",
            "detailedDescription": "Over 64 million people in the U.S. have a permanent disability, with mobility-related disability (MRD) representing the most prevalent disability type (13.7%). The occurrence of chronic conditions including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are significantly higher in adults with disabilities compared with non-disabled adults. Adults with MRD are 66% more likely to be overweight or obese than their non-disabled peers. Exercise in adults with MRD is important for weight management and is associated with improvements in obesity-related health conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin processing/sensitivity, etc. However, over half (57%) of adults with MRD do not exercise, while 22% engage in exercise of insufficient duration or intensity to obtain health benefits. Adults with MRD face numerous intrapersonal, environmental, and financial barriers to participation in community-based exercise, and exercise is frequently limited to short-term referrals for outpatient physical and/or occupational therapy. While effective, these clinical settings do not provide a long-term strategy for the delivery of exercise programs to the general population of adults with MRD.\n\nHigh-intensity functional training (HIFT) represents a potentially effective strategy for community-based exercise to support body weight and obesity-related health conditions, in addition to improving physical function and aspects of psychosocial health for people with disabilities. HIFT incorporates multiple exercise modalities and constantly varied functional movement patterns designed to simulate daily activities (e.g., sit-to-stand, transferring). The variety of functional movements offered by HIFT may be more enjoyable and result in better long-term adherence compared with traditional single mode continuous aerobic exercise such as stationary biking, arm cycling, or treadmill walking/running. Preliminary evidence supports the effectiveness of HIFT to improve body composition, cardiovascular and muscular fitness, insulin processing and insulin sensitivity in non-disabled adults who are overweight/obese. The limited available data relative to HIFT interventions in adults with MRD provides some support for the feasibility and potential effectiveness of HIFT in adults with MRD including high retention rates, positive intervention experiences, improved functional capacity and confidence in performing daily movements. However, this data is based on unpowered pilot studies and unpublished these/dissertations with poor descriptions of the HIFT interventions, and thus should be cautiously interpreted. To date, no study has systematically evaluated the feasibility or effectiveness of a community-based HIFT intervention for improving obesity-related health outcomes in overweight/obese adults with MRD. Thus, Thus, the proposed study will implement a 6-mo. pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a HIFT intervention (60 min sessions/3 days/wk.) in 25 adults with MRD and overweight/obesity. The intervention will be conducted at two community-based facilities in greater Kansas City that have been conducting HIFT sessions for adults with disabilities for over three years. HIFT sessions will be delivered by instructors certified by the Adaptive Training Academy (ATA), a non-profit organization, which provides training in adapting and conducting safe HIFT sessions for people with disabilities. This study will address the following aims:\n\nAim 1: Evaluate the intervention feasibility based on participant recruitment, session attendance, retention, outcome assessment completion, and the results of semi-structured exit interviews to obtain information regarding study improvements, perceptions of the length/frequency of the intervention, satisfaction with instructors, exercise facilities, session content, difficulties with compliance, and overall satisfaction with the intervention.\n\nAim 2: Evaluate changes (baseline - 6 mos.) in weight (primary outcome), and secondary outcomes including fat-mass/fat-free mass, and components of the metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose). Energy expenditure will also be measured during HIFT sessions using portable indirect calorimetry.\n\nResults from this study will inform the development of an NIH-R01 application to conduct an adequately powered, randomized trial in overweight/obese adults with MRD to evaluate the effectiveness of HIFT over a longer time frame (i.e., 12 mos.), on the obesity-related outcomes proposed for this study plus additional health and functional related outcomes. If ultimately shown to be effective, the physical infrastructure available in the over 5,000 HIFT affiliates across the country would provide the framework for widespread adoption, implementation, and maintenance of inclusive HIFT programs for adults with MRD."

Performance areas report by the client as challenging or unable to do will be documented in a list. Then the client will rate the perceived importance of each problem area on the list. Only the most important performance areas (top five maximum) will be included in the COPM assessment. The client will then rate their current satisfaction of their ability for each of these performance areas. The client's ratings satisfaction will be used to calculate the client's baseline average occupational satisfaction of their ability. Baseline average satisfaction scores are then used to determine if a client's occupational performance improvements occur over time. Range of scoring is 1-10, where higher scores indicate greater perceived satisfaction.",

The flow turbine will be calibrated using a 3.0-L syringe. The lightweight (\\~1.5 kg) portable system will be attached by a harness around the waist and shoulders of the participant before each assessment. During exercise sessions, participants will breathe into a facemask that directs air into the unit housing the O2 and CO2 analyzers. Data will be retrieved for analysis via a serial port interface and software provided with the calorimeter and aggregated over 20-second epochs for the calculation of 1-min averages.",
