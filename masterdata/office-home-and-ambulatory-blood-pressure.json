Patients will have an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) placed and be trained to use a home blood pressure monitor (HBP) which will be sent home with them. The monitors in this study are FDA-approved and are being used as indicated. After one day at home, patients will return the ABPM via mail and continue to take measurements with the HBP for 20 days."
