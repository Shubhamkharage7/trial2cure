The study will also serve as a means for recruiting HIV-infected individuals to NIAIDs ongoing clinical and laboratory studies and supporting the institute s infectious disease training program by providing Infectious Disease fellows with ongoing training in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPeople 18 years of age and older with suspected or confirmed HIV infection who live in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area may be eligible for this study. Physician referral is required.\n\nParticipants come to the NIH Clinical Center a minimum of once every 3 to 4 months for evaluation with a physical examination; blood tests for research purposes, safety, immune status and viral load; and response to any treatment they may be receiving. Other procedures, such as a biopsy, are done only as needed for standard medical practice, and informed consent is obtained before any such procedure is done. Treatment offered is consistent with standard medical practice; no experimental treatments are offered under this protocol.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is designed as a prospective natural history study with ongoing monitoring of HIV infection and HIV-related disease processes. The overall protocol Objective is to determine the long-term clinical outcome of treated HIV infection and investigate aspects of the host immune response that may predict outcomes. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit include: monitoring of immune status and viral load, routine safety laboratory tests, and collection of blood for research and storage. Medical treatment of HIV infection will be provided in accordance with standard medical practice. Specific HIV treatment regimens will be in accordance with standard medical practice and not constitute research."
