            "briefSummary": "This pilot project proposes to build upon these cultural strengths, including the clan system, to test the feasibility of a translational research intervention to promote healthy relationships and prevent dating violence among Aps\u00e1alooke youth. Community Advisory Board members identified 5th grade as an important age to establish healthy dating norms. The feasibility study includes a one-group pre/post intervention that includes 10-hour long sessions with youth to promote healthy relationship knowledge, volition, and communication skills. Elders and near-peer (young adults) will assist during these sessions sharing advice and serving as role models for youth. In addition, to promote the connectedness between youth and their community, there are 3 monthly clan feeds.",
            "detailedDescription": "This project builds upon long-standing community-based participatory research partnerships between Montana State University and the Crow Nation. Through these partnerships, Aps\u00e1alooke community members prioritized healthy relationships among youth as a critical area for intervention. Through interviews and focus groups with Apsaalooke community members a strength-based strategy to promote healthy relationships among youth has emerged. This pilot project proposes to build upon these cultural strengths, including the clan system, to test the feasibility of a translational research intervention to promote healthy relationships and prevent dating violence among Aps\u00e1alooke youth. Community Advisory Board members identified 5th grade as an important age to establish healthy dating norms. The feasibility study includes a one-group pre/post intervention that includes 10-hour long sessions with youth to promote healthy relationship knowledge, volition, and communication skills. Elders and near-peer (young adults) will assist during these sessions sharing advice and serving as role models for youth. In addition, to promote the connectedness between youth and their community, there are 3 monthly clan feeds. Using a participatory approach, our project will accomplish the following aims:\n\n1. Using a participatory research approach, finish adapting and localizing the curriculum. 2. Test the feasibility of pilot intervention among Aps\u00e1alooke youth and their families. 3. Refine pilot intervention and design an appropriate translational intervention (R01) for promoting healthy relationship skills among Aps\u00e1alooke youth."
