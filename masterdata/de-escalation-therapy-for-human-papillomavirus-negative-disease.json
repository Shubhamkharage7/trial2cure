Known history of active tuberculosis (Bacillus Tuberculosis infection).\n8. Hypersensitivity to nivolumab or any other drug used in this protocol.\n9. Prior systemic anti-cancer treatment within the last 8 weeks.\n10. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer or any tumors that are not likely to influence life expectancy in the subsequent 3 years without active treatment.\n11. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic therapy in the past year (i.e. with steroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy e.g. levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid doses for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc. are not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n12.
