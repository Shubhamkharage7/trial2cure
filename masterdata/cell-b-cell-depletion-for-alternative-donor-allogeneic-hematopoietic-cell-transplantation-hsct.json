Patients will receive an allogenic HSCT from a matched unrelated donor (MUD), mismatch unrelated donor (MMUD) or a mismatched related (haploidentical) donor. Patients will receive a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) \u00b1 Plerixafor donor mobilized peripheral stem cell donor transplant following CliniMACS\u00ae \u03b1\u03b2T cell/CD19+B cell depletion. Cluster of Differentiation 34 (CD34) and \u03b1\u03b2T cell content of the graft is determined based on the transplant indication."

Legal guardian must give informed consent (and patient must give assent if appropriate) if patient is \\< 18 years.\n* Adequate organ function (within 4 weeks of initiation of preparative regimen). For patients receiving Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) on this platform, they should meet organ function to tolerate MAC. Similar if patients are receiving Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC).\n* High resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) available\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient does not have a suitable donor who is willing and able (meets donor criteria).\n* Patient reports a history of allergic reactions to murine protein\n* Pregnant or lactating females are ineligible as many of the medications used in this protocol could be harmful to unborn children and infants. Female patients of childbearing potential females \u226511 years of age or post- menarche and should have a negative pregnancy test\n* Patients with HIV or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections are excluded. Patients with history of fungal disease during induction therapy may proceed if they have a significant response to antifungal therapy with no or minimal evidence of disease remaining by CT evaluation. Viremia by Pluripotency Check (PCR) analysis is not considered an active infection but may require immediate viral prophylaxis. Patients with possible fungal infections must have had at least 2 weeks of appropriate anti-fungal therapy and be asymptomatic -\n* Patients receiving umbilical cord blood and matched sibling donor transplants",
