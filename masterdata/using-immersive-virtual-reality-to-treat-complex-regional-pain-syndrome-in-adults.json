Virtual reality involves looking into a set of goggles and interacting with a computer-simulated world. The use of VR has been shown to be an effective treatment for other pain conditions (Hoffman et al., 2019) and is inexpensive and noninvasive.",

They will also learn some simple 10 minute stress reduction, mood lifting mindfulness skills in VR and will receive audio instructions to focus their attention on the sights and sounds, and controlled breathing (Flores et al., 2019)."

Secondary hypothesis. In a Between Groups ANOVA (or non-parametric equivalent), we predict the group that receives more VR (VR \"in clinic\" and VR homework during first 2 weeks) will show significant more self-reported improvement in pain and functionality, after the first two weeks of treatment.",
