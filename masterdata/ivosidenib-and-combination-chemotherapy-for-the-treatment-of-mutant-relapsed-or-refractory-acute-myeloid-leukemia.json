            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ivosidenib when given together with combination chemotherapy for the treatment of 1DH1 mutant acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Ivosidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the IDH1 mutation and some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ivosidenib with combination chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared to chemotherapy alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ivosidenib in combination with fludarabine, cytarabine, plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (FLAG) chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile of ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.\n\nII. To determine the rate of complete remission (CR + complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery \\[CRi\\] + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery \\[CRp\\]) with ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate the 1 year progression free survival. IV. To evaluate the 1 year overall survival. V. To assess the number of patients that receive allogeneic stem cell transplant after ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess for minimal residual disease negativity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for IDH1 mutations after treatment with ivosidenib in combination with FLAG chemotherapy.\n\nII. To assess for minimal residual disease negativity by PCR for IDH1 mutations after 3 cycles of maintenance therapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 0-6, fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) QD over 30 minutes on days 1-5, cytarabine IV QD over 4 hours on days 1-5, and ivosidenib orally (PO) QD on days 7-28. Treatment continues for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCONSOLIDATION: Patients receive filgrastim SC QD on days 0-5, fludarabine phosphate IV QD over 30 minutes on days 1-4, cytarabine IV QD over 4 hours on days 1-4, and ivosidenib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment continues for 28 days for 1 cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE: Patients receive ivosidenib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every month for up to 1 year."
