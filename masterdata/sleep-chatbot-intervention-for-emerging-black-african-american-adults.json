            "briefSummary": "Unhealthy sleep and cardiometabolic risk are two major public health concerns in emerging Black/African American (BAA) adults. Evidence-based sleep interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) are available but not aligned with the needs of this at-risk group. Innovative work on the development of an artificial intelligence sleep chatbot using CBT-I guidelines will provide scalable and efficient sleep interventions for emerging BAA adults.",
            "detailedDescription": "Abnormal metabolic syndrome (MetS) components affect up to 40% of emerging adults (18-25 years), particularly Black/African Americans (BAA). MetS risk in early life tracks into adulthood and predicts cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life. Unhealthy sleep is a known modifiable factor for MetS components. However, the prevalence of unhealthy sleep (up to 60%) in emerging adults is alarming, potentially exacerbating downstream future cardiometabolic health. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an evidence-based intervention for unhealthy sleep that improves both sleep quantity and quality. Compared with traditional in-person intervention paradigms, digital CBT-I has comparable efficacy with enhanced accessibility and affordability. However, current digital CBT-I based programs are unable to deliver tailored content and interactive services in a humanlike way, thus are unable to meet the needs of emerging BAA adults at risk for MetS. Building on prior work by the team, the investigators will leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and refine an AI sleep chatbot using CBT-I guidelines and examine its feasibility and efficacy in a 4-week clinical trial in short-or-poor sleeping, emerging BAA adults with at least one MetS factor."
