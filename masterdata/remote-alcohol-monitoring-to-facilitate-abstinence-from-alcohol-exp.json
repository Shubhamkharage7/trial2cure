The goal of this study is to use technological advancements to remotely, accurately, and securely monitor alcohol use with a newly developed smartphone app and breathalyzer. This treatment approach has the potential to facilitate the dissemination of an effective, evidence-based treatment for alcohol dependence to a broader population whose treatment needs are not currently being adequately met."
