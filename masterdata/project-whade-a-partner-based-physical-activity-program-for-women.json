Each participant receives a trained physical activity coach and a physical activity partner; the partner is another woman in the program. Partners communicate with each other between weekly coaching sessions to provide support for physical activity behavior change.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a new method for supporting physical activity in women ages 40-65 who have risk markers for cardiovascular disease. The primary goal is to understand perceptions of support and communication patterns between partner dyads of women in midlife (ages 40-65). The creation of these partner dyads is a promising method for promoting social support and physical activity for this population. Understanding how partners communicate with one another throughout this intervention study will give insight into how women in this population maximize benefits from partnership through communication and shared experiences (e.g., age, gender, cardiovascular disease risk, interest in being more physically active)."
