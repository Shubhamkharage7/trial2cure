The ultrasound contrast agent is called Sonazoid and it consists of tiny gas-filled bubbles about the side of red blood cells. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound with Sonazoid, may help identify more SLNs than standard of care in patients with cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer.",

To determine the concordance between lymphosonography and the standard of care in the identification sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer.\n\nII. To determine if lymphosonography can identify more SLNs with metastatic deposits in patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer when compared to the standard of care.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive perflubutane microbubble (Sonazoid) injections subdermally and then undergo ultrasound over 30 minutes before standard of care cancer treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up for 30 days."
