            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nEnvironmental exposures like pollution, diet, and stress can help cause human diseases, or make them worse. Researchers want to better understand how injury and inflammation are caused by these exposures. They want to collect biological and environmental samples and other data. They may use the samples to measure a range of factors, like hormones, toxins, and chemicals. This will help them improve their studies.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo identify and understand how environmental exposures contribute to human disease.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy adults ages 18 and older\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with questions about their health history, demographics, and medicines they take.\n\nParticipants may give blood, hair, stool, saliva, and/or urine samples. They may have a skin punch biopsy to collect skin cells. They may give fingernail or toenail clippings. They may give a sample of exhaled breath.\n\nParticipants may give a sputum sample. They will inhale a saline mist and cough mucus into a cup.\n\nParticipants may have their nasal passages brushed, scraped, or washed.\n\nParticipants may give cheek cell samples. They will swish mouthwash and spit it into a cup.\n\nParticipants who produce sperm may give samples.\n\nParticipants may have bronchoscopy to collect fluid. A saline solution will be put into their lung and then suctioned out, washing areas of the lung.\n\nParticipants may have a pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound. They may have lung function tests.\n\nParticipants may collect household dust, urine, or stool at home.\n\nParticipants will complete surveys about their health, diet, and exposures.\n\nParticipation will last for one or more study visits.\n\nParticipants may be contacted in the future to take part in other studies.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nEnvironmental exposures such as pollution, diet, stress, etc. contribute to the development and exacerbation of human disease. Understanding the mechanisms of environmentally induced injury and inflammation will allow us to devise better prophylaxis and treatment measures.\n\nSubjects may undergo sampling of (including but not limited to:) blood, urine, saliva, household dust, cheek cells, hair, nasal cells, stool, nail clippings, exhaled breath condensate, sperm samples, skin cells, and/or sputum etc., and may answer predefined questionnaires regarding health and exposures.\n\nStudies which may be performed on collected material includes establishment of cell cultures and immunologic studies.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To identify the interaction of host and environmental factors in the response to injury and the development of disease.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To develop better methodological tools in order to quantify host-environmental interactions in health and disease.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Biological markers of cell/tissue injury and inflammation, such as inflammatory cytokines, intracellular kinases or DNA/RNA damage in association with in vitro or in vivo environmental exposures.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Diseases or pathological processes (e.g. abnormal laboratory values) associated with environmental exposures."
