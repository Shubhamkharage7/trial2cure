            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of intranasal oxytocin on bone health in children with autism spectrum disorder, ages 6-18 years old. Subjects will be randomized to receive intranasal oxytocin or placebo (30 IU, 2 times daily) for 12 months in the double-blind phase, followed by a 6-month open label phase during which all study subjects will receive intranasal oxytocin (30 IU, 2 times daily). Study visits include screening to determine eligibility, followed by study visits at baseline, week 2, and months 6, 12, 18 and phone calls every two weeks for the first two months and monthly thereafter for the duration of the study. Study assessments include history and physical examinations, anthropometric measurements, electrocardiogram (EKG), adverse event monitoring, laboratory tests for chemistries, hormones and biomarkers for bone metabolism, questionnaires regarding diet and exercise, and imaging to assess body composition, bone density and structure.",
            "detailedDescription": "The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a group of behaviorally-defined disorders characterized by impaired social interactions and verbal and non-verbal communication, is increasing among children. Studies have shown that children with ASD are at a higher risk for low bone mineral density and fractures. ASD is also characterized by low levels of oxytocin (OXT), a peptide hormone with prosocial effects. In addition, OXT promotes bone formation over resorption and low levels of OXT are associated with poor bone health. Hence, OXT administration represents a potential strategy for improving bone health in children with ASD, particularly during the childhood and adolescent years when bone accrual peaks.\n\nThe investigators aim to examine (i) whether intranasal OXT administration vs. placebo increases areal bone mineral density (BMD) and improves overall bone health in children with ASD, and (ii) other pathways whereby OXT may impact bone health favorably.\n\nThe investigators will enroll 96 participants 6-18 years old with ASD and randomize them into the intranasal oxytocin vs. placebo groups. The study subjects will undergo history and physical examinations, anthropometric measurements, electrocardiogram (EKG), adverse event monitoring, laboratory tests for chemistries, hormones and biomarkers for bone metabolism, questionnaires regarding diet and exercise, and imaging to assess body composition, bone density and structure."
