The main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is the Tremor Retrainer application usable for patients and are there signs that it can help functional tremor?\n2. Can a televideo administration of the Simplified Functional Movement Disorder Rating Scale give enough information to use this scale via televideo in future studies?",
            "detailedDescription": "Following a one-week observation period, 20 subjects will complete the one-week four hour Tremor Retrainer smartphone protocol.\n\nThe study will consist of 4 in-person visits over 3-4 months and one televideo visit the same day as study visit 1.\n\nFor Objective 1, the investigators will evaluate mHealth Application Usability Questionnaire scores after subjects complete Tremor Retrainer protocol and compare Simplified Functional Movement Disorder Rating Scale (S-FMDRS) scores before (study visit 2) and after (study visits 3 and 4) intervention between groups.\n\nFor Objective 2, the investigators will evaluate which components can be scored after televideo administration of S-FMDRS and measure correlation between randomly-ordered sequential in-person and televideo S-FMDRS administration.\n\nFor Objective 3, the investigators will measure change and variability in S-FMDRS between study visit 1 and 2. S-FMDRS scoring will be completed via video review by a movement disorder neurologist blinded to timing of visit relative to treatment."

Meanwhile, oscillatory movements will be continuously analyzed with frequency calculated and displayed relative to goal frequency, so that the patient receives continuous feedback via a visual dial as to whether they are meeting treatment goals.
