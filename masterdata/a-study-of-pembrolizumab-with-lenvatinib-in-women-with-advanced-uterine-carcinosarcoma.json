The researchers will also do tests to find out whether biomarkers in the blood can predict the cancer's response to the study treatment. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition"
