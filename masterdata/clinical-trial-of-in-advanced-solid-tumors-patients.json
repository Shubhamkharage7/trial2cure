Increased cardiac risk:\n\n      * Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite optimal management (\u2265160/100 mmHg).\n      * Presence of clinically relevant valvular disease.\n      * History of long QT syndrome.\n      * Corrected QT interval (QTcF, Fridericia correction) \u2265450 ms on screening ECG.\n      * History of ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary arteriography or cardiac stress testing with findings consistent with coronary occlusion or infarction \u22646 months prior to study entry.\n      * History of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction \\[LVEF\\] \u226450%) by multiple-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiography (ECHO).\n      * Clinically relevant ECG abnormalities, including any of the following: right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock, second (Mobitz II) or third degree atrioventricular block.\n      * Symptomatic arrhythmia.\n      * Concomitant medication with risk of inducing torsades de pointes, which cannot be discontinued or switched to an alternative drug prior to start PM54 dosing.\n      * Use of a cardiac pacemaker.\n   2. Active infection requiring systemic treatment.\n   3. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or active hepatitis B.\n   4. Any other major illness that, in the Investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the patient's participation in this study (e.g., COVID-19).\n2. Symptomatic, steroid-requiring, and progressing central nervous system (CNS) disease. Exceptions will be made for patients who have completed radiotherapy at least four weeks prior to inclusion (asymptomatic patients taking steroids in the process of already being tapered within two weeks prior to inclusion).\n3. Patients with carcinomatous meningitis.\n4. Prior bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.\n5. Prior treatment with trabectedin, lurbinectedin, or PM14.\n6. Use of (strong or moderate) inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 activity within two weeks prior to the first infusion of PM54.\n7. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the drug product.\n8. Limitation of the patient's ability to comply with the treatment or to follow the protocol procedures.\n9. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding and fertile patients (men and women) who are not using an effective method of contraception. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use an effective contraception method to avoid pregnancy during the course of the trial (and for at least six months after the last infusion).
