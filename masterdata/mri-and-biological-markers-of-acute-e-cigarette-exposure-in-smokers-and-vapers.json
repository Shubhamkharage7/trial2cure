            "briefSummary": "To examine vascular reactivity and inflammatory biomarkers via quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood serum, respectively, in a crossover study where active vapers (electronic cigarette users) and smokers will undergo three separate acute exposure-episodes of electronic cigarette +/- nicotine and tobacco-cig. The MRI exams and blood draws will be performed pre- and post-exposure. The results will be compared against baseline values derived from a group of non-smokers/non-vapers, who will also undergo a blood draw and MRI.",
            "detailedDescription": "This work is an extension of prior funded work on the acute effects of nicotine free electronic cigarette aerosol on vascular function and inflammatory biomarkers in healthy non-smokers. Here, the investigators will examine vascular reactivity and inflammatory biomarkers using quantitative magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) and blood serum in a crossover study, with active vapers (electronic cigarette users) and smokers undergoing three, separate-day, acute exposure-episodes of smoking a tobacco cigarette, an electronic cigarette without nicotine, and an electronic cigarette with nicotine. Participants will undergo an MRI exam and a blood draw pre- and post-exposure-episode.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that all three paradigms will cause a transient response but greatest for tobacco and nicotinized electronic cigarettes. The results will be compared against baseline values derived from a group of non-smokers/non-vapers, who will undergo a blood draw and MRI only. Eligible participants will be healthy, males and females, current, habitual users of electronic or tobacco cigarettes (except for the non-smoking/non-vaping comparison group), 21 to 45 years of age, and without co-morbidities."
