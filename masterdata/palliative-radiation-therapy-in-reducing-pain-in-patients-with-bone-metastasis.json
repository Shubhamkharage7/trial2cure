Palliative radiation therapy using external beam radiation therapy may help patients with bone metastasis to relieve symptoms and reduce pain caused by cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether 8 gray (Gy) x 2 fractions results in lower re-treatment rates compared to 8 Gy x 1 fraction.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether 8 Gy x 2 fractions provides superior pain and narcotic relief compared to 8 Gy x 1 fraction.\n\nII. To determine whether 8 Gy x 2 fractions is associated with improved quality of life compared to 8 Gy x 1 fraction.\n\nIII. To determine whether use of a bone strengthening agent is associated with improved pain relief, narcotic relief and re-treatment rates.\n\nIV. To determine if 8 Gy x 2 fractions is associated with increased toxicity. V. To correlate patient satisfaction, perceived stress, and social support with treatment outcomes.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo 1 fraction of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) over 30 minutes.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo 2 fractions of EBRT over 30 minutes. The 2 fractions will be separated by 3-7 days.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at 3 months."
