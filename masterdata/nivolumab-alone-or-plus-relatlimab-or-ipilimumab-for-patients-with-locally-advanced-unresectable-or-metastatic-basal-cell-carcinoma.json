Eligible, enrolled patients will be assigned to one of 3 cohorts in a non-randomized fashion according to prior treatment history.\n\nCohort A: Patients with advanced BCC (aBCC) who are treatment-na\u00efve (i.e., no prior hedgehog pathway inhibitors and T cell modulating agents) will receive anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) alone. Patients will receive Nivolumab 480mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks (six 8-week cycles).\n\nCohort B: Patients with advanced BCC who experience disease progression on anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) + anti-LAG-3 (Relatlimab) will receive anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) + anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab). Patients will receive Nivolumab 240mg IV + Ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV every 3 weeks x 4 doses, then Nivolumab 480mg IV every 4 weeks x 7 doses starting 6 weeks after the final dose of Ipilimumab + Nivolumab.\n\nCohort C: Patients with advanced BCC who experience disease progression on anti-PD-1 (on or off trial) will receive anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) + anti-LAG-3 (Relatlimab). Patients will receive Nivolumab 480mg IV + Relatlimab 480mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks (six 8-week cycles).\n\nPatients enrolled on Cohort A who demonstrate progressive disease after Nivolumab monotherapy may, if appropriate in the opinion of the investigator, move to Cohort B or Cohort C.\n\nDiscontinuation of nivolumab or ipilimumab +nivolumab or relatlimab + nivolumab may be at the discretion of the investigator under circumstances including but not limited to the following:\n\n1. A complete response to therapy.\n2. A severe IMAR, defined as Grade 3 or greater.\n3. Documented disease progression warranting alternative systemic therapy.\n4. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of study treatment.\n5. Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons."

HBV carriers or those participants requiring antiviral therapy are not eligible to participate.\n\n   iv. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA after discussion with the study P.I.\n\n   f. Participants with a prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years may be permitted to enroll only after discussion with the study P.I. Examples might include locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.\n\n   g. Organ transplant recipients with a functioning allograft will be excluded from this study.\n\n   h. For Cohorts B and C, patients may be excluded from the study if they previously experienced a toxicity to immunotherapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make it unsafe to restart therapy. Examples may include a Grade 3 or greater immune mediated adverse event that was considered related to previous immunotherapy and required immunosuppressive therapy, or an immune mediated adverse event that was considered related to previous immunotherapy and is still \\> grade 1 despite administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Exceptions may include Grade 3 ophthalmologic immune-mediated events that improved to Grade 1 within 2 weeks after topical therapy only, or Grade 3 endocrine immune-mediated events that did not result in symptoms lasting \\>6 weeks and are not requiring \\>7.5mg prednisone or equivalent per day.\n\n   i) For Cohort C, Troponin T (TnT) or I (TnI) \\> 2 \u00d7 institutional ULN.

If TnT or TnI levels are between \\>1 to 2 \u00d7 ULN within 24 hours, the participant may undergo a cardiac consultation and be considered for treatment, following cardiologist recommendation. When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test will be conducted as soon as possible. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are \\< 2 \u00d7 ULN, the participant may undergo a cardiac consultation and be considered for treatment, following cardiologist recommendation.\n2.
