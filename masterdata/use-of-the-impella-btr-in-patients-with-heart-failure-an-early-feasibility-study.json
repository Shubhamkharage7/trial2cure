            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, early feasibility study that aims to evaluate the safety of the Impella BTR\u2122 in adult patients requiring left-ventricular hemodynamic support, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the Impella BTR\u2122 in supporting patients to recovery or their next therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objectives of this Early Feasibility Study are to evaluate the safety of the Impella BTR\u2122 in adult patients requiring left-ventricular hemodynamic support. Additionally, to evaluate the feasibility of the Impella BTR\u2122 in supporting patients to recovery or their next therapy. The investigational device consists of the following primary device and accessories: The Impella BTR\u2122 Pump System (an intravascular transvalvular, micro-axial blood pump) and the Modified Automated Impella Controller\u2122 (AIC) to allow control of the Impella BTR.\n\nFollowing informed consent, subjects that meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, and in whom the Impella BTR\u2122 is implanted or attempted to be implanted, will be considered enrolled into the Study. The device is inserted during a surgical procedure through a vascular graft that has been sutured onto the left or right axillary artery. After proper placement and passage through the aortic valve with the help of a guidewire, the device pumps blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. Once hemodynamic support is no longer required, the device is weaned and removed. Subjects will be followed to 90 days post-implant.\n\nThe primary and secondary endpoints will be summarized and presented without formal statistical testing. All adverse events including all Protocol-defined events, serious and non-serious, will be documented and reported from the time of subject enrollment until Study completion. Feasibility is defined as the ability of the pump to provide clinically adequate support for the duration of the implant up to 28 days. Clinically adequate support is defined as operating without device malfunctions or failures that result in device removal, replacement or use of an additional MCS device."
