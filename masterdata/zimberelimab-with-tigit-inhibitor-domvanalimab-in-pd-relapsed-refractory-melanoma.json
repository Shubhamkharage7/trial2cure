Once enrolled, patients will receive zimberelimab 360 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) and domvanalimab 15 mg/kg Q3W. Patients will undergo restaging scans at W9 following 3 cycles of therapy with response assessed using RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST. Following restaging scans, patients with response will continue to receive zimberelimab and domvanalimab till disease progression, intolerable toxicity or for up to 24 months."
