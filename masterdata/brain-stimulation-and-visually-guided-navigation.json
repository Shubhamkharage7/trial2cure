            "briefSummary": "This study investigates the neural mechanisms causally involved in how people navigate through their immediately visible environment (e.g., walking around one's bedroom flawlessly and effortlessly, not bumping into the walls or furniture). To investigate whether particular neural mechanisms are causally involved in \"visually-guided navigation\", repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to temporarily disrupt the functioning of particular brain regions in healthy adults while they are shown simple visual stimuli of places (e.g., bedrooms, kitchens, and living rooms) and asked to perform simple computer tasks or to complete simple behavioral tasks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Human ability to navigate through the immediately visible environment is crucial for survival. However, the representations and computations underlying this remarkable ability are not well understood, and current computer vision algorithms (robots) still lag far behind human performance. One promising strategy for attempting to understand \"visually-guided navigation\" is to characterize the neural systems that accomplish it. The results from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) on adult humans have begun to elucidate the cortical regions involved in visually-guided navigation, with the central finding that there is at least one visual cortical region - called the occipital place area (OPA) that may play a central role in the ability to navigate through currently visible places (e.g., walking around our bedroom flawlessly and effortlessly, not bumping into the walls or furniture our bedroom). However, fMRI is a correlational method, and research still needs to determine if this functionally specific brain region is causally involved in visually-guided navigation. Understanding the causal involvement of this region will provide important clues about how humans navigate their world, and also perhaps someday be harnessed to help those individuals who devastatingly lose the ability to navigate, as a result of eye diseases, brain surgery, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, or developmental disorders.\n\nThe use of rTMS to investigate the causal involvement of particular brain regions in particular human abilities is not novel, having been used to investigate face recognition, scene recognition, and object recognition. The general question for this research is to determine, using rTMS, the causal involvement of OPA in visually-guided navigation."

Action potentials are triggered in neurons, along with a subsequent period of deactivation. Normal ongoing brain activity is disrupted providing a way for investigators to produce a transient and reversible period of brain disruption.\n\nParticipants will be seated comfortably in a chair and asked to complete either a simple computer-based task or a simple behavioral task that will require them to walk around in a small room. During or just before each of these tasks, participants will receive rTMS. In rTMS, a small plastic coil is placed next to the participant's head. The coil will be placed over the relevant brain region identified during the participant's fMRI scan. The coil will then generate a magnetic pulse, and stimulation will occur.
