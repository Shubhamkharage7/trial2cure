The study team will take a holistic focused approach to build on the experiences of Black women perinatal nurses, Black women/birthing people, and their care partners enrolled in the Holistic Care Partner Program (HCP) to understand the program's feasibility and acceptability. HCP was developed at NYU Langone Health by Blank women-led perinatal nurses to address the effects of obstetric racism and the associated fear of pregnancy and birth faced by Black women and birthing people. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the study will focus on understanding HCP's acceptability and feasibility via surveys and qualitative interviews with Black women and birthing people and their partners/support persons to identify strategies and recommendations for intervention improvement. Exploratory analysis of maternal and infant outcomes will be conducted using a propensity score matched historical control group."
