Only a handful of studies have looked at the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip with a standardized physical therapy treatment, primarily looking at manual therapy versus exercise therapy protocols. However, there are no studies observing the effect of a standardized physical therapy program on patients presenting with non-arthritic hip and groin pain. Based on the gap in the literature, this study will aim to assess the effect of matrix-based standard of care therapy in patients presenting with non-arthritic hip and groin pain."
