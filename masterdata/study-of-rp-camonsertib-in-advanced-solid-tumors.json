This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-3500 (camonsertib) alone or in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine, examine both the pharmacokinetics (PK)and pharmacodynamics (PD)and investigate its anti-tumor activity in solid tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2a, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to:\n\n* Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RP-3500 (camonsertib) when administered orally, alone and in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine, to establish the dose and schedule recommended for the Phase 2\n* Characterize the PK profile of RP-3500 (camonsertib) alone or in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine\n* Identify anti-tumor activity associated with RP-3500 (camonsertib) given alone or in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine\n* Examine biomarker responses and establish a correlation with RP-3500 (camonsertib) exposure and clinical outcomes.\n\nThe initial cohorts will test RP-3500 (camonsertib) as monotherapy. Additional cohorts will enroll with RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine.\n\nAfter the RP2D and schedule is determined, expansion cohort(s) for RP-3500 (camonsertib) will be enrolled to study the anti-tumor effect, and further examine the safety and PK of RP-3500 (camonsertib) at the RP2D"
