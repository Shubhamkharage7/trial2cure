            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare chronic liver disease. It affects the bile ducts of the\n\nliver. It can result in bile duct infections, cirrhosis, cancer, and end stage liver disease. Researchers want to learn more about this disease.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo understand the biological causes of primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 and older who have primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.\n\nParticipants will give blood, saliva, urine, and stool samples. They will have nasal swabs. They will complete surveys.\n\nParticipants will get an intravenous (IV) catheter. A plastic tube is inserted into an arm vein.\n\nParticipants will have a colonoscopy. A tube with a video camera at the end is inserted into the rectum.\n\nParticipants will have an upper endoscopy. A scope with a light and camera at its tip is used to look inside the upper digestive tract.\n\nParticipants will have a liver biopsy, entering through the chest wall or a neck vein. Blood is drawn from a blood vessel that carries blood to the liver. A liver tissue sample is taken.\n\nParticipants will have magnetic resonance imaging or spectroscopy. They will get a contrast agent through an IV.\n\nParticipants may have an optional bone marrow aspiration. A large needle is inserted into the hip to withdraw marrow.\n\nParticipants will have a liver ultrasound.\n\nParticipants will complete a 3-day food diary. They will have a nutrition assessment.\n\nParticipants may give contact details for people who live with them, to also take part in this study.\n\nParticipation will last for 12 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nWe hypothesize that primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) develops as a consequence of a genetically driven aberrant immune response to commensal or pathogenic bacteria, and that unique genetic-immunemicrobial associations may underlie development of distinct disease patterns. We intend to conduct a thorough radiologic, endoscopic, histologic and microbiological investigation of patients with PSC in order to determine potential associations.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nThe ultimate goal of this study is to generate understanding of how factors driving pathogenesis in PSC interact by capturing and integrating collated datasets from across relevant biologic systems and interpreting those in the context of phenotypic presentation in one exceptionally well-characterized set of patients.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To collect comprehensive data on distinct patterns of disease expression, through single cell sequencing and microRNA and transcriptome profiling.\n2. To conduct extensive phenotypic characterization of cellular and humoral immune responses as well as microbiome signatures at multiple anatomic sites.\n3. To evaluate metabolic signatures or biomarkers for PSC diagnosis and prognostication.\n4. To generate a humanized mouse model of each subject s disease by obtaining bone marrow aspirate.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\n1. Identification of immune signatures at multiple levels and from different anatomical sites and tissues\n2. Characterization of microbiome signatures (taxonomic and functional), as well as identification of specific species.\n3. Identification of metabolomic signatures from different anatomical sites and tissues as well as identification of different biomarkers correlating with disease progression.\n4. MicroRNA profiling of portal and systemic blood."
