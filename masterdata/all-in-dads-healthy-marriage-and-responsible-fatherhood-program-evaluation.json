            "detailedDescription": "After being informed about the study and giving consent, participants will enroll in a five-week All in Dads! program that collects data at enrollment, at the end of the program, and 12 months following the program. Research questions in this study are framed by a Descriptive Evaluation Design to assess whether outcomes improve for low-income fathers who participate in the All in Dads! (AID!) Project. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed before and after participants complete core curricula-Father Factor, The New Playbook, and Money Smart-and Job Readiness Coaching and Career Development as employment support services (pre to post). Primary outcome measures will indicate whether behavior improved for healthy family relationships (parent, co-parent, and partner) and economic stability (financial, employment). Secondary outcome measures will indicate whether behavior improved for the attitudes and expectations that facilitate and reflect behavior for healthy family relationships and economic stability."
