The primary outcomes include the responses to questions 13-28 from the Opioid Attitudes and Beliefs survey.\n\nSecondary\n\n1. To evaluate Hispanic/Latino individuals' reports of personal experiences with the use of opioids. The corresponding outcomes are the responses to questions 1-12 from the Opioid Attitudes and Beliefs survey.\n2. To find out any potential reasons why some Hispanic/Latino individuals may refuse to use clinically indicated opioid prescriptions. These outcomes are the responses to questions 14-15 from the Opioid Attitudes and Beliefs survey.\n3. To explore factors associated with participant's comfort with the use opioid analgesics for their pain. The outcome will be the association between participants' responses to question 2 and their characteristics such as age, gender, race, level of education, extent of acculturation, knowledge of opioids, or previous opioid use."
