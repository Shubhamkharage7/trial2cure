            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II, single-arm, multi-center study assessing the feasibility and tolerance of WBRT using upfront PRDR in the treatment of solid tumor brain metastases. This study will also examine the impact of substituting PRDR for standard whole-brain radiation therapy in the upfront treatment of brain metastases on neurocognitive decline as compared to historical controls. Additionally, clinical patient outcomes associated with radiation treatment of brain metastases will be collected. Using a group sequential design with one interim analysis to stop for futility, the investigators will recruit and enroll 53 adult patients (\u226518 years) undergoing upfront treatment of brain metastases to determine feasibility and a preliminary analysis after the first 27 enrolled patients.\n\nIn order to be eligible for this study, patients must have a biopsy-proven solid malignancy with intracranial lesions radiographically consistent with or pathologically proven to be brain metastases. Patient who are confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria will be registered to the study and start PRDR WBRT within two weeks postregistration. Patients will receive PRDR WBRT as a dose of 30Gy in 10 fractions and start memantine orally two days prior to (or one day prior to) but no later than the fourth PRDR WBRT treatment session."

Willing and able to give consent and to comply with treatment and follow-up schedule.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Metastases from hematological malignancy, or central nervous system malignancy.\n2. Patients whose malignancy is being treated with curative intent.\n3. Leptomeningeal metastases.\n4. Contraindication to MRI imaging with contrast.\n5. Contraindication to memantine including concurrent use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists.\n6. Stage IV-V chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.\n7. Participants with a maximum tumor diameter exceeding 5 cm (if not resected).\n8. Prior cranial whole brain radiation therapy.\n9.
