            "detailedDescription": "Participants will complete 4 testing sessions that will be held on 4 separate days (Baseline, Eccentric Exercise day, 48 hours post exercise, and 72 hours post exercise). All sessions will take place in the National Institute of Fitness and Sport, where the Department of Kinesiology laboratories are located.\n\nDuring the first session (Baseline), the purpose and procedures of the research will be explained by the investigator, co-investigator, or a research assistant in more detail. Participants will read and sign the informed consent form and then undergo an exclusion/inclusion criteria assessment which includes the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), and brief questionnaire. All study personnel/staff obtaining informed consent will be trained in the responsible conduct of research. All participants will be asked if they have a known allergy to Kinesio Tape (KT) or if they have sensitive skin. Those with sensitive skin will be administered an allergy test. After screening and enrollment, participants will complete baseline assessments of muscle pain and function, pain sensitivity, and psychological risk factors (See outcome measures).\n\nDuring Session 2, strength of the non-dominant bicep will be measured first. Participants will then perform an eccentric exercise protocol designed to induce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) on the non-dominant arm. Strength of the non-dominant bicep will be measured immediately post the eccentric exercise protocol. At the end of this session, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (experimental KT group, placebo KT group) or a control group (i.e., no intervention performed). The experimental group will receive KT with proper technique and tension (10-20%), while the placebo group will receive KT without technique and tension.\n\nSessions 3 and 4 will occur approximately 48 and 72 hours post Session 2, respectively. All the outcome variables will be measured during these sessions. For participants in the KT groups, the tape will be removed at the end of session 4, as described below."
