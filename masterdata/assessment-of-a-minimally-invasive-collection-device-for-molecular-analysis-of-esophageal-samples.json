            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates the use of cytosponge, a minimally invasive collection device, for the detection of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in patients undergoing endoscopy. Non-endoscopic swallowable encapsulate sponge cell collection devices combined with markers for BE/esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) detection are a guideline-endorsed alternative to endoscopy for BE screening. The Oncoguard registered trademark Esophagus test (OGE) test uses esophageal cytology specimens collected with a minimally invasive, non-endoscopic, encapsulated sponge sampling device to identify BE/EAC biomarkers that indicate whether a patient should undergo diagnostic endoscopy. The OGE test is a simple and cost effective screening method that may lower barriers to widespread adoption of BE screening in at risk patients, resulting in increased and earlier detection of BE/EAC.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Measure Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) yield from esophageal cytology samples collected with the Cytosponge device.\n\nII. Evaluate the methylated DNA markers (MDM) levels and accuracy of the Oncoguard Esophagus test (OGE test) for the detection of methylated DNA markers in Cytosponge collected esophageal cytology samples.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the tolerability of the Cytosponge device using a tolerability questionnaire II. Evaluate presence of any trauma to the esophagus from the passage of the Cytosponge device using the endoscopic injury score.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients with known or suspected Barrett's Esophagus undergo a biopsy and sample collection with the cytosponge followed by standard of care endoscopy and complete surveys while on study.\n\nARM II: Patients without known or suspected Barrett's Esophagus undergo a biopsy and sample collection with the cytosponge followed by standard of care endoscopy and complete surveys while on study."
