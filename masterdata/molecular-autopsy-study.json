Genetic testing of the index subjects and their parents (or other biological family members if parents are not available) will be assessed for potential heritable causes of sudden death. By combining the wide catchment base of the San Diego Medical Examiner's Office, sequencing expertise of SD-based collaborators, computing power of the San Diego Supercomputer Center and in-house and external genomic analytics, the Scripps Translational Science Institute aims to provide a more complete characterization and understanding of the genetic causes of sudden death. Ultimately, findings from this study will be utilized to identify previously unrecognized mechanism of sudden death allowing for the development of preventative screening programs and potentially life-saving interventions."
