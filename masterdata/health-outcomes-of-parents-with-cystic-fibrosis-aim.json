            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational prospective study is to determine the health impact of parenthood on United States (US) people with CF in the era of CF transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR) modulators. The investigators will collect physical and mental health data to comprehensively evaluate the impact of parenthood in CF with widespread highly effective CFTR modulator use. The main hypotheses this study aims to examine are:\n\nH1: Parents with CF and moderate-to-severe depression have more rapid change in ppFEV1 (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second) versus those with mild or no depression.\n\nH2: Parents with CF who have more parental responsibility and/or stress have more rapid ppFEV1 (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second) change than those with less responsibility/stress\n\nH3: Parents using CFTR modulators have decreased ppFEV1 (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second) change versus those not using CFTR modulators\n\nParticipants will complete quarterly surveys during the first year of parenthood and biannual surveys, thereafter, using the computer-based survey system on an iPad protected for infection control or via personal device or computer via emailed survey link.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will follow 146 new parents of children \\<5 years of age at 18 participating US adult CF centers to assess the primary outcome of percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) up to 5 years after becoming a parent. A prospective approach will capture the immediate and long-term impact of the use of the highly effective CFTR modulator ETI (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) by \\~90 percent of US adults with CF. By combining objective health measures and participant surveys, the investigators can comprehensively assess the psychosocial impacts of parenthood and explore the interplay between the parenting role and physical and mental health. The investigators anticipate identifying modifiable factors that may ameliorate negative health impacts of parenthood. The investigators will conduct hypothesis-generating, semi-structured dyadic interviews with a subset of parents and their key supports (partner/family/friend) to inform future interventions. The investigators have selected qualitative methodology to avoid preconceived theories/hypotheses."
