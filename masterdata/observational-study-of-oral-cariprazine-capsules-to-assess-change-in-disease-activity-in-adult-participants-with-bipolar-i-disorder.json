This prospective, observational study will examine effectiveness, functioning and quality of life outcomes in adult patients with BP-I experiencing a major depressive episode (with or without mixed features) requiring treatment and initiating treatment with cariprazine. It will examine outcomes of cariprazine treatment in a real-world setting in patients with BP-I commonly seen in clinical practices.\n\nCariprazine (Vraylar) is a medication indicated in the United States and Canada to treat adult patients experiencing manic, mixed or depressive episodes associated with BP-I. This study plans to enroll approximately 170 adult patients with BP-I from the United States and Canada. Cariprazine should be prescribed by the physician under the usual and customary practice of physician prescription. The decision to initiate treatment with cariprazine should be made prior to, and independently from, the patient's decision to participate in the study.\n\nParticipants will receive cariprazine as prescribed by their physician. Observational data will be collected during visits which should align to routine standard of care for a duration of up to 24 weeks."
