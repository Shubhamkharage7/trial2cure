            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study is a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) to identify an effective adaptive intervention (AI) for adolescents at elevated suicide risk transitioning from acute psychiatric care. Participants will be initially randomized to Motivational Interview (MI)-enhanced safety planning (MI-SP) or to MI-SP with supportive text messages delivered for four weeks after discharge (Texts) (Phase 1 intervention). Adolescents who are classified as Phase 1 non-responders at the end of the first or at the end of the second week post-discharge, based on their responses to daily surveys , will be re-randomized to either added booster call or portal follow-up (Phase 2 intervention). Those classified as Phase 1 responders at the end of the second week post discharge will continue with the initially assigned intervention options. Thus, participants will receive one of six treatment sequences resulting from the different intervention components or their combinations. These six treatment sequences, in turn, will form four AIs.\n\nThe study team anticipates that AIs that begin with MI-SP plus text-based support will have:\n\n* lower odds of suicidal behavior 3 months post discharge\n* longer time to suicidal behavior over the 6 month follow-up\n* less severe suicidal ideation over the 6-month follow-up\n\nAdditionally, the study team anticipates that the AI that begins with MI-SP + Texts followed by portal follow-up for non-responders will lead to:\n\n* lowest odds of suicidal behavior within 3 months\n* longest time to suicidal behavior over the 6 month follow up\n* least severe ideation over the 6-month follow-up"
