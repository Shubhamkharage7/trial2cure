            "briefSummary": "The study participant is being asked to take part in this clinical trial, a type of research study, because the participant is a young child with sickle cell disease or the caregiver of a child with sickle cell disease. This study is being done to test a school readiness program for children with sickle cell disease (ages 4-6 years old).\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nAssess feasibility and acceptability of an adapted school readiness intervention among preschool children (ages 4-6) diagnosed with sickle cell disease.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nObjective 1:\n\nMeasure preliminary efficacy of the adapted school readiness intervention compared to routine care among preschool children ages (4-6) diagnosed with sickle cell disease.\n\nObjective 2:\n\nExamine implementation factors (i.e., barriers and facilitators) during post-intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "* Group randomization- Parent and child will be randomly selected (like the flip of a coin) to receive either the school readiness intervention or the standard school resources.\n* Attend virtual classroom program sessions- If the participant is in the school readiness group, the caregiver, will attend about 8 weeks of sessions virtually with a teacher and a caregiver of a child with sickle cell, for a total of 8 sessions. The sessions will be during the summer and done in a group. Each session will last about 1 \u00bd hours and will be video recorded. These sessions will be shared with another researcher for feedback and consistency.\n* Complete a caregiver interview-If you are in the school readiness group, a member of the study team will interview you after the virtual classroom sessions are over. The interview will take about 15-20 minutes and will be audio recorded. The caregiver will be asked for suggestions and how satisfied with the program.\n* Complete assessments - Caregiver and child will complete a set of assessments that evaluate school readiness skills (e.g., early math and reading), child behaviors, and parent-child relationships before and after the intervention."
