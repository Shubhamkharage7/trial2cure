The study will clarify the role of contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy in driving intention to initiate contraception postpartum and describe the impact of environmental barriers on enacting intended postpartum contraception initiation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be a sequential mixed-methods design with a prospective cohort to identify and explore barriers to contraceptive initiation both immediately after birth and prior to hospital discharge, as well as throughout the fourth trimester. It will include a baseline patient survey, electronic medical record data pull, follow up survey, and qualitative interviews.\n\nThe investigators will enroll 1400 patients into the prospective cohort, selecting individuals enrolled at prenatal care visits at two sites. The baseline survey will be self-administered. The investigators will then contact participants for a follow-up survey at 12 weeks postpartum. Surveys will be self-administered through a link received by text message or email. Additional analyses will draw on retrospectively collected medical record data.\n\nThe investigators will invite a subset of 25-30 study subjects to participate in qualitative interviews."
