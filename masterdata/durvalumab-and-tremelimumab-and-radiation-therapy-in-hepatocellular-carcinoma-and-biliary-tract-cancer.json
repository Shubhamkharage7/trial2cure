Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe FDA has not approved tremelimumab as a treatment for any disease.\n\nBoth durvalumab and tremelimumab are antibodies (proteins that work with the immune system) that target proteins produced by the cancer cells. These cancerous proteins suppress the immune system which allows the cancer cells to grow. The study drugs may target these cancerous proteins and stop the cancer cells from suppressing the immune system.\n\nThe investigators hope that the combination of these study drugs with radiation therapy will help stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading."
