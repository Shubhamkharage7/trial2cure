            "briefSummary": "Primary brain cancer kills up to 10,000 Americans a year. These brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a significant unmet clinical need in oncology.\n\nThe investigators have completed a Phase I clinical trial that has shown that Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (BV) is safe up to a dose of 15mg/kg in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Additionally, the investigators have shown in a recently completed Phase I/II clinical trial, that SIACI BV improves the median progression free survival (PFS) from 4-6 months to 11.5 months and overall survival (OS) from 12-15 months to 23 months in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Therefore, this two-arm, randomized trial (2:1) is a follow up study to these trials and will ask simple questions: Will this repeated SIACI treatment regimen increase progression free survival (PFS-primary endpoint) and overall survival (OS-secondary endpoint) when compared with standard of care in patients with newly diagnosed GBM? Exploratory endpoints will include adverse events and safety analysis as well as quality of life (QOL) assessments. The investigators expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI BV therapy for newly diagnosed GBM and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future.",
            "detailedDescription": "Those randomized to the treatment group (IA BV+TMZ/RT )the experimental aspects will include:\n\n1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to IA BV infusion. Mannitol is delivered IA, 12.5 mL over 2 minutes in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. IA mannitol has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.\n2. Subjects will then be treated with repeated IA BV. Each patient will receive one dose of IA BV on day 30, followed by chemoradiation. IA BV will be repeated every three months for a total of 3 infusions."
