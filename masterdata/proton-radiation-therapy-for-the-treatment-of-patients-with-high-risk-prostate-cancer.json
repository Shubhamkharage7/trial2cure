            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates whether proton radiation therapy directed to the prostate tumor, pelvic, and para-aortic lymph nodes, is an effective way to treat patients with high-risk or lymph node positive prostate cancer who are receiving radiation therapy, and if it will result in fewer gastrointestinal and genitourinary side effects. Proton beam therapy is a new type of radiotherapy that directs multiple beams of protons (positively charged subatomic particles) at the tumor target, where they deposit the bulk of their energy with essentially no residual radiation beyond the tumor. By reducing the exposure of the healthy tissues and organs to radiation in the treatment of prostate cancer, proton therapy has the potential to better spare healthy tissue and reduce the side effects of radiation therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity compared to historical photon treatments.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity compared to historical photon treatments.\n\nII. To assess the feasibility of extended-field proton irradiation of high-risk prostate.\n\nIII. To demonstrate safety of proton therapy followed by high dose rate (HDR) boost.\n\nIV. To determine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of toxicity.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo conventionally fractionated proton beam therapy daily on Monday-Friday. Patients may receive a high-dose rate brachytherapy boost.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 years."
