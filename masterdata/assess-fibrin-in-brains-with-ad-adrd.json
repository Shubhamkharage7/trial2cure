            "detailedDescription": "While there are many potential therapeutics being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), there is currently no known cure for ADRD and its origin and pathophysiology are still not well understood. However, the association of fibrin with ADRD is becoming increasingly clearer. Up to now it was not possible to quantify brain fibrin in vivo to better elucidate its role in ADRD, but recently, 64Cu-FBP8 was proposed as a tool to detect thrombus anywhere in the body. This unique tool will allow us to non-invasively assess brain fibrin levels in at-risk and ADRD subjects.\n\nThe goal of this project is to use 64Cu-FBP8-PET in the brains of subjects ranging from cognitively normal to clinically diagnosed with ADRD to assess fibrin levels. It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study. 64Cu-FBP8-PET is not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
