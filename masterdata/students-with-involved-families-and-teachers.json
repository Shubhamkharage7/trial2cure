            "briefSummary": "PURPOSE: In the proposed project, the investigators seek to examine whether the SWIFT Program might be efficacious to improve students' prosocial skills and emotion and behavior regulation and improve home-school communication and the use of positive parenting practices for families. The investigators will also test whether the SWIFT program might be efficacious to improve students' longer-term school adjustment and parents' involvement in school.\n\nSETTING: Study activities will take place in ten school districts in Lane County, OR. The districts have approximately 10,000 middle school students (Grades 6-8), and approximately 60% of students are eligible for free and reduced price lunch. Some participating districts participated in the IES-funded Goal 2 study to develop the SWIFT Program.\n\nPOPULATION: 320 students in Grades 6-8 who are receiving special education services for emotional or behavioral disorders, and transitioning or at risk of transitioning between school settings and placements will be recruited. Parents and content area teachers of all participating students will be recruited to complete assessment measures. It is expected that up to 15% of the children in the study will be of Latino ethnicity and approximately 60% will be European-American and 10-20% will be of other or multiple ethnicities.\n\nINTERVENTION: The SWIFT Program is a 9-12 month intervention that includes four components: (a) behavioral progress monitoring, (b) case management of the intervention elements and coordination with the school, (c) parent support to promote parent engagement/collaboration with the school and study routines in the home, and (d) behavioral skills coaching for students.\n\nSERVICES AS USUAL (SAU) CONTROL CONDITION: The SAU students and families will continue to receive any services that they were receiving prior to their entry into the study (as will the SWIFT students and families). These may include school-based interventions and supports and related services as required in the student's IEP."

Key outcomes will be tested at Time 1 (T1, baseline), Time 2 (T2, 6 months post-baseline), Time 3 (T3, 12 months post-baseline), and Time 4 (T4, 18 months post-baseline).",
