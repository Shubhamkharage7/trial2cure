To help understand rare plasma cell disorders and its association with gut microbiome, the investigators will study the stool samples of newly diagnosed POEMS patients and AL amyloidosis and compare it with patients with newly diagnosed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma as well as healthy controls. Moreover, gut microbiome in newly diagnosed POEMS patients will be compared to POEMS patients in remission. It is the overall hypothesis that in POEMS patients the gut microbiome signature will differ between active disease (at diagnosis) and inactive disease (in remission), and the gut microbiome in POEMS patients will be different from patients with other plasma cell disorders and healthy controls."
