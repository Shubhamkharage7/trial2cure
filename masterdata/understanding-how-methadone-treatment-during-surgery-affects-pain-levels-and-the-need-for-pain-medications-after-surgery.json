Participants' pain will be measured by how much pain is reported after surgery, and how much additional pain medication is needed to lower pain levels. The researchers will look at whether giving methadone during surgery reduces the need for other pain medications after surgery. In addition, the team will compare the effects of the two standard treatments- one with methadone and one without methadone to to evaluate which one works best."
