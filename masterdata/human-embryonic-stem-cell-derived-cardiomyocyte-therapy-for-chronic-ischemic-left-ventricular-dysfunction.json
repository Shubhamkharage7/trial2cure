Patients on Coumadin will be withdrawn 5 days before the procedure and confirmed to have an INR \\< 1.3. Patients who cannot be withdrawn from Coumadin will be excluded from enrollment.\n* Have known allergies to penicillin or streptomycin.\n* Be an organ transplant recipient.\n* Have a history of organ or cell transplant rejection.\n* Have a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., patients with prior malignancy must be disease-free for 5 years), except curatively-treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma.\n* Have a non-cardiac condition that limits lifespan to \\< 1 year.\n* Be on chronic therapy with immunosuppressant medication, such as corticosteroids or TNF\u03b1 antagonists.\n* Be serum-positive for HIV, hepatitis BsAg, or viremic hepatitis C.\n* Be currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an investigational therapeutic or device trial.\n* Be a female patient who is pregnant, nursing, or have child-bearing potential but is not using effective birth control.\n* Tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the last 30 days",
