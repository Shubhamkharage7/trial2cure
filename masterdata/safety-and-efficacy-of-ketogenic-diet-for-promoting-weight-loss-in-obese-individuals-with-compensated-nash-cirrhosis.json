The safety endpoints captured in the study include liver decompensation events, measured through several questionnaires, fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, fasting lipid profile and other adverse events. The tolerability of the ketogenic diet will be assessed by study compliance and by administering a questionnaire.\n\nSecondary aims include weight loss, changes in body composition via serial use of bioelectrical impedance via an Inbody Machine, changes in liver fat and liver stiffness using MRI and proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), liver biochemistries, changes in Child-Turcotte-Pugh and MELD scores measured via labs and changes in liver steatosis and stiffness via serial measures of VCTE by FibroScan\u00ae."
