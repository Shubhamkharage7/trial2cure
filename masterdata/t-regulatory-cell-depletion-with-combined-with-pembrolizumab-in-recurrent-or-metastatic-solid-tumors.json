            "briefSummary": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer: nearly 22,000 women are diagnosed with OC in the US annually and 63% are expected to die from their disease. The 5-year overall survival rate is unacceptably low at 20-30%, with \\> 50% of patients experiencing recurrence of their disease. Recurrent, platinum-resistant OC is characterized by a low response to chemotherapy (\\<10-15%) and poor prognosis, with overall survival estimated to be \\<12 months. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapies to improve outcomes for patients with recurrent, platinum resistant OC. The primary focus in this trial is targeting tumor associated immunosuppressive T-regs with E7777 combined with PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab. This trial will enroll patients with solid tumors in the dose escalation portion and specified cohorts in the dose expansion portion. In the Phase I portion, 18-30 patients will be enrolled. In the dose expansion portion, approximately 40 patients (20 in each cohort) will be enrolled. Given the relatively poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this population is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates.",
            "detailedDescription": "Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has emerged as a promising option in several solid tumors, given its durable response and low toxicities. However, the durable benefit of ICI as monotherapy is limited to certain cancers like melanoma, or cancer with a deficient mismatch repair system. However, in the majority of cancers the response rate is lower. For example, the response rate to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monotherapy in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) has been underwhelming, with a range of 8-15%.\n\nE7777 or denileukin diftitox is a recombinant cytotoxic fusion protein composed of the amino acid sequences for diphtheria toxin fragments A and B (Met1-Thr387)-His and for human interleukin-2 (Ala1-Thr133). Denileukin diftitox has been marketed in the US as ONTAK\u00ae (Eisai code name E7272) since 1999 and is indicated for the treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) whose malignant cells express the CD25 component of the IL-2 receptor.\n\nThis open label study will investigate the safety and efficacy of a combined regimen of pembrolizumab with T-regulatory cell depletion and E7777 in patients diagnosed with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors in the second line setting. This study will have 2 stages: dose escalation and dose expansion. In the dose escalation, any solid tumor where pembrolizumab is approved for or felt as an appropriate therapy by treating physician based on prior trials with encouraging activities including (but not limited to): renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, MSI-H cancer, endometrial cancer (EC), and non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, urothelial cancer. The expansion cohort will include ovarian cancer and MSI-H cancer cohort. More cohorts can be considered later.\n\nThe TITE-CRM method of dose assignment will be used, which will improve the quality of the assessment of potential toxicities better than the 3+3 method, and will facilitate the evaluation of efficacy. Participants will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities and/or dose limiting toxicities. E7777 will be given for 8 cycles and Pembrolizumab will be continued after that."

No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority. Patients with HIV infection with following exception are allowed: HIV-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with viral load within 6 months of enrollment are eligible for this trial.\n  * Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection except following situation: Patients with a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection are allowed to be included if: participant on a stable dose of antiviral therapy, HBV viral load below the limit of quantification. HCV viral load below the limit of quantification.\n  * Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n  * Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies except what is specified in the inclusion criteria.\n\n    o Prior anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 therapy is allowed in the dose escalation cohort and prior PD1/PDL1 inhibitors are allowed in the MSI-H expansion cohort.\n  * Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 \\[IL-2\\]) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment\n  * Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\n    * Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after Principal Investigator confirmation has been obtained.\n    * Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n  * History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n  * Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the pembrolizumab formulation\n  * Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the E7777 formulation\n  * Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment or within 6 months for pembrolizumab and E7777 after the final dose of study treatment o Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment.",
