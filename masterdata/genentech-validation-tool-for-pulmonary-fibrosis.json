The primary goal of this project will be to create a tool using findings on chest computed tomography (CT) for nearly 300 patients with the most common types of fibrosis. The tool will be tested using chest CT scans of an additional 100 patients with the 3 most common diagnoses of fibrosis. The second objective will be to further validate the tool by performing a reader study with 3 co-investigating radiologists and ask them to look at 100 CT scans of patients with fibrosis without tool and then with tool and see if accuracy of diagnosis improves compared to the working diagnosis when using the tool."
