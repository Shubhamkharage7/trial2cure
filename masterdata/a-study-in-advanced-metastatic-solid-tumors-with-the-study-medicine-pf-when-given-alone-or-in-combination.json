            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety (the impact of the study drug on the participant's body), effects of the study drug alone or in combination with bevacizumab or sasanlimab, and to find the best dose.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who have solid tumors that:\n\n* have advanced (cancer that doesn't disappear or stay away with treatment) or\n* has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).\n\nThis includes (but limited to) the following cancer types:\n\n* Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): It's a type of lung cancer where the cells grow slowly but often spread to other parts of the body.\n* Colorectal Cancer (CRC): This is a disease where cells in the colon or rectum grow out of control.\n* Urothelial Cancer (UC): This is a cancer that starts in the urinary systems.\n* Melanoma: Skin cancer that develops when melanocytes (the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color) start to grow out of control.\n\nAll participants in this study will receive the study medication (PF-07329640) as an IV infusion (given directly into a vein) at the study clinic every week for repeating 28-day cycles.\n\nDepending on which part of the study participants are enrolled in they will receive the study medication (PF-07329640 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications (bevacizumab or sasanlimab). Bevacizumab is given in the clinic as IV infusion every two weeks and sasanlimab is given as a shot under the skin every 4 weeks.\n\nParticipants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07329640) and bevacizumab until their cancer is no longer responding. Participants who are taking sasanlimab may receive it for up to 2 years.\n\nThe study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will be involved in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, they will have a study visit every week. After they have stopped taking the study medication (at about at 2 years) they will be followed for another two years to see how they are doing."
