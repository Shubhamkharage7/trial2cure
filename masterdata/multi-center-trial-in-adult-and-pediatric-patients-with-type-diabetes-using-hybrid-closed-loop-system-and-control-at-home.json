            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Hybrid Closed Loop system (HCL) in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in the home setting. A diverse population of patients with type 1 diabetes will be studied. The study population will have a large range for duration of diabetes and glycemic control, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). They will be enrolled in the study regardless of their prior diabetes regimen, including using Multiple Daily Injections (MDI), Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) or Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy (SAP)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a 6 month, multi-center, randomized, parallel, adaptive study in type 1 diabetes with a 6 month continuation period. The study will have three periods, per Cohort:\n\n1. Run-in Period: The run-in period can be up to 60 days during which time a blinded CGM sensor will be worn for two weeks.\n2. Study Period: There will be a 6 month randomized study period with two arms: The HCL system and Control.\n3. Continuation Period: There will be a 6 month continuation period during which time all subjects will use the HCL system with Auto Mode.\n\nUp to 1500 subjects will be enrolled in order to have 1000 subjects complete the study. Up to 70 investigational Centers in the US, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand will be enrolled."
