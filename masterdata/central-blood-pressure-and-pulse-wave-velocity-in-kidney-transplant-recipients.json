Using an oscillometric monitor, the investigators aim to non-invasively obtain the central blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV), or arterial stiffness, of children with kidney disease. The investigators will also enroll age- and race-matched healthy controls and measure the same parameters for comparison. In addition, the investigators will measure PWV by standard arterial tonometry method in a subset of patients.",

Using an oscillometric blood pressure monitor, the investigators aim to non-invasively obtain the central blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV), or arterial stiffness, of children with kidney disease.\n2. Measure oscillometric central blood pressure and PWV in age and race matched healthy children.\n3. Measure PWV by standard arterial tonometry method in a subset of patients, and compare these measurements to the PWV measured using the oscillometric device.\n4. Measure body composition of patients and controls (Body Mass Index, Waist-to-Height ratio, %body fat, and mid-arm muscle circumference) to see how this relates to central blood pressure and PWV."
