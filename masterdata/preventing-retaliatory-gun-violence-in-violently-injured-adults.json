            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to find out if a hospital-based violence intervention (Bridging the Gap) is effective for reducing violence. The researchers think that adults who receive Bridging the Gap will see greater improvements than those who do not receive the intervention. This study will allow them to learn more about the intervention's effectiveness. The study will also help them understand if the violence intervention affects other behaviors, such as firearm use, drug use, aggression, risky behaviors, and rates of violent re-injury.",
            "detailedDescription": "Approximately 616 patients will enroll in this study. Participants will be asked to complete sessions about behavior, personality, and experiences. Participants will be randomized into a study group (either Bridging the Gap or Treatment as Usual) by drawing a number. If patients agree to the study but do not like the group they are assigned to, they can request to switch groups. Participants assigned to the Treatment as Usual intervention will receive a brief violence awareness brochure during your hospital stay. Participants assigned to the Bridging the Gap intervention will receive an in-hospital intervention and, once released from the hospital, will receive 6-months of community case management services. The study team thinks that adults who receive the Bridging the Gap intervention will see greater improvements than adults who do not receive the intervention. This study will allow them to learn more about the intervention's effectiveness.\n\nDuring these study sessions participants will complete questionnaires about exposure to traumatic events, symptoms of trauma, history of suicide, aggression and violence, antisocial personality traits, illegal behaviors, substance use, and mental health. Participants will complete several tasks which measure cognitive ability, such as problem-solving, attention/concentration, and decision-making. They will also complete a clinical interview that covers antisocial personality traits and behaviors, including history of aggressive behavior and substance use. These interviews will be video recorded. These recordings will be used to help score the interviews and for training purposes. Information will also be collected from participant's medical records, including demographic information, history and reason for past hospitalizations, mental health history, and substance use reports, as well as a criminal background check.\n\nThe surveys take about 2 hours to complete. Participants will complete these questionnaires again 6 and 12 months later. Participation in this study will last up to 12 months."
