            "briefSummary": "This Study is designed to test an investigational product (IP) called LSTA1 (Study drug). LSTA1 is a drug designed to improve the delivery of anti-cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. Improved delivery of chemotherapy may result in improved anti-cancer effects when given with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients with peritoneal metastases. Participants will be randomized to receive LSTA1 with HIPEC or HIPEC alone (without LSTA1) at the time of surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Given the high recurrence and disease-related mortality in patients with peritoneal metastases from appendiceal, colorectal, and ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC), use of an agent to improve operative tumor delivery of co-administered anticancer drugs during HIPEC would potentially have significant impact on oncologic outcomes.\n\nSafety of LSTA1 has been demonstrated in the context of metastatic pancreatic cancer when administered intravenously with cytotoxic chemotherapy, but the investigators wish to determine its safety and potential efficacy when administered intraperitoneally with HIPEC in patients with peritoneal metastases from appendiceal, colorectal, and ovarian cancer."
