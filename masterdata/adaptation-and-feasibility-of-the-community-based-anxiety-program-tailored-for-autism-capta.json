The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of implementing this treatment in community care centers.",

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for autistic youth is effective at treating anxiety, but access is limited. The investigators have tailored the treatment to make it more accessible to families in the participants' home communities. The purpose of this project is to investigate how feasible it is to implement Community-Based Anxiety Programs Tailored for Autism (CAPTA) in community settings."

Child has a verbal intelligence quotient \\> 70, as measured by the Verbal Comprehension Index of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V).\n5. One parent/guardian is able and willing to participate (i.e., available during therapy sessions, attend study assessments).\n6. Child is eligible to receive services at the participating clinic.\n7. Both parent and child can read and/or understand English and/or Spanish.\n8. Both parent and child reside in Texas or Pennsylvania.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.) The child has a diagnosis of psychotic disorder as determined by completion of a structured psychiatric diagnostic interview (the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview).\n\n  2.) The child has severe current suicidal/homicidal ideation and/or self-injury requiring medical intervention (referrals will be made for appropriate clinical intervention).\n\n  3.) The child is receiving concurrent psychotherapy for anxiety.\n\n  4.)
