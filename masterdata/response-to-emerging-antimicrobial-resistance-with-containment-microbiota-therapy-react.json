            "detailedDescription": "REACT is a phase two, open-label, cluster randomized, crossover study of microbiota therapy (MT) to reduce colonization with multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) in patients admitted to long-term care facilities. REACT is designed to test the safety and efficacy of instillation of donor intestinal microbiota.\n\nPatients admitted to long-term care facilities (e.g. long-term acute care hospitals and ventilator-capable skilled nursing facilities) found to be MDRO colonized during prevalence screening activities performed in the related APPS study.\n\nFacilities undergo prevalence sampling that involves participant peri-rectal, inguinal, and stool sampling to estimate the prevalence of targeted MDROs (CRE, ESBL, VRE, MDRP, C. difficile) under the accompanying APPS protocol. Patients who are positive with at least one targeted MDRO are eligible for an Emory manufactured MT product (via rectal enema or feeding tube), or observation followed by repeat sampling at Days 7, 14, 21, and 28. A repeat prevalence sample will then be conducted at all facilities. After a washout period, facilities then undergo another prevalence sample, crossover to the opposite assignment for recruiting patients (i.e. Observation -\\> MT or MT -\\> Observation) followed by another facility prevalence sample. Participants will be followed with collection of data on adverse events/safety/changes in medications at Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and followed up once a month for 6 months, after MT administration."

Are pregnant, breastfeeding, lactating, or planning a pregnancy during study duration (through 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product, or MT), if POCBP.\n2. Have known uncontrolled intercurrent illness(es):\n\n   1. Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n   2. Acute coronary syndrome\n   3. Cardiac arrhythmia\n   4. Untreated in-situ colorectal cancer\n   5. Toxic megacolon\n   6. Ileus\n   7. Positive stool studies without completion of treatment course (including ova and parasites, Salmonella spp, Shigella, Campylobacter, and other enteropathogens).\n   8. other acute illness that in the opinion of the investigator could affect the safety of the participant or make study data uninterpretable.\n3. Are on systemic antibiotics for any reason other than treatment of recent MDRO infection or clear anticipated need for antibiotics during the follow up period that cannot be rescheduled (e.g. fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for percutaneous nephrostomy tube exchange, prolonged antibiotic course for endocarditis). Participants must complete the planned antibiotic course by study Day -1.\n4. Have a compromised immune system, defined as:\n\n   1. AIDS with CD4+ T-cell count \\<200 and detectable HIV viral load on most recent assay.\n   2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\<1,000 neutrophils / mL on day of enrollment.\n   3. Active malignancy requiring intensive induction chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic treatment within 2 months prior to enrollment.\n   4. History of hematopoietic cell transplantation, either allogeneic or autologous in the last 1 year.\n5. Have a history of significant food allergy that led to anaphylaxis or hospitalization.\n6. Have a life expectancy of 24 weeks or less\n7. Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with study objectives or limit compliance with study requirements, including but not limited to:\n\n   1. Known active intravenous drug or alcohol abuse\n   2. Uncontrolled psychiatric illness\n   3. Social situations (e.g. incarceration)\n8.
