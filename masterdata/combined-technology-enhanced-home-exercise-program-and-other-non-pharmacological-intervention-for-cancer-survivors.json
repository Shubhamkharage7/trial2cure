            "briefSummary": "A 12 weeks technology enhanced home exercise (TEHE) program using mobile technologies that provide immediate feedback and send reminder messages to improve exercise motivation is developed. Investigators combine this TEHE program with techniques including auricular point pressure (APA) and brief mindfulness body scan (MBI). This study will examine the feasibility of the TEHE program and combined programs, and ascertain the effect of TEHE program alone, the combined programs on fatigue and biological markers among cancer survivors.\n\nMain Research Variable(s): The independent variables are the 12-week program of TEHE alone, APA alone, combined APA and TEHE (TEHEplus) and combined MBI and TEHE (TEHE-MBI). Outcome variables are fatigue, physical activity, contributing factors of fatigue and biomarkers.\n\nDesign: Repeated measures randomized controlled trial. Setting: Participants will be recruited through the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSample: Participants diagnosed with non-metastatic solid tumor cancer; who had completed all primary cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy )within at least 3 months OR non-metastatic prostate cancer completed all primary cancer treatment and have hormone therapy for at least 6 month, OR participants diagnosed with solid tumor cancer; who are receiving immunotherapy for at least 3 months before enrollment, aged 21 years or older, experiencing fatigue in the past 7 days on average of \u2265 3/10, able to participate in a moderate-intensity exercise training program, self-report ability to complete the 6 min walk test with a perceived exertion of 3 or below, and can communicate in English.\n\nMethods: Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the TEHE only, APA only or TEHEplus or TEHE-MBI or control group. All exercise groups (TEHE) will be offered a 12-week exercise program through an online communication. In additional to the TEHE, the TEHEplus group will receive an instruction on how to apply the pressure on the ear points through online meeting/communication. The TEHE-MBI group will perform 5 min mindfulness body scan daily. The control (usual care) group will report participant's fatigue level daily. At the end of week 12, participants will answer open-ended questions about participant's opinions on the programs. Fatigue will be assessed and blood will be drawn before and after the program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Home-based exercise interventions have a significant effect on fatigue; however, motivation and intervention compliance are the main challenges. The use of personalized exercise and immediate feedback though smartphome communication has been found to increase motivation. We developed a 12 weeks technology enhanced home exercise (TEHE) program using mobile technologies that provide immediate feedback and sends reminder messages to improve exercise motivation. Moreover, to enhance the effectiveness of exercise, we combine this TEHE program with techniques--auricular point pressure and brief mindfulness body scan--, which have been found to affect fatigue and physical activities. The Auricular Point Acupressure (APA) and Mindfulness Based Intervention (MBI) may enhance the effect of exercise on fatigue; however, the feasibility and effectiveness of this combination have not been tested. This study will examine the feasibility of the TEHEplus program and ascertain the effect of TEHE program alone, APA alone, the TEHEplus program and the TEHE-MBI program on fatigue among cancer survivors and cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. In addition we will explore peripheral and central markers (e.g., Phosphorous levels) of cancer-related fatigue using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This study will also investigate whether specific types of fatigue (e.g., physical fatigue, cognitive fatigue) will have different levels of these peripheral and central energy markers).\n\nConceptual Framework: The biopsychosocial model will be used. Main Research Variable(s): The independent variables are the 12-week program of TEHE alone, APA alone, combined APA and TEHE (TEHEplus) and combined MBI and TEHE (TEHE-MBI). Outcome variables are fatigue, physical activity, contributing factors of fatigue (depressive symptom, anxiety, sleep, relationship with others), and biomarkers.\n\nDesign: Repeated measures randomized controlled trial design. Setting: Participants will be recruited through the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSample: Participants diagnosed with non-metastatic solid tumor cancer; who had completed all primary cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy )within at least 3 months OR non-metastatic prostate cancer completed all primary cancer treatment and have hormone therapy for at least 6 month, OR participants diagnosed with solid tumor cancer; who are receiving immunotherapy for at least 3 months before enrollment, aged 21 years or older, experiencing fatigue in the past 7 days on average of \u2265 3/10, able to participate in a moderate-intensity exercise training program, self-report ability to complete the 6 min walk test with a perceived exertion of 3 or below, and can communicate in English.\n\nMethods: Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the TEHE only, APA only, TEHEplus or TEHE-MBI or control (usual care) group. All exercise groups will be offered a 12-week exercise program. The program will based on personal exercise preference and physical activity goals to reach moderate intensity based on readings from a heart rate monitor and exertion level. Activity/steps will be monitored daily using the FitBit Charge. Reminders to exercise will be sent to the patient through a mobile phone application based on the participants' personal schedule and frequency. In additional to the TEHE, the APA only, and the TEHEplus group will receive an instruction on how to apply the pressure on the ear points through the online meeting and mobile application. The TEHE-MBI group will perform 5 min of mindfulness body daily. The control (usual care) group will report their fatigue level daily and attend weekly meetings with the researcher to discuss fatigue. At the end of week 12, in addition to the questionnaires, participants will answer open-ended questions about their opinions on the program. Fatigue will be assessed and blood will be drawn before and after the program. Participants who enrolled in the sub-study will be scheduled for a visit for an MRS before the exercise intervention.\n\n2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)\n\nPurpose/Specific Aims:\n\nThe study primary aims are to (1) test the feasibility of a 12-week technology-enhanced home exercise (TEHE) program and combined technology-enhanced home exercise and Auricular Point Acupressure (TEHE plus) program among cancer survivors; (2) to determine the effect of the TEHE plus program on fatigue, physical activity and serum biomarkers (Heat Shock Protein 90 and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) compared to the control (usual care) group.\n\nThe secondary aims are to (3) compare the effect of the TEHE only, TEHE plus, APA only, combined MBI and TEHE on fatigue and physical activity; and (4) determine the change in serum biomarkers at week 12 compared to baseline in the TEHE only, TEHE plus, APA only, MBI+TEHE, and control (usual care) groups (5) explore the associations of muscle and brain energetic markers using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with fatigue symptoms of cancer survivors."
