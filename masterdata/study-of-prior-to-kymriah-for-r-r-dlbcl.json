CD25 is expressed at high levels on Tregs but also on activated effector T cells. The use of the CAR-T cell product and associated apheresis and LD chemotherapy is considered standard of care (SOC)."

Up to 3 dose levels will be tested. The MTD is determined by using the continual reassessment method (CRM). Enrollment begins with Dose Level 1 using a cohort of two patients. Twenty one (21) days after the 2nd patient's tisagenlecleucel infusion the next cohort of 2 patients are assigned to the most appropriate strategy based on updated toxicity probabilities corresponding to the desired maximum toxicity rate of \u2264 25% as determined by the study statistician (or designee). Enrollment continues in cohorts of 2 separated by a minimum of 28 days until 20 patients are enrolled or 10 sequential patients are enrolled at the same dose level.
