            "briefSummary": "The aim of this pilot study is to determine the effects of a 12-week indoor rock climbing training program on heart health, mental health, and behavioral health in generally healthy adults aged 18-35 years old who do not exercise. Participants will learn to rock climb using ropes on an indoor rock climbing wall and participate in the training program 2-3 days per week for 60 minutes each session over 12 weeks. Health outcomes will be measured at 4 time points over the course of the study (pre-intervention, 6-weeks/mid-intervention, 12-weeks/post-intervention, and 24-weeks post-intervention).",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a 12-week progressive, supervised indoor rock climbing intervention on physical, mental, and behavioral health outcomes in physically inactive adults. This will be a pilot study used for informing a larger, randomized controlled trial. Measurements include: cardiometabolic disease risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipids, hemoglobin a1c), health-related components of physical fitness (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness, dynamic balance, body composition), health-related quality of life, and behavior change variables (e.g., attitudes toward physical activity, self-efficacy for exercise, objective physical activity and sedentary behavior). The majority of rock climbing-related studies focus on enhancing performance in high-level climbing athletes and very little research has examined the specific impact of climbing physical activity on cardiovascular health parameters. Indoor climbing has demonstrated to be an activity that is safe for many individuals and does not require a high level initial fitness to partake in the activity. This study will engage generally healthy, physically inactive adults (aged 18-35 y) in an indoor rock climbing program 2 times per week for 60 minutes for the first 4 weeks and progressing to 3 times per week for 60 minutes for the last 8 weeks. Participants will partake in top-rope style rock climbing and bouldering. Data collection will occur over three visits to the School of Health and Human Performance Research Lab at four time points throughout the course of the study (baseline/pre-intervention, 6-weeks/mid-intervention, 12-weeks/post-intervention, 24-weeks post-intervention; total of 12 data collection visits)."
