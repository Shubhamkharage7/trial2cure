            "briefSummary": "If transplantation using mismatched unrelated donors or non-first-degree relatives could be performed with an acceptable toxicity profile, an important unmet need would be served. Towards this goal, the current study extends our platform of nonmyeloablative, partially HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplant (BMT) and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT) to the use of such donors, investigating up to several postgrafting immunosuppression regimens that incorporate high-dose Cy. Of central interest is the incorporation of sirolimus into this postgrafting immunosuppression regimen.\n\nThe primary goal for phase 1 is to identify a transplant regimen associated with acceptable rates of severe acute GVHD and NRM by Day 100 and for phase 2 estimate the 6-month probability of survival without having had acute grade III- IV GVHD or graft failure."

Any previous BMT must have occurred at least 3 months prior to start of conditioning.\n8. Adequate end-organ function as measured by:\n\n   1.

The donor and recipient must be identical at at least 5 HLA alleles based on high resolution typing of HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DRB1, and -DQB1, with at least one allele matched for a HLA class I gene (HLA-A, -B, or -Cw) and at least one allele matched for a class II gene (HLA-DRB1 or -DQB1).\n3. Meets institutional selection criteria and medically fit to donate. 4 . Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody. Note: In some instances, low level, non-cytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a level well below that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the PI and one of the immunogenetics directors. Pheresis to reduce anti-HLA antibodies is permissible; however eligibility to proceed with the transplant regimen would be contingent upon the result.\n\nDonor Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Donor must not be HLA identical to the recipient.\n* Has not donated blood products to recipient.",
