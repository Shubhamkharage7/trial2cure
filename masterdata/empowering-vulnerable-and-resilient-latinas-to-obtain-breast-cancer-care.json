Within 1 week of enrollment, all Latina Aim 1 participants in both study arms will engage in three 30-minute, individual, phone-based sessions with the study team across 3 consecutive weeks. Sessions will be based on landline or cellphone calls. Within 1 week after each session, all Latina Aim 1 participants will receive copies of the multi-media materials (e.g., personalized plans) by text message or mail, depending on participants' preferences\n\nControl Sessions will be as follows:\n\nSession 1 Learning about Breast Cancer (BC) care uptake Targets the effects of Social Determinants of Heath (SDH) and genetic risk factors on Non-Latino White (NLW) Latino BC disparities Study staff will give personnel testimonials, empirical data and individual action plans behavior change and BC care uptake Session 2 Learning about Diet to promote BC prevention per the American Cancer Society (ACS) BC screening and prevention guidelines Session 3 Learning about Physical Activity to promote BC prevention\n\nEmpowerment and Navigation Sessions will be as follows:\n\nSession 1 Learning about Breast Cancer (BC) care uptake Targets the effects of SDH and genetic risk factors on NLW/Latino BC disparities ACS BC screening and prevention guidelines Identify and address SDH and genetic risk factors Study staff will give personnel testimonials, empirical data and individual action plans for behavior change Session 2 Teaching about BC Targets the importance of sharing BC information and personal barriers \\& preferred solutions to sharing BC information Study staff will give personnel testimonials and individual action plans for sharing information and role playing activities Session 3 Teaching about BC Targets opportunities \\& skills in sharing BC information participants will give testimonials and relay empirical data. There will be a group discussion and plans for sharing information\n\nThere will be a post intervention BC survey call and an end of study BC survey call\n\nBicultural, bilingual study staff will engage participants in a 5-10 minute call/text every month to \"check in\" until the end of the study"
