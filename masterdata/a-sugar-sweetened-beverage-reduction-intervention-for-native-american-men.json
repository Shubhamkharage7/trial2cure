Sugary drinks are drinks like pop, soda, and juice. Increased sugar consumption may lead to an increased risk of chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, some types of obesity-related cancers, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and dental decay. A culturally sensitive program may help reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption in Native American men",

Conduct and analyze qualitative data from focus groups and key informant interviews with Native American community members including Native American leaders and community members to develop Sugar Sweetened Beverage (SSB) intervention for Native American men (SIPsmartER Lacrosse).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nAIM 1: Participants complete interviews over 60 minutes and attend focus groups over 90 minutes in support of intervention adaptation and refinement.\n\nAIM 2: Participants receive the Indigenous SIPin intervention over 6 months, which includes in-person and/or virtual educational sessions weekly over 30 minutes for 12 weeks and text message communications twice a week (BIW) for 12 weeks and then monthly thereafter up to month 6."
