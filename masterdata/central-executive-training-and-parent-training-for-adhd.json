CET is a computerized training intervention that improves ADHD symptoms and academic functioning by improving children's working memory abilities. BPT is a therapeutic intervention that improves family functioning and child oppositional-defiant (ODD) symptoms by changing parenting behaviors. Their combined use is expected to provide complementary and additive benefits, particularly if CET is delivered before BPT."
