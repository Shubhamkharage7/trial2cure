            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to find substances in the blood and urine that indicate that a person has kidney damage. It will identify proteins found only in patients with acute kidney failure but not in normal healthy people or in patients with volume depletion.\n\nAdults and children who are at least 3 years old who fall into one of the following four categories may be eligible for this study:\n\n1. Are healthy and have normal kidney function\n2. Have volume depletion (this condition differs from acute kidney failure in that it is easily treated with fluids)\n3. Are at high risk of kidney failure\n4. Have acute kidney failure (kidney shutdown)\n\nAll study participants will have a history and physical examination. Up to four blood samples of 3 tablespoons each will be taken for laboratory analysis. Urine will be collected for analysis and to measure urine output. The participants length of stay in the study varies. People with normal kidney function will be in the study for 1 day and patients with volume depletion will be studied 3 days. The length of hospitalization of patients at high risk of kidney failure or in acute kidney failure will depend on the patient s condition and medication requirements.\n\nThe results of this study may lead to the development of earlier and more accurate methods for diagnosing acute kidney failure. With earlier detection, treatment could be started earlier, possibly preventing further damage and helping recovery of injury that has already occurred.",
            "detailedDescription": "The mortality of acute renal failure (ARF) remains high despite advances in supportive care. There are no established effective drug therapies, and dialysis may promote renal injury via hypotension or neutrophil activation. Many agents \\[e.g., mannitol, furosemide, dopamine, Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1), thyroid hormone, etc.\\] are effective in animal models but ineffective in treating or preventing human ARF. The failure of these agents in human ARF may be due to late enrollment into the trial; effective therapy will likely require earlier detection.\n\nThe objective of this clinical study is to identify new biomarkers of renal injury, progression or recovery by analyzing urinary proteins during ARF. We will enroll patients with ARF, patients at high risk of ARF, patients with volume depletion, patients with urinary tract infection, patients with chronic kidney disease, and normal subjects. The diagnosis of pre-renal versus renal ARF will be made by routine clinical and laboratory testing. The level of renal dysfunction will be determined by creatinine clearance. Those patients at high risk for ARF will be followed prospectively and will undergo additional testing if ARF does develop. Patients will also be studied after creatinine levels return to normal. We will identify protein and/or microRNA biomarkers that are unique to patients with ARF,but not found in normal subjects or patients with volume depletion. It is hoped that some of these proteins may form the basis of new diagnostic tests for ARF."
