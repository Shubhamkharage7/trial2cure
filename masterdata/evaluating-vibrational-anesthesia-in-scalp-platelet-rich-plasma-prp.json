The investigators will randomize half of the scalp of each patient: one half will receive vibrational anesthesia (VA) via a device and the other half will not. Approximately 100 unique patients will be recruited (there will only be one study group). During the standard of care platelet rich plasma (PRP) procedure, a REDCap survey questionnaire will be provided asking the patients to rate their pain with the visual analogue scale (VAS). A simple paired t-test will be used to test significant improvement in pain scores between the two halves of the scalp."
