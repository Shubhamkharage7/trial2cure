Capecitabine is not counted as a prior chemotherapy regimen in these patients.\n\nInclusion Criteria for Phase II:\n\n* Progressive bone metastasis per the most recent tumor imaging studies by RECIST 1.1 or clinical progression (such as worsening bone pain, elevation of tumor marker) per treating physician.\n\nExclusion Criteria for both Phase Ib and Phase II:\n\n* Patients may not have received the following investigational or SOC therapies within the below specified time frames prior to C1D1:\n\n  * Radiation therapy within 1 week\n  * Systemic chemotherapy, including antibody drug conjugates with chemotherapy payload, within 3 weeks.\n  * Immunotherapy within 3 weeks\n  * Oral chemotherapy or molecularly targeted therapy within 5 half-lives of the agent.\n  * Endocrine therapies do not have a required washout and may be continued until C1D1.\n  * Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including grapefruit), strong CYP3A inducers, and drugs with QT prolonging potential within 5 half-lives of the agent.\n* Untreated brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they show no evidence of progression and are off steroids.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to zunsemetinib or other agents used in the study.\n* History of acute, untreated skeletal related events (SRE) or active untreated SRE or a change or an anticipated change in the SOC anti-resorptive agents after entering the study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of C1D1.\n* Patients with HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are \\< 350 cells/mcL or they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to DHHS treatment guidelines is recommended.\n* Screening resting QTcF above 460 msec.\n* History of other malignancy, unless all treatment was completed and patient had no evidence of disease within 2 years of C1D1 for phase II only.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Phase Ib:\n\n* Capecitabine within 2 weeks prior to C1D1. Patients may be currently taking capecitabine, but must not have dosed within 2 weeks prior to C1D1 for study correlative purposes.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Phase II:\n\n* Prior capecitabine in the metastatic setting.\n* History of other malignancy, unless all treatment was completed and patient had no evidence of disease within 2 years of C1D1.",
