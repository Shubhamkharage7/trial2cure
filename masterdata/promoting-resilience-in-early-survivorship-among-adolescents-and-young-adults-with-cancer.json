            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to find the best way to help participants and families manage the stress of facing a serious illness and be better able to \"bounce back\" or be resilient after a difficult situation. Participants will take part in the \"Promoting Resilience in Stress Management\" PRISM program, which is designed to provide skills to change or improve the impact of stress in everyday life.\n\nThe name of the intervention used in this research study is:\n\n-PRISM (a mobile app program comprised of 6 sessions of skills-based, manualized resilience education)",
            "detailedDescription": "In this sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial participants will be randomly selected to participate in PRISM program sessions with a trained research coach either by text or by video sessions, or participants will use the PRISM mobile app program in a self-guided way. Randomization means the group participants are placed in will be decided by chance. All groups will continue to receive all the same care from primary medical, social work, and other care teams.\n\nIn this two-stage study, participants will be randomly assigned to either the \"app-only\" (20% chance), \"text\" (40% chance) or \"video\" (40% chance) groups for the first stage. In the second stage, participants may be re-randomized again to the \"app-only,\" or \"text,\" groups, or will be referred to a specialty psychosocial support, social worker or counselor, based on responses to questionnaires. Participants randomized to the \"app-only\" group in the first stage will not be re-randomized.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and completion of questionnaires.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for up to 6 months.\n\nIt is expected about 325 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe National Institute for Health (NIH) is funding this research study."
