This study will investigate the effects of ANAVEX3-71 in patients with Schizophrenia for the first time. This is an in-patient study. In both parts, participants will undergo either 10 or 28 days of dosing (Part A and Part B, respectively). Standard clinical outcome measures used in the clinic and novel fluid and electrophysiological biomarkers will also be assessed."
