            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, interventional cohort study with an embedded Phase II randomized controlled clinical trial with a parallel design.\n\n* The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, consent, enrolled, randomization into 1 of 4 groups.\n* The study interventions including the (web-based portal ) YES portal use including regular assessments, serial outcome surveys, medical record review, and tumor/blood collection.\n* The YES portal is a web-based portal designed for access by smartphone, tablet, or laptop/desktop. The portal is designed to help monitor cancer related issues and to share self-management information and resources to those interested in particular issues or who score high enough on the symptom measures designed to assess and track noticeable symptoms (and thus might benefit from such), as well as to share potential research opportunities when available. The portal is also designed to create a community among participants through the yeschat.org discussion board\n* Participants will be in this research study for up to 5 years with the option to opt out of portal assessment component follow-up after only 1 year.\n* It is expected that about 400 people will take part in this research study"
