Patients will have received previous standard of care treatment including chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Patients will be treated with the standard subcutaneous dosing of daratumumab (weekly for 8 administrations, then every 2 weeks for 8 administrations then every 4 weeks until progression). All follow-up visits and imaging will be performed as per standard of care. This is a signal finding study and an overall response rate \u226520% is considered clinically meaningful."
