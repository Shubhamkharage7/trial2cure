Unfortunately, many patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation. Some find it challenging to attend the in-person sessions. This study aims to compare two methods of delivering cardiac rehabilitation: in-person and through telehealth. The investigators want to know if the effects of these two programs are alike and if certain individuals benefit more from one program over the other."
