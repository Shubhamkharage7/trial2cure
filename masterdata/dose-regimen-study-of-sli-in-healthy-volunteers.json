All excisions will be randomized to treatment with vehicle or 4 doses of SLI-F06 drug product. Patients will be divided into 3 cohorts, with Cohort B receiving the same doses as Cohort A but daily for a total of 5 days. Cohort C will receive up to twice the concentration of Cohort A potentially divided into 2 doses, with both cohorts treated only on treatment Day 0. Scars will be assessed for improvement by both the investigator and the patient at follow-up visits over 6-9 months.\n\nDuration of study-approximately 7-10 months."
