However, there are few studies looking at the variability of measurements between the left and right arm, and none looking at this effect in diabetic patients. This study may identify if glucose differences exist in the left and right arm in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. Furthermore, it may point to future directions for research to standardize methods of glucose measurement such as consistently measuring on only one side of the body.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the time-matched difference in glucose levels between the left arm and right arm in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The main objective aims to answer:\n\n\u2022 Is there a difference in time-matched controlled glucose monitoring (CGM) - derived blood glucose between left and right arm in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in target range (\\<70 mg/dL; 70-180 mg/dL; \\>180 mg/dL)?\n\nParticipants will wear two Freestyle Libre 3 sensors, 1 on the left and 1 on the right arm, continuously for 2 weeks. Participants will need to download the Freestyle Libre 3 app on two separate mobile devices and connect the sensors with Freestyle Libre View accounts provided by the study team. The study team will collect and compare the data between the left and right arm for further analysis."
