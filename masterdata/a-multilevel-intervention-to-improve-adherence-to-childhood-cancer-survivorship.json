            "briefSummary": "More than 80% of childhood cancer survivors develop serious or life-threatening late effects after cancer therapy, but \\<20% receive recommended survivorship care offered at cancer center survivorship clinics. In a shared care model, the investigators propose to investigate an innovative multi-level intervention consisting of: 1) patient survivorship education via telehealth with the cancer center, 2) ongoing patient-tailored education program within the electronic health record patient portal, 3) a structured interactive phone communication between the cancer center and the primary care clinic, and 4) an in-person visit with the primary care clinic for survivorship care with the goal of achieving high rates of adherence to recommended surveillance for late effects, as well as improving patient and physician knowledge and self-efficacy. If this scalable intervention demonstrates patient completion of recommended care comparable to cancer center survivorship clinics, this innovative study has the enormous potential to deliver recommended care to a larger proportion of childhood cancer survivors and reduce survivorship care disparities, while engaging p to integrate survivorship care as part of overall, lifelong health maintenance.",
            "detailedDescription": "More than 80% of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) develop serious or life-threatening late effects. Yet \\<20% of CCS receive recommended survivorship care, despite the availability of consensus guidelines for lifelong surveillance for late effects starting 2 years post-therapy. The \"gold standard\" cancer center-based survivorship clinic provides high-quality care to CCS who attend, but patients avoid reminders of their past cancer and lack knowledge and self-efficacy for survivorship care. Other barriers include travel distance, inadequate insurance, and out-of-pocket costs-these structural issues contribute to health disparities. Partnering with community primary care provider (PCP) clinics in a shared model of care is a promising strategy to overcome these barriers, but PCPs lack knowledge, self-efficacy, and interactive communication with the cancer center and are confused about the division of care responsibilities. This intervention is scalable and distance-based, is informed directly by patient and PCP barriers and preferences from previous studies, and is boosted by a nationwide explosion in telehealth services precipitated by the COVID-19 crisis. The proposed randomized controlled trial will enroll 240 CCS 2.0-4.0 years post-chemotherapy/radiation to investigate an innovative multi-level intervention (i.e., interpersonal and organizational levels) consisting of 1) patient survivorship education via telehealth with the cancer center, 2) ongoing patient-tailored education program within the electronic health record (EHR)'s patient portal, 3) a structured interactive phone communication between the cancer center and the PCP clinic (with 1-year follow-up call), and 4) an in-person visit with the PCP clinic for survivorship care. The comparison group will be randomized to an in-person visit with their cancer center survivorship clinic. This study includes 4 centers with high proportions of subgroups vulnerable to survivorship care disparities (i.e., rural, Black, Latinx, Spanish-speaking, socioeconomically disadvantaged). Both groups will be asked to begin recommended surveillance for late effects within 1-year post-randomization, separate from tumor recurrence monitoring by the primary oncologist. The Specific Aims are to Aim 1- Demonstrate patient completion of guideline-recommended surveillance tests in intervention participants is not inferior, i.e. within 10%, to that in the comparison group; Aim 2- Achieve greater 1) patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and activation and 2) PCP knowledge and self-efficacy with survivorship care among intervention participants and their PCPs compared to the comparison group; and Aim 3- Ascertain process outcomes for the 1) patient and 2) PCP clinic. Outcomes will also be assessed among subgroups with survivorship care disparities. Transformative Impact: If the intervention demonstrates patient completion of recommended survivorship care comparable to cancer center survivorship clinic, the study has the enormous potential to deliver recommended lifelong care to a larger proportion of CCS and reduce survivorship care ies, while engaging patients and PCPs to integrate survivorship care as part of overall, lifelong health maintenance."
