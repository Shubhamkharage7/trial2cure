Participant does not have an adequate myofascial flap to allow for circumferential contact with the implanted device.\n9. Participant has evidence of or history of severe peripheral vascular disease or insufficiency, muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease, or diabetes mellitus (Type I or Type II).\n10. Participant has evidence of or a documented history of osteomyelitis (excluding the history of osteomyelitis distal to amputation), systemic osteoporosis, or osteomalacia.\n11. Participants with identified risk factors for osteoporosis must have a reported T-score \\> -2.5 within 6 months prior to Study Day 1.\n12.
