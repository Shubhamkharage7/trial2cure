            "briefSummary": "This is a three-phase study comprising both retrospective and prospective components, as follows:\n\nPhase I: Deployment of Rare Disease Algorithm:\n\nA diagnostic screening algorithm was developed using advanced analytical methods to identify patients who have an increased likelihood of having Gaucher disease. This tool will be applied to a health system's electronic health records (EHR).\n\nThe top 50 active patients per healthcare system will be identified as \"highly ranked by the RDA\" and moved to Phase II. As three to four healthcare systems are expected to participate in this study, between 150 to 200 persons are expected to be identified and included in Phase II.\n\nPhase II: Retrospective review of medical records of highly ranked persons: The listing of persons highly-ranked by the RDA from phase I will be forwarded to the study team within each participating healthcare system. After reviewing the RDA reports and medical records of each highly ranked person, study site personnel will determine eligibility for Phase III based on the relevant selection criteria listed in the section below.\n\nPhase III: Prospective diagnostic testing: Eligible persons (or their parent/guardian) from Phase II will be contacted and asked to provide consent for inclusion into the study. After consent is received, blood samples will be collected and sent for Gaucher diagnostic testing. Because of overlap in clinical symptoms between Gaucher disease and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), patients will also receive diagnostic testing for ASMD. Results will be shared with study site personnel, who will subsequently inform the study subject (and/or their parent/guardian, where appropriate) of results. It is anticipated that participation of a typical subject will be less than 3 months."
