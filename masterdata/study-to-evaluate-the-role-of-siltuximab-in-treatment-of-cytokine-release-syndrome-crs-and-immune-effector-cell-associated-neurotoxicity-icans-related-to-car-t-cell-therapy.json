            "detailedDescription": "Patients eligible to receive CAR T-cell therapy for FDA-approved indications in hematological malignancies will be enrolled in this study on the day of CAR T-cell infusion. Patients will be followed until they develop grade 1 or higher CRS and/or ICANS. On developing these syndromes, siltuximab will be administered with close monitoring and follow-up for resolution of symptoms. If symptoms continue to worsen, then an additional dose of siltuximab will be given. If the symptoms leading to CRS do not resolve, then rescue tocilizumab will be administered. The study's primary endpoint is to assess the response rate of siltuximab in the resolution of CRS within 14 days. The study's secondary endpoint is to assess the response rate of siltuximab in the resolution of ICANS, the safety of siltuximab, and the overall response rate of CAR T-cell therapy."
