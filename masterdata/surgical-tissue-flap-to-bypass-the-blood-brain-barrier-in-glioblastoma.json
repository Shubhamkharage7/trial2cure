            "briefSummary": "This single center, single arm, open-label, phase 2 study will assess the safety and efficacy of a pedicled temporoparietal fascial (TPF) or pericranial flap into the resection cavity of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multifome (GBM) patients.\n\nThe objective of the Phase 2 study is to demonstrate that this surgical technique is safe and effective in a human cohort of patients with resected newly diagnosed AA or GBM and may improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).",
            "detailedDescription": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary central nervous system malignancy in adults, and accounts for over half of all malignant brain tumors. The prognosis for newly diagnosed GBM is extremely poor even with Stupp protocol consisting of surgery followed by temozolomide and radiotherapy. For newly diagnosed GBM the median overall survival (OS) is only 15 months, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) is a mere 5-6 months with only 53.9% of patients having 6 month PFS.\n\nThis Phase 2 study is an extension of our recently completely enrolled Phase I trial which showed the initial safety of a TPF into the resection cavity of newly diagnosed GBM. All 36 subjects included in this Phase 2 study will initially undergo standard surgical resection for newly diagnosed GBM. Following the resection, the surgical cavity will be lined with a long pedicled, autologous piece of tissue called a temporoparietal fascial flap or pericranium. The patient's dura, bone and scalp will be closed as is customary. The subject will be followed for side effects at 72 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 120 days and 180 days. The primary outcome measure will be progression free survival (PFS) and secondary outcome measures will include overall survival (OS). Risk assessment will include seizure, stroke, infection, tumor progression, and death."
