Requirements for contraception and pregnancy testing for a clinical trial should encompass all investigational medicinal products (IMPs) as well as protocol-mandated non-investigational medicinal products (NIMPs) such as background therapy, and the measures to be followed should be based on the medicinal product with the highest risk (see the protocol synopsis for definition of IMP and NIMP). Contraception requirements for marketed Roche IMPs or NIMPs should be based on recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics or, if there is no Summary of Product Characteristics, national prescribing information. Length of time required for abstinence or use of contraceptives should take into account the reproductive toxicity profile, including genotoxicity and teratogenicity, the size of the molecule, and the number of doses. In the absence of specific delayed-toxicity concerns or safety hypotheses, the following guidelines should be used:\n\nOptions for female contraception are based on the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group \"Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials.\" Three options for female contraception are shown below.\n\n\u2022 For women of childbearing potential: agrees to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or to use contraceptive methods, and agrees to refrain from donating eggs, as defined below:\n\n* Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of atezolizumab/pemigatinib/bevacizumab. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n* A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\u2265 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n* Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n* The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.\n\nPeriodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. Options for contraception in male patients with pregnant female partners and/or with female partners of childbearing potential are based on the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group \"Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials\" and the Roche White Paper regarding contraception for males in clinical trials.\n\nAtezolizumab does not require male contraception or condom use; guidelines below apply to other protocol-mandated study treatments.\n\n\u2022 For men: agrees to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agrees to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n* With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of atezolizumab/pemigatinib/bevacizumab to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n* The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.\n\nPeriodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of preventing drug exposure.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Received prior chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agent within 3 weeks prior to initiation of study medications.\n* Had previous treatment with selective FGFR inhibitors including erdafitinib, infigratinib, or futibatinib.\n* Had prior therapy with any VEGFR-targeting agent targeting including bevacizumab, ramucirumab, pazopanib, lenvatinib, and other anti-angiogenesis inhibitors.\n* Has a history and/or has current evidence of extensive tissue calcification including, but not limited to, the soft tissue, kidneys, intestine, myocardium, vascular system, and lung. Exceptions include calcified lymph nodes, minor pulmonary parenchymal calcifications, and asymptomatic coronary calcifications-these are allowed.\n* Has corneal or retinal disorder/keratopathy with current evidence of corneal or retinal disorder/keratopathy including, but not limited to, bullous/band keratopathy, inflammation, or ulceration, keratoconjunctivitis, or diabetic retinopathy, confirmed by ophthalmic physician. Participants with asymptomatic ophthalmic conditions assessed by the investigator to pose minimal risk for study participation may be enrolled in the study.\n* Are currently receiving or are planning to receive during participation in this study, treatment with any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers or moderate CYP3A4 inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study drug. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not prohibited but should be avoided. Medications that increase serum phosphorus and/or calcium concentration are prohibited. Medications associated with hyperphosphatemia and/or hypercalcemia adverse events are searchable in the Leximcomp Online Pharmacy \\& Formulary available on the Inside MD Anderson Clinical Tools SharePoint site. Participants are not permitted to receive enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs, including carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone.\n* Have consumed grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruit hybrids, pomegranates, star fruits, pomelos, Seville oranges or products containing juice of these fruits within 7 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n* Had a Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal bleed within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n* Has a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or any other thromboembolism, including portal venous thrombosis within 3 months prior to enrollment. Venous port or catheter thrombosis, incidental asymptomatic pulmonary embolism diagnosed on imaging studies, or superficial venous thrombosis are not considered significant and are allowed.\n* Has current or recent (within 10 days prior to study treatment start) use of full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulants (including direct oral anticoagulants); thrombolytic agents for therapeutic (as opposed to prophylactic) purpose; use of aspirin (\\> 325 mg/day); or use of clopidogrel (\\> 75 mg/day). Prophylactic anticoagulation for the patency of venous access devices is allowed provided the activity of the agent results in an INR \\<1.5 \u00d7 ULN and an aPTT within normal limits within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* Had significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class II or greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident); unstable arrhythmia; or unstable angina significant cardiovascular disease within 6 months prior to enrollment.\n* Has a history of uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (\\>150 mmHg systolic or \\>100 mmHg diastolic).\n* Has a history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.\n* Had a serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Has undergone major surgery (including open biopsy, surgical resection, wound revision; or any other major surgery involving entry into a body cavity); or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to enrollment; or subcutaneous venous-access-device placement within 7 days prior to enrollment; or anticipates need for major surgical procedure, core biopsy, or other minor surgical procedures during the course of the study.\n\n  o Note: Placement of a vascular access device should be at least 2 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* Is receiving chronic antiplatelet therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), dipyridamole, clopidogrel, or similar agents.
