            "briefSummary": "This study is open to adults with advanced cancer in the stomach and oesophagus. This is a study for people for whom previous treatment was not successful or no treatment exists. In this study, BI 3706674 is given to humans for the first time.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find a suitable dose of BI 3706674 that people with advanced cancer can tolerate when taken alone. Another purpose is to check whether BI 3706674 can make tumours shrink. BI 3706674 blocks growth signals and may prevent the tumour from growing.\n\nParticipants take BI 3706674 as a tablet when starting treatment. Different doses of BI 3706674 are tested during this study. If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given up to the maximum duration of the study. During this time, participants visit the study site regularly. The total number of visits depends on how they respond to and tolerate the treatment. Doctors record any unwanted effects and regularly check the general health of the participants."

KRAS status will be confirmed retrospectively for those with a known KRAS status or determined prospectively (dose confirmation and expansion) if KRAS status is unknown, using archival tissue (if available) or a fresh biopsy.\n\n   Dose escalation (Part A) only: Patients with advanced or metastatic relapsed or refractory solid tumours of any histology with KRAS wt amplification or harbouring a KRAS G12V mutation who have exhausted treatment options known to prolong survival for their disease. Detection of KRAS status by a local test is allowed for enrolment but will be retrospectively confirmed.\n2. Patients who have failed conventional treatment or for whom no therapy of proven efficacy exists or who are not eligible for established treatment options.\n3. Dose confirmation (Part B) only: Patient is willing and able to undergo mandatory pre- and on-treatment low risk tumour biopsies. Patients with a high risk for biopsy complications can be included without undergoing pre- and on-treatment tumour biopsy as long as archival tumour tissue is available for confirmation of KRAS status.\n4. At least one target lesion that can be measured per RECIST version 1.1 (radiated lesions do not qualify as target lesions unless there has been demonstrated progression of the lesion after completion of radiotherapy) Dose escalation (Part A) only: Patients with no lesions measurable per RECIST version 1.1 may be included if agreed between Sponsor and investigator.\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n6. All toxicities related to previous anti-cancer therapies have resolved \u2264 CTCAE Grade 1 prior to trial treatment administration (except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy which must be \u2264 CTCAE Grade 2 and amenorrhea/menstrual disorders which can be any grade).\n7. Life expectancy \u22653 months at the start of treatment in the opinion of the investigator.\n8. Age \u226518 years of age, or over the legal age of consent as required by local legislation.\n\nFurther inclusion criteria apply.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Previous anti-cancer chemotherapy within 3 weeks of the first administration of trial drug.\n2. Previous anti-cancer hormonal treatment or anti-cancer immunotherapy within 2 weeks of the first administration of trial drug.\n3. Previous treatment with rat sarcoma (RAS), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) targeting agents.\n4. Presence of cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 and/or diastolic blood pressure \u226590 millimetre of mercury (mmHg)), congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of \u2265 III or IV, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia. History of myocardial infarction, stroke, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to randomisation.\n5. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\<50%.\n6.

Radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to start of treatment, except as follows:\n\n   * Palliative radiotherapy to regions other than the chest is allowed if completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomisation.\n   * Single dose palliative radiotherapy for symptomatic metastasis within 2 weeks prior to randomisation may be allowed but must be discussed with the Sponsor.\n\nFurther exclusion criteria apply.",
