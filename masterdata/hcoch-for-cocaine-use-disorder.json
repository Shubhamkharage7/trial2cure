This gene regulates an enzyme (cocaine hydrolase) that breaks down cocaine into inactive substances, thereby decreasing the pleasurable feeling this drug usually provides.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase-I dose escalation clinical trial testing the safety and MTD of IV administration of AAV8-hCocH to subjects with a history of cocaine use disorder-sustained remission. Subjects who provide written informed consent, meet entry criteria, and do not have transduction inhibition to AAV8 (pre-existing AAV8 antibodies) will be eligible. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially every 2-3 months or longer between cohorts. Dose escalation may be initiated after a single subject has been safely dosed; maximum enzyme expression is anticipated at week 3-4. This escalation paradigm is intended to minimize the number of subjects exposed to sub-therapeutic doses. The starting dose is based on the expression and safety of AAV8-CocH in mice, rats and NHP, and previous human experience using AAV8-FVIII IV in hemophilia patients. The starting dose has a large safety margin (15-fold) from the NOAEL in NHP. Approximately 7 weeks after an injection, a decision to escalate to the next dose level will be made based on a review of safety parameters and CocH levels by the investigative team."
