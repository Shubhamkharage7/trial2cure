The current proposal will test the acceptability, initial efficacy, and mechanisms underlying a novel digital therapeutic targeting risk for PTSD-CUD, which could address the critical need for PTSD-CUD prevention for the 100,000 women who annually present for emergency care after sexual assault. In this research context, the applicant will receive key training in multisite, emergency-care based randomized clinical trials (RCTs), advanced statistical analyses for RCTs and ecological momentary assessment data, biobehavioral mechanisms underlying PTSD-CUD prevention, and professional development, launching her independent research career focused on reducing the public health burden of PTSD-CUD among sexual assault survivors by leveraging digital therapeutics."
