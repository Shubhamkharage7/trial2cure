The proposed study adapts the PRE-ACT model to racial and ethnic minority patients who were underrepresented in the original PRE-ACT study and will be combined with a patient navigator model.",

This model has been previously studied in a primarily white, well-educated population. It is unknown how well this model adapts to meet the needs of diverse patient populations."
