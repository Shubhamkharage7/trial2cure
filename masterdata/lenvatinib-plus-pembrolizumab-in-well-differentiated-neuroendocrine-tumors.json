            "briefSummary": "This is the first study to be done in a newly described class of neuroendocrine tumors known as well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors (WD G3 NET). First described in the pancreas in 2017, the classification was broadened to include gastrointestinal tract tumors in 2019. Recent data suggest an equivalent subtype exists in the lungs (NEC with carcinoid morphology). WD G3 NETs can occur de novo as well as the result of grade progression over time. This is a single arm, multi-site, Phase II study in biomarker \"unselected\" participants. This study will also incorporate serial blood samples, tumor biopsies, and special imaging to better understand the impact of therapy on the tumor and microenvironment. Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C-pyruvate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - a novel non-radioactive imaging modality able to provide in vivo measurements of the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate (kpl).",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab. II. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.\n\nIII. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in participants receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.\n\nII. To compare overall response rate (ORR), DOR, and PFS by Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) with the same measures assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1.\n\nIII. To correlate clinical outcomes (ORR, DOR, PFS, OS) with baseline immune cell infiltration, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining in pre-treatment biopsies. IV. To assess changes in immune cell infiltration, PD-L1 staining, and TCR repertoires in pre- and post-biopsies.\n\nV. Correlate Ki67proliferative index with outcomes (ORR, DOR, PFS, OS).\n\nIV. To characterize the baseline molecular features (tissue- and blood-based) of G3 NETs treated with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab.\n\nVII. To correlate the molecular features of G3 NET with clinical outcomes (e.g., response/resistance, survival, safety, pharmacodynamic activity) in the setting of treatment with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib.\n\nVIII. To describe the relationship between baseline tumor growth rate (TGR) and RECIST measurements for all patients.\n\nIX. To examine changes in TGR over time in patients treated with Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab TGR as assessed by cross-sectional imaging.\n\nX. To investigate the relationship between on-treatment changes in pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate (kpl) and ORR, PFS, and OS.\n\nXI. To investigate the relationship between baseline tumor proliferative index (as measured by Ki67), metabolic profile (NMR spectroscopy), and pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate (kpl, as measured by hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate imaging) and ORR, PFS and OS.\n\nXII. Assessment of baseline heterogeneity of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate (kpl) between patients and between tumors within a given participant.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nThere are 2 stages to this study. If at least 2 participants in stage 1 show a demonstrated response, a second stage will open to enroll additional participants. Participants may continue treatment for up to two years of therapy (i.e., 18 doses of pembrolizumab).\n\nAfter the end of treatment, each participant will be followed for 30 days for adverse event (AE) monitoring. Serious adverse events (SAE) and events of clinical interest (ECI) will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier. Participants who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. After documented disease progression each participant will be followed by telephone for overall survival and anti-cancer therapy until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first."

Hypersensitivity (\\>=G3) or known intolerance to lenvatinib or pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\n9. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.\n10. Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or participants at risk for severe hemorrhage.\n11. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n12. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n\n    * Individuals with new or progressive asymptomatic small (\\<1 cm) brain metastases are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS-specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy.\n    * Participants with previously treated brain metastases (e.g., whole brain radiation therapy, surgery, or radiosurgery) may participate provided they are radiologically stable (i.e., without evidence of progression by imaging) for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n13. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).\n\n    \\*Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n16. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by a local health authority.\n17. Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection. Note: No testing for hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by a local health authority.\n\n    * Participants with controlled hepatitis C are eligible (no detectable HCV RNA qualitative) provided anti-viral therapy completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n    * Participants with controlled HBV are eligible if they meet the following criteria:\n\n      * Antiviral therapy for HBV must be given for at least 4 weeks and HBV viral load must be less than 500 IU/mL before the first dose of study drug. Participants on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 100 IU/mL should stay on the same therapy throughout study treatment.\n      * Participants who are positive for anti-Hepatitis B Core (HBc), negative for HbsAg, and negative or positive for anti-HBs, and who have an HBV viral load under 100 IU/mL, do not require HBV antiviral prophylaxis\n18. Is known to have active tuberculosis (TB, Bacillus tuberculosis).\n19. Diagnostic assessments:\n\n    * Participants with urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) \\>1 or proteinuria \\>-2+ (\\>=100 mg/dL) on urinalysis/urine dipstick testing will undergo 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein \\>=1 g/24 hour will be ineligible.\n    * Prolongation of QTc interval to \\> 480 milliseconds (ms). Investigator may use the average of 3 triplicates if screening QTc \\> 450 ms. Rescreening is allowed after discontinuation of any drugs known to prolong QTc. NOTE: If the QTcF is prolonged to \\>480 ms in the presence of a pacemaker, the participant will not be excluded if the participant is considered at low risk for ventricular arrhythmias by the investigator.\n    * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the institutional (or local laboratory) normal range as determined by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO).\n20. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab are products with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n\n    * A woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days of the first dose of the study intervention.\n    * If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., a positive or an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.\n21. Women who are breastfeeding are excluded from the study because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab).\n22. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality (including electrolyte abnormalities that have not been corrected, e.g., potassium, calcium, magnesium) that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n23. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperating with the requirements of the study.\n\n    Listed below are specific concomitant therapies or vaccinations that are prohibited during the study (exceptions noted):\n24. Currently participating in or has participated in a trial of an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n25. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks or 5 times the half-life time, whichever is shorter prior to study treatment start.\n\n    Participants must have recovered from all adverse events (AE) due to previous therapies to \\<=Grade 1 (except for alopecia) or baseline, and \\<=Grade 2 for neuropathy.\n    * Concomitant administration of hormone therapy for breast cancer, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs for prostate cancer allowed.\n    * Concomitant somatostatin analogs for functional neuroendocrine tumors are allowed as per standard of care assuming a stable dose for at least two months and progressive disease has been documented on that dose.\n    * Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate if it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n26. Has received prior treatment with lenvatinib, or any anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), OX 40, CD137). Treatment with another Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibitor (VEGF inhibitor_ (besides lenvatinib) is allowed if at least 6 months have elapsed since discontinued therapy.\n27. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the start of study treatment. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities (to Grade \\<=1), not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\\<=2 weeks of radiotherapy) for non-CNS disease.\n28. Has had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study interventions. Note: Adequate wound healing after major surgery must be assessed clinically, independent of time elapsed for eligibility.\n29. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n30. Patients who are currently receiving medication with a known risk of prolonging the QT interval inducing Torsade's de Pointes (TdP) and the treatment cannot either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug treatment. A list of prohibited drugs with a known risk of TdP is provided in Appendix 6.\n31. Biologic response modifiers (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) within 4 weeks before study entry. Chronic erythropoietin therapy is permitted provided that no dose adjustments were made within 2 months before the first dose of study drug.\n32. Received a live or attenuated vaccine within 30 days of the planned start of study treatment (C1D1). Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations are also allowed.",
