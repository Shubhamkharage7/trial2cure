            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important non-invasive tool to study and diagnose cardiovascular disease. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of body organs. Researchers want to find better MRI methods and new ways of imaging cardiovascular disease and better understand normal and abnormal cardiovascular and brain function. Researchers are also interested in seeing if gadolinium, the commonly used MRI contrast agent, stays in the body long after the MRI was performed.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo develop new methods for imaging the heart and other organs of the body.\n\nTo describe cardiovascular diseases using newer MRI methods\n\nTo look at the relationship between cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors and other organ systems\n\nTo look for gadolinium deposits in the brain from prior exams.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people and people with known or suspected cardiovascular disease ages 7 and older may be eligible for this study.\n\nResearchers may be particularly interested in those who:\n\n* Have suspected or known cardiovascular disease\n* Were previously exposed to a gadolinium-based contrast agent,\n* Need to have a heart MRI scheduled\n* Need a test of the heart or other body part or will be undergoing a future cardiac catheterization\n\nDesign:\n\nThere are multiple arms to the study with optional components; therefore, there are multiple variations as to what an individual participant s experience may involve.\n\nParticipants will have an MRI scan lasting up to 2 hours. The scanner is a large hollow tube. During the scan, there may be loud knocking and buzzing sounds caused by the scanner. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the tube. Their vital signs may be monitored.\n\nParticipants may have a test of heart electrical activity using wires connected to pads on the skin.\n\nParticipants may have blood drawn.\n\nParticipants may be injected with an MRI contrast agent through a plastic tube inserted in the arm.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this protocol is to develop and test new MRI techniques applicable to patients undergoing cardiovascular evaluation with the ultimate goal of translating the technical advances into improving clinical diagnosis and management of patients undergoing cardiovascular evaluation. Patients undergoing cardiovascular evaluation and healthy volunteers will be scanned under the protocol. We will evaluate new developments in non-contrast and contrast MRI of the heart and blood vessels and novel postprocessing methods.\n\nThe use of the newer sequences will be used to improve clinical imaging workflow and disease diagnosis. We hope to use this protocol to clearly describe cardiovascular disease and associated problems using novel MRI methods and follow certain subsets of patients with disease as part of a natural history process. Inter-related physiologic systems may be phenotyped by MRI with characterization of disease associations between different organ systems.\n\nAdditionally, information regarding gadolinium deposition of the brain will be gathered. The literature regarding deposition of gadolinium in the brain has a large void regarding information of prevalence of the phenomenon in healthy subjects. The National Institutes of Health has a large healthy subject pool who have participated in gadolinium contrast MRI studies. This pool of healthy subjects is not easily available at most clinical MRI centers, and thus, we are uniquely well-situated to be able to answer this outstanding question.\n\nFor all objectives, MRI studies will be conducted in the NIH MRI systems located at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. These procedures may involve the intravenous administration of commercially available MR contrast media and exercise or pharmacologic stress testing. Results will be used to evaluate the performance of various research pulse sequences, gradient coils, and radiofrequency receiver coils on human subjects and will provide essential ground work for specific patient protocols, both diagnostic and therapeutic."
