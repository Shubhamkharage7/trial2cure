Unfortunately, traditional managements have transient benefits with more than 90 recurrence rate within a year. Therefore, there is a significant unmet medical need. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Trametinib in children and adults with Extracranial Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)."
