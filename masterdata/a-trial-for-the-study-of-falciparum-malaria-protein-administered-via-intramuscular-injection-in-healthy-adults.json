Able and willing to comply with all research requirements, in the opinion of the Investigator;\n4. Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study.

Persistent Grade 1 abnormalities that are felt to represent the non-pathologic baseline for the subject will be discussed with the research monitor and documented before a subject is enrolled in the trial, and are allowable per discretion and agreement of the PI and Research Monitor\n6. Birth control requirements:\n\n   Female subjects must meet one of the following 2 criteria:\n   * No reproductive potential due to post-menopausal status (12 months of natural \\[spontaneous\\] amenorrhea) or hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation;\n   * Women of childbearing potential should agree to practice highly effective contraception at least 30 days before enrollment and through 3 months post-CHMI or post-last vaccination (whichever is latest), using one of the following methods: condoms (male or female) with spermicide; diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicide; intrauterine device; contraceptive pills, patch, injection, intravaginal ring or other FDA-approved contraceptive method; male partner has previously undergone a vasectomy; abstinence.\n\n   Male subjects are encouraged but not required to practice highly effective contraception to avoid pregnancy in their partner from 30 days prior to enrollment through 60 days post-CHMI. This is due to the potential impact of malaria and antimalarial medications on spermatogenesis.\n7. For all female subjects except those with a history of hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, a negative \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test (urine) on day of enrollment, each day of vaccination, and the day of CHMI (tubal ligations have a not insignificant failure rate, 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea does not completely preclude pregnancy and can be a result of polycystic ovarian syndrome);\n8.

No plans to travel outside the Washington DC metro area (DC, Maryland, and Virginia) between the day of challenge and 28 days post-challenge; For Travel outside the US occurring 28 days post-challenge to a malaria endemic area inclusion will be at the discretion of the PI.\n10. If a subject is active duty military, he or she must obtain approval from his or her supervisor per WRAIR Policy 11-45;\n11. Must have low (\\< 10%) cardiac risk factors according to clinical Gaziano (NHANES I) criteria assessed at screening, and a normal or normal variant ECG;\n12. Completion of Study Comprehension Quiz (minimum passing score of 80% with 2 attempts permitted).\n13. Subject must be willing to take anti-malarial treatment after CHMI;\n14. Subject must provide 2 emergency contacts who will be made aware of the subject's participation in this trial and the vital importance of being reached during the challenge phase of the study. Both contacts must be verified by pone prior to subject enrollment.\n\nVerification will be define as either speaking to the emergency contact over the phone, hearing their name included in the voicemail response, or confirming the emergency contact uses the number if a third party answers the phone.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of malaria infection (any species) or residence in a malaria-endemic area for more than 5 years (includes previous participation in CHMI studies).\n2. Previous travel to malaria endemic regions within the past 6 months before study enrollment defined as first vaccination or day of challenge (for infectivity controls) or planned travel to malaria endemic regions during the vaccination, CHMI and 28-day CHMI follow-up period; For Travel outside the US occurring 28 days post-challenge to a malaria endemic area exclusion will be at the discretion of the PI.\n3. Any history of receiving a malaria vaccine.\n4. Received an investigational product in the 30 days before enrollment, or planned to receive during the study period.\n5. Concurrent participation in another clinical research study.\n6. Any use of medications that prevent or treat malaria during the 1 month prior to challenge or planned use during the study (outside of the drugs provided by the study team).\n7. Any serious medical illness or condition involving the heart, liver, lungs, or kidneys.\n8. Any significant risk for developing heart disease in the next 5 years, assessed according to clinical Gaziano (NHANES I) criteria assessed at screening, and an ECG.\n9. Receipt of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months before enrollment.\n10. Any history of anaphylaxis.\n11. History of sickle cell trait or disease, or any condition that could affect susceptibility to malaria infection, per subject verbal report.\n12.

History of active/recent cancer still within treatment or active surveillance follow-up (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in situ). Treated/resolved cancers with no likelihood of recurrence may be deemed acceptable at Principal investigator discretion\n15. History of autoimmune disease.\n16. Significant (eg systemic anaphylaxis) hypersensitivity reactions to mosquito bites (local reactions at the site of mosquito bites are not an exclusion criterion) requiring hospitalization.\n17. Suspected or known current alcohol or drug abuse as defined by an alcohol intake of greater than 3 drinks a day on average for a man, and greater than 2 drinks a day on average for a woman.\n18. Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of the volunteer to give informed consent, participate in the study, or impair interpretation of the study data, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n19. Current anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis or treatment.\n20. History of splenectomy.\n21. History of confirmed or suspected immunodeficiency.\n22.
