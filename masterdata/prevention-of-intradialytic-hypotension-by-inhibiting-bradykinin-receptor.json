            "briefSummary": "Currently, there is no medication available to adequately treat patients undergoing hemodialysis who are suffering from intradialytic hypotension (IDH). Medical interventions such as Trendelenburg positioning, saline bolus administration, reduction of ultrafiltration rate, interruption of the hemodialysis, and other medical treatments are the methods of choice to treat the hypotensive condition of these patients and thus to maintain the systolic blood pressure. Patients suffering from IDH have a higher reported mortality rate due to the given stress on their cardiovascular system. New treatments, therefore, would give clinicians an additional alternative to current existing approaches and might help patients to maintain their blood pressure during hemodialysis.\n\nThe main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of icatibant in the prevention of systolic blood pressure (SBP) drop in patients on hemodialysis suffering from recurrent IDH episodes during hemodialysis.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that in patients prone to IDH, blockade of bradykinin B2 receptor with icatibant prevents the drop of blood pressure and maintains hemodynamic stability. For this purpose, heart rate and blood pressure during hemodialysis are monitored. Importantly, the study will be conducted in an outpatient clinic, using the patients' usual hemodialysis dose and settings as for a regular hemodialysis session.\n\nAim 2 is to test the hypothesis that in patients prone to IDH, inhibition of the plasma kallikrein system with icatibant prevents symptoms associated with IDH such as cramps, dizziness, and nausea, and improves the quality of life (QoL) and recovery time after hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is associated with many complications, including IDH, that negatively affect the QoL of patients and their families. Any intervention that prevents the occurrence of IDH will result in a faster recovery from hemodialysis. The present study will evaluate the impact of icatibant on preventing symptoms associated with IDH and reducing recovery time after hemodialysis."
