Tenapanor is the newest FDA-approved agent for IBS-C. It is a small molecule that inhibits the NHE3 receptor, leading to impaired sodium and water absorption in the intestine. Previous clinical trials comparing tenapanor to placebo showed that a 50 mg dose of tenapanor led to increased bowel movements and decreased abdominal pain. This study consists of an 8-week treatment period in which subjects will ingest one capsule of tenapanor (50 mg per dose), twice daily, and send in stool samples following 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment."

Composition analysis of metagenome will be performed using the read-based bioinformatics analysis suite. Functional genomic profiles, detailed species-specific reconstruction of microbial metabolic pathways, their complement of gene orthologs, taxonomic distributions, and abundances will be generated with HUMAnN2. This will provide taxon-specific profiles of UniRef orthologous gene families, MetCyc, UniPathway, and KEGG pathways to survey microbial community metabolite production potential in each metagenome according to tenapanor use.",
