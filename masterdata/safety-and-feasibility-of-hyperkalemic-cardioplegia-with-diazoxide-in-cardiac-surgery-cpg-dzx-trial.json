            "briefSummary": "This study aims to confirm the safety and efficacy of diazoxide as an additive to hyperkalemic cardioplegia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The investigators hypothesize that diazoxide combined with hyperkalemic cardioplegia provides superior myocardial protection and reduced myocardial stunning compared with standard cardioplegia alone. Thirty patients will receive treatment. Safety will be assessed by comparing mean arterial blood pressure measurements, glucose levels and incidence of adverse events between the two groups. Efficacy will be assessed by comparing right and left ventricular function in pre-operative vs post-operative transesophageal echocardiograms, need for mechanical circulatory support, ease of separation from bypass and Vasoactive Inotrope Score (VIS) between the two groups. The information gained could pave the way for the use of Katp (Potassium-atp) channel openers to prevent stunning, improve patient outcomes, and reduce health care costs related to myocardial stunning that requires inotropic and mechanical support following cardiac surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I clinical trial. Thirty patients total will receive treatment (IV Diazoxide added to cardioplegia). Diazoxide will be added to the first dose of cardioplegia only. Subsequent doses of cardioplegia will not contain additives."
