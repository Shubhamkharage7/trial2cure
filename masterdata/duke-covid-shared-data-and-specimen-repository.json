The core data variables were in-part selected to specifically match those agreed upon by Academic Medical Centers across the U.S., with the intention of aiding the efficiency and effectiveness of de-identified data reuse for population-level research. An additional benefit is that centralized, shared data storage of demographic and longitudinal variables will reduce subject burden, as many questions will now only need to be asked once, rather than each time a given subject joins another COVID-19 related study at Duke.\n\nThis shared data and bio-repository project will house all the core data for all patients with COVID-19 (or suspected cases), as well as individual participants ICFs for all other participating COVID-19 studies enrolling Duke patients. Each participating study will have its own separate IRB approved protocol. Samples may be either collected specifically by the protocol, or include left-over clinical samples from the testing and treatment of patients with COVID-19 at Duke."
