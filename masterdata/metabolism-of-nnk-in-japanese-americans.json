In this study the investigators will explore how individual differences in the metabolism of a tobacco-specific lung carcinogen may contribute to the variable risk of lung cancer between ethnic/racial groups.\n\nIn this 10 day clinical trial, Japanese Americans will smoke a cigarette containing deuterium-labeled 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a tobacco-specific lung carcinogen. The study cigarette will be smoked for 7 days.\n\nThis will allow for NNK metabolic profiling and determining the effect of CYP2A6 genotype on the level of NNK \u03b1-hydroxylation in Japanese Americans smokers using \\[pyridine- D4\\]-NNK containing cigarettes.",

Study cigarettes spiked with labeled NNK will be provided to the subjects to smoke over a 7 day period. During this time, 24 hour urine samples will be collected over days 5, 6 and 7 on study cigarettes. Blood will be drawn on days 6 and 7 on study cigarettes.
