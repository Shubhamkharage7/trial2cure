            "briefSummary": "Aging is an independent risk factor for developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease; however, the mechanisms underlying age-related cardiovascular disease remain poorly understood. One hallmark of aging is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity, which can decrease the number and/or sensitivity of \u03b22 adrenergic receptors to reduce dilation of blood vessels and increase blood pressure. Identifying new targets to restore vascular \u03b22 adrenergic receptor signaling may help reduce cardiovascular risk in aging. This study will test the hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7), a protective hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, can reduce cardiovascular sympathetic outflow and blood pressure and improve endothelial function in older healthy humans.",
            "detailedDescription": "A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study will be conducted to determine if acute intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) infusion can reduce cardiovascular sympathetic tone and blood pressure and improve the function of blood vessels in older healthy individuals. This is an outpatient study that requires a screening visit, and if eligible, two study visits separated by at least one week in the Clinical Research Center within the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. The study visits will include intravenous infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) or saline for approximately two hours, starting with increasing doses and holding at a steady-state dose. Endothelial function will be measured and blood samples and endothelial cells collected at baseline and at the end of infusions. Blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity via microneurography will be measured throughout the study. Each study visit will last approximately 4 hours."
