Each participant will receive a laptop equipped with the necessary applications and features for the study. Participants will receive up to 10 evaluations and 20 speech therapy sessions with a licensed speech therapist, as well as access to Communication Bridge, a personalized web application to practice home exercises that reinforce treatment strategies. There are no costs to participate in this study."

Participants rate each item with a score between 1 (Not at all) and 5 (A great deal) corresponding to the amount of perceived burden. Higher scores reflect increased burden. Internal consistency .81 to .90. Construct validity demonstrated in mixed cohort of care partners of persons with dementia.
