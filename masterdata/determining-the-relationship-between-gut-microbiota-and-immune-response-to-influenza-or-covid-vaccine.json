            "detailedDescription": "The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the role of gut microbiome in influenza or COVID-19 vaccine response in immunosuppressed populations. Microbial diversity (alpha diversity) is decreased in immunosuppressed patients and might be associated with lower immunogenicity to vaccines.\n\nIt is known that patients with IBD have dysbiosis of their gut microbiome and those immunosuppressed may have a lower vaccine response. In this aim, the investigators will evaluate whether differences in microbial diversity predict immune response to the influenza and COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIn this prospective study, immunosuppressed IBD patients will be vaccinated per standard of care and blood will be collected to measure the immune response. A fecal and saliva sample will be collected to characterize the gut microbiome. The investigators hypothesize that reduced richness / alpha-diversity in gut microbiota will correlate with those with a blunted vaccine response."
