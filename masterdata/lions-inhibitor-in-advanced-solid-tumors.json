Exploratory objectives include examination of biomarker responses in relationship to RP-1664 exposure.\n\nAfter the recommended dose and schedule is determined, expansion cohorts with molecularly selected advanced solid tumors will be enrolled to preliminarily assess the anti-tumor effect, and further examine the safety and PK of RP-1664 at the RP2D."
