            "briefSummary": "The primary purpose of this hybrid Type II comparative effectiveness and implementation study is to compare two self-management strategies in nursery and landscape workers. This randomized pragmatic study will compare interventions with different degrees of support to determine if self-management videos plus multimodal personalized support is more effective than self-management videos alone for improving LBP among horticulture workers. Both groups will review short self-management video modules to introduce general pain concepts and the importance of managing pain without medication, risks of opioid use, self-management of pain, and simple ergonomic strategies for both groups. Both groups will choose 1 self-management strategy to manage pain at home and 1 ergonomic workplace strategy to limit pain. The video+support group will receive 1) check-list guidance, 2) review videos of their work tasks, and 3) receive text reminders to support implementation. Surveys will include instruments reflecting low back pain disability, pain, work ability, and affective or cognitive characteristics (self-efficacy, pain anxiety, depression, coping), collected at baseline, pre- and post-intervention, with follow-ups at 3- and 6-months. Workers will be videoed pre- and post-intervention for calculation of work risk and to compare any changes after the intervention. Specific aim 2 will identify contextual factors impacting engagement, adoption, effectiveness, and implementation. Interviews, focus groups, and field notes will be used to explain results and establish patterns to inform future translation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary dependent variables will be collected at all measurement points: pain severity, interference, and persistence, pain with specific work tasks, disability, work ability, and pain medication use. Affective or cognitive characteristics potentially impacting adoption and effectiveness (secondary dependent variables or confounders) such as coping, fear, anxiety, depression, will also be collected.The post- and follow-up survey questions will also reflect adoption, opinions of interventions, effectiveness, facilitators, and barriers."
