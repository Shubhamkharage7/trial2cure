            "detailedDescription": "Approximately 700 adult participants (18 to 70 years old, inclusive) with DM1 will be enrolled at 15 centers (up to 70 patients will be recruited at each site). No treatment will be administered as part of this study. Participants will receive standard of care as determined by the investigators. Study visits occur at baseline/0 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Few restrictions are placed on participation in the study because the investigators aim to capture the full spectrum of disease severity.\n\nMuscle biopsy sub-study: Studies of splicing biomarkers in muscle biopsy samples will be conducted on a subset of 95 participants. These participants will have an additional study visit at 3 months.\n\nLongitudinal muscle biopsy sub-study: Up to 30 individuals who have had a prior muscle biopsy as part of a DMCRN study will be asked to undergo another biopsy greater than 24 months after the prior biopsy. These participants will have an additional ad hoc biopsy visit.\n\nCOVID-19 sub-study: To evaluate severity of illness and response to COVID-19 vaccination in DM1 patients compared to corresponding data available about the general population, END-DM1 study participants will be asked to complete a one-time survey about COVID-19 experiences. A subset of those participants' blood samples will be analyzed to understand immunoglobulin response to infection and vaccination in DM1 patients.\n\nActigraphy sub-study: To assess daily physical activity in individuals with DM1 and evaluate physical activity changes over a 12-24 month period related to disease progression, a subset of participants will be asked to wear a small, wireless activity monitor while performing functional assessments described in the main study. Those participants will be asked to wear the activity monitor for 7 days following their research visit. Those participants will be asked to complete additional questionnaires.\n\nHandheld Dynamometry sub-study: To evaluate additional muscle strength methods, a subset of participants will be asked to complete additional strength testing using either the MEDup or MicroFET handheld dynamometry device on the same day as their END-DM1 main study visit. Those participants will be asked to return to the clinic for a second visit within 10 days of the END-DM1 study visit to repeat the handheld dynamometry assessments and complete additional strength measures."

Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of DM1 in \\> 99% of individuals who satisfied these criteria.2\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Symptomatic renal or liver disease, uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disorder, or active malignancy other than skin cancer.\n* Current alcohol or substance abuse\n* Concurrent enrollment in clinical trial for DM1, or participation in trial within 6 months of entry.\n* Concurrent pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the course of the study.\n* Concurrent medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator or clinical evaluator, compromise performance on study measures.\n* Note: non-ambulatory participants are not excluded, but are limited to \\<15% of enrollment.\n\nInclusion criteria for participants in the muscle biopsy sub-study:\n\n\u2022 Of the 95 patients undergoing the tibialis anterior muscle biopsy, at least half will have at least moderate weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, defined as MRC score \u2264 4+. This is in order to obtain a muscle tissue sample in a person more severely affected with myotonic dystrophy. Approximately 10 patients at each site will undergo the muscle biopsy.\n\nExclusion criteria for 95 participants in the muscle biopsy sub-study:\n\n* Known CTG repeat expansion size less than 100 repeats, unless there are clear cut signs of limb weakness and muscle wasting. This is in order to obtain a muscle tissue sample in a person more severely affected with myotonic dystrophy.\n* Use of anticoagulant such as warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (e.g. dabigatran) due to the increased risk of bleeding.\n* Use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be discontinued 3 days prior to the biopsy procedure, if possible.\n* Platelet count \\<50,000 (if known) due to the increased risk of bleeding.\n* History of a bleeding disorder due to the increased risk of bleeding.\n* Advanced wasting of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle that precludes needle muscle biopsy in order to ensure that a sample taken would be of muscle and not just fat and fascia.\n* Previous muscle biopsy of either TA in order to provide muscle tissue samples of non-biopsied muscles.",
