            "briefSummary": "This research study is studying a medication called Venetoclax and a chemotherapy regimen as a possible treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.\n\nThe drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Venetoclax\n* Standard Chemotherapy (which includes cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, etoposide, and cytarabine",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug and drug combination to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drug and drug combination is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Venetoclax for this specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nVenetoclax is an inhibitor of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 is critical for keeping cancer cells alive.\n\nBy inhibiting Bcl-2, venetoclax promotes cancer cell death. This drug is currently being used in other clinical trials for people with certain types of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. There is some evidence from those and other laboratory trials that venetoclax may kill cancer cells and cause tumors to shrink.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are investigating how safe the combination of Venetoclax and standard chemotherapy is and how it affects this disease.. The participant will be given Venetoclax alone first and the standard chemotherapies will be given in combination. This study aims to provide information to help determine the dose of Venetoclax , in combination with standard chemotherapy, affects this disease the best and which dose is the safest."
