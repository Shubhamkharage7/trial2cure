Participants will be randomized with equal allocation to one of the 2 groups. The IDEAL group will receive 1 DSMES brief video/week for 24 weeks delivered via text message. The CHW will assess participants' SDOH barriers to T2D care and link them to available resources in the community. The CONTROL group will continue to receive their usual care and at the end of the study, they will receive DSMES videos."
