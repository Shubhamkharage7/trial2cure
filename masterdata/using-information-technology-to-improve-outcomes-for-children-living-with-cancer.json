            "briefSummary": "This proposed study plans to develop and evaluate a patient-oriented, technology-based, symptom monitoring system that reports symptoms experienced by children with cancer to their parents and health care providers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cancer is a leading cause of death and disability in children under 15 years of age. Its unrelieved symptoms and side effects of often-aggressive treatments can lead to poor psychosocial functioning and decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients and their families. Barriers at the patient, healthcare provider and system levels can contribute to poor symptom management. A technology-based program can minimize these barriers by routinely collecting and interpreting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient/parent contextual data in pediatric oncology ambulatory settings in a manner that is efficient, actionable by physicians, supports engagement of patients and families with their health and care, and improves clinical processes and outcomes. This proposed project will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of such a program: Symptom Monitoring \\& Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS). We hypothesize that the SyMon-SAYS intervention will decrease parent-perceived barriers to managing their child's symptoms, decrease patient symptom burden, increase patients' and parents' self-efficacy, and ultimately increase patient HRQOL."
