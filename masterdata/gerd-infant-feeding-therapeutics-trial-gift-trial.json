The three therapies being compared are natural maturation, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, and added rice (AR) formula use. The main goals are:\n\n* to evaluate and compare the efficacy of the three commonly used treatment interventions used in the NICU for GERD in a randomized controlled manner with the primary endpoint of oral feeding success and absence of troublesome symptoms (as defined below).\n* to characterize the mechanisms of primary end point (success or failure) using pH-Impedance metrics.",

These subjects will be randomized to one of the 3 arms of the study (natural maturation, PPI, AR formula) for 4 weeks of treatment. A second 24-hour pH Impedance test will be done on therapy at 4 weeks or before discharge, whichever occurs first. Primary outcome will also be measured at 4 weeks or at discharge, whichever comes first."
