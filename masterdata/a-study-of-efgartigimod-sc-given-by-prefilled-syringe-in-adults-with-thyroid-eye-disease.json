At the end of the DBTP, participants may enter a follow-up observational period while off study drug. Some participants may also enter the open-label treatment period with efgartigimod PH20 SC. The study duration varies from approximately 60 to 110 weeks.\n\nAn alternative list of clinical sites open for recruitment could be found in the other UplighTED study record (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06307613)"
