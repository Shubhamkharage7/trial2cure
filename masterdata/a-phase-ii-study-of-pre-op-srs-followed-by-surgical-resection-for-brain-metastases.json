This research study will also determine if pre-operative SRS will lower the risk of radionecrosis that is the breakdown of body tissue at the original tumor site, and the development of leptomeningeal disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients with a solid tumor malignancy that has metastasized to the brain are invited to participate in this trial. Upon enrollment to this study a subject will undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Elekta Gamma Knife Icon, being treated in once daily 15 minute fractions of 9 Gray (Gy) or every other day 15 minute fractions of 9 Gy for a total dose of 27 Gy in 3 doses. A subject will undergo a routine CT and MRI simulation to determine positioning of the head prior to the start of the SRS treatment. Within two (2) weeks after completion of SRS a subject will undergo a routine surgical resection of the brain metastasis. Prior to the SRS treatment and during the follow up phase of the study MRIs will be performed, which are standard of care. Subjects will also complete a quality of life questionnaire. The duration of subject's time participating in this study is 2 years."

The preferred dose will be 27 Gy, with ability to drop dose down to 24 Gy if normal tissue constraints cannot be met. It should be noted, that while the dosing remains within standard of care, the timing of the radiation (pre-operative) is still not considered standard of care but is supported by emerging data as described in the study background. Additional metastatic lesions may be treated using SRS according to institutional practices. The radiation dose prescribed to the non-index lesions is at the discretion of the treating physicians.
