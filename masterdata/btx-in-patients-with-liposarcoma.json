BTX-A51 works in a different way from currently approved therapies used to treat liposarcoma by blocking proteins called CK1\u03b1 and CDK9.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved BTX-A51 as a treatment for Liposarcoma.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, blood tests, and tumor biopsies.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as there are no serious side effects, and disease does not get worse. Participants will be followed for 1 year after the last dose of BTX-A51.\n\nIt is expected that about 12 people will take part in this research study.\n\nEdgewood Oncology is supporting this research study by providing the study drug."
