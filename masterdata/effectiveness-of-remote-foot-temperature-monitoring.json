            "briefSummary": "Diabetic foot ulcers are common, debilitating, and costly complications of diabetes, disproportionately impacting Black and rural Veterans. Forty percent of individuals have an ulcer recurrence within a year of ulcer healing and 65% within 5 years. Monitoring plantar foot temperatures is one of the few interventions that reduces the risk of ulcer recurrence. Despite the evidence, adoption has been poor because the original procedures, including the use of handheld thermometers, were burdensome and time-consuming. Podimetrics, a private company, has developed a temperature monitoring system involving a \"smart\" mat that can wirelessly transmit data and a remote monitoring team that works with VA providers to assist with triage and monitoring. This care model has incredible promise, but has been untested in VA. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate effectiveness of remote temperature monitoring as well as costs. Additionally, the investigators will evaluate the implementation process, including barriers and facilitators to use among key stakeholders.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objective(s) and Hypotheses: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are common, debilitating, and costly complications of diabetes, disproportionately impacting Black and rural Veterans. Forty percent of individuals have an ulcer recurrence within a year of ulcer healing and 65% within 5 years. Remote temperature monitoring (RTM) of feet is one of the few interventions that reduces the risk of ulcer recurrence. Despite the evidence, adoption has been poor because the original procedures, including the use of handheld thermometers, were burdensome and time-consuming. Podimetrics, a private company, has developed a temperature monitoring system involving a \"smart\" mat that measure foot temperatures and a remote monitoring team that works with VA providers to assist with triage and monitoring. This care model has incredible promise, but has been untested in VA.\n\nThe specific aims of this study are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of RTM vs. usual care in terms of primary (ulceration) and secondary outcomes (severity of ulceration, amputation, hospitalization, emergency room visits, quality of life, satisfaction with care, and self-efficacy for managing diabetes) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months; 2) Collect data on costs of RTM and compare with usual care costs, if effectiveness is demonstrated; and 3) Evaluate the implementation process, including barriers and facilitators to use among key stakeholders\n\nResearch Design: For Aim 1, the investigators will conduct a 3-site randomized controlled study. Aim 2 involves a budget impact analysis to evaluate costs of RTM. Aim 3 involves qualitative interviews to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation of RTM.\n\nMethodology: For Aim 1, the investigators will aim to enroll at least 406 patients who have had a DFU or amputation within the past 24 months (including active ulcers). Patients will be randomized 1:1 to RTM or usual care (no RTM), with randomization stratified on site and active ulcer vs. not. For Aim 2, the investigators will collect data and observe providers to quantify provider time for selecting patients for RTM, ordering mats, and responding to alerts of \"hot spots\". The investigators will use medical records to assess patient utilization (ulcer/amputation-related outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room visits) and associated costs of care for patients in the RTM and comparison groups. For Aim 3, the investigators will conduct semi-structured phone interviews with 30-50 Veterans and 6-12 providers and use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to guide data collection and analysis.\n\nRelevance to VA Mission: Findings from this study will be used to inform effective, efficient, and equitable scaling of RTM in VA."
