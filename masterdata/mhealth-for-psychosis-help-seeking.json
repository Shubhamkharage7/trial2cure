This clinical trial will involve a remote pilot randomized controlled trial that will examine (1) the feasibility of the proposed research approach, (2) the acceptability and usability of the NORTH intervention as well as (3) the specific additive value of help-seeking support in the context of self-guided mHealth for early psychosis. The full intervention, which includes psychoeducational lessons, Cognitive-Behavior Therapy-based practices, a symptom tracking feature, and help-seeking resources will be compared to a \"Lite\" version that will include the lessons, practices, and tracking but exclude the help-seeking resources."
