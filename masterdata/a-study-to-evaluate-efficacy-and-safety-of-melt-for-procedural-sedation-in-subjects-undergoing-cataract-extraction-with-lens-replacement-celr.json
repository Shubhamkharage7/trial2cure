            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if MELT-300 works on procedural sedation in adult participants undergoing cataract extraction with lens replacement (CELR). It will also learn about the safety of MELT-300. Researchers will compare MELT-300 to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) to see if MELT-300 works on procedural sedation in adult participants undergoing CELR. Researchers will also include a comparator SL midazolam to confirm the benefit of inclusion of ketamine in the combined drug product.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does MELT-300 is effective in comparison to placebo on procedural sedation for cataract surgery?\n2. To determine the effectiveness of MELT-300 compared with midazolam on procedural sedation (to determine the contribution of ketamine component and inform the risk of ketamine in MELT-300)\n3. To determine the time to achieve preoperative target sedation level with MELT-300\n4. What medical problems do participants have when taking MELT-300 vs placebo\n\nEligible participants will admitted to the study unit on Day 1. Participants will be randomized prior to surgery 4:1:1 to\n\n1. MELT-300 (i.e. 1 MELT-300 sublingual tablet which contains 3 mg midazolam and 50 mg of ketamine)\n2. Midazolam (i.e. 1 matching midazolam sublingual tablet which contains 3 mg midazolam)\n3. Placebo (i.e. 1 matching placebo sublingual tablet)\n\nParticipants will receive study medication 30 (\u00b1 5) minutes, without food or water, before planned surgery start (defined as instillation of topical ocular anesthetic gel \\[i.e.. 3 drops of chloroprocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic gel)\\].\n\nThe effectiveness of MELT-300 will be performed after study medication is administered before surgery, in the course of surgery, and postoperative on Day 1 (end of surgery defined as just prior to drape removal). The safety of MELT-300 will be performed at baseline, in the course of surgery, postoperatively on Day 1, and on Day 3 \u00b1 1 day post dose of study medication.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-cohort, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MELT-300 compared with placebo on procedural sedation in adult participants undergoing CELR. An active comparator, SL midazolam, is also included in the trial, in part, to confirm the benefit of inclusion of ketamine in the combined drug product.\n\nApproximately 486 participants will be enrolled in 3 parallel treatment arms to assess efficacy endpoints.\n\nEligible participants will be admitted to the study unit on Day 1. Participants will be randomized prior to surgery 4:1:1 to\n\n1. MELT-300 (i.e. 1 MELT-300 sublingual tablet which contains 3 mg midazolam and 50 mg of ketamine)\n2. Midazolam (i.e. 1 matching midazolam sublingual tablet which contains 3 mg midazolam)\n3. Placebo (i.e. 1 matching placebo sublingual tablet) Participants will receive study medication 30 (\u00b1 5) minutes, without food or water, before planned surgery start (defined as instillation of topical ocular anesthetic gel \\[i.e.. 3 drops of chloroprocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic gel)\\].\n\nEfficacy assessments will be performed after study medication administration before surgery, intraoperatively, and postoperative on Day 1 (end of surgery defined as just prior to drape removal). Efficacy assessments will include assessments of sedation, need for rescue medication for sedation, need for rescue medication for pain, and the ability to complete the surgery.\n\nSafety will be monitored at baseline, intraoperatively, postoperatively on Day 1, and on Day 3 \u00b1 1 day post dose of study medication. Safety assessment will include monitoring of AEs, vital sign measurements, and physical examinations."
