            "detailedDescription": "Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disorder that affects the musculoskeletal system, causing widespread pain, tenderness, and fatigue. It is estimated to affect 1-5% of the population. The primary symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain throughout the body, accompanied by tenderness and sensitivity to pressure. Secondary symptoms include fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, headaches, depression, and anxiety. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of neurobiological, genetic, and environmental factors.\n\nThere is no cure for fibromyalgia, and only a minority of fibromyalgia patients continue taking medications for more than a short period due to either lack of efficacy, side effects, or both. Pharmacological treatments include drugs such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and painkillers, and operate by modulating pain signals in the brain and nervous system. Another treatment option for fibromyalgia is the use of devices, such as the Quell device by Neurometrix 3. Other non-pharmacological treatment options for fibromyalgia include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), biofeedback, and relaxation techniques 2.\n\nRemote Electrical Neuromodulation (REN) is a non-pharmacological technology that induces subthreshold, non-painful neurostimulation signals that activate an endogenic pain-management system termed Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM), to produce generalized pain relief in remote body areas. Multiple studies have shown that REN is safe and effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults and adolescents, as well as migraine prevention.\n\nThe CPM system, which is deficient in patients with migraine, has been shown to be abnormal in fibromyalgia patients as well, suggesting that fibromyalgia patients could potentially benefit from activating the CPM via REN. The current study aims to examine the safety and efficacy of REN technology, implemented via the FibroNova device for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain and related symptoms.\n\nThe FibroNova device\n\nThe device is a wireless wearable battery-operated stimulation unit controlled by a smartphone software application. Treatments with FibroNova are self-administered by the user. The FibroNova device includes several main components:\n\n* A pair of electrodes covered with hydrogel and a removeable protective film\n* An electronic circuitry and a battery contained in a plastic case\n* A software that includes firmware and a software application for mobile platforms\n* An armband to improve the adhesiveness and enable a discreet treatment\n\nThe study design A prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. The ratio between treatment and control groups will be 1:1, stratified by prior use of prescribed medications for FM (up to 2 vs. 3 or more). the following are considered as FM medications for the stratification: Dulloxetine, Pregabalin, Milnacipran, Amitriptyline.\n\nThe study will consist of two main phases and a voluntary open-label extension phase:\n\n4-week baseline phase- in which participants will report their symptoms daily via an electronic app diary (with no intervention);\n\n12-week intervention phase- in which eligible participants perform two treatments per day (using FibroNova/identical looking sham (placebo) device, according to randomization), and continue to report symptoms daily via the app.\n\n12-week open-label extension phase (OLE)- upon completion of the intervention phase, eligible participants will be offered to participate in an additional voluntary 12-week period in which they will receive active treatment."
