            "detailedDescription": "Replacing sedentary behaviors during leisure time with active video gaming (AVG) has been shown to be an enjoyable option for increasing the amount of physical activity acquired each week. A growing body of literature indicates that increases in energy expenditure can be achieved during AVG play in people with physical disabilities, including those with mobility impairments such as cerebral palsy (CP), spinal cord injury, stroke, and other neurological conditions. AVGs are particularly important for people with disabilities given the higher rate of inaccessible features in the built environment and the difficulty in finding activities they enjoy. Since AVG devices are relatively affordable, they also hold promise as a scalable product for promoting higher levels of physical activity and fitness among people with disabilities.\n\nThere continues to be a pressing need to make gaming controllers accessible to people who are unable to stand for long periods, cannot stand on a small platform due to poor balance or extreme obesity, or who are unable to stand and are full-time wheelchair users. The GAIMplank controller, was developed and tested for usability among people with mobility impairments. During usability testing, a sample of 21 adults were able to successfully access and play a series of standard PC video games using trunk/body movements to produce game play action. Using validated survey tools, participant usability scores and qualitative feedback indicated above average usability for the GAIMplank system. In addition, participants enjoyed the activity and reported game play as light to moderate intensity activity.\n\nThis project will examine the feasibility of an AVG intervention using the GAIMplank."
