The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the behavioral intervention feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress, insomnia, and nightmares?\n* What is the efficacy of efficient treatment vs. delayed treatment (2-4 week waitlist) in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress, insomnia, and nightmares?\n\nWe will beta test the intervention in 1-2 groups of 3-5 firefighters. Then we will randomize 50 participants to immediate or delayed (2-4 week waitlist) treatment. Consented participants will:\n\n* Complete self-report and interview measures assessing posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia (PTSD), and nightmares\n* Attend an individual treatment orientation session\n* Attend a 4-day (\\~3 hours per day over 4 consecutive days) group treatment that integrates WET, CBT-I, and CBT-N\n* Attend an individual booster session held approximately one week later\n* Complete self-report measures before, during, and after treatment, and at a 3-month follow up assessment and a clinical interview before and after treatment to assess program efficacy."
