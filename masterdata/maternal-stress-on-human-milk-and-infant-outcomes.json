            "detailedDescription": "During every two-week period, newly admitted preterm infants (\\<36 weeks gestational age) will be recruited at performance site OHSU NICU and block-randomized to either control (standard of care) or intervention (modified 8-week mindfulness-based intervention (with a focus on self-compassion; MBSC) group. The purpose of the nested cohorts is to minimize the postpartum time difference among cohort mothers. Each nested MBSC cohort will undergo the 8-week MBSC intervention with a focus on increasing self-compassion. The MBSC program includes previously developed daily mindfulness practices, guided meditations, routine mindfulness prompts, and four video conference group sessions with a certified mindfulness facilitator.\n\nMaternal data: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF) will be given to mothers from both groups pre- and post-intervention, and during the 4th week. Saliva, urine, stool, and human milk samples will be collected at the same time points as above. Additional maternal data include: age, race, height, weight (pre-pregnancy and last weight before delivery), parity, delivery mode, chorioamnionitis, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet) syndrome, antenatal antibiotics, anti-depressants or other mood-altering/neurochemical medications (current and during pregnancy), diagnosis of depression or other mental illness within the previous 5 years, history of postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and any inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.\n\nInfant data: Gestational age, birth weight, ventilation requirement, surgical interventions, patent ductus arteriosus, growth, nutrition prescriptions, saliva, urine and stool samples.\n\nData collection: All data (not including biosamples) will be collected using REDCap hosted within the UI system.\n\nSample measurements: Maternal salivary cortisol (marker of stress) and oxytocin (marker of anxiety and \"social-closeness\") concentrations will be measured using ELISA. Human milk proteins will be identified using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Following proteomic analyses, targeted proteins will be quantified using ELISA and Western Blot. Both maternal and infant saliva, urine and stool samples will be used for metabolomic and transcriptomic sequencing to identify metabolic and molecular changes, respectively, in both mothers and infants. Infant systemic oxidative stress will be measured through urine F2-isoprostanes concentrations (ELISA), and infant intestinal inflammation will be determined with stool calprotectin concentrations (ELISA)."
