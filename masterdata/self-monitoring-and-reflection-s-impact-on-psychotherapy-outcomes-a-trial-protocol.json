            "detailedDescription": "The quality of the therapeutic relationship is critical in determining psychotherapy outcomes. However, facilitating patients' self-awareness and reflection on their affective responses to their therapist remains understudied as a potential tool for enhancing this relationship and subsequent treatment outcomes. The primary objective of this study is to examine the influence of a brief post-session battery, designed to foster patient self-monitoring and reflection on their emotional reactions toward their psychotherapist, on the quality of the therapeutic relationship and treatment outcomes. Using an observational randomized control trial design, participants will be allocated into intervention and control groups. Those in the intervention group will complete a postsession battery following each therapy session, while the control group will only undergo regular treatment. Data collection will be facilitated through the Qualtrics online survey software and span baseline, mid-trial (5th week), and end-of-trial (10th week) assessments."
