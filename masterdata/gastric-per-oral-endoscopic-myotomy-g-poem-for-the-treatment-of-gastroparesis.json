This disease results in a multitude of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and malnutrition.\n\nCurrent treatments for gastroparesis include dietary changes, oral medications (prokinetic agents to enhance gastric motility, acid reducers, anti-emetics to reduce nausea and vomiting), gastric stimulators and rarely surgery.\n\nG-POEM (Gastric Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy-creating a cut in the muscle that controls gastric emptying), an incision-less (no cutting of the surface of the body) endoscopic procedure, is increasingly being performed to assist in the management of certain groups of patients with gastroparesis.\n\nThis data will be used for research purposes only to determine the clinical impact of endoscopic treatments on gastroparesis. The physicians will also be able to better understand the patient's condition and disease process that may lead to improved standard of care and improved patient management."
