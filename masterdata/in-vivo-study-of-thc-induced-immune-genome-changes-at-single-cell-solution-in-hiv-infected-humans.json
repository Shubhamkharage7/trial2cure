To test these hypotheses, the investigators propose defining the epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations at single cell resolution in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by administering THC to humans with and without HIV infection. The THC-associated epigenomic/transcriptomic alterations will be linked to genomic variants to understand the causal effects of THC response in immune cells."
