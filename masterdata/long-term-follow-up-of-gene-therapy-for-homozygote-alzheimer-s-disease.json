A secondary objective is to assess the biomarker as shown by the conversion of CSF APOE isoforms from APOE4 to APOE2-APOE4. Additional secondary outcomes include amyloid PET scan, CSF markers (including A\u03b242, A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio T--tau, and P-tau), and quantitative MRI (and other biomarkers that may be informative for this therapeutic approach). Other secondary objectives include instruments to assess cognitive and clinical AD and to evaluate if treatment with AAVrh.10hAPOE2 improves brain tau pathology with tau PET scan (LX1001-01 Cohort 3 only).",
