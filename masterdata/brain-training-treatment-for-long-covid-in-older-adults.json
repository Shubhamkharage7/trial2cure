            "briefSummary": "This research is being done to collect preliminary data on the potential of computerized \"brain-training\" exercises for treating Long COVID symptoms in older adults. The investigators hypothesize that computerized brain-training will be an acceptable and feasible intervention for treating Long COVID symptoms in older adults. The investigators also expect to provide initial evidence that computerized brain-training has potential for improving thinking, mood, and other aspects of everyday functioning in older adults with Long COVID.",
            "detailedDescription": "Some patients who contract coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially older adults, show lingering neuropsychiatric symptoms such as cognitive impairment, brain fog, and depression. These neuropsychiatric symptoms-commonly referred to under the umbrella term \"Long COVID\"-are debilitating and may last for months or even years after viral infection. The purpose of the present study is to help address this public health crisis by determining whether computerized \"brain-training\" treatment has potential for improving thinking, mood, and other aspects of functioning in older adults with Long COVID. More specifically, the first aim is to determine the acceptability and feasibility of using brain-training treatment in individuals with Long COVID. The second aim is to evaluate for potential efficacy by determining whether brain-training treatment appears to improve cognitive function, mood, and other aspects of daily functioning in Long COVID."
