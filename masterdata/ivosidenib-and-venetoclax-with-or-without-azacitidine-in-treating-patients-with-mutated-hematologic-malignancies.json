            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax and how well it works when given together with ivosidenib with or without azacitidine, in treating patients with IDH1-mutated hematologic malignancies. Venetoclax and ivosidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ivosidenib and venetoclax with azacitidine may work better in treating patients with hematologic malignancies compared to ivosidenib and venetoclax alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of ivosidenib with venetoclax, with or without the addition of azacitidine, in IDH1-mutated patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) including complete response (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), and partial response (PR) of the combination of ivosidenib and venetoclax, with or without the addition of azacitidine, in IDH1-mutated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of venetoclax and ivosidenib in combination in plasma samples (in Part 1b).\n\nII. To evaluate molecular and cellular biomarkers that may be predictive of antitumor activity and/or resistance to treatment including evaluation of 2HG, IDH1 VAF levels before, during and after treatment.\n\nIII. To determine time to event endpoints including duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) using multiparameter flow cytometry, cytogenetics and molecular evaluation.\n\nII. Evaluate global gene expression profiles, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation profiles, BH3 profiling and other potential prognostic markers to explore predictors of antitumor activity and/or resistance to treatment.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-14. Patients also receive ivosidenib PO daily on days 15-28 of cycle 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients may also receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then monthly for 3 years."
