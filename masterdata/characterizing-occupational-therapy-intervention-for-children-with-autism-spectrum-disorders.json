            "briefSummary": "This pilot study aims to identify behavioral and neural measures of sensory processing and attention associated with routine occupational therapy intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, the investigator will examine the impact of a child's level of engagement during therapy using standardized behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measures of sensory processing.",
            "detailedDescription": "Occupational therapy is one of the most frequently requested and highly utilized interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders (autism) and therapists have consistently reported using the sensory integration framework as a dominant theory guiding practice. A key component of sensory integration theory is the child's active engagement during therapy, which is assumed to improve neural function, behavior, and participation. However, no studies have examined the neural mechanisms associated with occupational therapy interventions among children with autism.\n\nThis pilot feasibility study will examine behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measures of attention and sensory processing before and following 6-8 weeks of routine occupational therapy at community outpatient centers among 30 children with autism aged 6 - 13 years. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility, sensitivity, and validity of EEG measures of auditory processing as a response biomarker following routine occupational therapy intervention. Another aim is to examine the contribution of a child's engagement during therapy as a key predictor of change using behavioral and EEG outcome measures. The occupational therapy intervention consists of one-hour weekly sessions of usual care at Nationwide Children's Hospital outpatient centers.\n\nResults from this grant will provide valuable proof-of-concept data establishing engagement during therapy as an active ingredient in occupational therapy intervention using neurophysiological and behavioral measures. These results will also establish the validity of EEG measures as sensitive to a child's level of engagement and neuroplastic changes following occupational therapy intervention."
