Investigators will also evaluate implementation outcomes to identify barriers and facilitators towards future implementation. Investigators hope to define best practices and optimize the delivery of smoking cessation interventions for people living with HIV.",
            "detailedDescription": "This hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial presents on opportunity to optimize tobacco treatment delivery for people living with HIV (PLWH), and identify barriers and facilitators towards future implementation. We are proposing a comparison of Treatment As Usual (TAU; reactive, opt-in tobacco treatment using standard clinical pathways) vs Proactive Outreach with Medication Opt-out for Tobacco Treatment Engagement (PrOMOTE). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation. The primary aim is to compare rates of cessation and quit attempts at the Week 12 follow-up between participants who received TAU versus PrOMOTE. As a secondary aim we will characterize key determinants of PrOMOTE reach, implementation fidelity, adherence, and acceptability. We hypothesize that the PrOMOTE intervention will increase cessation rates and number of quit attempts, and that it will result in greater reach and pharmacotherapy delivery compared to TAU. Key determinants of PrOMOTE implementation outcomes will also be characterized. An exploratory assessment of CD4 cell count and HIV viral load, in addition to durability of smoking cessation outcomes, will also be assessed. By optimizing the delivery of effective tobacco treatments for PLWH, we hope to increase the number of people receiving tobacco treatment, increase tobacco cessation rates, and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from smoking-related causes."
