The PI and his team will enroll approximately 25-30 Veterans. Veterans will be recruited via provider referral and via advertisements that will be placed in general clinical areas and desks at the Errera Center. The PI will work with the Veterans to create a detailed genogram of family, friends and other supporters in the Veteran's life. This will be followed by a meeting with each Veteran over the course of three 30-minute weekly sessions to help the Veteran identify and engage people listed in their genogram which the Veteran might want to form stronger relationships with. Veterans will also be asked to complete several measures and questionnaires such as housing information, employment, mental health and quality of life."
