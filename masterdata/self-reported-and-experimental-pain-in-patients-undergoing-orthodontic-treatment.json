PPT is considered an objective measurement tool to assess pain levels. Studies have assessed the difference in pain levels between clear aligners and fixed appliances using subjective pain scales. No study has utilized PPT to evaluate the difference in pain between aligners and fixed braces at different time points. This study will aim to compare the self- reported and experimental pain perception between the clear aligner and fixed appliance therapies during the phase of crown alignment and to assess how long pain is perceived in the following five days from the adjustment of the appliance."
