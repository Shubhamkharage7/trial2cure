Participants will be randomized to receive either e-cigarettes or nicotine pouches for a duration of 4 weeks and to 1 of 4 possible regulatory scenarios within products where flavor availability is either menthol and tobacco/unflavored available or tobacco/unflavored only available, and nicotine concentration is either higher (5% e-cig, 6mg pouch) or lower (2.4% e-cig, 3mg pouch). Participants will return for bi-weekly research visits (in person or remote videocall) to complete measures for study aims. Participants will complete a final follow-up at Week 6 to assess maintenance of cigarette reduction and willingness to continue using products once they are no longer provided. The investigators expect to observe which products and constituents lead to greater smoking reduction.",
