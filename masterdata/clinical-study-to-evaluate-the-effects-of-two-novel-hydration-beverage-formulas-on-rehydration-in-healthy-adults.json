Exercise regularly as per physical activity guidelines for Americans \\[structured exercise for a minimum of 150 cumulative minutes per week (low end) to 500 cumulative minutes of exercise per week (high-end)\\] and willing to maintain the same level of physical activity throughout the study period. Can maintain their exercise status at the beginning of the study throughout the study period. Can achieve a peak VO2 at screening that is at least 60% of their age and gender matched normative value per American College of Sports Medicine recommendations. Have normal or acceptable to the investigator vital signs (BP and HR) at screening. Individuals with childbearing potential: Agree to have urine pregnancy test performed on each trial day. Able to agree to the requirements and restrictions of this study, willing to give voluntary consent, able to understand and read the questionnaires, and carry out all study-related procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Female participants who are lactating, pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study. Carry a diagnosis of diabetes. Weigh less than or equal to 80 pounds at any visits. Answer \"yes\" to any of the questions asked on the screening questionnaire (Appendix 10.2.1).

Use any dietary supplements that may impact hydration status within the 30 days prior to the baseline visit (Familiarization Trial/Visit 2). Participants must observe a 30-day washout period of no supplementation to be eligible. Consume more than two standard alcoholic drinks per day. Use of inhalables, smokables, or the like (e.g., cigarettes, vaporizers, water pipes, or cannabis) within 30 days prior to the first dose of the study product or for the duration of the study.
