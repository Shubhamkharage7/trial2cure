            "briefSummary": "The P\u1d4cOPPY study is designed to support the American Heart Association's mission to improve maternal/infant health outcomes and address inequities in maternal/infant health care. The P3OPPY Project is one of five projects within the American Heart Association P3 EQUATE Network. The overarching goal of the P3 EQUATE American Heart Association Health Equity Research Network (HERN) is to promote equity in Maternal and Infant Health outcomes by identifying innovative and cost-effective strategies to enhance access to quality health information, care, and experiences during pregnancy, postnatal and postpartum/preconception periods, particularly for Black and under-served populations. Collectively, the investigators will collaborate with pregnant and postpartum individuals and their families, hospitals, and communities to discover ways to reduce racism and social problems that contribute to poor health outcomes. In this trial, 400 non-Hispanic Black participants will be randomized to see if 2 promising interventions (digital health interventions and community health workers) reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The aim of this trial is to assess whether an existing Digital Heath Intervention (DHI) and/or a Community Health Worker (CHW) Intervention will reduce adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. A 2 x 2 factorial randomized controlled trial of Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients living in high area deprivation index (ADI) communities will be conducted. Participants (n=400) will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of 4 arms: 1) standard prenatal care (PNC) alone, or 2) standard PNC plus DHI, or 3) standard PNC plus CHW, or 4) standard PNC, plus DHI and CHW.\n\nThe P\u1d4cOPPY study is designed to support the American Heart Association's mission to improve maternal/infant health outcomes and address inequities in maternal/infant health care. The promise of digital health and community health worker engagement makes P\u1d4cOPPY interventions potentially transformative, sustainable, and scalable for Non-Hispanic Black mothers and their infants from under-served communities in Alabama and beyond."
