Researchers will assess whether the social media intervention is feasible. In addition, the study team will also explore and compare changes in glucose levels and person-reported outcomes between the two groups.",

Strategies that improve adolescent diabetes self-management are needed. Social media offers new opportunities to provide diabetes education and peer support through communication in a digital environment.\n\nAs part of a randomized controlled trial, adolescent participants will be randomized to receive diabetes education and peer support over Instagram in addition to usual care or to standard outpatient diabetes care."
