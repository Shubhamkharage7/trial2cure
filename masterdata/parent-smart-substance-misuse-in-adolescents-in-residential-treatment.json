            "briefSummary": "Adolescents in residential substance use treatment have serious substance-related problems and poor outcomes following discharge: follow-up studies indicate that 60% of adolescents treated in residential treatment will relapse within the first 90 days. Parenting practices have been established as a critical predictor of adolescents' substance use outcomes and likelihood of relapse following treatments, but parents are notoriously difficult to engage in adolescent substance use treatment. Findings such as these provide strong justification for targeting parents of adolescents in residential substance use treatment via easily accessible interventions.\n\nThis study tests the effectiveness of a technology-assisted parenting intervention called Parent SMART (Substance Misuse among Adolescents in Residential Treatment). The intervention combines an off-the-shelf computer program that teaches parenting skills called Parenting Wisely, four telehealth coaching sessions, and a networking forum that allows parents to connect with a clinical expert and with other parents. The investigators will compare adolescents who receive standard residential substance use treatment to adolescents who receive the same treatment plus whose parents receive Parent SMART. Investigators will test the comparative effectiveness of Parent SMART versus residential treatment as usual on parental monitoring and communication, adolescent substance use (i.e., days of substance use and substance-related problems), and substance-related high-risk behaviors (i.e., school-related problems, criminal involvement, externalizing behavior). The investigators will also test whether improvements in parenting partially mediate any observed changes in adolescent substance use and other high-risk behaviors.",
            "detailedDescription": "Building upon a successful National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded R34, this study evaluates a technology-assisted parenting intervention with evidence of high feasibility and acceptability, as well as preliminary evidence of effectiveness as an adjunct to residential treatment as usual (TAU). Specifically, this study involves a fully powered evaluation of Parent SMART (Substance Misuse among Adolescents in Residential Treatment), which was developed based on extensive formative research with parents, adolescents, and residential treatment staff, and subsequently tested in a NIDA-funded pilot trial.\n\nParent SMART was intentionally designed with scalability in mind. It consists of an off-the-shelf computer program called Parenting Wisely (PW) that has robust evidence of efficacy in improving parenting skills and reducing youth behavior problems across five clinical trials. Guided by formative research, Parent SMART augments PW with four telehealth coaching sessions and access to a state-of-the-art, mobile networking forum (available via both mobile phone app and web browser), where parents can submit questions to an expert and connect with other parents of adolescents in residential substance use treatment. Parent SMART was piloted at both short (i.e., 6-10 day length of stay) - and long-term (i.e., 30-45 day length of stay) residential facilities: the model was feasible and acceptable in both settings, and effective at improving parental monitoring and communication in both settings. In the short-term setting, Parent SMART was also effective at reducing days of substance use (i.e., days of binge drinking, days of all other drug use) and reducing school problems: the pilot project was underpowered to detect differences at the long-term setting. The current trial is a fully powered evaluation of Parent SMART as an adjunct to residential treatment as usual.\n\nAdolescent-parent dyads (n = 220; 440 participants) will be randomized to receive either residential treatment as usual (TAU) only or Parent SMART + TAU. Those randomized to TAU will be offered the technology-delivered elements of Parent SMART at the 6-month follow-up. Parent SMART telehealth sessions will be delivered by bachelor's and master's level counselors to enhance scalability. Multi-method follow-up assessments (i.e., self-report measures, videotaped interaction task, urine screens) will be conducted 6-, 12-, and 24-weeks post-discharge.\n\nThe primary aims of this study is to examine the effectiveness of Parent SMART as an adjunctive treatment, relative to adolescent residential treatment-as-usual on: parenting processes (Primary Aim 1) and adolescent substance use outcomes (Primary Aim 2). A secondary aim is to test the effectiveness of Parent SMART compared to residential treatment-as-usual on adolescent high-risk behaviors. An additional Exploratory Aim will test whether change in parenting processes mediates change in adolescent substance use outcomes.\n\nPursuit of these aims is significant given the potential to improve the outcomes of adolescents following discharge from residential substance use treatment by offering their parents a novel technology-assisted intervention. Technology-assisted interventions have the potential for marked public health impact by extending the reach, duration, and scalability of evidence-based care."
