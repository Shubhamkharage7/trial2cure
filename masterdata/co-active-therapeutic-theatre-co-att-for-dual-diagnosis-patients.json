The study will also assess participants feelings and thoughts about the drama therapy intervention (such as whether or not they enjoyed it and if/how they found it helpful).\n\nThe drama therapy intervention will consist of one group drama therapy session per week, for a total of twelve weeks (i.e., total twelve sessions) followed by a single performance (with composition of the audience determined by unanimous agreement of the participants) of the dramatic work (script) produced by the participants during the course of the drama therapy intervention."
