            "detailedDescription": "Background\n\nOver the last decade, major advances have occurred in histiocytic disorders with the discovery of MAPK-ERK pathway mutations leading to targeted therapeutics using BRAF- and MEK-inhibitors. However, there is a lack of large studies informing the burden of morbidity and mortality among people with histiocytosis. Institutional studies in pediatric LCH suggest that survivors suffer from long-term impairment of health related quality of life, cognitive dysfunction, pituitary dysfunction, and hearing difficulties in 20-50% cases. Studies from the investigative team and others have also shown a high incidence of acute myeloid leukemia and other second primary malignancies in pediatric and adult LCH. Chronic medical conditions may arise as a function of the disease biology or due to cancer therapy, as seen in other hematologic malignancies.\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective cohort study aimed at determining the risk of chronic health conditions and cause-specific mortality in pediatric and adult patients with histiocytic disorders. The study will include patients from the Histiocytosis Association registry and other institutions including UAB (n\\~6000). The participants will complete a validated questionnaire capturing details of chronic health conditions, health related quality of life, cognitive/psychological function, and healthcare utilization.\n\nFuture directions\n\nThe results from our study will be instrumental in formulating follow-up guidelines for histiocytic disorders and developing targeted survivorship programs to improve overall outcomes."
