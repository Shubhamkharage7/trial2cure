HER2+ patients may preferably continue with their HER2 targeted treatment due to the availability of a 2L targeted treatment option, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan if they are still HER2 positive. Patients who do not have access to 2L targeted treatment and are still HER2+ are eligible as long they present with \u2265 10% CLDN18.2 positive TC in their tumor tissue.\n\n   Part C, Cohort 2: PDAC patients, that are treatment na\u00efve for their m/a disease and have no contra indication to receive Gemcitabine plus Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel).\n\n   Part D, Cohort 3: Patients with m/a GC/GEJ-C who have progressed under 1L or 2L SOC chemotherapy +/- ICI and are treatment na\u00efve to CLDN18.2 targeting agents. Patients who were initially HER2+ and have exhausted their HER2 targeted therapy or where trastuzumab deruxtecan is not available, are equally eligible to be enrolled into this cohort and do not require a fresh biopsy. Patients will receive PT886 combined with pembrolizumab.\n\n   Part D, Cohort 4: Patients with m/a HER2 negative GC/GEJ-C, that are treatment na\u00efve for their m/a disease.\n\n   Part D, Cohort 5: Patients with m/a GC/GEJ-C, that have progressed under 1L SOC chemotherapy, and zolbetuximab treatment, and are treatment na\u00efve to pembrolizumab or other ICI therapy for their m/a disease. Patients must present with \u2265 10% CLDN18.2 positive TC in their tumor cells following their zolbetuximab treatment.\n4. Biopsies:\n\n   Able to provide a formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample (preferably fresh biopsy or if not possible, archival tissue) to be assessed for CLDN18.2 expression and other biomarkers. Biopsy must be excisional, incisional, or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is insufficient. This biopsy may not be done if the biopsy poses a risk to the patient and/or per the Investigators discretion.\n   * Archival tissue can be used to assess the expression level of CLDN18.2 for all Parts. In Part D for Cohort 5, a newly acquired fresh biopsy may be requested unless a biopsy was taken after completion of zolbetuximab treatment.\n   * If the archival tissue is older than 12 months, we recommend a newly acquired fresh biopsy. For Parts C and D, willingness to have an on-treatment biopsy in patients that have stable disease or partial response at week 16, if deemed clinically feasible by the Investigator.\n5.

Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before starting study treatment in all pre-menopausal women, and women \\< 24 months after the onset of menopause (had a menstrual period in past 24 months) and are of childbearing potential (women who underwent hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy do not need a pregnancy test).\n9. Must agree to use effective contraceptive methods to avoid pregnancy (including male and female patients and partners of study patients) during the study and until at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n10. Life expectancy \\>3 months.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nPatients are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Women who are pregnant or lactating.\n2. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) who do not use adequate birth control.\n3. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n4. Condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to study treatment. Corticosteroids doses equivalent to Prednisone 10 mg per day or less are allowed (see Criteria 3 for exceptions), or a single application of up to 8 mg dexamethasone i.v. over 30 minutes prior to dosing the first two PT886 doses, in individual cases.\n5.
