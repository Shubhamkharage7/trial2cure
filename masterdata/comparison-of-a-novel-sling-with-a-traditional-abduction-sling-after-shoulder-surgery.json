            "detailedDescription": "Specific Aim I:\n\nTo determine if patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair prefer the traditional abduction sling vs the novel sling.\n\nSpecific Aim II:\n\nTo determine if patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty prefer the traditional abduction sling vs the novel sling.\n\nSpecific Aim III:\n\nTo determine if short term follow-up (2, 4, 6 weeks), subjective patient-reported outcomes are superior in patients utilizing the novel sling compared to patients utilizing the traditional, abduction sling.\n\nSpecific Aim IV:\n\nTo determine if longer term follow-up (6 weeks, 14 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months), validated patient-reported outcomes are similar (non-inferior) in patients utilizing the novel sling compared to a historical control cohort of patients that only utilized the traditional, abduction sling. The purpose of this aim is to ensure that patients that utilize the novel novel sling for 2 to 4 weeks (with the traditional sling used for the rest of the 6 week period) do not have inferior outcomes compared to patients that have worn the traditional sling for a total of 6 weeks."
