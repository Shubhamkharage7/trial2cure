The secondary objective is to determine the safety and adverse events of povidone-iodine compared to normal saline for irrigation in patients undergoing emergency laparotomies for CDC class 2 and 3 wounds.\n\nThe main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n* Does combined intraoperative wound irrigation with intraoperative peritoneal lavage with dilute aqueous povidone-iodine decrease surgical site infections?\n* Is combined intraoperative wound irrigation and intraoperative peritoneal lavage with dilute aqueous povidone-iodine safe to use compared to normal saline?\n* Are there any adverse effects of combined intraoperative wound irrigation and intraoperative peritoneal lavage with dilute aqueous povidone-iodine usage on CDC class 2 and 3 wounds compared to normal saline?\n\nSubjects will be followed over 18 months with follow-up of each patient up to 30 days postoperatively. Randomization of patients will occur prior to going to beginning the emergency laparotomy."
