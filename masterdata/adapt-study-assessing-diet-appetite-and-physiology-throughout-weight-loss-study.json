Each participant will complete 3 in-person study visits, then participate an a 6-month weight loss program delivered remotely. Some participants may be invited to complete 3 additional in-person visits. Study Visit activities include questionnaires, blood draws, brain MRIs, body measurement and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan for body composition measurement, a breathing test, and biopsies of muscle and fat tissue. Each participant will be provided a fitness tracker and body weight scale to use throughout the study."
