Single patient cohorts will be evaluated, the dose of APG-2575 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600mg and 800mg accordingly. If there is any one of the following event is observed, a DLT, two drug related Grade 2 toxicities or one drug related \u2265 Grade 3 toxicity, or laboratory or clinical TLS, or suspected hypersensitivity reaction occur in Cycle 1, or dose level of 400 mg is reached, the dose escalation will convert to the standard 3+3 design, If \u2265 2/6 patients develop DLT at any dose level dose escalation will cease and the dose level immediately below will be expanded to 6 patients. If \u2264 1/6 patients develop a DLT at the highest dose reached this will be declared the MTD. After the MTD is defined, a maximum of 20 patients will be treated at that dose level."
