            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of novobiocin in treating cancer patients with alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes. Novobiocin is an antibiotic that blocks the activity of a protein called DNA polymerase theta, which helps repair DNA that has become damaged as cells grow and divide. Cancer cells that cannot repair their damaged DNA die. This medication may help shrink or stabilize cancer with a mutation in DNA repair genes.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of novobiocin sodium (novobiocin) administered on a 5-days on/2-days off schedule in patients with solid tumors carrying homologous recombination (HR) or DNA damage repair (DDR) alterations that are poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor-na\u00efve or -resistant.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of novobiocin administered on a 5-days on/2-days off schedule in patients with solid tumors carrying HR or DDR alterations that are PARP inhibitor-na\u00efve or -resistant.\n\nIII. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of novobiocin administered on a 5-days on/2-days off schedule in patients with solid tumors carrying HR or DDR alterations that are PARP inhibitor- na\u00efve or -resistant.\n\nIV. To determine the minimally biologically effective dose of novobiocin in patients with solid tumors carrying HR or DDR alterations that are PARP inhibitor-naive or -resistant using pre- and on-treatment biopsies to characterize novobiocin-mediated pharmacodynamic effects.\n\nV. To conduct a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of novobiocin administered on a 5-days on/2-days off schedule.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of pre- and time-of-progression biopsies to characterize tumors for HR deficiency (deleterious mutations/deletions in genes known to be involved in HR) and genomic changes mediating acquired resistance to novobiocin.\n\nII. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) on pre- and on-treatment biopsies, as well as time-of-progression biopsies for serial analysis of gene expression to identify determinants of response, resistance, and pathway adaptation to novobiocin.\n\nIII. Correlation of baseline level of POLQ messenger (m)RNA with clinical outcome (complete response \\[CR\\], partial response \\[PR\\] or stable disease \\[SD\\] versus \\[vs.\\] progressive disease \\[PD\\]).\n\nIV. Correlation of ATM immunohistochemistry (IHC) with clinical outcome in patients with ATM-mutant cancers.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients receive novobiocin sodium orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 5 days in a row followed by 2 days off each week. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo a tumor biopsy at baseline, on day 15 of cycle 1, and at time of progression. Patients undergo medical imaging scans at baseline and every 8 weeks. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years."

Patients with alterations defined only by germline testing are eligible\n* Any number of prior therapy regimens is allowed.\n* Patients with cancers for which PARP inhibitors have been approved as standard-of-care must have received a PARP inhibitor prior to enrollment on this study. Other patients may be either PARP inhibitor-na\u00efve (i.e., never have received a PARP inhibitor) or have disease that is PARP inhibitor-resistant (i.e., disease that has progressed radiologically based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 while receiving any PARP inhibitor)\n* Age \\>=18 years.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression, stable and off steroids for 1 month\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the patient is asymptomatic and the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients should be New York Heart Association Functional Classification of class 2B or better\n* Patients must have tumors amenable to biopsies, and be willing to undergo biopsies at two time points (pre- and on-treatment)\n* The effects of novobiocin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because polymerase theta (POLtheta) inhibitor agents have the potential to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and 4 months after completion of novobiocin administration. Effective contraception is defined as a method that achieves a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. (Note: Because of a concern for decreased effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral agents when given with novobiocin, barrier methods and abstinence are the preferred methods for contraception). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1) with the exception of alopecia\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to novobiocin\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 are ineligible. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are known to be substrates of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) and/or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1) and/or organic anion transporters (OAT1 and OAT3) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients using herbal/dietary supplements with known hepatotoxicity risk are ineligible\n* Patients receiving concurrent medications associated with a risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes are not allowed within 14 days of initiation of study treatment. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated medical reference such as CredibleMeds or Lexicomp. Drugs listed in the \"drugs to avoid in CLQTS (congenital long QT syndrome)\" and \"known risk of TdP (torsade de pointes)\" should be excluded. Granisetron is an acceptable antiemetic on this study. If a patient must take ondansetron, they may NOT take any other concomitant agents which might impact their QTc.\n* Patients must have UGT1A1 testing at screening. Patients homozygous or heterozygous for A(TA)7TAA in the promoter region, or homozygous or heterozygous for the G71R allele (also known as UGT1A1\\*6) are excluded (i.e., patients with Gilbert syndrome or Gilbert carriers) as they are at risk for further reduction of UGT1A1 activity that may disrupt bilirubin clearance\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness. Additionally, patients with acute liver disease, poorly controlled liver disease, or cirrhosis are excluded\n* Patients with (known) active or poorly controlled alcohol use disorder are excluded\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because novobiocin is a POLtheta inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with novobiocin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with novobiocin",
