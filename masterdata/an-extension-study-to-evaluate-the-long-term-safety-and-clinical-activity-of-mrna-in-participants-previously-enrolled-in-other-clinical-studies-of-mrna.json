The study will include 2 periods: 1) Treatment Period and 2) Follow-up Period (up to 2 years after the last dose of study drug).\n\nTreatment Period will continue unless one of the following occurs: mRNA-3705 receives marketing approval and reimbursement in the country of origin of the participant (following market approval and access being in place, all participants who wish to continue treatment will be offered mRNA-3705 through market access, with the intent to prevent treatment interruption. Safety monitoring will be performed for all participants under treatment per market access requirements), the participant discontinues study drug, the participant is no longer receiving clinical benefit (in the opinion of the Investigator), or Sponsor discontinues the development of mRNA-3705."
