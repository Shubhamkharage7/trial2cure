Phase 1b will evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activity of MBRC-101 at potential OBRDs. Phase 1 and Phase 1b will both characterize single and multiple-dose PK profiles and evaluate incidence and persistence of anti-MBRC-101 Ab.",
            "detailedDescription": "Phase 1, dose escalation, will enroll approximately 30 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. EphA5 expression will not be required for enrollment into Phase 1 but will be assessed retrospectively.\n\nPhase1b, the dose expansion phase will evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activity of MBRC-101 at potential OBRDs and dosing regimens in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. Phase 1b will enroll 3 expansion cohorts of \u2248 20 patients per cohort (n \u2248 60 total).\n\nSafety will be monitored by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) at each dose escalation in Phase 1 and at regular intervals throughout Phase 1b.\n\nOverall Response Rate (ORR), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Response Rate (RR), Overall Survival (OS), Disease Control Rate (DCR), and Complete and Partial response (CR and PR) will be used to evaluate efficacy per RECIST v1.1 criteria based on the results of positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans."
