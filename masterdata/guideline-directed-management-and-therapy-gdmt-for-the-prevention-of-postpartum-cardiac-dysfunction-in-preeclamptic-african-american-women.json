            "briefSummary": "This is a single-center, open-label pilot study looking at how Guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMP) in post-partum women with preeclampsia can improve Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS).",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is looking at when given GDMP in post-partum women with preeclampsia, compared to the current standard of care, can this therapy improve Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) at 9 months. Subjects who agree to participate and who have already completed the PARENT study (NCT04479072) at 6-months will be randomized in this study to either the GDMP (Treatment) arm or the standard of care (Observational) arm. Subjects that agree to participate in the extension part of the study, will add on an additional 3 months.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to mechanistically determine the effect of GDMT administered at six months postpartum on GLS at nine months postpartum in African- American patients at high risk due to elevated blood pressures (\\>120/80 mmHg).\n\nThe trial biostatistician will create the randomization schedules using computer-generated random numbers and will have access to treatment group allocation. Below are further details on each arm.\n\nTreatment Arm: Subjects randomized into the treatment arm will be enrolled into the remote patient monitoring program (RPM). Subjects who enroll in the sub-study will utilize the RPM by the University of Chicago Heart Failure Program. This program enables providers to track the number of critical vitals in real time. Patients are equipped and trained to monitor blood pressure, heart rate, weight, temperature, and medication adherence, through a Bluetooth-enabled tablet that integrates and transmits data to the clinic providers and advanced practitioners. This system is currently in use by the heart failure program at the University of Chicago, including hospital-to-home transition care after hospitalization for decompensated heart failure and long-term outpatient management of chronic heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease. The heart failure team will provide the tablet, blood pressure cuff, weight scale and training at the subjects baseline visit.\n\nObservational Arm: Subjects randomized to this arm will receive the standard of care based upon the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines, which include counseling of increased cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and risk factor intervention as determined by the primary care physician. They will not be receiving the RPM program equipment.\n\nFollow-up clinic visit approximately 3 months after they have been randomized will be scheduled in both arms. At this visit the study team will;\n\nPerform a Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) Obtain Vital signs Physical Exam Adverse Event check Concomitant Medication check Blood draw for laboratory test\n\nIn addition, the study team will conduct monthly telephone interviews of all randomized trial participant's for concomitant medications, adverse events/side effects, and study drug compliance."
