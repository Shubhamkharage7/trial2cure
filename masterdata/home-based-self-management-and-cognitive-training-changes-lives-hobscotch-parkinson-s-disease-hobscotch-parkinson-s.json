Can the current HOBSCOTCH program be adapted for people with PD?\n2. Will people with PD experience improved quality of life similar to that found in people with epilepsy after participating in the HOBSCOTCH program?\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* attend nine, one-hour virtual (online and/or by telephone) HOBSCOTCH-PD sessions with a one-on-one certified HOBSCOTCH-PD coach\n* complete a brief clinical questionnaire about their diagnosis of PD\n* complete two questionnaires before and after the HOBSCOTCH-PD sessions about their quality of life and about memory and thinking processes\n* keep a short daily diary about their PD symptoms and use of the self-management strategies taught in the HOBSCOTCH-PD program\n* complete a brief Satisfaction Survey after the entire HOBSCOTCH-PD program"
