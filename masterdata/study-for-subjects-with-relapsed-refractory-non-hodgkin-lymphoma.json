The initial 3 subjects will be sequentially enrolled in a staggered fashion, with a 7 day interval between each subject to enable the capture and monitoring of any acute and subacute toxicities.\n\nSubjects in both cohorts will initially receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by a single 4 week cycle of the CD19 t haNK single-agent regimen.
