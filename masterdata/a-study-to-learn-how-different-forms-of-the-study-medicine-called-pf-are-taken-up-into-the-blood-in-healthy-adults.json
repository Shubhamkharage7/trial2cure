The participants may receive different tablets by mouth for PF-06954522.\n\nThe study will compare experiences of people receiving three different products of PF-06954522. This will help understand how much PF-06954522 is taken up into the blood for each product given.\n\nParticipants will take part into the study for about 77 days. During this time participants will have to stay onsite for 21 days. There will be one follow up (by telephone) study visit."
