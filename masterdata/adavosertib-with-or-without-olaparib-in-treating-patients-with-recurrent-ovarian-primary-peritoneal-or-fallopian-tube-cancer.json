            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well adavosertib with or without olaparib work in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back (recurrent). Adavosertib and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) of adavosertib (AZD1775) alone or in combination with olaparib in women with recurrent ovarian cancer in whom progression has been documented following poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of AZD1775 alone or in combination with olaparib in this population.\n\nII. To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) = overall response rate (ORR) plus stable disease rate for 16 weeks.\n\nIII. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of this population following AZD1775 alone or in combination with olaparib.\n\nIV. To evaluate the duration of response by RECIST version (v)1.1.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of each arm by BRCA-mutation status (BRCA-mt) and homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair deficiencies (HRD).\n\nII. To describe endogenous and dynamic markers of DNA damage response in tumor tissue and circulating surrogates, such as circulating tumor cells (CTC), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), exosomes (cellular/nuclear), cell cycle kinetics (CDKs), and immunophenotype.\n\nIII. To examine genomic alterations associated with response and mechanisms of resistance to olaparib and/or AZD1775.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. If enrollment pauses for 1 arm, patients will be assigned to the enrolling arm. Study has a new arm 3 and enrolling patients.\n\nARM I: Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and adavosertib PO QD on days 1-3 and 8-10. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nArm III: Patient receive ceralasertib tablets by PO BID each day on Days 1-14. You will also take olaparib tablets by PO BID each day on Days 1-28.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and periodically afterwards."

Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration (study enrollment). Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted.\n   3. Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including any systemic immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to first dose of study drug (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C).\n\n   Cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal or non-hormonal targeted therapy within 21 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 is not permitted (a duration of 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) is required for patients treated with non-cytotoxic drugs). The minimum washout period for immunotherapy is 42 days. Palliative radiotherapy must have been completed 21or more days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment). The patient can receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone metastases, before and during the study as long as these were started at least 5 days prior to the study treatment.

Note: Patient may not have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or be receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Patient has refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or previous significant bowel resection, with clinically significant sequelae that would preclude adequate absorption of the study medication.\n5. Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. Patients with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are eligible provided they meet all of the following criteria: disease outside the CNS is present, no clinical evidence of progression since completion of CNS-directed therapy, minimum 3 weeks between completion of radiotherapy and Cycle 1 Day 1 and recovery from significant (Grade \u2265 3) acute toxicity with no ongoing requirement for \\>10 mg of prednisolone per day or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroid.
