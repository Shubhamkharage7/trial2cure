Twenty women who have planned or received conventional breast MRI imaging at UNC Hospitals will be recruited for the study. Participants will be scanned with the DBT system after the administration of iodinated contrast agent. Images will be acquired prior to the administration of contrast, followed by at approximately 2 minutes and 5 minutes. For the purposes of this study, imaging will focus on a single breast to simplify data acquisition."
