The first of two participant types in the study are the Patient Study Participants (PSPs) will refer to individuals who are enrolled in the study and who will receive commercially available CAB PrEP via prescription from the PrEP provider. The second are Staff Study Participants (SSPs) who are site staff involved in the administrative and clinical aspects of offering and administering PrEP to PSPs at the clinical site."
