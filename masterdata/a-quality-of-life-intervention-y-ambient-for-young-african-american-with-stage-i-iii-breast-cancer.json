Y-AMBIENT is a four-month, telephone-based intervention that includes three themed education sessions with three follow-up sessions, written materials, and videos. The Y-AMBIENT intervention may improve quality of life and other health-related outcomes in young African American breast cancer survivors.",

Explore the degree to which the Y-AMBIENT versus (vs.) enhanced usual care affects preliminary health-related outcomes among young African American (AA survivors).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (Y-AMBIENT): Patients receive three themed education sessions over 1 hour each, written materials, and videos at month 1. Patients also participate in 3, 20 minutes telephone reinforcement calls to discuss how they are doing and discuss any concerns that they are still managing at months 2, 3, and 4.\n\nARM II (ENHANCED USUAL CARE): Patients receive usual care at month 1. Patients also participate in 3, 20 minutes telephone reinforcement calls to discuss their chemotherapy regimen at months 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month."
