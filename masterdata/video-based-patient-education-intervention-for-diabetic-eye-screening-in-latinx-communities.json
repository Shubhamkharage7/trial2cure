            "detailedDescription": "3 Latinx patients with diabetes and 3 Latinx clinicians will be recruited to videotape testimonials regarding the importance of diabetic eye screening and teleophthalmology use from their personal experiences. The investigators will structure the testimonials as a series of responses to a brief set of interview questions, or prompts, designed to elicit key messages previously identified by our community stakeholders as being particularly important, based on our prior studies and those of others and conducted in Spanish (with English subtitles).\n\nAfter the Latinx patient and clinician video testimonials are recorded, a community outreach specialist bilingual in Spanish and English will facilitate a series of 4 community stakeholder meetings (90 min. each) to develop the culturally-adapted, video-based patient education intervention to increase diabetic eye screening and teleophthalmology use among Latinos.\n\nAfter patient education videos are developed, an online survey will be conducted (n=1500) to test 3 versions of the video-based patient education intervention: (1) patient + clinician combined testimonials, (2) patient testimonials only, (3) clinician testimonials only, and compare them to 2 control conditions: (1) a standard educational video, publicly available online from the National Eye Institute, and (2) pre-video questionnaire-only control in a mixed-effects randomized design with pre- and post-measures (video conditions treated as the between-subjects factor).\n\nFinally, a community outreach specialist bilingual in Spanish and English will facilitate focus groups (60-90 minutes) in the participants' preferred language (participants will be grouped based on their preference for either Spanish or English). Focus groups will begin by having each participant complete a brief survey instrument that will be read aloud and adapted from validated survey instruments for eye health literacy and trust in healthcare (CADEES and T-HCT scale). Participants will then silently view the video-based, patient education intervention (patient + clinician combined version). Afterwards, they will complete the same brief survey instrument to obtain a pre-/post-comparison of any differences in their responses that may result from viewing the video intervention.\n\nTogether with the online survey results, the investigators will test the intervention's ability to increase eye health literacy and trust in healthcare for obtaining eye care."
