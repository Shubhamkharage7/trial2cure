The Registry will include up to 20 centers in the US and up to 200 patients for the initial evaluation.\n\nThe FDA-approved Tula System includes the Tula Iontophoresis System (IPS) with TYMBION\u2122 otic anesthetic for local anesthesia of the ear drum and the Tula Tube Delivery System (TDS) for ear tube placement. Clinical research established the safety, efficacy and tolerability of this system for in-office procedures in the pediatric population. Patients will be treated and evaluated according to standard medical care. Outcome data is collected up to 6 months following extrusion or removal of their tube(s)."
