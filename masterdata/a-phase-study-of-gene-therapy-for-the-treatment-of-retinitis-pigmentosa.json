RHO arm will only enroll participants with confirmed genetic diagnosis of mutation in RHO gene; whereas Gene Agnostic arm will enroll RP Participants based on clinical diagnosis of RP and a confirmed genetic diagnosis with a gene associated with RP.\n\nSubjects in each arm will be randomized into treatment (N=50) and control groups (N=25). Subjects in the treatment group will receive a sequential, bilateral sub-retinal injection of OCU400 if both eyes meet inclusion criteria. Control or untreated group subjects will receive OCU400 subretinal injection after completion of 12-month follow-up."
