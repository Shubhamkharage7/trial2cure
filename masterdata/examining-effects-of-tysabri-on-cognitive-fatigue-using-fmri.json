Cognitive fatigue is the kind of fatigue that occurs after intense mental concentration as after a session of problem solving.",

The researchers will investigate the effects on the cognitive fatigue that develops during the performance of a demanding task and also on how cognitive fatigue changes as a function of duration of treatment."
