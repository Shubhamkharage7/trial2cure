            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered CD19-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in treating patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. CAR T cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, CD19, on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. ICV is an injection technique that delivers the CD19-CAR T cells directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (which flows in and around the hollow spaces of the brain and spinal cord, and the thin layers of tissue that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord) in the brain, through a surgically placed catheter. Giving CD19-CAR T cells ICV may be more effective at treating patients with primary CNS lymphoma than giving them via other methods.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Examine and describe the safety and feasibility of ICV delivery of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T-lymphocytes (CD19-CAR T cells) and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in participants with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nII. Determine the activity of ICV-delivered CD19-CAR T cells based on disease response at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\n\nSECONDAY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Describe persistence, expansion and phenotype of endogenous and CD19-CAR T cells in peripheral blood (PB), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), when available.\n\nII. Describe cytokine levels (PB, CSF) over study period. III. Quantify B-cell aplasia over the treatment period as a surrogate for targeted cytotoxicity in the periphery.\n\nIV. Assess prolonged cytopenia based on prolonged grade 4 continuous or intermittent anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia \\> 60 days or deemed medically significant.\n\nV. Estimate rates of disease response. VI Estimate rate of 6-month progression free survival (PFS6mon). VII. Estimate median overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Characterize changes in potential molecular and gene-analysis based indicators of neurotoxicity in CSF and PB.\n\nII. Describe the tumor phenotype pre- and post-therapy. III. Characterize functional and phenotypic metabolic profile of CAR T cells pre- and post-infusion.\n\nIV. Assess the presence and magnitude of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients may undergo catheterization, undergo leukapheresis, may receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) and cyclophosphamide IV, and receive CD19-CAR T cells ICV on study. Patients also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), collection of blood samples, and CSF aspiration throughout the trial, and lumbar puncture as clinically indicated."

However, the research participant can proceed with lymphodepletion (if applicable) and CAR T cell infusion only after the translated full consent form is signed\n* Agreement to allow the use of archival tissue from diagnostic tumor biopsies. If unavailable exceptions may be granted with study principal investigator (PI) approval\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 2\n* Documented primary CNS lymphoma. Progression must be determined radiographically. Participant must have measurable disease which could be a measurable lymphomatous mass or, in the case of leptomeningeal only disease, measurable lymphoma cells in CSF by flow cytometry\n* Documented current CD19+ tumor expression if prior CD19 directed therapy was used\n* Participant must have received and failed or have been intolerant to CNS directed therapy like high dose methotrexate or high dose cytarabine based regimens.

HBV monitoring should last until 12 months after last dose of study drug. Any subject with a rising viral load (above lower limit of detection) should discontinue study drug and have antiviral therapy instituted and a consultation with a physician with expertise in managing hepatitis B. Subjects who are core antibody (Ab) positive at study enrollment are strongly recommended to start Entecavir before start and until completion of study treatment\n  * Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded\n* Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* Active significant bacterial, fungal or viral (other than those listed) infections\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
