Eligible patients undergoing repair of a large unrestrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD), a partial or complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), or an ostium primum atrial septal defect (primum ASD) will be eligible for enrollment.\n\nEach enrolled patient will be randomized to receive either L citrulline or placebo throughout all administrations in the study. Patients will receive:\n\n1. an L-citrulline bolus of 150 mg/kg or placebo at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass\n2. the addition L-citrulline or placebo to maintain a steady state target concentration of approximately 100 \u03bcmol/L of L-Citrulline or placebo during cardiopulmonary bypass\n3. an L-citrulline bolus of 10 mg/kg or placebo 30 minutes after decannulation from cardiopulmonary bypass, followed immediately by a 9 mg/kg/hour continuous L-citrulline infusion or placebo for up to 48 hours post-first dose. The infusion rate will be adjusted (up or down titration of drug infusion) to achieve a target steady state concentration of 100 \u00b5mol/L.\n\nThe study drug or placebo infusion will be discontinued once invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is discontinued or at 48 hours, whichever occurs first. Patients will be followed until Day 28 or discharge from the hospital, whichever occurs first. For patients discharged prior to Day 28, a final assessment via telephone will be conducted at Day 28."
