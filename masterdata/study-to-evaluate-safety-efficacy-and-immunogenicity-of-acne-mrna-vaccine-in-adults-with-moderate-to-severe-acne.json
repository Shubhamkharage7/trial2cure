            "detailedDescription": "Acne vulgaris (acne) is a highly prevalent inflammatory skin disease, especially in adolescents and young adults. Acne is estimated to affect 231 million people worldwide, therefore being one of the most prevalent diseases globally. Acne is also one of the top causes of years lived with disability and nonfatal disease burden. Despite being one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, the mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over the past 30 years. To date there is still no effective treatment that can prevent and cure this disease.\n\nThe aim of this first-in-human (FIH), Phase I/II trial is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the Acne mRNA vaccine candidate at three different dose levels in adults aged 18 to 45 years with moderate to severe acne. The study is designed to assess the safety profile and efficacy (also long-term) of the vaccine candidate, select the dose for the further clinical development steps and to describe the immunogenicity profile of the vaccine."
