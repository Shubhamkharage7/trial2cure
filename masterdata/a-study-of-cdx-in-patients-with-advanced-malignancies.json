The dose-escalation part of the study will test the safety profile of CDX-585 and determine which dose of CDX-585 will be studied in the expansion portions of the study.\n\nApproximately 130 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.\n\nThe expansion portion of the study will further evaluate the safety of CDX-585 in selected tumor types at the dose level chosen during the escalation part of the study."
