            "briefSummary": "Current forms of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for hypotension and orthostatic hypotension (OH) remain inadequate during acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) following a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). A critical need exists for the identification of safe, practical, and effective treatment options that stabilize blood pressure (BP) after traumatic SCI. Recent published evidence suggests that transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (TSCS) can be used to raise seated BP, and mitigate the falls in BP during orthostatic repositioning in individuals with chronic SCI. This site-specific project will focus on the use of TSCS to stabilizing seated BP and mitigate the fall in BP during orthostatic repositioning during AIR following traumatic SCI.",
            "detailedDescription": "Based on available evidence, TSCS may have advantages over current pharmacological approaches to the treatment of hypotension and OH: (1) does not exacerbate polypharmacy, (2) can be activated/deactivated rapidly, and (3) can be applied in synergy with physical exercise. TSCS represents an alternate approach to epidural SCS, with far greater potential to reach large numbers of individuals, thus providing for a greater likelihood of clinical implementation with fewer risk. We are asking several key questions: (1) what are the effects of TSCS on seated BP and BP changes during an orthostatic challenge, (2) is the application of TSCS during AIR tolerable based on pain reporting, (3) is there evidence of superficial burns to the skin near the site of cathode or anode placement, and (4) are the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance reduced with TSCS? To facilitate adoption of TSCS for widespread clinical use, we have designed a spatial-temporal mapping and parameter configuration approach that will result in a key deliverable for SCI care: a standard, easy to follow algorithm that will maximize individual benefits of spinal neuromodulation, while minimizing the burden on healthcare professionals. This project will provide the foundational evidence to support the feasible and safe application of TSCS for widespread clinical utility in the newly injured SCI population, thereby overcoming barriers to engagement in prescribed AIR regimens that are imposed by autonomic nervous system dysfunction."
