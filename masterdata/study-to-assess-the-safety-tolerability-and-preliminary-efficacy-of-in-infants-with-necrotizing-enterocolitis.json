            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of two dose levels (0.5 mL/kg and 1.0 mL/kg) of once daily (QD) via IV route of administration of ST266 in treating patients with Bell's stage IIA or higher medical NEC by incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs, with a secondary objective to assess preliminary efficacy of the same two dose levels (0.5 mL/kg and 1.0 mL/kg) of QD via IV route of administration of ST266 in treating patients with Bell's stage IIA or higher medical NEC.",
            "detailedDescription": "This Phase 1-2 clinical trial is a randomized, controlled, open-label study using a sequential cohort design. Assignment to cohorts will be based on the following dosages and weight ranges: 0.5 mL/kg and 1.0 mL/kg; weight \u22651000 g and \u22643000 g, and weight \u2265800 g and \u2264999 g.\n\nIn each cohort, patients will be randomized to either ST266 + SOC or SOC alone. The first 3 patients randomized to ST266 will be staggered, where each patient must complete their 10 day treatment cycle and 1 month follow up visit and be evaluated by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), before dosing of the next patient occurs. Patients randomized to SOC alone will follow the treatment plan as dictated by the Investigator or licensed medical designee and will be evaluated for the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and selected endpoints for analysis. If for any reason a patient is withdrawn, the decision for replacement will be determined by the DSMB.\n\nDosing for the next cohort will occur after review of safety data up to and including Day 28/1 Month from all patients in the previous cohort. The DSMB reviews will include comprehensive safety data analysis of data available at that time."
