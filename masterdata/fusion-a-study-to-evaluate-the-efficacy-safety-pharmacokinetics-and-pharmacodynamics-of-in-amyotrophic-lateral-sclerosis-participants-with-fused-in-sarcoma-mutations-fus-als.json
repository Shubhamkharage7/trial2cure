Upright (sitting position) slow vital capacity (SVC) is \u2265 50% of predicted value (as adjusted for sex, age, and height) OR if SVC is \\< 50% of predicted value, must be 10 to 30 years of age (inclusive) at the time of informed consent AND had ALS symptom onset within 12 months before the time of informed consent.\n4. Participants taking edaravone, riluzole, Relyvrio (sodium phenylbutyrate/taurursodiol combination, called Albrioza in Canada), sodium phenylbutyrate, or tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, also known as taurursodiol or urosodiol) must be on a stable dose for \u2265 28 days prior to Day 1, and willing to continue on that dose throughout the duration of the study, unless the Investigator determines that it should be discontinued for medical reasons, in which case it may not be restarted during the study.\n5. Stable concomitant medications and nutritional support for at least 1 month prior to Study Day 1. Concomitant medications or nutritional support that have not been stable for at least 1 month prior to Study Day 1 may be allowed in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee.\n6.

Any known genetic variant (other than those in the FUS gene) that is pathogenic or likely to be pathogenic for the ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum of disease.\n3. Positive test result for:\n\n   1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n   2. Hepatitis C (HCV), unless previously treated and has been serum/plasma HCV RNA negative for at least 6 months after the end of treatment\n   3.

Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure \\[BP\\] \\> 160/100 millimeters of mercury \\[mm Hg\\]).\n6. Malignancy within 1 year before Screening, except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been successfully treated. Participants with a history of other malignancies that have been treated with curative intent and which have not recurred within 6 months may also be eligible per Investigator judgement.\n7. Obstructive hydrocephalus\n8. Known significant brain or spinal disease that would interfere with the lumbar puncture (LP) process, CSF circulation or safety assessment, including tumors or abnormalities by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography, subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggestion of raised intracranial pressure on MRI or ophthalmic examination, spinal stenosis or curvature, Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, tethered spinal cord syndrome and connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome.\n9. Concurrent participation in any other interventional clinical study.\n10. Previous or current treatment with an oligonucleotide (including small interfering RNA \\[siRNA\\], tofersen). This exclusion criterion does not apply to COVID-19 vaccinations, which are allowed.\n11. Treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent, or device within 1 month before Screening, or 5 half-lives of investigational agent, whichever is longer.\n12. History of gene therapy or cell transplantation or any other experimental brain surgery.\n13. Anticipated need, in the opinion of the Investigator, for administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication that cannot be safely paused before and/or after an LP procedure according to local or institutional guidelines and/or Investigator determination after consultation with the appropriate treating physician. Low-dose aspirin (\u2264 100 mg/day, administered as monotherapy) is permitted and may be continued through the LP procedure.\n14.
