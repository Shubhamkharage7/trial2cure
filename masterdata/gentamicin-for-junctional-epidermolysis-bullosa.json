            "briefSummary": "Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB), an incurable, fatal, inherited skin disease, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the LAMA3, LAMB3 or LAMC2 genes, resulting in loss of laminin 332 and poor epidermal-dermal adherence. Eighty percent of H-JEB patients have LAMB3 mutations and about 95% of these are nonsense mutations. The investigators recently demonstrated that gentamicin readily induced nonsense mutation readthrough and produced full-length laminin beta3 in several nonsense mutations tested. Importantly, the gentamicin-induced laminin beta3 restored laminin 332 assembly, secretion, and deposition into the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). Newly induced laminin 332 reversed abnormal H-JEB cellular phenotypes. Herein, the investigators propose the first clinical trial of gentamicin (by topical and intravenous administration) in JEB patients with nonsense mutations. The milestones will include restored laminin 332 and hemidesmosomes at the DEJ, improved wound closure, and the absence of significant gentamicin side effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "Three subjects (adults and children of any age) will receive topical gentamicin to be applied to select skin sites.\n\nThree subjects (adults and children of any age) will receive intravenous (IV) gentamicin infusions.\n\nPatients will be assessed for Primary and Secondary endpoints during follow up visits."
