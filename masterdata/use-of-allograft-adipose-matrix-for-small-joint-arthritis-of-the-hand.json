            "briefSummary": "The purpose the research is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of injection of adipose allograft matrix (AAM) to the small joints of the hand for treatment of early stage osteoarthritis. The hypothesis is that use of AAM injected directly into the joint will show improvements in pain and disability while providing a safe, off-the-shelf alternative which can obviate the need for, and risks associated with, current treatment options with autologous fat transfer.\n\nAs standard of care, routine strength, pain scale scores (VAS) and range of motion will be recorded, a baseline disability survey (DASH score) will also be administered. After these have all been recorded and administered in a separate visit the patient will undergo the lipofilling procedure.\n\nThe subject population will include patients over the age of 18 who present with joint pain of the hand with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators central hypothesis is that use of AAM injected directly into the joint will show improvements in pain and disability while providing a safe, off-the-shelf alternative which can obviate the need for, and risks associated with, current treatment options. The overall aim of the project is to validate the clinical use of AAM for the treatment of early-stage osteoarthritis of the hand in adult patients (\\>18 years of age). The specific aims for this project are:\n\n1. To determine the safety of use of Leneva as a lipofilling alternative to autologous fat grafting for arthritis of the hand\n\n   a. To determine safety, the investigators will evaluate for any adverse reactions to the injection at each of the follow up time-points\n2. To determine the efficacy of the technique as measured by clinical outcomes in terms of pain, disability, range of motion and strength\n\n   a. To determine efficacy, the investigators will measure visual analogue pain scale scores as measures by visual analogue scale, disability scores as measured with DASH scores, and standardized range of motion and strengths scores as measured by the same study administrator at each of the follow up time points\n3. To determine patient satisfaction with the procedure a. To determine patient satisfaction, the investigators will administer a survey at each of the follow up time points"
