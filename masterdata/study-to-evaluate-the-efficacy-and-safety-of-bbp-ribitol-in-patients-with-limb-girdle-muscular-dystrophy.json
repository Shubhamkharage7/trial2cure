Willing and able to complete all study procedures, including biopsies, according to the Schedule of Assessments (see Appendix 1).\n\nParticipants must not meet any of the following criteria to be enrolled:\n\n1. Evidence of clinically significant concomitant disease, including:\n\n   1. Any significant concomitant medical condition, including mental, cardiac, renal, pulmonary, hepatic, or endocrine disease other than that associated with LGMD2I/R9.\n   2.

Any other laboratory, vital sign, ECG abnormality, clinical history, or finding that, in the Investigator's opinion, is likely to unfavorably alter the risk-benefit of study participation, confound study results, or interfere with study conduct or compliance.\n   4. Surgery for scoliosis or other indication that will significantly impact the participant's ability to execute clinical assessments planned or expected to be required to manage curvature within 12 months following the Screening Visit.\n2. A participant with a score of zero on any one or more of the primary or key secondary endpoints at the time of screening. (Participants who previously completed participation in Study MLB-01-001 and would be excluded due to this criterion may enroll in this study provided all inclusion and no other exclusion criteria are met.)\n3. If pregnant and/or breastfeeding or planning to conceive children within the projected duration of the study through 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.\n4. Use of ribose or other sugar alcohol-containing supplement within 90 days of the Screening Visit.\n5. Use of a systemic corticosteroid for the treatment of muscular dystrophy within 90 days of the Screening Visit. (An inhaled corticosteroid or bronchodilator for reactive airway disease is allowed if the participant is on a stable dose for 30 days prior to study entry.)\n6. Previously received gene therapy to treat LGMD2I/R9.\n7. Participants with active suicidal ideation as measured by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale during screening with most severe suicide ideation score of 4 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan) or 5 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent).\n8.
