This study targets a specific kind of tES called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), where a mild, constant current is passed between electrodes placed on the scalp.",

Primary objective is to measure changes in brain function during MRI-guided HDtDCS with MRI. Secondary objective is to measure changes in depressive symptoms after five consecutive days of MRI-guided tDCS (20 minutes per session)."
