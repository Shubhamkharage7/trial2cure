            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this prospective study is to compare the clinical and radiographic success of MTA and Biodentine as a medicament in vital pulp therapy in maxillary and mandibular primary molars in a pediatric population. There is limited research currently on Biodentine since it's a novel product. Biodentine is less expensive than MTA and does not cause discoloration like MTA. Biodentine may be an alternative medicament used for vital pulp therapy in primary molars.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a interventional randomized split mouth prospective study that evaluates the clinical and radiographic success of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Biodentine as pulpotomy and indirect pulp cap (IPC) medicaments. Male and female participants ages two to twelve who need at least two quadrants of treatment will be enrolled in the trial. Participants will be treated at Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, and Geisinger Bloomsburg Hospital operating rooms for full mouth rehabilitation. Each participant must have at least two matched bilateral carious primary molars that require either pulpotomy or indirect pulp cap. Maxillary and mandibular primary first and second molars who receive pulpotomy and /or indirect pulp cap will be compared. The research will be split mouth design where the primary molar on one side will get MTA as the pulpotomy or IPC medicament and the corresponding primary on the other side will get Biodentine as the pulpotomy or IPC medicament in the same arch.\n\nThe procedures will be performed according to standards of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), by Institutional Review Board approved investigators. Data will be extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) and TigerView dental radiograph imaging software. Data will be recorded using REDCap. Clinical and radiographic follow up of patients will be every 6 months since date of procedure for 3 years. Follow up will be done at the Geisinger Pediatric Dental Clinic at Danville or Milton."
