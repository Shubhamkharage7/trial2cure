Hypothesis: HH participants will spend less time sitting and more time moving at post-intervention (week 9) compared to participants in the attention control group.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nThe secondary aims of this proposed study are to:\n\n* Examine the effects of HH on psychosocial wellbeing and the association of psychosocial wellbeing with behavioral outcomes. Hypothesis: HH participants will report improved psychosocial wellbeing, including reduced stress, depressive symptoms, and negative affect and improved quality of life, which will in turn mediate intervention outcomes at post-intervention (week 9) and follow up (week 24).\n* Evaluate the long-term benefits of the HH intervention. Hypothesis: HH participants will spend less time sitting and more time moving at follow up (week 24) compared to participants in the attention control group.\n\nAn exploratory aim of the proposed study is to identify implementation facilitators and barriers using a mixed-methods approach. Implementation of HH will be evaluated using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the RE-AIM Framework. In-depth interviews with key informants combined with administrative and questionnaire data will be used to identify critical facilitators and barriers for implementing HH and to evaluate reach, implementation, adoption, and maintenance."
