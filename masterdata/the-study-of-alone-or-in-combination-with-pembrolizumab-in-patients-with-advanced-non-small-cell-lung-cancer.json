            "detailedDescription": "This is a non-randomized, three-arm trial.\n\nArm 1a and 1b will enroll patients with advanced NSCLC regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression who have experienced disease progression on or after PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy, given alone or in combination with other systemic anti-cancer therapy. Patients will be assigned to arm 1a or 1b at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients on arm 1a will receive NC318 alone; those on arm 1b, combination therapy with NC318 and pembrolizumab.\n\nArm 1a will be based on a Simon two-stage minimax design. In the first stage, 18 patients will be accrued. If tumor response per RECIST v1.1 is achieved in 2 or fewer patients, arm 1a will be closed to further enrollment. If tumor response is demonstrated in 3 or more patients, then 25 additional patients will be accrued (stage 2), for a total of 43 patients.\n\nArm 1a and 1b will start with a safety run-in portion consisting of 6 patients (see 4.1.1). If deemed safe, each arm will continue to accrue and follow the Simon two-stage design outlined above. Patients in the run-in portion will be included in stage 1 of the Simon two-stage design.\n\nArm 2 will enroll patients with advanced NSCLC and tumor PD-L1 expression less than 50% who are na\u00efve to PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy. Patients on arm 2 will receive combination therapy with NC318 and pembrolizumab. Arm 2 will also start with a safety run-in portion identical to that of arms 1a and 1b (see 4.1.1). If deemed safe, accrual will continue following a Simon two-stage minimax design. In the first stage, 19 patients will be accrued. If tumor response per RECIST v1.1 is achieved in 3 or fewer patients, arm 2 will be closed to further enrollment. If tumor response is demonstrated in 4 or more patients, then 36 additional patients will be accrued (stage 2), for a total of 54 patients. Patients in the run-in portion will be included in stage 1 of the Simon two-stage design.\n\nThe study protocol was amended to add 2 additional arms 5/2023. Arms 1c and 2a will receive NC318 800 mg, IV weekly for 8 doses, followed by every 2 week dosing. They both follow the same procedures as the earlier arms in the study. Arm 2 has essentially been removed from the study- but remains included in the protocol registration.\n\nIn addition, patients treated on arm 1a will be allowed to receive combination therapy with NC318 and pembrolizumab at the time of progression, after a mandatory tumor biopsy. They will be considered separately from arm 1c."

Patients with TKI treated EGFR mutant NSCLC harboring the secondary EGFR T790M tumor must have received prior osimertinib.\n  2. Patients with crizotinib treated ALK rearranged NSCLC must have received a next generation ALK inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib or lorlatinib).\n* At least one tumor amenable to incisional, excisional, core or forceps (transbronchial) biopsy. Patients must be willing to undergo a tumor biopsy before starting trial therapy and at the time of disease progression.\n* Adequate hematologic and end-organ function\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects must not have a history of life-threatening toxicity related to prior anti-PD-1 axis therapy:\n\n  a. Subjects with history of anti-PD-1 axis therapy toxicities that are unlikely to recur with standard countermeasures (e.g., hormone replacement after adrenal crisis) are eligible.\n* Symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases. Patients with a history of treated asymptomatic CNS metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n  1. No evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the start of trial therapy\n  2. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone as therapy for CNS disease; anticonvulsants at a stable dose are allowed.\n  3. Completed stereotactic radiosurgery at least 1 week prior to initiation of trial therapyCycle 1, Day 1 or whole-brain radiation at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of trial therapyCycle 1, Day 1.\n* History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n* Prior palliative radiotherapy outside the CNS within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to, dexamethasone at doses \\> 2 mg daily (or equivalent dose of other corticosteroids), cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, sirolimus, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor \\[anti-TNF\\] agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiating trial therapy. (Inhaled or topically applied steroids, and acute and chronic standard-dose NSAIDs are permitted. Replacement steroids are also permitted). Prophylactic corticosteroids prior to imaging with intravenous contrast are allowed per institutional guidelines, without need for delay of 2 weeks. Arm 2a: No prior PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy",
