All tumor biopsies will be collected from the same target lesion, if possible. Archived, fixed tumor tissue may only be collected (taken ideally after completion of the most recent systemic tumor therapy and within 6 months prior to the first dose of trial treatment) if fresh biopsy at screening cannot be retrieved from patients due to safety concerns.\n* Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-1\n* Must have recovered from all adverse events (AEs) due to previous therapies to grade \u22641 toxicity (excluding alopecia) or have stable grade 2 neuropathy as per investigators judgement Note: grade \\>1 immune- related AEs to any prior treatments may be accepted if considered clinically nonsignificant and/or clinically stable on supportive therapy.\n* Organ function: Have adequate organ function during screening and prior to first SOT201 dose.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPrior/concomitant therapy\n\n* Known clinically relevant intolerability or severe hypersensitivity to prior anti PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent therapy, pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients, or an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, CD134 \\[OX40\\], CD137) that caused permanent discontinuation of the agent, or that were grade 4 in severity or have not resolved to grade \u22641.\n* Prior exposure to drugs that are agonists or antagonists of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21 or IL-27 prior to ICF signature.\n* Prior systemic anti-cancer therapies, including investigational agents, prior to day 1 cycle 1 signature if not otherwise indicated:\n\n  * Less than 3 weeks for all systemic chemotherapy\n  * Less than 3 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever shorter) for any biologic agents\n  * Less than 4 weeks for ICIs (targeting CTLA-4, or PD-L1, including e.g., ipilimumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, cemiplimab) prior to cycle 1 day 1\n  * Less than 4 weeks from major surgeries and not recovered adequately from the procedure and/or any complications from the surgery before starting SOT201\n* Has received radiation therapy \u226414 days before day 1 of cycle 1 or has not recovered to grade \u22641 from treatment-related side effects. A 1-week radiation-free period is permitted for palliative radiation (\u22642 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system disease.\n* Use of prohibited medication prior or during the course of the trial as specified in the protocol\n* Predicted life expectancy \u22643 months\n* Clinically significant cardiac abnormalities\n* Has undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within the last 5 years (patients who have had a transplant more than 5 years ago are eligible as long as there are no symptoms of graft versus host disease)\n* Diagnosis of other forms of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days before the first dose of SOT201\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 5 years. Patients with basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n* Has known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during trial screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days before the first dose of SOT201.\n* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy, except in cases for treatment of HIV and/or Hepatitis B\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n\nNOTE: Other Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
