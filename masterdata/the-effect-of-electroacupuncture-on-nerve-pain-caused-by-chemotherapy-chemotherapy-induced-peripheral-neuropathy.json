            "detailedDescription": "During the study, patients will be randomized to one of the two possible acupuncture treatment groups and receive 10 treatments over the course of 8 weeks and then enter a follow-up period. Acupuncture is a medical technique that involves insertion of very thin needles into specific areas on the body with the goal of promoting health and well-being. EA involves adding a very small amount of electricity through the acupuncture needles (electrical stimulation). Researchers have found that EA can increase the effects of regular acupuncture, and it is particularly helpful for treating different kinds of pain. The purpose of this study is to learn if EA can improve CIPN pain in cancer survivors, and if it is effective against other CIPN-related symptoms."
