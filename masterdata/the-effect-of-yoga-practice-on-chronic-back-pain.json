Surgery is only an option in a minority of these patients, usually confined to those with structural instability. Yoga is an ancient modality whose benefits are currently being studied.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a 6 week standardized yoga practice is superior to usual conservative therapies in the treatment of chronic back pain at 6 months. There is enough data that the most recent ACP guidelines have included yoga as a treatment for chronic back pain, but more data needs to be generated regarding the efficacy of this modality in treating the chronic back pain population."

The protocol is designed to be directed by a teacher initially but can be done at home and is only 18 minutes in duration.",
