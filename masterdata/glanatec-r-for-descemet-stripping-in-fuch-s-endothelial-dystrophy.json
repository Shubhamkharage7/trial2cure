While some limited data exists as a proof of concept in in vitro or animal studies, and Glanatec\u00ae has been successfully used in a recently published case series for this indication, there is insufficient data to show that this drug can be effectively used for corneal cell clearing while maintaining patient safety.\n\nThe goal of the study is to provide sufficient proof of concept for the use of this drug in patients with FED whose only treatment alternative is to undergo corneal transplant."
