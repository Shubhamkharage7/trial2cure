This procedure will offer patients the benefits of cryoneurolysis (freezing) of the intercostal nerves, thereby providing short and long term pain control while their ribs heal.\n\nPatients in the intervention arm will receive cryoneurolysis via the Iovera device and patients in the control arm will receive standard of care which typically includes multimodal pain therapy and pulmonary toilet.
