This study uses systems science approaches to improve access to healthier foods in independently owned restaurants by: 1) testing the effects of a novel intervention called FRESH (Focus on Restaurant Engagement to Strengthen Health) on dietary quality, health indicators and other outcomes in African American and Latin communities, and 2) developing a system dynamics model to allow stakeholders to virtually test FRESH strategies in their own communities. The resulting restaurant intervention simulation model offers potential cost savings from avoided trial-and-error testing, and will support community-based cancer prevention."

FRESH intervention components include food preparation, food access and procurement, and consumer nutrition environment. Activities will take place over 16 months, and include training restaurant chefs to use healthier cooking methods, partnering with restaurant suppliers to offer healthier ingredients, and offering point-of-purchase promotions to educate customers on the healthier promoted food options. Intervention staff will form strong relationships with restaurant owners and chefs via in-person visits at least twice a month. Data from the intervention trial will inform the development of a system dynamics simulation model that will allow stakeholders to test new policy ideas prior to implementation.",
