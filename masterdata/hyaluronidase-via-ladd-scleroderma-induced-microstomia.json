            "briefSummary": "Two treatment methods, ablative carbon dioxide (CO2) laser and intradermal hyaluronidase, will be combined to maximize the beneficial potential of each. Laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD) has been shown to be effective for the administration of medications in diverse skin diseases but not previously reported for the treatment of scleroderma-induced microstomia. By using this laser technique, the investigator can reduce the pain of typical hyaluronidase injections and reap the therapeutic benefit of the laser treatment itself. The investigator's goal is to create greater mouth mobility for chewing and speaking as well as improved oral hygiene, self-esteem, and overall quality of life. Each participant will undergo three separate laser sessions at 4 to 8-week intervals. Participants will also complete a follow-up visit three months after the last laser session to evaluate the response.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study, the investigator will combine two treatment modalities, ablative carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, and intradermal hyaluronidase, via laser-assisted drug delivery. The investigator's goal is to maximize the therapeutic potential of each of these therapeutic interventions by combining them. Laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD) has been shown to be an effective modality for the administration of medications in diverse cutaneous diseases but has not been previously reported for the treatment of scleroderma-induced microstomia. By using an ablative fractional CO2 laser, the investigator can facilitate both the intradermal administration of hyaluronidase and reap the therapeutic benefit of the laser treatment itself. LADD of hyaluronidase has the additional advantage of being less painful and likely better tolerated than intradermal hyaluronidase injections, which typically require painful infraorbital and mental nerve blocks. The investigator's goal is to provide patients with a novel, effective, and less painful option for the treatment of scleroderma-induced microstomia, leading to greater mouth mobility for mastication and phonation as well as improved oral hygiene, self-esteem, and overall quality of life. Ten patients with scleroderma-induced microstomia will be selected primarily from the scleroderma patient population at University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) Dermatology as well as from a local non-profit scleroderma support group. Each patient will undergo three separate laser sessions. On each occasion, we will treat the perioral area with 200 units of hyaluronidase, administered via LADD using an ablative fractional CO2 laser. These appointments will be scheduled at 4 to 8-week intervals, depending on the patient's tolerance to laser therapy and availability. Patients will also complete a nonprocedural follow-up visit three months after the last laser session to evaluate for a sustained response."
