            "detailedDescription": "This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, single-center, clinical trial in which 20 patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment groups:\n\n1. Group 1 (n=10): Active tAN + standard care\n2. Group 2 (n=10): Sham tAN + standard care\n\nStimulation:\n\nParticipants undergoing lumbar fusion surgery will be randomized to receive either active or sham tAN treatment according to the following time points:\n\n* Pre-operative: 30 minutes in the hour prior to surgery\n* Intra-operative: 30 minutes before the end of surgery\n* Post-operative: 30 minutes at 3 and 6 hours after surgery\n* Inpatient: Four 30-minute sessions on Day 2\n\nBlood Draws\n\nParticipants will have blood samples collected at the following time points:\n\n* Day 1 (Day of Surgery)\n* Day 2 (Day 1 post-surgical)\n\nFollow up Visits Participants will have study follow up visits on Days 7 and Day 14. These visits can either be conducted either via a secure telehealth video visit, or in person visit."

Electrodes applied to select dermatome regions can target ear neural structures and deliver non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS). Use of tAN for pain relief is an attractive alternative to pharmacologic and opioid-based approaches because it is safe and effective and presents no addiction liability.",
