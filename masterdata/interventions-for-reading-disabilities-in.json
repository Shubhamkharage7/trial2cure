            "briefSummary": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder that is associated with a four times greater risk of learning disabilities, including reading disabilities, and a deficiency of neurofibromin - a protein important in a signaling pathway that regulates learning and memory. Our previous work (NS49096) demonstrated that school-age children with NF+RD can respond to standard phonologically-based reading tutoring originally developed to treat reading disability in the general population. Combining our work with that by other researchers suggesting that a medication (Lovastatin) may counteract the effects of the deficient neurofibromin, and possibly ameliorate learning disabilities in NF1, the investigator propose to examine the synergistic effects of medication plus reading tutoring.",
            "detailedDescription": "Neurofibromitosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome. The most common concern of NF1 is learning disabilities (LDs). Approximately half of children with NF1 have LDs, the most common of which are reading disabilities (RDs).The purpose of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and treatment of RDs in NF1.\n\nThe Investigator will evaluate four different groups (see list below) to determine if there are differential outcomes in these groups of children with NF+RD. The first two groups will consist of NF1 patients, and the second two groups will consist of participants with RDs but without NF1.\n\n1. Reading tutoring program and a medication called Lovastatin (NF1 patients)\n2. Reading tutoring program and no Lovastatin (placebo) (NF1 patients)\n3. Reading tutoring program (RD participants)\n4. Other Academic \"Sham\" tutoring (eligible to receive reading tutoring after study participation is complete) (RD participants)"

If male, participant has reached Tanner Stage 2 (NF patients only)\n5. Participant able to swallow capsule (NF patients only, may be confirmed via swallowability test, described below)\n6. Participant's English is sufficient for school (all participants)\n7. Participant must either answer \"yes\" to question A, or answer \"yes\" to at least 2 items for questions B-D listed below:\n\nA.

Have you (parent) ever been concerned about your child's reading ability? D. Did the school or teacher ever express any concerns about your child's reading ability? Swallowability Assessment: We may ask patients to perform a capsule swallowability assessment prior to enrollment. We will ask subjects to attempt to swallow an empty capsule, matching the same size of the Lovastatin 20mg and 40mg capsules to be used in the study, to confirm swallowability. Patients will be provided with up to 2 capsules as needed to successfully perform the swallowability assessment. If the patient is unable to swallow the capsule, enrollment in the study may deferred or declined.\n\nA child will be excluded if he/she meets any of the following criteria, which will be determined by initial telephone screening as well as review of medical/developmental history prior to and during testing:\n\n1. Child 7 years of age or less;\n2. known uncorrectable visual impairment;\n3. documented hearing impairment greater than or equal to a 25 dB loss;\n4. medical contraindication to MRI procedures (e.g., metal devices);\n5. any psychiatric, behavioral, or developmental disorder that would preclude active participation in in-depth tutoring sessions\n6.

Recent Operation or significant Injury\n   11. Muscle Pain or Tenderness with Increase Creatinine Kinase,\n   12. Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol\n   13. Pregnant or lactating. - Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing mothers because it decreases synthesis of cholesterol and other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that are essential components for fetal development.\n\nChildren who meet criteria for ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, adjustment disorder, and/or mild depression will be eligible as long as they are not taking psychotropic medications, with the exception of stimulant medication for ADHD.\n\nFor pilot participants only:\n\nCriteria for inclusion/exclusion for pilot participants is outlined below.
