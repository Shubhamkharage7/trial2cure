Participants with HbA1c levels between 6.5-8.9% (inclusive) will be recruited and randomized into either the placebo or intervention group. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 90 days. At the beginning of the 90 days, the participant will complete online questionnaires, a blood draw, and a set of at-home sample collections for blood, stool, and saliva that will be sent back to Viome. After the samples are analyzed, the participant will receive dietary recommendations and either personalized supplements or placebo supplements. The participant will follow the dietary recommendations and take the supplements for 90 days. At the end of the 90 days, the participant will once again complete online questionnaires, a blood draw, and a set of at-home sample collections for blood, stool, and saliva that will be sent back to Viome for analysis."
