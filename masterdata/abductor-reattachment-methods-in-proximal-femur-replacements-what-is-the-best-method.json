The investigators hypothesize that those patients who receive reattachment of the abductors directly into the prosthesis will have better functional outcomes overall. Furthermore, the investigators plan to develop a simple, cost effective, and reproducible method to assess abductor function at clinical post-operative visits through plain radiographs.",

The Duke DEDUCE database will be used to identify retrospective patients using the above mentioned CPT codes. Individual chart review of the electronic medical record will then be used to identify those receiving a proximal femur replacement. Maximum number of charts to be reviewed in the study will be 300. Of these 300 charts, the investigators plan to consent 25 subjects who have return appointments scheduled. The investigators also plan to consent 25 preoperative patients, for a total of 50 subjects."
