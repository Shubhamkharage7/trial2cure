SRG-514 will be investigated utilizing a 3+3 convention dose escalation cohorts, with 3 to 6 patients enrolled at each dose level, and a minimum of 6 patients enrolled at the highest dose level, for a total of approximately 12-18 patients in the dose escalation portion of the study.\n\nSRG-514 doses will be escalated based on safety and potential dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the 14-day period following SRG-514 administration. Patients who do not complete the DLT period for reasons other than study drug related toxicity would be considered non-evaluable for DLT assessment and may be replaced."
