            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMultiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer of certain blood cells. MM often returns after treatment, and most people survive only 5 to 8 years after diagnosis. To improve survival, researchers need to find ways to identify returning disease earlier.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find out if the radiotracer 18F-fluciclovine (a substance injected into the blood during imaging scans) is better at detecting MM than the one (18F-FDG) currently used for this purpose.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older with MM. The MM may be newly diagnosed (NDMM); or it may have returned or failed to respond after at least 1 prior line of treatment (RRMM).\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have blood tests. They will have a positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) scan using 18F-FDG. The radiotracer will be injected into a vein. Then participants will lie on a table while the PET/CT scan takes images of their body.\n\nAll participants will have 3 study visits. During each visit they will have:\n\nTwo PET/CT scans. One with 18F-FDG, one with 18F-fluciclovine.\n\nAn optional magnetic resonance imaging scan.\n\nA bone marrow biopsy. An area on the hip will be numbed; a needle will be inserted to draw out a sample of the soft tissue from inside the bone.\n\nThese tests may be spread over 30 days for each visit.\n\nNDMM participants will have their second study visit 2 to 4 weeks after they complete their usual treatment for the disease. RRMM participants will have their second visit 6 months after their first.\n\nAll participants will have a third study visit after 5 years or when their disease progresses.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells that leads to destructive bone lesions, renal damage, anemia, and hypercalcemia. MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy. The American Cancer Society estimates that annually over 34,000 new cases of MM will occur in the U.S. and over 12,000 deaths due to MM in 2022.\n* Overall survival (OS) has improved significantly over the past 20 years with the development of proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies. However, despite these advances, patients ultimately relapse requiring multiple subsequent lines of therapy. As MM evolves, it generally becomes more refractory, and patients ultimately succumb to their disease.\n* With multiple lines of efficacious therapies, the correct early identification of relapsed disease is important to trigger initiation of a new line of therapy.\n* Limitations in conventional imaging highlight a need for molecular imaging agents with better sensitivity for detecting and measuring tumor burden to improve staging and treatment selection for patients with MM and plasma cell dyscrasias.\n* 18F-fluciclovine is a radionuclide approved by the FDA for evaluating suspected prostate cancer recurrence but has shown additional ability in detecting MM lesions.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo determine the concordance between 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in participants with multiple myeloma\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Participants \\>= 18 years old\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0 to 2\n* Participants must have a documented diagnosis of MM defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria\n* Participants fit criteria for one of the following categories:\n\n  * Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) without previous treatment (or within the first 3 cycles of front-line treatment)\n  * Relapsed and/or Refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with at least 1 prior line of therapy\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is an open-label, single center phase 2 study evaluating 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT imaging in up to 50 participants with multiple myeloma. Participants will be enrolled into one of two cohorts based on disease status; newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) participants will be enrolled into Cohort 1 and relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) participants will be enrolled into Cohort 2. All subjects will undergo an 18F-fluciclovine injection followed by a static whole-body PET/CT at three time points: Timepoint #1, Timepoint #2 (after induction for NDMM or at 6 months for RRMM) and Timepoint #3 (at progression or at 5 years). Results will be compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging at those same timepoints."
