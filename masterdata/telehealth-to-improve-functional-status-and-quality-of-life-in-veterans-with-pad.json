            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will use the VA Telehealth service to deploy a remotely accessible supervised exercise training program and evaluate whether a telehealth-based intervention can improve walking performance, quality of life, and ultimately cardiac risk in Veterans with PAD. The impetus for the current proposal stems from the following: 1) over 50% of VA-enrolled Veterans live in rural communities; 2) Veterans with PAD are older (mean age, 70 years), further increasing their risk for functional decline; and 3) there is a significant lack of access to facility-based supervised exercise training for Veterans with PAD. The objectives include the following:\n\n1. To develop a telehealth-facilitated exercise intervention for Veterans with PAD that serves as a Veteran centric new model of care.\n2. To integrate Veteran preferences into the development of a telehealth-facilitated supervised exercise program.\n3. To assess the long-term patterns of functional impairment and quality of life among Veterans with PAD not undergoing supervised exercise training."
