This study is seeking participants who:\n\n* Must be male or female of 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive at the time of the study.\n* Are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other study procedures.\n* Have a BMI (body mass index) of 17.5 to 40 kg/m2; and a total body weight \\>50 kg (110 lb).\n* Are capable of giving signed informed consent document. All participants in this study will receive Lorlatinib. Participants will be placed into 1 of 3 cohorts based on their hepatic (liver) function. Participants will take Lorlatinib once by mouth. We will examine the experiences of people receiving the study medicine. This will help us determine if the study medicine is safe and effective. Participants will take part in this study for up to 35 days.",

Severe uncontrolled ascites and/or pleural effusion.\n8. Screening supine BP \u2265160 mm Hg (systolic) or \u226590 mm Hg (diastolic), on a single measurement following at least 5 minutes of rest. If initial supine BP is \u2265160 mm Hg (systolic) or \u226590 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the three BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.\n9.
