            "briefSummary": "This study will explore neurocognitive performance in pediatric brain tumor patients receiving proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT). The investigators goal is to gather baseline neurocognitive testing prior to the completion of the first week of radiation therapy along with follow-up testing 6-12 months after the completion of radiation and serial annual testing thereafter. With these data the investigators plan to evaluate the effects of PBRT on neurocognitive performance as it relates to patients' age at diagnosis, tumor location, and radiation dose. Modeling studies have demonstrated that PBRT could improve neurocognitive outcomes, but there is a paucity of prospectively-collected patient data. The investigators are uniquely positioned to address this important question given the busy pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumor service, the delivery of proton therapy at the S. Lee Kling Proton Therapy Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and the multi-disciplinary research team with extensive experience into the late effects of therapy as it relates to neurocognition."
