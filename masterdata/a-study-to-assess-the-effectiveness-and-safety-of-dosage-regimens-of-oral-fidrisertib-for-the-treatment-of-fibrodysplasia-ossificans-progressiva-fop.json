            "briefSummary": "Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease characterized by the presence of bone in soft tissue where bone normally does not exist, known as Heterotopic Ossification (HO). It is often associated with painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that lead to abnormal stiffening and immobility (ankyloses) of major joints with cumulative and irreversible loss of movement and disability.\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of 2 dosing regimens of IPN60130 in inhibiting new HO volume compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in adult and paediatric participants with FOP. It will be assessed by a scan (provides internal images of the body) called low dose Whole Body Computed Tomography (WBCT), excluding head.\n\nAdults and participants 5 years of age or older are also eligible for a sub study to evaluate HO lesions assessed by another type of scan, Fluorine-18-labelled natrium fluoride Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (\\[18F\\]NaF PET-CT )."
