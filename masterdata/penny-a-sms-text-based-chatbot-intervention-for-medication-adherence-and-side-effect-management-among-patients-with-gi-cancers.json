            "briefSummary": "There has been a dramatic paradigm shift over the last 25 years within cancer care due to the onset of many new targeted therapies and a transition from inpatient to outpatient care. Hand in hand with this shift has been the increased development and use of oral anti-cancer drugs, including cytotoxic chemotherapies that patients self-administer at home versus administration of an intravenous product at an infusion center. One of the main drivers for the growth and popularity of oral chemotherapy has been patient preference. However, an incorrect assumption exists among patients that oral therapy is associated with minimal side effects. According to the 2008 NCCN Task Force Report on Oral Chemotherapy, \"some patients may incorrectly assume that oral chemotherapy is not \"real\" chemotherapy and is more akin to taking a vitamin or antibiotic. Furthermore, patients must understand that oral equivalents of cytotoxic therapies, such as capecitabine, have side effects that are similar to their parenteral counterparts in this case, fluorouracil. The need to monitor for side effects and titrate dosages increases the complexity of oral chemotherapy regimens\".\n\nSelf-administration of these complex oral therapies causes patients to become more autonomous in their care, without medical supervision of doses between office visits. Due to the lack of oversight, there is a concern of compromised efficacy if patients take less than the prescribed doses, or increased, sometimes life-threatening, toxicity, often between office visits, if more than the prescribed dose is taken. Both daily dose and schedule can be complicated for patients to comprehend and follow.\n\nCapecitabine is a particularly complex oral chemotherapy, with 2 pill dose sizes, dosing by Body Surface Area (BSA), twice a day dosing, and days of on therapy and days off of therapy. For this reason, capecitabine has been chosen as the backbone for regimens that will be studied. As noted in section 5.3 capecitabine might be combined with other oral chemotherapies, Parenteral chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n\nThe investigators believe there is an opportunity in this space to improve oral chemotherapy adherence by walking patients through how and when to take their oral therapies remotely, as well as to better manage toxicity by gathering more information from the patient during their treatment."
