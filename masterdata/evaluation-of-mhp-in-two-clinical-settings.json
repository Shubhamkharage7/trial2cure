The investigators will pilot MHP 3.0 (Spanish and English language options) at practice sites at the Obstetrix Medical Group of Houston, Texas and the UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) Healthcare System. Patient and care team feedback will be assessed throughout this study. Patients at Obstetrix Medical Group of Houston will be assessed using 4 short acceptability and feasibility surveys administered by the Naima Health team using a link for an online survey during the study term: at baseline, week 14-18, week 24-28, and week 34-36. A subset of participants at UPMC will also be asked to complete user surveys.",
            "detailedDescription": "For this study the investigators pilot MHP products in two clinical settings to determine their acceptability and feasibility in clinical practice. The investigators will pilot MHP 3.0 (Spanish and English language options) at practice sites at the Obstetrix Medical Group of Houston, Texas and the UPMC Healthcare System. Participants will receive MHP to use as part of their prenatal care, along with communication from the prescribing provider about how the app will be used and when the provider will have access to their information.\n\nPopulation and Sample Size: The investigators will recruit a sample of 75 patients from the Obstetrix Medical Group clinical sites in women's first trimester of pregnancy. The investigators will over sample for Spanish speakers (approximately 20% of our population). Women will be eligible for recruitment if they are at least 18 years old, are currently pregnant and under the care of a participating provider/clinic, own a smartphone, and are literate in English or Spanish. We will recruit 75 patients patients who are currently using MHP as part of their routine care at the UPMC Healthcare system to complete a user online survey to discuss their experience with the app.\n\nAt Obstetrix Medical Group of Houston, recruitment staff will identify eligible women to match our demographic requirements, introduce the study during an initial prenatal appointment, and then consent women to the study.\n\nData sources and collection:\n\nPatients at Obstetrix Medical Group of Houston: A short acceptability and feasibility survey will be administered by the Naima Health team online four times during the study term. A final interview will be conducted by phone between weeks 36-42 with a sample of 10 - 15 study participants.\n\nPatients at UPMC Healthcare system: Patients who have been prescribed the app as part of their routine care will be invited to participate in an online survey.\n\nAnalytic Plan and Sample Size Considerations:\n\nThe investigators will focus on feasibility (a priori defined as \u2265 67% completion of weekly questionnaires administered through the app) and acceptability (a priori defined as satisfaction scores of \u2265 4 on a 7-point Likert scale among \u226580% participants) as primary outcomes for this aim. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize baseline demographic characteristics of the participants. The investigators will use point estimates (i.e. means and sample proportions) and 95% confidence intervals to characterize the sample with respect to baseline demographic characteristics. Debriefing interview transcripts will be coded for themes of acceptability, satisfaction, and barriers to app use."
