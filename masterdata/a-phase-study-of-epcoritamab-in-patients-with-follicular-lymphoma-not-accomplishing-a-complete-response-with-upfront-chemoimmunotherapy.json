            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, phase 2, single arm, open label trial investigating epcoritamab in participants with follicular lymphoma (FL) who have failed to achieve a complete response after frontline therapy. Epcoritamab is a bispecific antibody, a synthetic protein that activates the immune system to target cancer cells.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved epcoritamab for follicular lymphoma but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, treatment study visits, questionnaires, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, electrocardiograms, blood tests, and bone marrow biopsies.\n\nParticipants will receive treatment for up to 12 cycles and will be followed for 2 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 35 people will take part in this research study.\n\nGenmab, Inc. is funding this research study by providing the study drug, Epcoritamab."

Rituximab monotherapy, rituximab plus radiation, or radiation alone is not sufficient.\n* Subjects need to have achieved a partial response or stable disease as best response following upfront treatment. Subjects with progressive disease will be excluded.\n* Subjects must have completed all prior anti-lymphoma therapy at least 4 weeks (28 days) prior to start of epcoritamab.\n* Age \u226518 years.\n* 3.1.7 Age \u226518 years.\n* ECOG performance status \u2264 2\n* Life expectancy of greater than 2 years\n* Participants must meet the following organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count \u22651000 cells/mcl (G-CSF allowed if marrow involved with disease)\n  * Platelets \u226575,000 cells/mcl (transfusion allowed if marrow involved)\n  * Hemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL (transfusion allowed if marrow involved)\n  * Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).

Patients with Hepatitis C antibody must have undetectable viral load.\n* Participants with a history of prior malignancy will be eligible if all treatment of that malignancy was completed at least 2 years prior to enrollment to this study, the treatment was considered \"curable-intent\", and there is currently no evidence of disease.\n* Resolution of toxicities from prior therapy to baseline or grade \u22641 (with the exception of grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or any grade alopecia)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Females of childbearing potential must agree to practice a highly effective method of birth control (as defined by the EU Clinical Trial Facilitation Group) consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for patients participating in clinical trials:\n\n  * Established use of oral, injected or implanted combined (estradiol and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception;\n  * Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS);\n  * Male partner sterilization (the vasectomized partner should be the sole partner for that patient)\n  * True abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient)\n* Women must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during the trial and for 12 months after receiving the last dose of epcoritamab.

Patients with history of CNS malignancy from separate malignancy must have completed CNS-directed therapy and must currently have no evidence of disease\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women or participants unwilling to adhere to institutional guidelines for highly effective contraception for the duration of the therapy are excluded. This is because of the unknown but potential risk of teratogenic or abortifacient effects, as well as potential for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, as epcoritamab has not yet been studied in this patient population. A female can be determined to not be of childbearing potential if she meets any of the following criteria:\n\n  * Premenarchal\n  * Postmenopausal (\\>45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 12 months or any age with amenorrhea for at least 6 months and a serum follicle stimulating hormone \\[FSH\\] level \\>40 IU/L or mIU/mL)\n  * Permanently sterilized (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion \\[which includes tubal ligation procedures as consistent with local regulations\\], hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy)\n\nNote: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the trial (e.g., woman who is not heterosexually active becomes active, premenarchal woman experiences menarche) a woman must begin a highly effective method of birth control, as described under 3.1.15.\n\n* Known current alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric illness, or unstable social situation that is likely to limit compliance with study requirements\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to epcoritamab\n* Exposure to a live or a live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks\n* Patients with HIV will be excluded",
