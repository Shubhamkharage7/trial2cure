            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate a cascade genetic testing intervention. Cascade testing is the process of offering genetic testing to people who are at risk of having inherited a possibly harmful gene change that has been found in their family. This process is repeated as more people within the family are found to have the gene change. The study will look at how often genetic testing occurs when healthcare providers have permission to reach out to family members to recommend genetic testing and to help those who are interested get tested. The study will look at whether this cascade testing intervention is practical and effective. The study would like to see how this approach of healthcare providers reaching out directly to family members compares with the usual approach of patients telling their family members about the recommendation to get genetic testing."
