We and others have shown that bradykinin increased during hemodialysis; however, the role of bradykinin in dialysis-induced hypotension (DIH) has not been evaluated. Preliminary results from a pilot clinical trial showed that bradykinin B2 receptor blockade with icatibant prevents excessive blood pressure during hemodialysis. Thus, in this study, we will test the overarching hypothesis that blockade plasma kallikrein with lanadelumab would ameliorate the reduction of blood pressure during hemodialysis in patients who are prone to DIH. For this purpose, we will conduct a parallel arm, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, using lanadelumab to evaluate the occurrence of"
