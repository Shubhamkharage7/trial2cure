            "detailedDescription": "Chronic pelvic pain affects almost 40% of women during their lifetime. Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) accounts for up to 30% of those with chronic pelvic pain. The most common underlying cause of PCS is incompetence or obstruction of the gonadal veins, resulting in painful congestion of the pelvic and perineal venous vasculature. Medical treatment is first line, and aims to suppress ovarian function and induce vasoconstriction of the venous system. Unfortunately, efficacy and long-term pain relief from medical therapy is limited. Coil embolization of the gonadal veins has been shown to decrease pain in those affected by PCS, although the degree of relief has not yet been quantified."
