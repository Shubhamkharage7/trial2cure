            "detailedDescription": "PAYA cancer survivors are 2.8 times more likely to develop a secondary human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancer than the general population. Unfortunately, HPV vaccination coverage among PAYA cancer survivors is even lower than that in the general population. Provision of adequate vaccine information and instructions for timing of vaccination post-treatment is associated with an increased intention to vaccinate. Nonetheless, research show a minority of cancer care teams specifically discuss HPV vaccination with PAYA cancer survivors and their caregivers. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an oncologist- and clinic-level intervention and the additional effect of a patient-level app-based intervention to improve initiation and 3-dose completion of the HPV vaccine series."
