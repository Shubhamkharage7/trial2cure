The investigators are looking at adults who bite their nails a lot. If this bracelet works, it could make nail-biters bite their nails less and have a better life.\n\nThe main question the investigators are trying to answer is: \"Does the gentle vibration from the bracelet make people bite their nails less?\"\n\nThe investigators will give participants a bracelet that vibrates when it senses nail-biting for 12 weeks. Participants will need to download an app that connects to the bracelet. This app will help the investigators keep track of how often participants get these vibration signals and see if nail-biting decreases while using the bracelet."
