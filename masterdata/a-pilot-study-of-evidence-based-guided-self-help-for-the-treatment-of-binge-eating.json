            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the present pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and likely effectiveness of an evidence-based guided self-help intervention for binge eating and related disordered over-eating in those unable to access clinician provided treatments. If feasible, acceptable and likely to be effective, such interventions could be made available more widely as an early intervention to those in need. Such interventions have the potential to improve quality of life by removing or ameliorating symptoms that impair psychological and social functioning. Eligible participants will receive the guided self-help intervention - an evidence-based self help program in the form of a self-help book plus telephone support and encouragement to follow the program provided by specially trained help-line volunteers. Support completing the self-help program will be provided over a period of 4 months and participants will be followed up for a year after completion of the intervention. Participants will be asked to complete brief online assessments before starting the program, at the end of 4 months when they complete the program and at 6 month and 12 month follow up."
