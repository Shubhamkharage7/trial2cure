            "briefSummary": "The hypothesis is that a behavioral intervention tool adapted for the US military population will be acceptable and associated with a decrease in incident sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV rates and high-risk sexual behaviors, and increased self-reported condom use compared to the standard of care at the Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) Preventive Medicine clinic and the Fort Bragg Department of Public Health (part of Womack Army Medical Center).",
            "detailedDescription": "This is the Execution Phase which will be conducted as a multi-site randomized controlled trial. A previous Formative Phase study was conducted under a separate protocol which has been completed with preliminary data indicating positive outcomes. Participants in both arms will meet the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and will be randomized into the intervention and control arms at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nThe intervention arm will receive the KISS (Knocking out Infections through Safer sex and Screening) intervention program in addition to standard STI prevention counselling routinely provided by military medical treatment facilities. The control arm will receive only standard STI prevention counselling. Both arms will receive follow-up educational messages via short message service (SMS)/text messaging monthly for 10 months, and have follow-up study visits at 6 months and 12 months.\n\nThe KISS intervention is a 2-hour, small group (6-12 individuals) class-based interactive, educational session based on Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Gender and Power. The intervention is an adaptation of the HORIZONS intervention, which has shown efficacy are reducing sexual risk behavior and incident STIs among adolescents in the USA. HORIZONS has been reviewed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Prevention Synthesis Research team and designated a CDC top-tier (Tier I) evidence-based intervention (EBI).\n\nTo enroll in the study, participants must be categorized as \"high risk\" as determined by a positive test for an STI within the previous 180 days or has had STI screening during this time frame (specifically gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT), M. genitalium, syphilis and/or HIV).\n\nStudy subjects will be recruited from Madigan Army Medical Center (Madigan) Preventive Medicine Clinic and the Womack Army Medical Center (Womack) Preventive Medicine Clinic in Ft. Bragg, North Carolina (NC). In addition, promotional flyers for recruitment will be placed in public areas on both bases, and will be promoted through approved social media channels. Subjects may also refer up to 5 friends or colleagues for screening.\n\nParticipants enrolled in the intervention arm will complete a total of four visits and those in the control arm will complete a total of three visits. Over the course of the study, participants in both groups will be asked to provide biological specimens and complete knowledge/behavioral surveys three times (at baseline, 6 and at 12 months). Those in the intervention group will also attend the KISS EBI (Evidence Based Intervention) program. Both arms will receive monthly (months 2-11) follow up text messages, but the content will defer between the two arms. Those in the intervention arm, will receive SMS/text messages targeting prevention maintenance interventions (PMI) messages reiterating information received during the EBI session. Those in the control arm, will receive SMS/text messages that will contain general health information."
