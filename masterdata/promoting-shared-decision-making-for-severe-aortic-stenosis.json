The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Do patient decision aids and clinician skills training course improve the quality of decisions, and do they work well for different patient populations?\n* Are heart clinics able to reach the majority of patients with decision aids before their specialist visit and do the majority of clinicians complete the training course?\n\nAll participating sites will start in the usual care group and then will be randomly assigned a time to switch to the intervention group. Participants will complete surveys before and after their specialist visit.\n\nResearchers will compare data from patients seen during usual care with data from those seen after the interventions are implemented to see if there are improvements in the quality of decisions.",

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Do patient decision aids and clinician skills training course improve the quality of decisions, and do they work well for different patient populations?\n* Are heart clinics able to reach the majority of patients with decision aids before their specialist visit and do the majority of clinicians complete the training course?\n\nThis study is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial with 8 sites, about 56 surgeons and interventional cardiologists, and will enroll about 1400 patients. All participating sites will start in the usual care group and then will be randomly assigned a time to switch to the intervention group. The interventions include a patient decision aid that was created by the American College of Cardiology CardioSmart program and a online shared decision making skills training course for clinicians. The coordinating center will provide implementation support to sites when they transition to the intervention arm. Data collection is similar across usual care and intervention groups. Patient participants will complete surveys before and after their specialist visit. Clinician participants will be randomly selected to complete a survey after the patient visit. Limited clinical data will be collected from the medical record.\n\nResearchers will compare data from patients seen during usual care with data from those seen after the interventions are implemented to see if there are improvements in the quality of decisions. Researchers will also calculate percentage of patients reached with decision aids and percentage of clinicians who complete training at each site to measure the success of the implementation."

Clinicians and staff will be involved in delivery of the decision aids and will not be blinded to the study arm. Research staff entering survey data and conducting chart review will not be given any explicit information about study assignment; however, it is likely that they will have a sense for the arm due to the timing. The statistician conducting analyses will be blinded to group assignment at each step. For the clinician survey, we will use computer generated random assignment to select one specialist (either interventional cardiologist or cardiac surgeon) to receive the post-visit survey for each patient participant.",

Participant information sheets for the study will indicate that de-identified information will be deposited in an open access service to promote use of the data by other researchers. No information that contains identifiers or that could be used to link an individual to the data will be included in the de-identified data set. No data will be provided from qualitative transcripts as this may lead to identifying information about participants. However, codes abstracted from qualitative transcripts may be made available.",
