            "briefSummary": "The overarching goal of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and safety of transcutaneous auricular neurostimulation (tan) in ICU patients with TBi and to determine the effect of tan on serum markers of inflammation. exploratory analyses will examine effects on such physiological parameters as blood pressure, heart rate, and intracranial pressure (iCP), as well as measures of neurological function.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-center, open-label, nonrandomized investigation. TBI patients with a post resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 or less (commonly described as moderate or severe TBI) and acute traumatic intradural blood on head CT scan will be screened upon admission to the ICU at Parkland Memorial Hospital. It is expected that all or almost all subjects will be in the Neuroscience or Surgical ICU. Consent for participation will be sought from the subject's legally authorized representative. Exception from informed consent or waiver of consent will not be part of this study.\n\ntAN will begin as soon as feasible after subject enrollment. Immediately prior to this intervention, vital signs, neurologic status, and other clinical parameters will be recorded, and pre-tAN blood will be collected for measurement of serum inflammatory markers. tAN will be administered for 30 minutes under the supervision of a member of the research team. After 30 minutes (just prior to stopping tAN), the same clinical parameters that were recorded at baseline will again be recorded then tAN will be stopped. Approximately two hours after tAN has ended, a post-tAN blood sample will be collected for measurement of the same inflammatory markers as in the pre-tAN blood sample. At each timepoint for blood collection, additional blood may be collected for banking and future analyses.\n\nPatients will undergo research blood draws and tAN stimulation for a maximum of 10 days. Research-related procedures will not exceed this 10-day period."
