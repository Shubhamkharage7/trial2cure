The researchers hypothesize that the smokers who switch to EC completely or significantly will experience reduced COPD symptoms, risks of exacerbations, and decreased levels of oxidative stress and inflammation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Smokers with COPD have a higher pack-year history and nicotine dependence compared to regular smokers as exemplified by the relatively large proportion of patients diagnosed with COPD that continue to smoke (95%).\n\nThis is a translational project which addresses the changing profile of tobacco product use in the United States (US) and the need for data regarding toxicity pathways for new nicotine products such as EC. In particular it focuses on critical scientific and clinically relevant gaps relating to oxidants in EC and their potential long-term cardiopulmonary effects. The study will obtain new information regarding the potential cardiopulmonary toxicity resulting from exposure to EC-derived oxidants that may lead to long-term disease development."
