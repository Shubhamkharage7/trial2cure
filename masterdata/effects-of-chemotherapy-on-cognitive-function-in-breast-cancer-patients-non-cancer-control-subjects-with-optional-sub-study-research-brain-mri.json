The investigator is trying to better understand the prevalence of cognitive difficulties in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to the general population as well as what biological mechanisms may play a role in the development of these difficulties. Patients will be asked to complete six assessments over the course of approximately 5 months. Assessments 1,3, 4.5 and 5 include computerized and paper and pencil cognitive testing as well as blood draws. Assessments 2 and 4 only involve the collection of a blood sample. An optional sub study is offered after Assessment 1. It involves a research brain MRI at Assessment 4.5 and cognitive testing and another research brain MRI at Assessment 6."
