There are 2 groups and 80 participants will be randomized into each group. Following the consent process, participants in each group will be seated individually in quiet rooms, with written instructions, several magazines, and a mini-fridge with beverages containing 110-120 kcals/8 fl oz. Participants will be provided instructions for the study, stating, \"The study we are conducting explores the relationship between blood glucose and cognitive abilities. After consuming food or drink, your body regulates your blood glucose. Physical exertion can also affect blood glucose. Therefore, we ask that you relax in this space for 10-15 minutes. You can read the provided magazines during this time. Drinking a beverage will bring your body's blood glucose into the right phase for our questionnaires. In the fridge are some beverages, and we ask that you drink something.\"\n\nAfter 10-15 minutes, participants will be given a cognitive test (a questionnaire on paper) and asked to complete as much of it as they can within 5 minutes. Then, moving to a separate area, weight and height measurements will be taken."
