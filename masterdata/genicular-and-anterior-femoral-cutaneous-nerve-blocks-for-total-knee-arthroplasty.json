            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to examine if there is a relationship between the addition of the genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block in providing analgesia and the use of oral and intravenous medication in patients undergoing a total knee arthroplasty. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does incorporating genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block to our current standard of care reduce patients' total opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery?\n2. Does incorporating genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block to our current standard of care reduce patients' worst numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)?\n3. Does incorporating genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block to our current standard of care result in earlier discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)?\n4. Does incorporating genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block to our current standard of care reduce patients' total opioid consumption in the first 7 days after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery?\n5. Does incorporating genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block to our current standard of care reduce patients' numerical rating scale (NRS) pain (both at rest and during movement) in the first 24 and 48 hours after surgery?\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive the genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block in addition to standard of care (intervention group), or not receive the nerve blocks (control group).\n\nComparing the intervention group to the control group, the researcher's primary outcomes are numerical pain in the post-anesthesia care unit and cumulative opioid consumption during the first 24 hours.",
            "detailedDescription": "Adductor canal nerve block (ACB), infiltration between the popliteal artery and the posterior knee capsule (IPACK), with or without peri-articular infiltration of local anesthetics (PAI), is the current standard of practice for analgesia coverage after total knee arthroplasty at the Hospital for Special Surgery. However, we frequently see patients with moderate post-operative knee pain, particularly on the anterior, middle, and lateral sides of the knee. There is limited clinical research on if adding a genicular nerve block could offer TKA patients a more complete analgesia. This study will test if the addition of genicular nerve block (including superolateral genicular nerve, superomedial genicular nerve, inferomedial genicular nerve, and nerve to vastus intermedius) and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block could offer TKA patients a more complete analgesia. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the genicular nerve block and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block in addition to standard of care (intervention group), or not receive the nerve blocks (control group).\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1.
