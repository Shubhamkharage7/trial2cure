Once these enrollment steps are completed and the participants will be randomized to one of two groups: standard National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) or a very low-carbohydrate version.\n\nIn addition to the diet (12 months) participants will be asked to participate in hour-long weekly group classes over zoom. After four months in the program, classes will occur about every month to help participants maintain the new diet. There will also be check-ins and follow-up visits through out the study."
