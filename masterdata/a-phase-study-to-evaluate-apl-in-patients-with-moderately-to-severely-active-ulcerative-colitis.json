This study comprises 3 periods including screening period (D-28\\~D-1), treatment period (D1-D28), and safety follow-up period(D29-D58).",
            "detailedDescription": "On Day 1, patients who meet all entry criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either APL-1401 or placebo in a 5:1 ratio. Patients will receive APL-1401 orally once daily (QD) during the 28-day treatment period.\n\nThree cohorts with increasing doses of APL-1401 will be explored. The dose of APL-1401 will start at 120 mg QD in Cohort 1 and sequentially increase to 160 mg QD and 200 mg QD in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, respectively. Three cohorts with increasing doses of APL-1401 will be explored. 200mg QD is designed to be maximum dose in this study.\n\nIn one cohort, if dose stopping criteria of cohort is not met, Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be held when last patient completes 28-day of study treatment. SMC will determine whether to continue the study to next cohort base on pre-defined dose escalation criteria, safety data, and available PK data. At this dose strength, if patients are well tolerated and SMC decides to escalate to a higher dose, the next cohort will be started."
