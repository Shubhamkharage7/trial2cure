Asymptomatic first-degree relatives willing to provide a blood sample may also be enrolled for the purpose of genetic testing.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with an eye exam.\n\nParticipants will have 1-12 visits per year depending on their eye disease for up to 5 years. Visits last about 4 hours and could include:\n\nMedical and family history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nEye exam and photography.\n\nOculography: They put on contact lenses or goggles. They watch spots on a computer\n\nscreen for 20-30 minutes.\n\nElectrooculography: Small metal disks are placed on the skin next to both eyes. They look left\n\nand right in the dark and light for about 30 minutes.\n\nElectroretinography: They sit in the dark with their eyes patched. A small metal disk is taped\n\nto the forehead. After 30 minutes, the patches are removed and contact lenses put in. They\n\nwatch flashing lights.\n\nFluorescein angiography: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. A dye is\n\ninjected through the tube and travels up the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures are taken of the\n\neyes.\n\nImmunosuppressive treatment\n\nEye cell sample: Samples are obtained from swabbing, pressing paper on, or taking a small\n\nbiopsy sample from the surface of the eye.\n\nBlood tests\n\nSkin, tear, urine, saliva, stool, or hair sample\n\nExam under anesthesia for some children\n\nAt each visit participants could get medications, eye drops, eye injections, laser treatments, or surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "The National Eye Institute (NEI) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide standard treatment to participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed ocular conditions. Objective: The primary objective of this protocol is to provide short term follow-up of patients, usually in conjunction with a referring physician. In addition, this protocol allows clinicians at the NEI to maintain their expertise in evaluating and treating various eye disorders for which there may not be specific research studies. The knowledge gained may lead to ideas for future clinical research studies. Study Population: The number of participants to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but will be set to 1,000 patients with ocular diseases. Design: This is an observational natural history study of multiple ocular diseases and their progression and physiology. Outcome Measures: No formal outcomes will be measured; however, the clinical assessments of enrolled participants can be used to measure the response to standard treatment."
