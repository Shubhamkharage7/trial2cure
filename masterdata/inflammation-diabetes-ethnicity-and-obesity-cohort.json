Obesity is associated with increased mortality through its linkage to comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and psychosocial disturbances. Given its prevalence, impact on morbidity and mortality, and economic cost, limiting the spread of obesity and its consequences is one of the most important problems of our time.\n\nIn this proposed study, investigators will recruit participants from a wide range of body mass index (BMI), ethnicity and Diabetes risk to collect data and blood, stool and adipose tissue samples in the San Francisco bay area.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Inflammation, Diabetes, Ethnicity and Obesity (IDEO) cohort is recruiting 350 individuals from various ethnicities, covering a spectrum of weight and Diabetes risk. The study is looking for participants between the ages of 18-75 years that are healthy with or without diabetes with a stable weight. The study will also like to include people who are slated to undergo any type of bariatric surgery for obesity or any other type of abdominal surgery at UCSF."
