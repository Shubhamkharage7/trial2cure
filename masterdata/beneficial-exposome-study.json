However, there is limited research on the impact of beneficial exposomes found in the natural environment. The researchers would like to identify and measure the benefits of these naturally occurring compounds on holistic human health.\n\nThrough blood specimens, the researchers will observe biomarkers such as cortisol levels and inflammatory markers. Data will be collected from wearable sensors to observe the effects of beneficial exposomes on areas such as cardiovascular health and sleep quality. There will be surveys to understand well-being, stress, and mood. Through such observations, this study aims to understand the positive impacts of intentional exposure to selected compounds found in nature."
