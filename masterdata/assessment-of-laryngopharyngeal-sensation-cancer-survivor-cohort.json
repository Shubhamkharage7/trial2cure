This study will expand on the previous research to include a separate cohort of adults being seen in clinic for an existing laryngopharyngeal disorder resulting from previous radiation or other cancer treatments.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Laryngeal sensation as measured by elicitation of laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR).\n\nII. To compare the elicitation of laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) threshold/probability to the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess patient-reported laryngeal sensation (PRLS) following stimulus and perceptual strength.\n\nII. To assess laryngopharyngeal responses (e.g., cough, gag, swallow) following stimulus.\n\nIII. To assess patient reported outcomes (PROs).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the elicitation of laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) threshold/probability to:\n\n* modified barium swallow (MBS) study kinematics;\n* MBS Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (MBS DIGEST);\n* MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory patient reported outcomes measure (MDADI PROMs);\n* Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity for Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (DIGEST-FEES)\n* Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing Visual Analysis of Swallowing Efficiency and Safety (FEES VASES).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants receiving care at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) for an existing laryngopharyngeal disorder resulting from previous radiation or other cancer treatments will undergo laryngopharyngeal sensory testing at a single visit. There will be up to 2 years of medical record follow up after completing the main study. Data collected from this separate cohort may be compared with historical data collected in a previous study (NCT05158179)."
