These conditions require the presence of continuous clinical disease worsening over a period of at least 3 months. Participants with these conditions may also have superimposed relapses but are distinguished from relapsing participants by the lack of clinically stable periods or clinical improvement.\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or known drug hypersensitivity.\n* Known allergy to any component of Avonex or BIIB017 formulation.\n* Occurrence of an MS relapse that has occurred within 30 days prior to randomization (Day 1) and/or the participant has not stabilized from a previous relapse prior to randomization (Day 1).\n* Any previous treatment with PEGylated human IFN \u03b2-1a.\n\nPart 2:\n\n* Any significant changes in medical history occurring after enrollment in Part 1, including laboratory test abnormalities or current clinically significant conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have excluded the participant's participation in Part 1. The Investigator must re-assess the participant's medical fitness for participation and consider any factors that would preclude treatment.\n* The participant could not tolerate BIIB017 in Part 1.\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply\"",
