            "briefSummary": "This study will test whether EMBER, a self-help tool to increase weight loss treatment engagement, helps veterans engage in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) weight management programs. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive EMBER or a list of weight management programs (the control group). They will answer questions about health beliefs and behaviors and share information from their medical record at the start of the study, 2-months after the start of the study, and 6-months after the start of the study. Participants will receive compensation for each of these contacts. Participants will also receive a reminder call 10 days after they enroll in the study. All study contacts will be over the phone. The main hypothesis is that people who receive EMBER will be more likely to use VHA weight management programs than people in the control group.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background Almost 40% of veterans using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have obesity. However, few patients use VHA's effective weight management programs. This study tests the effectiveness of EMBER, a self-directed tool with the goal of Enhancing Motivation for Better Engagement and Reach (EMBER) for weight management. It is available in paper and digital formats. EMBER is not a weight management program, instead it engages veterans in existing programs by informing and guiding choices about weight management.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\n1. Assess whether veterans randomized to EMBER are more likely to have any weight management engagement at 2-month follow-up (per electronic medical record data supplemented with self-report) compared to those randomized to the control arm (information sheet listing available programs). (Primary Outcome)\n2. Assess whether veterans randomized to EMBER have greater weight management program retention, weight management behaviors (e.g., physical activity), weight loss, and quality of life gains at 6-month follow-up compared to those randomized to the control arm. (Secondary Outcomes)\n3. Assess factors likely to affect EMBER's implementation. Preliminary implementation outcomes will be assessed via RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation) and the Proctor et al. implementation outcomes framework (Acceptability, Appropriateness, Costs, Fidelity). (Implementation Outcomes)\n\nMethodology Randomized two site Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Trial among veteran primary care patients with obesity in VA. Participants (N=470) will be randomized to EMBER or a control condition consisting of a list of available weight management programs. Logistic regressions will be used to assess Aims 1 and 2. Aim 3 results are descriptive."
