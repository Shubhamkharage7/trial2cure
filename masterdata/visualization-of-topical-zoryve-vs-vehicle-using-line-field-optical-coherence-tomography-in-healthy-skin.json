            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to visualize the deposition of topical 0.3% roflumilast (Zoryve) compared to vehicle using Line-Field Optical Coherence Tomography (LC-OCT) in vivo in healthy skin. We hypothesize that the application of topical 0.3% roflumilast (Zoryve) will result in distinct patterns of deposition within the epidermal and dermal layers compared to the vehicle. Specifically, we anticipate observing deeper penetration and more uniform distribution of roflumilast within the skin layers, indicative of enhanced efficacy, as visualized by LC-OCT imaging.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective\n\nCompare the deposition of Zoryve and the vehicle in the epidermal and dermal layers using LC-OCT.\n\nPrimary Endpoint\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is a visual qualitative analysis of LC-OCT images conducted by an expert confocalist, Babar Rao MD. This analysis aims to assess the penetration of the active drug product compared to the vehicle.\n\nSubjects will be instructed to apply topical 0.3% Zoryve once daily for seven consecutive days to a predetermined 2x2cm area on the dorsal surface forearm, as defined by the investigator. Additionally, participants will apply a topical cream vehicle provided by Zoryve to the dorsall side of the opposite forearm. Therefore, one forearm, will be designated for application of Zoryve, while the other forearm will the designated for application of the topical cream vehicle supplied by Zoryve. Subjects will apply the topical vehicle and roflumilast, daily, for 7 consecutive days. LC-OCT imaging will be conducted on both arms at various time points: baseline (T0A), 15 minutes (T0B), 1 hour (T0C), 8-12 hours (T0D), 24 hours (T0E), seven days after application (T7), and seven days after not applying cream (T14). LC-OCT imaging will follow a predefined image acquisition protocol, with investigators designating 2x2cm areas for imaging. The imaging protocol will include capturing 2D vertical photos, 3D photos, and 2D vertical videos per imaging site. Participants will be instructed to photograph the imaging sites to aid in the accurate application of the active drug product or vehicle cream base."
