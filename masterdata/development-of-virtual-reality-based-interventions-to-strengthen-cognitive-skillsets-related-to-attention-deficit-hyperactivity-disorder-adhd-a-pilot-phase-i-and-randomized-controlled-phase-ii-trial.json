            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nChildren with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often have cognitive problems. It may be hard for them to control their behaviors, concentrate for long periods, or make decisions. This can affect their education, friendships, and daily life. Virtual reality-based games may help improve cognitive skills in children with ADHD. It may also help change how the brain functions.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if virtual reality-based games help improve thinking skills and brain function in children with ADHD.\n\nEligibility:\n\nChildren aged 10 to 16 years with ADHD.\n\nDesign:\n\nWe will first do a pilot study, meaning that everyone will receive the games. If this is successful, we will then conduct a randomized controlled trial, meaning that some participants will be randomly assigned to the full version of the games and some will be randomly assigned to a limited version. Participants will be screened. Their physical and mental health, medical and family history, and intellectual and emotional development will be evaluated. They will have tests of their mood, memory, attention, thinking, and behavior. Blood or saliva may be collected. Participants may have an MRI scan of the brain.\n\nParticipants will receive a set of virtual reality games. The set includes 4 different games all played using a virtual reality headset. The participant will play the games for 20 minutes 5 days a week for 4 weeks.\n\nThe parent or caregiver will start each game using an iPad. Each of the games is designed to help the participant practice specific cognitive skills. These include inhibition control, processing speed, temporal information processing, and working memory.\n\nParticipants will have interviews each week. They will answer questions about motion sickness, eye strain, headache, and any other side effects, as well as number of game sessions played.\n\nBlood or saliva tests and the MRI may be repeated after the last game session. For the pilot, participants will have a final interview at the study end. For the full trial, a 1-month follow-up visit will be done by telehealth.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description: This study will be a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial examining the efficacy of a novel virtual reality (VR) adaptive cognitive training intervention for youth with ADHD in improving symptoms of inattention relative to a non-adaptive training control intervention. Prior to the main randomized trial, a proof-of concept open-label pilot study will assess the safety, tolerability, usability, feasibility, credibility and treatment expectancy of the intervention. It will also provide an initial assessment of the efficacy on the intervention in improving inattention symptoms and neuropsychological performance.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: Examine the efficacy of the Floreo VR intervention in improving symptoms of inattention in children/adolescents with ADHD.\n\nSecondary Objectives: Examine the efficacy of the VR intervention in improving neuropsychological performance in five cognitive domains pertinent to ADHD.\n\nPilot Study Objective: Assess the safety, tolerability, usability, feasibility, credibility and treatment expectancy of the VR intervention. Provide an initial open-label assessment of the efficacy of the intervention.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: The primary endpoint of the main trial is to investigate whether the intervention decreases symptoms of inattention as assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale-5 for Children and Adolescents (ADHD-RS-5).\n\nA secondary aim of the main study is to investigate whether the intervention brings about improvements in performance on five neuropsychological performance indices. These are parameter A on the Rapid Visual Information Processing task (sustained attention), stop signal reaction time on the Stop Signal task (inhibitory control), visuospatial working memory as determined using number of correct responses on the Dot Matrix task, discounting steepness (parameter k) on the Delay Discounting task, a composite measure of temporal deviation on a Temporal Reproduction task, and the number of correct responses on the NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test. Pilot interventions Endpoints: Responses to structured interview items on safety, tolerability, usability, credibility and treatment expectancy of the intervention. Reports of adverse events will be used to assess safety. Feasibility will be assessed using participation and compliance rates. Usability will also be assessed using a System Usability Scale. Open-label assessments of efficacy will also be performed, using the ADHD-RS-5 inattention subscale. Secondary endpoints for the pilot study are the same as for the main study."

Specifically, when the subject is deemed to perform adequately well at a given level of difficulty, the training adapts by presenting a more challenging difficulty. This adaptation to the subject s performance is designed to allow for continued incremental improvements in the trained domains. The VR games take place in a spaceship themed environment.
