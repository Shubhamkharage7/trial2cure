Grounded in Behavioral Activation (Lejuez et al., 2011), BBAISC is a structured, 6-session skill-building intervention that has 4 key elements (Pepin et al., 2020):\n\n1. Psychoeducation: Psychoeducation focused on homebound status, social connectedness, and associated changes in behavior.\n2. Behavioral Activation intervention rationale: Framing how changing behavior can positively impact social connectedness (i.e., improve social connectedness and reduce loneliness).\n3. Exploration of life areas, values, and activities: Focused on identifying life areas and values most relevant to the participant. Then, these values are used to generate activities that are aligned with those values.\n4. Activity monitoring and planning: Participants are encouraged to schedule and organize their day based on what is important rather than their current mood or feeling state.",
