            "briefSummary": "The planned study is a prospective cohort interventional study in IPF and PF-ILD patients after initiating anti-fibrotic therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation. The study aims to investigate if accelerometer measured PA parameters, such as total daily steps, moderate-vigorous PA demonstrate significant and sustained changes longitudinally from baseline in this cohort and can predict disease progression. The study also explores if the actigraphic PA indices correlate with patients' quality of life, change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD), GAP score, fatigue score, change in patients' dyspnea score/scale, radiographic extent of the disease, and pulmonary function test parameters.\n\nThe study is exploratory in nature. It will provide vital information for clinical as well as research purposes. Clinically, accelerometer measured PA can be utilized for therapeutic target and prognostication, helping to develop patient centric care. The measured indices can also be useful to serve as meaningful endpoints to plan larger and definitive studies in IPF and PF-ILD patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a 52-week prospective cohort study, involving IPF and PF-ILD patients. Those IPF and PF-ILD patients fulfilling inclusion criteria without meeting exclusion criteria will be considered for the study.\n\nAn IPF diagnosis will be confirmed according to ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2018 criteria. Other PF-ILD diagnoses will be confirmed using standard diagnostic criteria by PI. In case of diagnostic uncertainty, the study PI and sub-PI may be consulted for consensus. All subjects will be over the age of 40 years and of either sex.\n\nWe will identify potential subjects from the ILD clinic at Tampa General Hospital. All consented subjects will have the following measurements recorded as part of their routine clinical assessment and standard of care: medical history, MMRC dyspnea scale, pulmonary function test (spirometry, lung volume and DLco), serum liver functions test, high resolution CT scan of chest and a 6MWT. The sarcoidosis-PF patients will fill out a FAS questionnaire, in addition. The study participants will complete the L-PF (L-PF symptoms and L-PF impacts), k-BILD, and FSS questionnaires. GAP index will be calculated. If indicated, echocardiogram and/or right heart catheterization will be performed.\n\nThe 6MWT will be performed following guidelines for the Boehringer-Ingelheim 1199.187 IPF trial. The document is enclosed along with this submission.\n\nFollowing initial evaluation and baseline questionnaires, all participants will be provided an actigraphy watch (CP Insight Watch, Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) which will be worn on the wrist for seven continuous days and participants will be encouraged to wear it for 24 hours a day. Actigraphy data will be monitored remotely via bluetooth and will be downloaded using the manufacturer's provided software.\n\nAfter completing seven days of baseline actigraphy assessment (this is the usual timeline to obtain prescription), treatment na\u00efve subjects will begin nintedanib, 150 mg twice daily as per standard of care (SoC). Subjects already on nintedanib for less than three months and on stable dosing for at least a month, will continue their current regimen. All subjects will receive other treatments as per SoC, including immunosuppression and/or oxygen supplementation as needed. All participants will be enrolled in a standardized pulmonary rehabilitation program.\n\nEvaluations and follow-up will be scheduled at week 0, 12, 24, 36, and 52. The first 7 days after enrollment, during the baseline actigraphy assessment, will count as week 0. At each of these visits, participants will wear an actigraphy watch (CP Insight Watch, Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) on the wrist for seven continuous days and participants will be encouraged to wear it for 24 hours a day. Actigraphy data will be monitored remotely via bluetooth and will be downloaded using the manufacturer's provided software.\n\nThereafter, accelerometer reported PA indices will be measured for 7 continuous days at week 12, 24, 36, and 52."
