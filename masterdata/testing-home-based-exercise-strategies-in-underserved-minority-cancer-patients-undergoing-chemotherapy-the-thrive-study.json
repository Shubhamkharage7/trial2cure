            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized control trial of Black and Hispanic patients who have been newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer and are being prescribed chemotherapy to determine the effects of home-based exercise on levels of physical activity. It will also evaluate the impact of home-based exercise on cardiovascular (heart health) risk factors.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations of body composition, blood tests, fitness and strength assessments, and surveys at study entry and follow-up visits.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) Supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (SUP), 2) Unsupervised aerobic and resistance exercise (UNSUP), or 3) Attention control (AC).\n\nParticipation is expected to last for 8 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 135 people will take part in this research study."
