            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if participants treated with the experimental drug cusatuzumab added to venetoclax and azacitidine works to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to venetoclax and azacitidine. Venetoclax and azacitidine are drugs commonly used to treat AML in patients that are unable to receive chemotherapy to treat AML. The main question the clinical trial aims to answer is does cusatuzumab added to venetoclax and azacitidine prolong the length of time participants live compared to venetoclax and azacitidine?",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of cusatuzumab in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in persons with newly diagnosed AML who are deemed ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.\n\nPotential participants will be considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and, therefore, eligible for the study, if they meet the trial eligibility criteria. Potential participants will undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy and aspirate collected for pathology review, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and other studies for confirmation of a diagnosis of AML and to define whether participants have adverse, intermediate, or favorable AML risk features.\n\nThe enrolled trial population will be enriched for participants with adverse risk features by enrolling adverse, intermediate, and favorable risk participants at a ratio of 3:1:1, respectively (i.e., 72 adverse risk, 24 intermediate risk, and 24 favorable risk participants will be enrolled). Enrolled participants will then be randomized 2:1 to either the experimental arm or the active comparator arm."

Participants with resolved infection (i.e., participants who are HBsAg negative with antibodies to total hepatitis B core antigen \\[anti-HBc\\] with or without the presence of hepatitis B surface antibody \\[anti-HBs\\]) must be screened using PCR measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded.\n\n     * Participants with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR\n  3. Active hepatitis C infection as defined by being positive for a nucleic acid test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA\n* Congestive hear failure severity that is New York Heart Association Class III or IV\n* Unstable angina\n* Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to cusatuzumab, venetoclax, or azacitidine or their excipients (e.g., mannitol, an excipient of azacitidine)\n* Inability or difficulty swallowing capsules/tablets, malabsorption syndrome, or any disease or medical condition significantly affecting gastrointestinal function\n* Any condition for which, in the investigator's opinion, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g., compromise the well-being) or physical limitations that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments\n* Major surgery (e.g., requiring general anesthesia) \u22644 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment",
