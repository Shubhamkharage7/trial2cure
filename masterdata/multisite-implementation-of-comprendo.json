This study will test the impact of COMPRENDO, a peer-navigation intervention, vs. usual care on accrual to childhood cancer therapeutic clinical trials and parental informed consent outcomes. COMPRENDO will be delivered by trained peer navigators in 4 visits. A mixed methods (surveys, individual interviews) implementation evaluation will examine implementation factors that can inform the use of peer navigation in clinical practice, integrating data from clinicians, navigators, administrators, and parents pre and post the RCT.",

We will use mixed methods with a minimum of 50 stakeholders: 22 clinicians, (17 oncologists, 3 psychologists, 2 social workers), 4 navigators, 4 administrators and 20 parents to identify implementation factors.\n\nWithin each site, eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention vs. usual care (informed consent discussion with the oncologist only), resulting in \u2248200 participants randomized to each arm."
