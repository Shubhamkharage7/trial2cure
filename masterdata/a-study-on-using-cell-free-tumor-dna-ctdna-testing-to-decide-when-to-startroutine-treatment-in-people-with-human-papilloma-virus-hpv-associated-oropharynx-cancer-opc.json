All participants will have recently had surgery to treat their disease, or they will be scheduled to have this surgery.\n\nIn Arm A the researchers will see whether monitoring participants' HPV ctDNA levels can safely identify patients who do not need radiation therapy (RT) after surgery and whose RT can be delayed until their HPV ctDNA levels become detectable.\n\nIn Arm B, the researchers will see whether patients who usually need 6-6.5 weeks of CRT can be selected by HPV ctDNA to receive 3 weeks of CRT."

All of the scales and single item measures range in score from 0 to 100. High scores for the Global Health Status/QoL scale represent high QoL, high scores for the functional scales represent high/healthy levels of functioning, but high scores for the symptom scales/items represent high levels of symptomatology/problems.
