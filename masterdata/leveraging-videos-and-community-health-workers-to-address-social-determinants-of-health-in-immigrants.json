The VIDEO group will receive 1 DSMES brief video/week for 24 weeks delivered via text message. The VIDEO+CHW group will receive the same DSMES videos plus bi-weekly support calls from a CHW for 24 weeks. The CHW will assess participants' social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers to Type 2 diabetes care and link them to available resources in the community. The CONTROL group will continue to receive their usual care and at the end of the study, they will receive DSMES videos."
