The study is designed to learn whether the formulation can be used as a platform for other drugs for treatment of HIV. The formulation is a drug combination nanoparticle (DCNP). The study will be conducted by UW Positive Research. The sample size for this study is 12-16. The study population consists of healthy adults without HIV. The study duration is 57 days per participant at the start of the study.",

The study has two primary aims as follows:\n\n1. To characterize the plasma concentration-time course and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of the drug substances of TLC-ART 101 (lopinavir, ritonavir, and tenofovir) administered by subcutaneous injection within the drug combination nanoparticle.\n2. To characterize the safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous injection of TLC-ART 101.\n\nThere are 4 exploratory mechanistic objectives (with related endpoints) as follows:\n\n1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the drug substances in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\n2. To characterize the concentrations of intracellular TFV-diphosphate (the active moiety of TFV) in PBMCs\n3. To explore whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of the 3 drug substances differ by sex following a single dose\n4. To compare lymphoid tissue mononuclear cell versus PBMC concentrations of the drug substances in TLC-ART 101."
