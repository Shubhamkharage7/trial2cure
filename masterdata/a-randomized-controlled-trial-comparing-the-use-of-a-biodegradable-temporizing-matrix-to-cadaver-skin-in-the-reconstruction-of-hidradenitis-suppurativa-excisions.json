            "briefSummary": "This will be a prospective, interventional, single-center, randomized, controlled, comparative study comparing a total of 10 patients treated with BTM and SOC in wounds diagnosed with Hidradenitis suppurativa (5 in each group).",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of enrollment will be up to 10 subjects, which is based on feasibility and access to suitable patients during the enrollment period.\n\nSubjects will be consented prior to any study procedure being performed. Surgical planning, approach and procedures will follow the standard of care (SOC) already established by the JMS Burn Center at Doctors Hospital Augusta surgical team. After an aggressive, wide excision, and thorough debridement and cleansing of the affected lesions will be performed. Photos of the prepared wound bed will be taken prior to study product placement of both wounds. To prepare the wound bed, study eligible patients will receive either the BTM or SOC to each of their wounds. BTM will be placed on the surgically prepared wound bed and fixated with sutures or staples, according to manufacturer's recommendations, local clinical practice, and the clinical judgement of the investigator. SOC will be placed according to manufacturer's recommendations, local clinical practice, and the clinical judgement of the investigator. Photos of the wound bed with the BTM/SOC study product in place will be taken. A mesh-type, non-adherent dressing (ConformantTM, Smith \\& Nephew or something similar) will be placed over the study product to prevent shear and friction. An antimicrobial dressing to help prevent infection (such as ActicoatTM, Smith \\& Nephew or SilverlonTM, Cura Surgical) may be used but must be used over both wounds. Adequate padding with gauze will be placed over the top of the non-adherent, or antimicrobial dressing, KerlixTM rolls will be used as the outer dressing and Ace wrap or Sepro net dressing may be used as needed to hold all in place. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy will also be used in conjunction with the BTM or SOC, (at the discretion and clinical judgment of the investigator) to help manage exudate and improve the contact of the BTM and SOC to the wound bed.\n\nFollow up will be in the wound clinic as per normal SOC on Day 7,14,21, etc., (+/-3 days), until assessment of the study site determines that the wound is ready for grafting. Subject will be processed for the autografting operative procedure as per normal SOC. Once in the OR, the research study team will capture pertinent surgical data related to the skin graft: level of excision, meshing ratio, type of fixation, type of cover dressing. Photos will be taken post debridement and after product placement. Post-op, the patient will continue to be seen in the clinic on a weekly basis and autograft take, and presence of shear, friction or infection will be documented.\n\nLong term follow up will take place at 3,6, and 12 months. Study sites will be assessed for scar quality using the POSAS scale. ROM will be assessed for subjects if the wounds were in the axillae region. AE/SAE surveillance will be continued throughout the study and at all study visits."
