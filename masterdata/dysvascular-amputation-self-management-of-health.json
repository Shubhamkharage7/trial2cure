This study examines the use of an evidence-based walking biobehavioral intervention to increase physical activity after dysvascular amputation. The proposed intervention leverages successes in conventional prosthetic rehabilitation, while addressing the complex health conditions and chronic sedentary behaviors that underlie dysvascular amputation, with the ultimate goal of improved physical activity self-management to minimize disability."
