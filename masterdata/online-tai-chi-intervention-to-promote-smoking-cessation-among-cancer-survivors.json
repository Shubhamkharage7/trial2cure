            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates an online Tai Chi intervention to promote smoking cessation among cancer survivors. Tai chi is a practice that involves a series of slow gentle movements and physical postures, a meditative state of mind, and controlled breathing. It is a gentle form of exercise that can be done while sitting or standing and does not involve any medications or medical procedures. Tai chi originated as an ancient martial art in China. Over the years, it has become more focused on health promotion and rehabilitation. The use of Tai Chi may be beneficial for cancer patients who want to quit smoking.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility of the Tai Chi intervention to promote smoking cessation among cancer survivors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Collect preliminary RCT data on the efficacy of our Tai Chi intervention for the potential of scaling up to a more extensive study.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants receive access to the online WaQi program to practice Tai Chi supervised and home-based over 8 weeks. Participants also receive standard cessation treatment that includes a prescription or recommendation for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and undergo carbon monoxide (CO) testing on study.\n\nARM II: Participants receive standard cessation treatment that includes a prescription or recommendation for NRT and undergo CO testing on study. Participants also receive an 8-week online Tai Chi self-administered teaching module subscription at the end of the study."
