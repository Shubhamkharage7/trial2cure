            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if a partial cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node removal will be effective at treating Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer instead of a complete cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node removal. This clinical trial aims to determine the safety and oncologic efficacy of the intervention, and to examine patient-reported quality of life outcomes in participants. Participants will receive the standard pre-surgery treatment for approximately 4 to 6 weeks. After the pre-surgery treatment is completed, participants will undergo a partial cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection. After surgery, participants will receive adjuvant systemic therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Radical cystectomy (surgical removal of the bladder) with pelvic lymph node dissection and urinary diversion, with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in eligible participants, is the standard of care in participants with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). While this has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of MIBC, it has risk of perioperative morbidity and impacts quality of life. Partial cystectomy (surgical removal of a portion of the bladder) is one option for bladder-sparing treatment of select bladder cancer participants and is included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network bladder cancer treatment guidelines. This treatment has the advantage of less invasive treatment with a lower risk of surgical complication and better health-related quality of life (HRQOL) while providing pathologic staging, however there are limited data on outcomes with this treatment, especially patient-reported HRQOL outcomes. Additionally, much of the existing literature on efficacy of this treatment predates the use of advanced imaging in preoperative staging and advances in surgical technique including use of minimally-invasive surgical approaches and enhanced-recovery post-operative care paths. Given these limitations in the existing literature, the aim of this clinical trial is to examine the safety and efficacy and HRQOL outcomes of partial cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection, with standard of care perioperative systemic therapy in eligible participants."
