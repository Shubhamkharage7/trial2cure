            "briefSummary": "This study is designed to test whether non-persistent environmental chemicals (PECs) are elevated in people with glucose dysregulation. The primary aim is to measure whether this toxicant burden can be reduced using a dietary and lifestyle modification intervention. The secondary aim is to observe any changes in glucose response pre and post-intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim will be measured using a commercially-available screening test for urinary toxicant metabolites. The toxicant burden will be measured by a percentile score of each metabolite and summing all percentile values. A risk level of each metabolite will be normalized by the percentile score in order to calculate the total toxic burden for an individual. Wilcoxon-ranked sum non-parametric calculations will be used to evaluate whether pre and post-intervention reduction has occurred. Because this is a single-arm trial, any reduction in the toxicant burden will be correlated with the relative improvement of the secondary endpoint and will be measured using Kendall's tau-beta ranked correlation.\n\nThe secondary aim will assess each participant's fasting and post-prandial glucose response measured daily for throughout the 3-week trial.. Because this study is not powered, the estimated man reduction from baseline cannot be estimated. Any reduction in blood glucose mean values will allow us to calculate an effect size for future investigation. The ranking of the improvement in glucose response (AUC) will be tested by ranking the reduction of the toxic burden by a correlation analysis using Kendall's tau-beta ranked correlation described above.\n\nEach participant is provided with a baseline in-person assessment, one midpoint education session and a final assessment session. Each participant will receive a standardized packet of information regarding dietary and lifestyle interventions which reduce toxicant exposures along with a water filter for home use and gift card to support the purchase of organic food during the trial. Questionnaries including a Medical Symptom Questionnaire, Weekly Stress Inventory and Knowledge Atttitudes and Behavior Questionnaire will be administered pre and post-intervention."
