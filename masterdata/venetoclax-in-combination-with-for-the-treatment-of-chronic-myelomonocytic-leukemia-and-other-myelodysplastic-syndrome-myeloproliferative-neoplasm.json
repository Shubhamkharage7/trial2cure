            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) in combination with venetoclax work better than ASTX727 alone at decreasing symptoms of bone marrow cancer in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) with excess blasts. Blasts are immature blood cells. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Cobimetinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called BRAF. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. The combination of ASTX727 and venetoclax may be more effective in reducing the cancer signs and symptoms in patients with CMML, or MDS/MPN with excess blasts.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the complete remission rates of ASTX727 and ASTX727 plus venetoclax in subjects with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and non-CMML myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with excess (\\>= 5%) blasts.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall response rate (complete response \\[CR\\] + partial response \\[PR\\] + marrow response with erythroid response) of ASTX727 versus ASTX727 + venetoclax in this patient population.\n\nII. To determine the overall survival, progression-free survival, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation rate, clearance of the malignant clone, clonality at time of hematologic remission, number of red cell and platelet transfusions required and toxicity of ASTX727 versus ASTX727 + venetoclax.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (COMBINATION THERAPY): Patients receive ASTX727 orally (PO) daily (QD) for 5 consecutive days starting on day 3 of treatment cycle 1; followed by day 1 of each subsequent cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1 through 14 of each treatment cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow biopsies, and collection of blood and buccal samples throughout the study.\n\nARM II (MONO THERAPY): Patients receive ASTX727 PO QD for 5 consecutive days starting on day 3 of treatment cycle 1; followed by day 1 of each subsequent cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not have response to treatment may cross over to Arm I. Patients also undergo bone marrow biopsies, and collection of blood and buccal samples throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years or until death, whichever occurs first."

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with venetoclax, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with venetoclax. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Patients must be post-menopausal or with evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential: negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment and confirmed prior to treatment on Day 1.\n\n  * Post-menopausal is defined as:\n\n    * Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments\n    * Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range for women under 50 years of age\n    * Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses \\> 1 year ago\n    * Chemotherapy-induced menopause with \\> 1 year interval since last menses\n    * Surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)\n  * Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months following completion of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception (latex or synthetic condom or abstinence) prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of venetoclax and ASTX727 administration\n* Patients with any other medical condition for which the expected survival is below 12 months\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or assessment of the investigational regimen\n* Patients with active infection at the time of study entry",
