Patients will be followed for up to five years after first dose.\n\nNaxitamab, also known as hu3F8 is a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting GD2",
            "detailedDescription": "Each patient will receive treatment for up to 101 weeks following the first Naxitamab administration. After the end of trial visit, each patient will enter a long-term follow-up where they will be monitored for up to 5 years after first treatment cycle.\n\nEach investigational cycle is started with 5 days, days -4 to 0, of Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) administered at 250 \u00b5g/m2/day in advance of the start of Naxitamab administration. GM-CSF is thereafter administered at 500 \u00b5g/m2/day on days 1 to 5. As standard treatment, Naxitamab is administered at 3 mg/kg/day on days 1, 3, and 5, totalling 9 mg/kg per cycle.\n\nTreatment cycles are repeated every 4 weeks (\u00b11 week) until complete response or partial response followed by 5 additional cycles every 4 weeks (\u00b11 week). Subsequent cycles are repeated every 8 weeks (\u00b12 weeks) through 101 weeks from first infusion at the discretion of the investigator. End of treatment will take place around 8 weeks after the last cycle and thereafter long-term follow-up will continue."
