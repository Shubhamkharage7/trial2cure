            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies the use of virtual reality technology and three dimensional surgery (3D-surgery) modeling to enhance current treatments in head and neck cancer surgery. Virtual reality 3D-surgery modeling may improve quality of surgical planning and interdisciplinary communication between surgeons and pathologists during the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer and ultimately increase the accuracy of planning, the quality of communication, and maximize the outcome patients with head and neck cancer experience throughout treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo assess the potential for preoperative virtual reality and 3D pathological modeling to reduce total number of margin events as defined in the study as the number of positive frozen margins, number of positive final margins and the number of unexpected defect driven margins.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo assess the impact of preoperative virtual reality and 3D pathologic modeling as treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma on event free survival (EFS) at 18-36 months after resection as defined by recurrence at the primary site.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the quality of existing interdisciplinary intraoperative communication using the proposed VR/3D-case enhancement protocols (CEPs) as an evaluating medium.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (VR/3D-CEPs + STANDARD TREATMENT): Prior to surgery (day 0-13), patients undergo virtual reality 3D tumor resection via VR/3D-CEPs. Patients' pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) scans are reviewed per standard of care. Patients then undergo surgical resection on day 14-29 and a 3D model of true tumor is created and imported into the virtual reality environment.\n\nARM II (STANDARD TREATMENT): Prior to surgery (day 0-13), patients' pre-surgical CT scans are reviewed per standard of care. Patients then undergo surgical resection on day 14-29.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed for up to 36 months."
