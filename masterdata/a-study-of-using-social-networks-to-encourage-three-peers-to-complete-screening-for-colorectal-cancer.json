            "briefSummary": "The Black community has higher rates of colorectal cancer and lower rates of colorectal cancer screenings than whites. Getting screened through FIT testing may help catch colorectal cancer earlier, when it is easier to treat. MSK has created a program to help people who have been FIT tested to also help their peers (family, friends, and colleagues) in their community get FIT tested. The researchers think that training people on peer outreach, such as telling people in your social network about FIT testing and how to get it, may increase the rate of colorectal cancer screening. The purpose of this study is to see if training people on peer outreach increases the number of people who get screened for colorectal cancer through FIT testing."
