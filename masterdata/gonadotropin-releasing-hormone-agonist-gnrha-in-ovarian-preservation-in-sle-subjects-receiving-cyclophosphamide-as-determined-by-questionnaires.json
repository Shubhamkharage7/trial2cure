            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disease that affects females nine times more often than males. People with SLE are often treated with cyclophosphamide (CYC). But CYC can damage a woman s ovaries; it may cause infertility. A drug called GnRHa is sometimes given to protect the ovaries during CYC therapy. But no one really knows how effective GnRHa treatment is. This natural history survey will compare women who received GnRHa during CYC therapy with those who did not.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find out whether GnRHa can help protect women s ovaries during CYC.\n\nEligibility:\n\nWomen under age 40 years starting CYC treatment with or without GnRHa.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis study will do 2 things: It will conduct patient surveys. It will collect data from medical records.\n\nParticipants will complete a one-time survey. They will answer questions about their menstrual cycle. They will be asked about their history of pregnancy or infertility.\n\nParticipants can take the survey in 4 ways:\n\nOn paper, sent through the mail.\n\nOnline, in a secure web page managed by the NIH.\n\nBy phone.\n\nIn person, during a routine visit to the NIH clinic.\n\nThe survey will take about 30 minutes.\n\nParticipants medical records will be reviewed. Researchers will look for data about the patients SLE disease. This may include their symptoms and the results of their blood tests. It may also include the details of prior treatments.\n\nResearchers will also collect data about patients reproductive history. This may include their personal or family history of infertility. It may include any fertility treatments and any sexually transmitted infections.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description: SLE patients with life-threatening lupus manifestations are often treated with cyclophosphamide (CYC), which has known cytotoxic effects on ovarian reserve. Co-administration of Gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is suggested to protect ovaries from the cytotoxic effects of CYC but there is lack of data to support this. We hypothesize that the co-administration of a GnRH agonist for the duration of CYC therapy will exert protective effects on ovarian reserve and function in SLE females. We plan to do a patient survey and a retrospective data collection to compare ovarian function in subjects who received CYC with GnRHa to those who received CYC without GnRHa.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: Determine the effectiveness of GnRH-a in preventing primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in female SLE patients getting cyclophosphamide treatment.\n\nSecondary Objectives: Determine the effects of SLE disease activity, damage accrual, cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide and other demographic and clinical variables in preventing primary ovarian insufficiency."
