The objective of this proposal is to rigorously test a novel, multi-level approach to skin cancer prevention among young rural children that is delivered through developmental baseball leagues. To attain this objective, the investigators will conduct a two-arm cluster-randomized trial with the primary outcome being multi-behavior sun protection change among children."
