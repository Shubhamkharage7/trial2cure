Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of ruxolitinib in patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) as compared to historical controls.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall response rate (complete response \\[CR\\] and partial response \\[PR\\]) of ruxolitinib in patients with T-LGLL.\n\nII. Duration of response to ruxolitinib. III. Leukemia-free survival. IV. Rate of conversion from PR at 4 months to CR at 8 and 12 months (at full ruxolitinib dosage).\n\nV. Rate of molecular remission (T-cell receptor \\[TCR\\] clearance, STAT3 mutation clearance) at 4, 8, 12 months.\n\nVI. Incidence of grade III/IV toxicities (at full ruxolitinib dosage). VII. Quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core 30 (C30), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQDi), Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire at baseline, after 5 months, 1 year of treatment.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Objective benefit (OB) rate at 4 months defined as a patient that had improvement in their cytopenias, transfusion dependence but not attaining a PR.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a response (CR or PR) may receive an additional 12 months of ruxolitinib, for a maximum of 24 months."
