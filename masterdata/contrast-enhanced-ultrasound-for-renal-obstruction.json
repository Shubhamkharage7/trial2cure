The proposed total dose for adult patients will not exceed 20 microliters/kilograms (kg). Each individual dose not to exceed 10 microliters/kg. At initiation of patient studies, the dose will start at 10 microliters/kg for the first injection and a second 10 microliters/kg dose to evaluate the contralateral kidney. However, if ultrasound findings in patient studies demonstrate a dose that is too high (unable to make accurate ultrasound assessment), the dose will be reduced.",
