Paired t-tests will be used to examine the differences in the pre- and post- treatment PHQ-9 scores, in all patients who complete the baseline study visit. Additionally, secondary outcomes (dropout rates, patient feedback from the Mobile Application Rating Scale, Skindex-16, Psoriasis Symptom Inventory, Appearance Anxiety Inventory) will be reported descriptively. Post-treatment interviews will be transcribed, edited for clarity, coded to identify themes and summarized."
