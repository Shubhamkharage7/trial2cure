Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to generally available, standard procedures and therapeutic modalities. Samples of blood and skin will be studied by routine and specialized investigative methods to establish these patients' diagnosis, response to treatment, and/or disease progression.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background\n\nThis is a training, natural history of disease, and screening protocol for the evaluation, treatment and follow-up of patients with dermatologic diseases and systemic diseases with cutaneous manifestations. This protocol was developed to allow subject enrollment for teaching purposes and to allow for second opinions regarding relatively complicated patients, and to allow for evaluation of non-invasive tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of cutaneous manifestations. This protocol promotes a critical link between the NCI, CCR Dermatology Branch and the local and national extramural medical communities.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To provide clinical material to fulfill the educational mission of the Dermatology Branch.\n* To learn about the natural history of selected dermatologic diseases.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAll subjects regardless of age, gender, or racial/ethnic group with dermatologic disease or systemic disease with cutaneous manifestations.\n\nDesign:\n\nPatients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to generally available, standard procedures and therapeutic modalities. Samples of blood and skin will be studied by routine and specialized investigative methods to establish these patients diagnosis, response to treatment, and/or disease progression. Non-invasive tools may be used as part of the examination and assessment of cutaneous manifestations of disease."
