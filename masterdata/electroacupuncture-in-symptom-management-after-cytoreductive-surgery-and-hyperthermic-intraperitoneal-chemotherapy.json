            "briefSummary": "The investigators are conducting this research study is to evaluate the feasibility (recruitment, compliance, safety, and acceptance) of using electroacupuncture (EA) to manage complex symptoms such as pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and insomnia in patients who have undergone Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy. Additionally, the investigators are aiming to determine the effectiveness of EA in reducing these symptoms, and to examine how EA impacts important biomarkers, or proteins in the blood, that can be used as indicators or signs of these symptoms.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, prospective pilot/feasibility study. Patients can be enrolled at any time prior to undergoing surgery. The protocol and interventions are as described in the above schema. Baseline assessments including the above surveys and inflammatory markers will be obtained at the preoperative visit. The same assessments will be performed at approximately 1 month s/p Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy. Electroacupuncture interventions will be performed between postoperative months 1 to 3; a total of 8 weekly interventions will be performed. A completion assessment will be performed at approximately 6 months s/p Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.\n\nOur specific aims are as follows:\n\nTo examine the feasibility of utilizing an EA protocol in patients who have undergone Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.\n\nTo characterize symptoms experienced by patients during recovery from Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.\n\nTo evaluate the utilization of EA in symptom management during recovery from Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.\n\nTo evaluate levels of biomarkers such as circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha), mitochondrial DNA after Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy and with utilization of EA."
