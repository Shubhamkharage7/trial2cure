            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test problem solving therapy (PST) in older adults who are undergoing major surgery. The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 What is the feasibility and acceptability of delivering PST to older surgical patients with depressive symptoms or report lacking social support in the pre-operative and post-operative setting?",
            "detailedDescription": "A pilot test of a 9-session psychosocial intervention (Problem Solving Treatment, PST) will be conducted at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). Ninety older surgical patients will be recruited from UTSW's Peri-operative Senior Health (POSH) clinic, with 20 for training, 35 randomized to the intervention arm, and 35 in the control arm. Preliminary data from this study will inform an R01 submission assessing the impact of PST on post-operative functional recovery.\n\nSummary of Objectives:\n\n1. Examine the feasibility of implementing an evidence-based psychosocial intervention, PST, for older surgical patients with depressive symptoms.\n2. Demonstrate the acceptability of the intervention delivery for older surgical patients with depressive symptoms.\n3. Evaluate the potential improvement in function and reduction in depressive symptoms.\n\nSetting:\n\nNinety older adults undergoing major surgery will be recruited at the UTSW POSH clinic during the pre-operative period over a 6-month time frame. UTSW POSH sees 15-20 older surgical patients pre-operatively a week.\n\nRecruitment and Enrollment:\n\nParticipants will be recruited through two pathways - clinician referral and self-referral. (1) Clinician referral: clinicians will refer via recruitment flyer, by the clinic team at the clinic visit, or via email to the study team. (2) Self-referral: recruitment flyers will be utilized in waiting rooms and clinical offices for interested patients to contact the study team.\n\nClinician Referral Details:\n\nClinicians will provide the research team with the patient's name and phone number for recruitment if they believe the patient is experiencing depressive symptoms and has a life expectancy of more than 6 months. The study team will reach out to the patient to recruit them into the study.\n\nEnrollment and Consent:\n\nEnrollment and consent will be conducted over the phone, and consent forms with DocuSign will be sent via email. To reduce discrimination against older adults unfamiliar with the technology, those unable to sign the consent form via DocuSign will be mailed the paper consent form with return postage to sign and send back. Consent will be stored in RedCAP.\n\nTraining of Interventionists:\n\nInterventionists will undergo training with a problem-solving therapy master trainer. Participants will be recruited for this training until all interventionists meet criteria for intervention delivery. Refer to the training participant consent form for details."
