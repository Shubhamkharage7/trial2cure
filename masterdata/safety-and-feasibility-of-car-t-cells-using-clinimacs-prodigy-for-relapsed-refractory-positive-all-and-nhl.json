            "briefSummary": "This pilot study examines the safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR T cells manufactured on-site in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or CD19+ B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nPatients will undergo screening, leukapheresis (cell collection), lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by the anti-CD19 CAR T cell infusion. The lymphodepleting chemotherapy is administered over four days IV to prepare the body for the CAR T cells. The anti-CD19 CAR-T cells are infused between 2-14 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. This study is designed for participants to begin lymphodepleting chemotherapy during the CAR T cell manufacture and receive a fresh cell infusion on the day that manufacturing is complete. Some patients may need more time in between the cell collection and the CAR T cell infusion, therefore, the cells may be manufactured and frozen prior to administration. Patients will be followed for a year after the cell infusion on the study and for up to 15 years to monitor for potential long term side effects of cell therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n* To examine the feasibility of manufacture and administration of autologous CD19 CAR T cells at a minimum target dose of 0.3 x 10\\^6 to 1 x 10\\^6 per kilogram for patients \\<50 kg and a flat dose of 0.3 - 1 x 10\\^8 for patients \u226550 kg using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy automated T Cell Transduction (TCT) process.\n* To evaluate the safety of administration of CD19 CAR T cells after lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n\u2022 To estimate the efficacy of CD19 specific CAR-T cells in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ B-cell ALL and NHL.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\n\u2022 To evaluate the persistence of CD19 CAR T cells after infusion.\n\nThe autologous lymphocytes are collected from the patient via apheresis. The apheresis product is then transported to the on-site GMP facility for manufacture of the CAR T cell product. Patients may be admitted to begin lymphodepleting chemotherapy during the CAR T cell manufacturing process. When the CAR T cell product is ready, the cells may be administered fresh or may be cryopreserved for use at a later date depending on the patient's clinical status.\n\nAll patients will be admitted to the hospital to undergo a Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide based leukoreduction conditioning regimen to be completed 2-14 days prior to CAR T cell infusion. Patients will be admitted for a minimum of 7 days after the CAR T infusion to monitor for toxicity including cytokine release syndrome, neurologic toxicity, and tumor lysis syndrome.\n\nLymphodepleting chemotherapy:\n\n* Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day IV x 4 days\n* Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day IV x 2 days\n\nCD19 CAR T cell dose:\n\n* 0.3 x 10\\^6 to 1 x 10\\^6 per kilogram for patients \\<50 kg\n* Flat dose of 0.3 - 1 x 10\\^8 for patients \u226550 kg"
