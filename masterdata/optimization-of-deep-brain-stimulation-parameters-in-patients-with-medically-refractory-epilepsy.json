This therapy has been shown to be effective in seizure reduction, yet very few patients achieve the ultimate goal of seizure freedom. Implantable neural stimulators (INSs) have many parameters that may be adjusted, and could be tuned to achieve very patient specific therapies. This study will develop a platform for stimulation setting optimization based on power spectral density (PSD) measures."

PS, OS, OS; 2.OS, PS, OS; 3. OS, OS, PS).",
