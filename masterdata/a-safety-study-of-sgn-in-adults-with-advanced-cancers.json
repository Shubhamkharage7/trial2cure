            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial is studying lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer that starts in the blood cells that fight infections. There are several types of lymphoma. This study will enroll people who have lymphoma, such as classical Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma including systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or types of primary cutaneous lymphoma.\n\nThis clinical trial uses a drug called SGN-35T. The study drug is in testing and has not been approved for sale. This is the first time SGN-35T will be used in people. The study drug will be given as an infusion through a vein.\n\nThis study will test the safety of SGN-35T in participants with lymphoma. It will also study the side effects of this drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.\n\nThis study will have three parts. Parts A and B of the study will find out the best dose and dosing schedule for SGN-35T. Part C will use the dose found in parts A and B to find out how safe SGN-35T is and if it works to treat select lymphomas.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of SGN-35T in adults with select relapsed/refractory lymphomas. SGN-35T is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate and will be studied in patients with lymphomas expressing CD30."
