Sessions will also include a mindfulness component, warm up, cool-down, and safety checks. Exercises are personalized to each person's functional status. Intensity of exercises will be determined by participants providing a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) on a scale of 0 (easy) to 10 (very hard) throughout the session. Initial exercise sessions will start at low-intensity and will gradually increase the duration and intensity to allow each person to reach recommended exercise levels at their own pace. Exercises are done virtually via Zoom. Each cohort will have 5-8 participants. The exercise program will be optimized after each cohort with modifications based on participant and exercise expert feedback.",
