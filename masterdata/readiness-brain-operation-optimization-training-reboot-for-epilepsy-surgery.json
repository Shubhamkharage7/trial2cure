            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if new educational program prior to epilepsy surgery can either decrease the risk of cognitive decline after surgery or be a help to those patients who experience a decline after undergoing epilepsy surgery.\n\nParticipants will participate in 2 individual virtual sessions and 4 virtual group sessions over the course of 5-6 weeks prior to their epilepsy surgery. They will asked to fill out online surveys and questionnaires at various times throughout the study, up to 12 months after their surgery.\n\nTo see if the educational program works, researchers will compare those participating in the educational program with those that are receiving the standard epilepsy care prior to surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this prospective, controlled, randomized study, the researchers aim to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a cognitive intervention in those with epilepsy. They will implement a novel prehabilitation program for patients who have been recommended for epilepsy surgery and will track retention, and adherence to understand the feasibility of the program. Researchers will gather patient data regarding satisfaction with the prehabilitation program and elicit qualitative feedback from patients to further refine the program. To assess intervention efficacy, researchers will compare patients who undergo the prehabilitation program to a treatment-as-usual control group on outcome measures related to quality of life, compensatory strategy use, psychosocial factors, and surgical satisfaction.\n\nThe study team will accomplish these objectives by comparing participants that are randomly assigned to the ReBOOT intervention arm (2 individual, virtual sessions and 4 virtual, group sessions over the course of 5-6 weeks) to those participants assigned to the control arm (standard epilepsy care). Researchers will measure the effects and feasibility of the intervention through the use attendance tracking, homework adherence, and health and quality of life questionnaires."
