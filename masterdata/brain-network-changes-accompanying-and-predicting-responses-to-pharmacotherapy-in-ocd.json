Matched healthy control participants will be imaged with one fMRI at baseline as a no-treatment comparison group; and\n2. a randomized, double-blind group of unmedicated OCD participants who will be assigned to begin either immediate or placebo-delayed treatment, and who will be imaged with fMRIs at baseline and over the course of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine.\n\nHypothesis-driven analyses and exploratory analyses will be performed in parallel.\n\nThis study will address the following Specific Aims:\n\n1. Identification of neural dysconnectivity associated with OCD symptomatology.\n2. Characterizing neural markers of clinical response to SSRI pharmacotherapy.\n3. Mapping neural predictors of clinical response to pharmacotherapy."
