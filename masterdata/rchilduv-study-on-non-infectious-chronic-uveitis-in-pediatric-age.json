            "briefSummary": "Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the uvea, one of the highly vascularized fundamental structures of the eye. It is a rare condition in children, with an incidence in the pediatric population ranging from 2% to 14% of all uveitis cases. The diagnosis and management of patients with uveitis rely on a multidisciplinary approach involving an ophthalmologist, a rheumatologist, and an infectious disease specialist to establish the correct diagnosis and assess the involvement of other organs. In Italy, there is no national or regional registry for non-infectious chronic uveitis as per the Prime Ministerial Decree (DPCM) of March 3, 2017 (Identification of surveillance systems and registries for mortality, tumors, and other diseases). However, many clinical centers adopt data recording systems to evaluate the quality of care and to study diseases and outcomes. The Universitary Hospital Meyer Institute Research Hospital (IRCCS) is a national referral center for managing these pediatric cases of non-infectious chronic uveitis, estimated to constitute 95% of all pediatric uveitis cases"
