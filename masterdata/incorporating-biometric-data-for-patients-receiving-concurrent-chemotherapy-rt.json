The investigators hypothesize that a practical workflow could be created within a busy community RO practice that will allow providers and patients to readily appreciate physiologic declines during concurrent CRT.\n\nSubjects will be asked to wear a device as part of this study that will collect their biometric data (heart rate, number of steps taken per day, etc) called a WHT device throughout their treatment and for 4 weeks afterward. Subjects will be asked to upload the data from their devices onto the computers in the clinic for the assessment."
