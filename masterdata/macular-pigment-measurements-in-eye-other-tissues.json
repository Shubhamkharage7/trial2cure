The investigators propose to study this by validating and correlating various non-invasive measurement methods of carotenoid concentrations in the human eye and skin tissue.\n\nA secondary objective is to correlate blood levels of carotenoids on a sub-set of participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "The macula of the human retina (the structure responsible for high acuity vision essential for reading, driving and recognizing faces) is colored an intense yellow due to the deposition of two carotenoid compounds, lutein and zeaxanthin. These xanthophyll carotenoids are derived exclusively from the diet, and are hypothesized to protect the macula from light-induced oxidative damage by virtue of their light-screening and antioxidant properties.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that high dietary intake and blood levels of lutein and zeaxanthin are associated with lower rates of vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\nIt is of interest to correlate carotenoid levels in the eye and skin tissues with blood levels of carotenoid compounds."
