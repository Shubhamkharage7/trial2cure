            "detailedDescription": "Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and severe psychiatric disorder. Currently, many youth with OCD are treated with medication, such as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI); however, only a subset of them responds to SRI. Data show that the addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to SRI partial responders is effective although extended SRI use with CBT can attenuate combined treatment outcomes. This placebo-controlled study will enroll pediatric OCD patients to examine if those who benefit from CBT augmentation can discontinue their SRI successfully without relapse over 24-weeks. This study will also bank genomic samples for future analysis when polygenic risk scores for OCD may become available.\n\nThis study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase I, all participants will receive a web-based CBT for 12 to 18 weeks. At the end of Phase I, those who achieve wellness indicated by CY-BOCS \u2264 12 and \u2265 50% reduction since baseline for 3 consecutive weeks, will go on to the next phase. In Phase II, participants will be randomized into two groups: 1) Continued SRI and 2) Discontinuation titration to placebo. In this phase, all participants will receive web-based CBT maintenance sessions and attend medication visits for 24 weeks. At 12 months after the end of Phase II, all participants will complete a follow-up assessment."
