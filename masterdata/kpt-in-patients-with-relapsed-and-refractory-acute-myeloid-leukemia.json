NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolic scavenging pathway that utilizes nicotinamide to replenish nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), an essential metabolic cofactor and second messenger. Recent investigations have shown that in in vitro and in vivo models, NAMPT is uniquely essential for relapsed or refractory AML stem cells. Targeting relapsed AML stem cells, through targeting of NAMPT, may allow for a promising therapeutic opportunity for patients with relapsed or refractory AML."
