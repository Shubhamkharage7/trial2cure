Serial organs include named arteries and nerves, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract.",
            "detailedDescription": "STUDY DESIGN: For each serial OAR, we expect that 10% or less of reirradiated patients will have a Grade 3-5 toxicity. Under this assumption, 15 patients treated at a defined OAR will provide a 90% confidence interval (CI) for the Grade 3-5 OAR toxicity rate with a CI width no larger than 29%. A total of 120 treated patients (15 per OAR) are needed to provide this level of precision for toxicity rates within all 8 OARs (spinal cord, brachial plexus, named vessels, esophagus, duodenum, rectum, proximal bronchus/trachea, liver).\n\nFor each OAR, the numbers of patients reirradiated and Grade 3-5 toxicities among them will be tabulated. The Grade 3-5 toxicity rate among treated patients will be estimated separately for each OAR using the sample proportion and a 90% Wilson score confidence interval. Only patients who initiate re-irradiation therapy will be included in this analysis."
