            "detailedDescription": "Once participants are consented and checked in for the procedure, researchers will obtain the randomization assignment from a REDCap database with a randomization module designed by the study statistician. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either virtual reality or standard of care.\n\nResearchers will collect participant vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and SpO2) at check in, laying down on the table, in the midst of the procedure, and after the procedure is complete. After the procedure is completed, all participants will be given two surveys about satisfaction with the experience to complete. Researchers will record any medications the participants takes the day of the procedure. Researchers will then gather demographic data from the participant's chart through Epic (age, height, weight, BMI, race, ethnicity, past medical history, and procedure information). All study data will be stored in a secure REDcap database. Researchers have teamed up with members of the anesthesia department at Mayo Clinic Florida who have performed similar studies utilizing the virtual reality headsets. The department has three virtual reality headsets and know how to operate them.\n\nThe participants who are selected to use the virtual reality device will be viewing calming narrated scenarios with relaxing music of walking through a forest, along a beach, through a chinese garden, a winter landscape or taking off in a spaceship or snorkeling through a reef."
