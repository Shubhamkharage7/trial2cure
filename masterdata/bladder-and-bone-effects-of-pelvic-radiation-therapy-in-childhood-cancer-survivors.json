The overarching hypothesis is that patients who received EBRT to the pelvis will have an increased rate of LUT dysfunction and osteoporosis even when controlled for chemotherapeutic exposures, using patients with similar chemotherapy regimens as controls. Between these two groups, the team expect to observe significant differences in both patient-reported outcomes and direct measures of LUT function."
