Subjects in this study will have their blood glucose measured regularly every 1-3 hours with current methods in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU), and by Point of Care (POC) fingerstick glucose using the Accucheck Inform II on the regular floors, and the CGMS reading at the same time will be captured. Subjects will have measurements taken throughout their stay in the CVICU and on the regular floors. Agreement and correlation between systems, as well as errors, will be calculated.",
