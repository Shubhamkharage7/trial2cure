            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial evaluates manual lymphatic drainage breast massage for reducing treatment-related side effects in women undergoing radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery for breast cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized). Breast conserving surgery can be an effective treatment option for early stage breast cancer, but it can also be associated with side effects including fluid collection in tissues/swelling (lymphedema), pain, reduced quality of life, and poorer body image. Manual lymphatic drainage is a gentle massage technique used to reduce swelling. It may be a safe and effective way to reduce treatment-related side effects in women receiving radiation therapy after surgery for localized breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate the feasibility of breast manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) on breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant breast radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the tolerability of breast manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) on breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant breast radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery.\n\nII. Preliminarily assess the effect on acute and chronic breast edema, pain, functional status, quality of life, body image and radiation induced fibrosis (RIF).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo MLD breast massage over 30-60 minutes twice a week (BIW) for the duration of standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy and for 1 month thereafter.\n\nAfter completion of SOC radiation therapy, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months."
