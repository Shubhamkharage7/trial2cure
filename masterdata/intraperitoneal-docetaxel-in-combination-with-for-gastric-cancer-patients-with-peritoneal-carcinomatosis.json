            "detailedDescription": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States and has a five-year survival of 40% after surgical resection. Metastatic gastric cancer has an even poorer prognosis and most patients die within the first year of diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease due to non-specific or lack of symptomatology and treatment options are then limited to systemic chemotherapy. The peritoneum is the most frequent site of metastasis as well as cancer recurrence. Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC) results in adverse clinical sequelae and is ultimately responsible for 60% of all gastric cancer-related deaths. While visceral metastases originating from primary gastric cancer are relatively chemosensitive, peritoneal carcinomatosis is particularly challenging to treat because of inadequate drug delivery from systemic circulation. The primary purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of administering intraperitoneal docetaxel in conjunction with the standard of care treatment regimen of intravenous mFOLFOX6 (5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) in patients with primary gastric cancer with gross peritoneal carcinomatosis."
