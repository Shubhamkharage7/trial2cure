This is a single-arm open-label feasibility study, enrolling older adults with Alzheimer's disease risk factors in a public health, community-deployed, group-based and individualized multimodal Brain Health Program (targeting, among other domains, diet, exercise and cognitive exercise), with a set of baseline assessments intended to characterize the population, and outcome measure to evaluate the usability of the program, as well as preliminary efficacy to reduce dementia risk factors."

Those who respond with a score of 9 to 10 are called Promoters, and are considered likely to exhibit value-creating behaviors, such as making more positive referrals to other potential program participants. Those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors, and they are believed to be less likely to exhibit the value-creating behaviors. Responses of 7 and 8 are labeled Passives, and their behavior falls between Promoters and Detractors. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. For purposes of calculating a Net Promoter Score, Passives count toward the total number of respondents, thus decreasing the percentage of detractors and promoters and pushing the net score toward 0.",
