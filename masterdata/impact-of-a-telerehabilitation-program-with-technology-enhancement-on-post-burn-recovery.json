We hypothesize that with the implementation of a novel telerehabilitation program incorporating technology enhancement, range of motion and quality of life can be improved. To test the hypothesis in future grant applications, this pilot study will be used to determine feasibility, collect preliminary data, vet endpoints, and gain patient feedback. To achieve these necessary goals, we will compare two methods of supporting home performance of prescribed physical and occupational therapy: Standard (S): patients will be equipped with paper instructions for their physical therapy exercises; and Technology-Enhanced (TE) support: patients will be given paper instructions, set up with a habit and productivity application (Avocation) that gamifies tasks and tracks achievements, a Fitbit activity tracker, a logbook, and have virtual movement therapy once weekly with an exercise physiologist for a total of four weeks.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine whether range of motion is altered with TE. Range of motion in the affected joint(s) will be measured by goniometry (self-reported by patient and measured by study staff in the clinic)\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To determine whether TE with prescribed movement affects scar, pain, and quality of life."
