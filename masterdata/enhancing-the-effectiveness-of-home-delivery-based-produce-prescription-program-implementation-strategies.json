The objectives of this study are two-fold: (a) to examine utilization of food basket contents and improvements in diet quality in this home delivery based PPRx program, and (b) to evaluate if and the extent to which utilization of food basket contents outcomes improves with support from an interactive AI-based conversational agent to convert food into healthy meals."
