Prolonged sitting is associated with decreased kidney function and increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and death.\n* In a previous pilot study funded by NIH, it was shown that a Sit Less, Interact and Move More (SLIMM) intervention targeting sedentary behavior in people with kidney disease was able to decrease prolonged sitting but that effect was not sustained.\n* Therefore, the researchers are currently conducting a follow-up study named Sit Less, Interact and Move More (SLIMM) 2.\n* This NIH funded study is conducted at the University of Utah and Stanford University.\n* The purpose of this study is to see if guided resistance training (to improve muscle strength) and semaglutide (FDA approved diabetes and weight loss medication that might also improve physical function) can boost adherence to the SLIMM Intervention and reduce sedentary behavior."
