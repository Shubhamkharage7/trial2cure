Females of child bearing potential must agree to continue using contraception throughout the study and for 1 month after the last dose of patiromer.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nThe following criteria exclude a subject from participating in this trial:\n\n* Preterm birth infants with \\<37 weeks of gestation cannot be included in Cohort 3.\n* Participants who due to their general condition, e.g., anaemia or low body weight, are not suitable to have blood volume withdrawn.\n* Any of the following renal conditions: maintenance haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, renal artery stenosis, and acute kidney injury (defined by 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) or a history of acute renal insufficiency in the past 3 months. Note: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not excluded.\n* A history of or current diagnosis of a severe gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis or surgery that could affect GI transit of the drug (delayed gastric emptying), such as a severe swallowing disorder, severe gastroesophageal reflux, uncorrected pyloric stenosis, intussusception, any other intestinal obstruction (e.g., Hirschsprung disease, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, clinically significant postsurgical abdominal adhesions) or any gut-shortening surgical procedure prior to screening. Pre-gastric above-mentioned pathologies may be disregarded in case of existence of a PEG or entero-gastric feeding tube, as the PEG or entero-gastric feeding tube will serve for nutrition and investigational product administration.\n* Active cancer, currently on cancer treatment, or history of cancer in the past 2 years (except for non-melanoma skin cancer).\n* Recipient of any organ transplant requiring treatment with immunosuppressive therapy or scheduled for kidney transplant procedure during the first 28 days after Day 1.\n* History of sudden infant death in a sibling (only for participants \\<2 years of age at screening).\n* Use of the following medications if doses have not been stable for at least 14 days prior to screening or if doses are anticipated to change during the 4-week PD/ dose-ranging period: digoxin, bronchodilators, theophylline, heparins (including low molecular heparins), tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, trimethoprim, or cotrimoxazole.\n* Use of any investigational product for an unapproved indication within 30 days prior to screening or within 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.\n* Known hypersensitivity to patiromer or its components.\n* If the child is being breastfed:\n\n  1. There is suspicion of current alcohol or substance misuse/abuse in breastfeeding mother\n  2. The breastfeeding mother is taking potassium supplements\n\nOther protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply",
