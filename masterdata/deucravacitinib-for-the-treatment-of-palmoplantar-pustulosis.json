In the first stage, 8 patients will be accrued. If 2 or fewer patients achieve a ppPASI-50 in these 8 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 10 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 18.\n\nAnalysis Plan: Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the study population, including demographics, disease characteristics and previous treatments. For the primary outcome, the percentage of participants who achieve a ppPASI-50 response, or at least 50% improvement in ppPASI score, at 16 weeks, the response rate with a 95% CI will be calculated. For all secondary endpoints, summary and descriptive statistics will be used as appropriate , including number of observations, calculation of mean/median, standard deviation range and 95% confidence intervals."
