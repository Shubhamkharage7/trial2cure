A prehabilitation program may improve the quality of life after surgery for patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the baseline difference in objective frailty measurements in patients with advanced ovarian cancer clinically deemed acceptable for primary surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nII. To evaluate level of adherence and retention of patients with advanced ovarian cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a prehabilitation program.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Will examine longitudinal trends and variability in function by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) over time and in response to the intervention.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT 1: Patients undergoing primary surgical intervention complete surveys, undergo computed tomography (CT), and undergo collection of blood samples at baseline.\n\nCOHORT 2: Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy complete physical activity for 30 minutes per day 3 times a week. Patients receive nutritional supplement drink up to 4.5 times daily, and complete Resilient Living program in-person or remotely over 60 minutes. Patients also undergo CT scans throughout the trial.\n\nCOHORT 3: Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy complete physical activity remotely for 30 minutes per day 3 times a week. Patients receive nutritional supplement drink up to 4.5 times daily. Patients also undergo health coaching remotely for 60 minutes weekly, complete Resilient Living program remotely over 60 minutes, and may wear a FitBit throughout the study."
