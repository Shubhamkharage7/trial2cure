            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMore than 130 primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) have been identified. Most affect less than 1,000 people in the United States each year. Because these tumors are so rare, there are few proven therapies. This study will test whether the immunotherapy drug nivolumab is an effective treatment for people with rare CNS tumors.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo learn if stimulating the immune system using the drug nivolumab can shrink tumors in people with rare CNS (brain or spine) tumors or increase the time it takes for these tumors to grow or spread.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults whose rare CNS tumor has returned.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened:\n\n* Heart and blood tests\n* Physical and neurological exam\n* Hepatitis tests\n* Pregnancy test\n* MRI. They will lay in a machine that takes pictures.\n* Tumor tissue sample. This can be from a previous procedure.\n\nAt the start of the study, participants will have blood tests. They will answer questions about their symptoms and their quality of life.\n\nParticipants will get nivolumab in a vein every 2 weeks for up to 64 weeks.\n\nParticipants will have monthly blood tests. Every other month they will have an MRI and a neurologic function test. They will also answer questions about their quality of life.\n\nGenetic tests will be done on participants' tumor tissue. Participants will be contacted if any clinically important results are found.\n\nAfter treatment ends, participants will be monitored for up to 5 years. They will have a series of MRIs and neurological function tests. They will be asked to report any symptoms they experience....",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* There are more than 130 identified primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Most have an annual incidence of less than 1000 in the United States.\n* Given the rarity of each of the tumors listed above, there is a paucity of proven therapies. Most of these neoplasms are treated with maximum surgical resection followed by treatment with external beam radiotherapy. With few exceptions (medulloblastoma, adult ependymoma), there are no effective systemic regimens and even in chemotherapy sensitive disease, most patients with recurrence eventually have no remaining salvage treatments available.\n* In the setting of this unmet need, we propose to create a basket protocol that will evaluate the efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with refractory rare central nervous system neoplasms.\n* This study seeks to establish effective therapies at recurrence in patients with rare CNS tumors. We hypothesize that this therapy will improve progression free survival and/or objective responses.\n* It will be important to determine whether any determined survival benefit is associated with improvements in symptoms or does a worsening of symptoms offset the increase in survival. Precedence exists for measuring non-therapeutic endpoints in oncology research, and specifically in studies evaluating therapeutic benefit in patients with CNS tumors. There have been efforts in neuro-oncology to evaluate secondary endpoints using validated instruments as an additional indicator of benefit. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) and Spine Tumor Module (MDASI-SP) allow for the self-reporting of symptom severity and interference with daily activities for patients with either brain or spinal cord tumors. The availability of validated instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the impact of treatment, both positive and negative, on patients.\n\nObjective:\n\nDetermine the efficacy of nivolumab in a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central nervous system tumors as measured by disease control rate (confirmed CR/PR or durable SD for at least 6 months).\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Documented recurrent or progressive disease that corresponds to one of the tumors eligible for testing.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.\n* Karnofsky Performance greater than or equal to 70%.\n* Tumor tissue available for central review to confirm morphologic diagnosis\n* Tumor tissue or slides must be available for central molecular and immune profiling.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is an open label phase II clinical trial. Patients will be treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, at a standard dose of 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) for cycles 1 through 2, then doses of 480 mg every 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) for a total of 14 additional doses (cycles). A maximum of 18 treatments will be given (64 weeks).\n* A cycle will be defined as 4 weeks and patients will undergo efficacy assessments using MR imaging (and/or other imaging tests if applicable) every 2 cycles. Toxicity assessments will occur before the initiation of each cycle and patient outcomes measures (PROs) will be completed at the time of each imaging study (every 2 cycles) but prior to the patient being informed of the imaging results.\n* After completion of the planned treatment course or if treatment was stopped because of toxicity, patients will undergo imaging evaluations and PRO measurements every 8 weeks (or 2 months) for one year, then every 3 months for the next year, then every 4\n\nmonths for the next year and then every 6 months while the patient remains on the protocol. Patients off treatment because of disease progression will not undergo future imaging or PRO assessments on this protocol.\n\n* Bayesian Optimal Phase 2 design (BOP2), will be used to conduct this phase II trial in patients with a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central nervous system tumors.\n* The study will be comprised of 2 disease cohorts: heavily pretreated (defined as having received 3 or more prior therapies) and non-heavily pretreated (defined as having received up to 2 prior therapies). Each cohort will be evaluated\n\nindependently for efficacy."

WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n\nNOTE: Based on the evidence cited in Nivolumab IB ver. 20, given that nivolumab is not a genotoxic agent, and that relevant systemic concentrations sufficient to produce a risk of fetal toxicity are not expected in WOCBP partners from exposure to a male participant s seminal fluid, male study participants will not be required to use contraceptive measures and/or a latex or other synthetic condom during sexual activity with a WOCBP partner.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Prior use of an immunotherapy such as (but not limited to) a vaccine therapy, dendritic cell vaccine, other checkpoint inhibitors, or intracavitary or convectional enhanced delivery of chemotherapy.\n* Prior or concurrent malignancy unless its natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen.\n* Severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:\n\n  * Unstable angina within the last 6 months prior to Step 2 registration.\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to Step 2 registration.\n  * Evidence of recent myocardial infarction or ischemia by the findings of S-T elevations of \\>= 2 mm using the analysis of an EKG performed within 14 days prior to Step 2 registration.\n  * New York Heart Association grade II or greater congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within 12 months prior to Step 2 registration.\n  * History of stroke, cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Step 2 registration, with the exception of pericavitary ischemia due to tumor resection.\n  * Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia.\n  * Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection) or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.\n  * Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.\n  * Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture or history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Step 2 registration, with the exception of the craniotomy for tumor resection.\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration.\n  * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration.\n  * Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects.\n  * Known acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude participants with AIDS is based on the lack of information regarding the safety of nivolumab in patients with active HIV infection.\n  * Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma, which in the opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for immunologic toxicity.\n* Participants with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to participants with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome or CIDP, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn s, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and participants with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease.\n\nOf note, participants with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Participants with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible. However, patients with vitiligo, diabetes mellitus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis on appropriate replacement therapy may be enrolled.\n\n* Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol therapy.\n* Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction: History of allergy to study drug components.\n* Pregnancy or lactating females due to possible adverse effects on the developing fetus or infant due to study drug. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to Step 2 registration.\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.\n* Participants unable to have MRIs.",
