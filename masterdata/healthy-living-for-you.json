            "detailedDescription": "The study objectives are to recruit and empower Black Healthy Living with Diabetes (HLWD) facilitators to deliver culturally tailored HLWD content and pilot the culturally tailored HLWD program, using the RE-AIM framework and Proctor implementation outcomes to gather preliminary implementation data. The study team will partner with stakeholders and community organizations serving Black adults, including Grace Fellowship Church and YMCA of Metropolitan Milwaukee. The central hypothesis is that the cultural tailoring of HLWD will increase the reach, adoption, implementation, and effectiveness of HLWD among Black adults.\n\nThe study aims are:\n\n1. Co-design a culturally relevant approach to the recruitment and training of Black HLWD facilitators. The study team will partner with a stakeholder advisory board including:\n\n   * (1) Black adults with diabetes (prior HLWD participants)\n   * (2) Black community leaders\n   * (3) current Black HLWD facilitators, and\n   * (4) current HLWD program providers (organizational leaders in settings delivering HLWD to Black adults)\n\n   to co-design: (a) an asset-based approach to recruiting Black facilitators and (b) an adjunct training that empowers the facilitator to use a culturally relevant approach to deliver HLWD content to Black adults.\n2. Implement the culturally tailored HLWD program among Black adults. Using a mixed methods design, the investigators will assess recruitment/retention rates among Black adults (reach), feasibility of adoption among facilitators and program providers (adoption), participant adherence, fidelity of enactment and acceptability, fidelity of program delivery by facilitators (implementation), and pre-post impact on diabetes outcomes (effectiveness)."
