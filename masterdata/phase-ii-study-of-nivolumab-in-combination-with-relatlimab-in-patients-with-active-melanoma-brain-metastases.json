Acceptable samples include core-needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions. Fine Needle Aspirations (FNA) will not be considered acceptable for tissue procurement.\n   * Tumor tissue from bone metastases is not evaluable for PD-L1 expression and is therefore not acceptable.\n   * However, if repeat biopsy is not feasible, and no archival tissue available patient still may be enrolled.\n7. Prior SRT and prior excision of up to 5 MBM is permitted if there has been complete recovery, with no neurologic sequelae, and measurable non irradiated lesions remain.\n8. Growth or change in a lesion previously irradiated will not be considered measurable.

Prior whole brain radiation is not allowed.\n4. Brain lesion size \\> 3 cm.\n5. Prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy in the metastatic setting\n\n   \u2022 Patients who received ipilimumab and/or anti-PD1 as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy must have a 6-month washout before receiving any dosing on this study.\n6. Subjects with an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.\n7. Subjects with major medical, neurologic or psychiatric condition who are judged as unable to fully comply with study therapy or assessments should not be enrolled.\n8. Subject has a history of a second malignancy, unless potentially curative treatment has been completed with no evidence of malignancy for 2 years. Note: The time requirement does not apply to participants who underwent successful treatment of superficial bladder cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other in-situ cancers. Subjects with a completely treated prior malignancy and no evidence of disease for \u2265 2 years are eligible.\n\n   a. Skin Cancer Exclusion: Please note that basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is exempt from needing resection prior to treatment. (Resection can be completed after the start of treatment).\n9. Has a known history of or is positive for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\] RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n\n   a. NOTE: Without known history, testing needs to be performed to determine eligibility. Hepatitis C antibody (Ab) testing is allowed for screening purposes in countries where HCV RNA is not part of standard of care.\n10. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n11. The use of corticosteroids is not allowed for 10 days prior to initiation of therapy (based upon 5 times the expected half-life of dexamethasone) except patients who are taking steroids for physiological replacement. If alternative corticosteroid therapy has been used, consultation with the PI is required to determine the washout period prior to initiating study treatment.\n12. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\u2264 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study initiation. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses \\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n13. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy (excluding skin cancer resection), or significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating study drug (unless the wound has healed) or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study.\n14. Non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.\n15. Women who are breast-feeding or pregnant.\n16. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (i.e., active infection \u2265 grade 2) or concurrent condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study endpoints or the subject's ability to participate.\n17. History of clinically significant cardiac disease or congestive heart failure \\> New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2. Subjects must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new-onset angina within the last 3 months or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months or a history of myocarditis.\n18. Troponin T (TnT) or I (TnI) \\> 2 \u00d7 institutional ULN. Participants with TnT or TnI levels between \\> 1 to 2 \u00d7 ULN will be permitted if repeat levels within 24 hours are \u2264 1 ULN. If TnT or TnI levels are between \\>1 to 2 \u00d7 ULN within 24 hours, the participant may undergo a cardiac consultation and be considered for treatment, following cardiologist recommendation. When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test should be conducted as soon as possible. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are \\< 2 \u00d7 ULN, the participant may undergo a cardiac consultation and be considered for treatment, following cardiologist recommendation. Notification of the decision to enroll the participant following cardiologist recommendation has to be made to the principal investigator.\n19. Investigational drug use within 14 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) of the first dose of nivolumab and relatlimab.\n20.
