Parent coaches will advise parents of children with IMV awaiting hospital discharge on strategies for advocating for home nursing. Parents and parent coaches will meet as needed and engagement will be tailored to parent preference: text messaging, video or phone conferencing, or in-person visiting in the family home or hospital. Points of contact, issues addressed, and time required will be collected as needs assessment data to appropriately size and scale a future intervention. Enrollment and exit assessments will include completion of the Family Empowerment Scale (FES) and a brief structured interview about parents' perceived impact and acceptability, which will provide pilot data to inform a future intervention. The investigator hypothesizes that parents will gain self-advocacy skills specific to recruiting home health nurses and improve the size of their home nursing workforce through this coaching model."
