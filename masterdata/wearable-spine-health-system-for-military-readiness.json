            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational trial is to compare the health history and motion capabilities of participants with low back pain disorders to participants with healthy spines. The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are to:\n\n1. Primary outcomes of this research effort include the development of composite measures or digital biomarkers to track functional recovery over time and predict duty or work status outcomes (return-to-full duty/work, limited duty/work restrictions or medical discharge/long-term disability).\n2. Secondary outcomes of this research effort include characterization of motion assessment utility to predict reinjury risk and evaluate intervention effectiveness. In addition, exploratively, the investigators will determine biopsychosocial profiles of low back pain, and neck pain military populations to identify low back and neck pain phenotypes.\n\nParticipants will complete questionnaires and wear a motion monitor that will assess the participant's back and/or neck. This session will be approximately 40-70 minutes. The research team will follow up with participants at 3 month, 6 months, and 1 year to complete a short series of questionnaires and a motion assessment test."
