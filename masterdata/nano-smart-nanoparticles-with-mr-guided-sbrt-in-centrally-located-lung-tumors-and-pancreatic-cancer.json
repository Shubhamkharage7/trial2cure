            "detailedDescription": "This is a seamless phase I/II trial with two separate disease groups/cohorts (centrally located lung tumors and locally advanced/unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-LAPC). The Phase I part is determining for each disease group a safe dose-level that will be evaluated in the Phase II component of the study. The phase II part of the study is a randomized controlled trial that tests, for each disease group, the treatment efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in combination with AGuIX gadolinium-chelated polysiloxane based nanoparticles compared to treatment with stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR)-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) alone\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Activation and Guidance of Irradiation X (AGuIX) as a treatment for any disease.\n\nAGuIX is a gadolinium-based nanoparticle, gadolinium is the drug used for an MR with contrast. It is believed that the AGuIX may help the radiation received work better by making a tumor more sensitive to the radiation and allowing doctors to see the tumor more clearly. AGuIX has been tested in one previous study with humans. It was found that AGuIX did make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for 5 treatment days and will be followed for a year after your treatment ends.\n\nIt is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study."

Tumors that are immediately adjacent (\\<1 cm) to mediastinal or pericardial pleura or other radiation-sensitive organs such as the esophagus and brachial plexus also are considered central tumors and are eligible for this protocol.\n\nOR Histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head, body or tail.\n\n* Participants must have measurable disease, defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as \u226520 mm with conventional techniques or as \u226510 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n\nEligible NSCLC patients must have no evidence of nodal involvement (N0), and disease has to be determined unresectable by a thoracic oncologist or the patient is medically inoperable.\n\n* Locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer as determined by a pancreaticobiliary surgeon as part of a multidisciplinary discussion at the investigative site, including multi-phasic CT demonstrating tumor abutment of the SMA or celiac axis, SMV or PV involvement which is not resectable without vascular reconstruction.\n* Completion of at least 3 months of standard induction chemotherapy for LAPC, which should consist of either FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, or another standard combination of induction chemotherapy agent, with a washout period no longer than 10 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n* No evidence of distant metastasis.\n* Pancreatic or central NSCLC size \u2264 5cm.\n* Age 18 years or older.\n* ECOG performance status \u22642 (Karnofsky \u226560%, see Appendix A).\n* Ability to understand and follow the breathing instructions involved in the respiratory gating procedure.\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count \u22651,500/mcL\n  * platelets \u2265100,000/mcL\n  * total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u22642.5 \u00d7 institutional upper limit of normal\n  * creatinine within normal institutional limits OR\n* Creatinine clearance \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n* The effects of AGuIX on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, as well as the known teratogenic effects of radiation, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have had prior radiation therapy to the chest or abdomen that would overlap with the current treatment field.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants with known metastatic disease.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to gadolinium-based IV contrast.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AGuIX is contrast agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AGuIX, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AGuIX.\n* Severe claustrophobia or anxiety.\n* Known HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AGuIX. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Active duodenal or gastric ulcer disease or evidence of tumor invasion of the bowel or stomach based on endoscopy.\n* Presence of a duodenal stent.\n* Unable to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to any of the following:\n\n  1. Presence of MRI-incompatible metal material or devices in the human body\n  2. MRI-incompatible Pacemaker or defibrillator\n  3. Insulin pump\n  4. Aneurysm clip\n  5. Artificial heart valve\n  6. Cochlear implant\n  7. Shrapnel or gunshot injury\n  8. Cataract surgery with implant unsafe for MRI",
