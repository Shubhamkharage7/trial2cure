Durvalumab (Imfinzi) and stereotactic radiotherapy, with each fraction of radiotherapy is given every other day on a standard stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) schedule or every four weeks on the personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR) schedule. Subjects will be followed for a period of 2 years after completion of treatment or until death, whichever occurs first. Specifically, subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months following treatment. After the 2 year follow up, the patient can continue routine follow up with their physicians, per standard of care. Subjects removed from therapy for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event."

(Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer-related conditions \\[e.g., insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy\\] is acceptable. Local treatment of isolated lesions, excluding target lesions, for palliative intent is acceptable \\[e.g., by local surgery or radiotherapy\\])\n      * Immunosuppressive medications including, but not limited to, systemic corticosteroids at doses exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 blockers.\n\n        * Immunosuppressive medications should not be given concomitantly, or used for premedication prior to the IO infusions. The following are allowed exceptions:\n\n          1. Use of immunosuppressive medications for the management of IP-related AEs,\n          2. Use in patients with contrast allergies.\n          3. In addition, use of inhaled, topical, and intranasal corticosteroids is permitted.\n        * A temporary period of steroids will be allowed if clinically indicated and considered to be essential for the management of non-immunotherapy related events experienced by the patient (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, radiation, nausea, etc.).\n      * EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) should not be given concomitantly, and should be used with caution in the 90 days post last dose of durvalumab. Increased incidences of pneumonitis (with third generation EGFR TKIs) and increased incidence of transaminase increases (with 1st generation EGFR TKIs) has been reported when durvalumab has been given concomitantly.\n      * Live attenuated vaccines should not be given through 30 days after the last dose of IP (including SoC)\n      * Herbal and natural remedies which may have immune-modulating effects should not be given concomitantly unless agreed by the sponsor",
