Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Paxalisib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses."
