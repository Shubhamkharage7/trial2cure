It is important to diagnose and treat STIs in a timely manner to prevent health complications and reduce transmissions. The purpose of this study is to understand whether gay and bisexual men living with HIV are willing to collect and return specimens for bacterial STI testing when combined with live audio/video (AV) conferencing support.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be recruited from across the US via social media advertising and peer referral. Seventy-five participants that complete an online survey (called the baseline survey) will be asked to attend a pre-test live AV conferencing session, collect and return a urine sample, a throat swab, a rectal swab, and a blood sample for bacterial STI testing, attend a post-test live AV conferencing session, and complete another online survey (called the satisfaction survey). Some participants (20 of 75) will also be invited to attend an online interview to share study-related experiences."
