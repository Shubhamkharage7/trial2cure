After enrollment and informed consent, participants will receive two separate doses of psilocybin in conjunction with preparatory and post-psilocybin therapy sessions. Each psilocybin session will last approximately 8 hours and will be facilitated by two trained session facilitators. Before the first psilocybin session, participants will meet with one or both of the session facilitators for a total of 6-8 hours of contact time (or up to 4 meetings) before the first psilocybin session day. Two post psilocybin therapy session visits will follow Psilocybin Sessions 1 and 2. Psilocybin Sessions 1 and 2 will occur about two weeks apart. Follow-up visits will occur 1 and 2 weeks and 1, 3, and 6 months after the final psilocybin session, with additional contact hours scheduled as needed. Thus, the intervention and follow-up requires at least 13 visits over a period of about 8-10 months."
