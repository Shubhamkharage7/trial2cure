The primary aims are to evaluate the effects of psilocybin on AUD; measures will include 1) fMRI neural activation and functional connectivity, using a well-validated task to characterize neural and subjective response to negative affective and alcohol visual stimuli; 2) alcohol use data (self-report and blood biomarkers); and 3) self-report measures related the NE, IS, and EF domains."

Have a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) \u2264 0.01% at screening, as determined by a breath alcohol reading from a calibrated breath alcohol sensor. (Note: this criterion may be re-evaluated within the 30-day screening period. This criterion will also be reassessed at Baseline, on Day 0, and on Day 2.

Are able to read, speak, and understand English, as documented during the informed consent process.\n\n   a. Non-English speaking subjects will be excluded because the study is using only validated English-language versions of assessment instruments.\n4.

Able to provide at least 2 locators.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnancy or lactation\n2. Any medical condition that would preclude safe participation in the study, including the following, as determined by medical history review, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests:\n\n   a.

(Note: participants who otherwise qualify at the Screening visit will have 3 opportunities to produce 1 blood pressure reading \u2264 140/90 mmHg (each reading will be collected at least 15 minutes apart). If blood pressure the Screening visit is consistently elevated \\> 140/90 mmHg across all 3 attempts, participants may be referred to their primary care provider for management of hypertension. Upon management of blood pressure, participants will have an opportunity to return once within the 30 day screening window to make 3 additional attempts at a blood pressure reading \u2264 140/90 mmHg. Participants will be considered eligible upon registering 1 blood pressure reading \u2264 140/90 mmHg during the Screening period.) v. Resting heart rate \\> 100 bpm (Note: participants will have an opportunity to return once within the 30 day screening window to make 3 additional attempts at a resting heart rate \u2264 100 bpm.).\n\n   vi. Serious ECG abnormalities present on the ECG obtained on Day -65 (e.g., evidence of ischemia, myocardial infarction, QT interval corrected for heart rate \\[QTc\\] prolongation (QTc \\> 0.450 seconds), arrhythmia, or conduction abnormalities that increase the risk of arrhythmia.\n\n   vii.

Those not meeting the criterion will not be randomized but may be rescheduled once within 14 days if the criterion is likely to resolve within 14 days in the judgement of the Investigator.)\n3. Have any of the following DSM-5 psychiatric disorders, as determined by the MINI and Psychiatric History AT the Screening Visit: (Note: psychiatric history will be re-evaluated on Day 0, but the MINI will not be re-administered on Day 0)\n\n   1. Lifetime history of schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder (including substance or medication-induced psychosis or psychosis due to a co-occurring medical condition).\n   2. Current alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score \\>7)\n   3. History of mania\n4. Have active suicidal ideation with intent, based on Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS assessment (severity score \\>3) at the Screening visit, confirmed by the Investigator. (Note: this criterion will be reassessed at each visit that occurs prior to Day 0, and on Day 0 prior to randomization. Participants will be discharged if actively suicidal, and appropriate follow-up will be arranged.\n5. Have made a medically significant suicide attempt (i.e., one that had a significant possibility of causing death or permanent harm in the absence of intervention) within the past 12 months, based on Screening C-SSRS assessment and confirmation by the Investigator. (Note: this criterion will be reassessed at each visit that occurs prior to Day 0, and on Day 0 prior to randomization. Participants will be discharged if actively suicidal, and appropriate follow-up will be arranged.)\n6.

Concomitant medications will be reassessed on Day 0. Any patient who has started prohibited medications will be discharged from the study.)\n14. Have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to psilocybin or any of the materials contained in the IP used in the study.\n15. Have an allergy, hypersensitivity, or other contraindication that would preclude safe treatment of acute hypertension, anxiety, or psychotic symptoms if necessary during or immediately after the IP Administration Session, using the adjunctive medications used in this study to treat these symptoms (i.e., unable to take captopril and unable to take clonidine; unable to take diazepam and unable to take lorazepam; or unable to take olanzapine).\n16. Have any other medical, psychiatric, or psychosocial disorder, symptom, condition, or situation that is likely to interfere with the establishment of rapport, adherence to study requirements, or safe administration of psilocybin or fMRI scanning, based on the judgement of the Investigator. (Note: This criterion will be reassessed on Day 0. Those not meeting the criterion will not be randomized but may be rescheduled once within 14 days if the criterion is likely to resolve within 14 days in the judgement of the Investigator.)\n17.
