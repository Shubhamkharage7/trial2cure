These miRNA can be detected in the blood and tumors of patients with cancer. The investigators hypothesize that the detection of certain miRNAs present in the blood/serum of patients with pancreatic cancer may be important to the early diagnosis of the disease. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that miRNA detection in PC patients will yield prognostic information and help predict the response to treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Specific aims of the study include:\n\n1. To obtain serum samples from patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer at baseline before treatment and monthly throughout treatment.\n2. To analyze the miRNA profiles present at each time point.\n3. To determine miRNAs that may distinguish pancreatic patients from unaffected individuals. This could be developed into a diagnostic test.\n4. To determine miRNAs whose levels correlate with treatment response, both in patients with and without elevations in the serum tumor marker CA 19-9."
