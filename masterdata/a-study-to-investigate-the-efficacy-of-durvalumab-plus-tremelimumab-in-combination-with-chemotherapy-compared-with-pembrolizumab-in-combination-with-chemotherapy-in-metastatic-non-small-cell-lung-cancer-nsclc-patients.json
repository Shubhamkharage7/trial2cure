            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab plus tremelimumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC patients with non-squamous histology who have mutations and/or co-mutations in STK11, KEAP1, or KRAS.",
            "detailedDescription": "A trial to learn if durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy is safe and how well it works compared to pembrolizumab with chemotherapy in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with certain genetic mutations.\n\nINFORMATION FOR TRIAL PARTICIPANTS:\n\nResearchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have metastatic NSCLC and tumors with STK11, KEAP1, or KRAS genetic mutations. Most people learn they have NSCLC after it has already become metastatic, and it can no longer be treated with surgery.\n\nBased on previous trials, researchers think durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy could help participants more than the current standard treatment, which is pembrolizumab with chemotherapy. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are designed to work by helping the immune system recognize and kill cancer cells.\n\nIn this trial, researchers want to learn more about how well durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy works in people with metastatic NSCLC and genetic mutations that can cause the cancer to be less responsive to treatment.\n\nThis trial is planned to have 280 participants. These participants will be randomly divided into one of two groups:\n\n* One group will receive durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy\n* One group will receive pembrolizumab with chemotherapy\n\nDurvalumab, tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy are given as an injection over time into a vein, also called an IV infusion. Chemotherapy will be one of the following regimens: pemetrexed plus cisplatin or pemetrexed plus carboplatin.\n\nThis is an open-label trial. This means that each participant will know which trial treatment they receive, and the doctors and trial staff will also know.\n\nResearchers will measure and compare:\n\n* How long participants live during the trial\n* How long participants live during the trial without their cancer getting worse\n* How many participants' tumors respond to treatment\n* How long participants' tumor responses last\n* How long before participants need to start a different treatment type\n\nResearchers will also keep track of all the medical problems participants have during the trial and monitor their safety.\n\nParticipants will be in this trial for up to approximately 4 years. They will stop receiving trial treatment if they no longer benefit from it or they stop participating for another reason.\n\nParticipants will visit their trial site every 3 to 4 weeks. At most visits, participants will:\n\n* Have a physical exam and answer questions about any medications they are taking or any medical problems they have\n* Receive their trial treatment\n* Give blood and urine samples\n* Have pictures of their tumors taken using CT or MRI scans"

Participants who have received prior platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or definitive chemoradiation for advanced disease are eligible, provided that progression has occurred \\> 6 months from end of last therapy.\n* No prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy excluding therapeutic anti-cancer vaccines, within 12 months to randomization.\n* WHO/ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at enrollment and randomization.\n* Minimum life expectancy \u2265 12 weeks at randomization.\n* At least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that qualifies as a RECIST 1.1 target lesion at baseline and can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the longest diameter with Computed Tomography (CT)/CT- Positron Emission Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging and that is suitable for accurate repeated measurements as per RECIST 1.1 guidelines.\n* Adequate organ and bone marrow function:\n* Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) for women of child-bearing potential\n* Female participants must be 1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using one highly effective form of birth control\n* Male and Female participants and their partners must use an acceptable method of contraception.\n* Body weight of \\> 30 kg\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any evidence of acute or uncontrolled diseases or history of allogeneic organ transplant.\n* Mixed small cell lung cancer and NSCLC histology.\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to the first dose of the study intervention or an anticipated need for major surgery during the study.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease \\[eg, colitis or Crohn's disease\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis \\[requiring immunosuppressive systemic therapy, eg, methotrexate, steroids\\], hypophysitis, uveitis, etc), autoimmune pneumonitis and autoimmune myocarditis. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  * Participants with vitiligo or alopecia.\n  * Participants with hypothyroidism (eg, following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement.\n  * Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy.\n  * Participants without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation with the Study Clinical Lead.\n  * Participants with celiac disease controlled by diet alone.\n* Medical contraindication to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.\n* History of another primary malignancy except:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease \u2265 2 years before the first dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence\n  * Adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer and curatively treated in situ disease.\n* Persistent toxicities (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] Grade \u2265 2) caused by previous anti-cancer therapy, alopecia and vitiligo are excluded toxicities.\n* Participants with Grade \u2264 2 neuropathy can be considered based on Investigator's judgement. Participants with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with study intervention in the opinion of the Investigator may be included (eg, hearing loss).\n* Spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic and stable.\n* Participant meets the following:\n\n  - Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia), which requires treatment (CTCAE Grade 3), symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation despite treatment, or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia. Participants with atrial fibrillation controlled by medication or arrhythmias controlled by pacemakers may be permitted based on the Investigator judgement with cardiologist consultation recommended.\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy, investigational product, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer-related conditions (eg, hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.\n* No radiation therapy is allowed, unless it is 1) definitive radiation that had been administered at least 6 months prior, 2) palliative radiation to brain, with associated criteria for stability or lack of symptoms, or 3) palliative radiation to painful bony lesions (this must comprise less than 30% of the bone marrow)\n* Patients with suspected brain metastases at screening should have an intravenous (IV) contrast-enhanced MRI (preferred) or IV contrast-enhanced CT/CT-PET of the brain prior to study entry. If brain metastases are detected patients must be treated before randomization. Randomization is only permitted if patients with brain metastases have:\n\n  * Confirmed stable condition\n  * Returned neurologically to baseline Brain metastases will not be recorded as RECIST target lesions at baseline.\n* History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n* Known to have tested positive for active tuberculosis infection\n* Known active hepatitis infection, positive HCV antibody, HBsAg, or anti-HBc, at screening.
