            "briefSummary": "This open-label research study is studying (Z)-endoxifen as a possible treatment for pre-menopausal (still having periods) women with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. (Z)-endoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator or \"SERM.\" SERMs work to treat cancer by blocking the body's natural estrogen from binding to cancer cells. This study includes a pharmacokinetic part (PK, how the drug works in your body) and a treatment part. The primary purpose of the study is to see how (Z)-endoxifen works on tumor cell growth by monitoring a cancer marker called Ki-67. Ki-67 will be measured by biopsy of the breast after about 4 weeks of treatment. If your cancer is responding to treatment based on the Ki-67 results, you may continue treatment up to 24 weeks or until surgery.\n\nThe PK part of the study will be enrolled first, enrolling about 18 study participants who will all receive oral once daily (Z)-endoxifen treatment. 12 of these participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with an equal (50/50) chance to be assigned to (Z)-endoxifen or (Z)-endoxifen + goserelin (a medication given to block the ovaries from making estrogen and is also called ovarian suppression). This part of the study will help select the dose of (Z)-endoxifen to use in the treatment part by measuring the levels of (Z)-endoxifen in the blood stream and determine how long it takes for the body to remove it.\n\nAbout 160 study participants will be enrolled in the treatment part. The treatment part will help to determine how oral once daily (Z)-endoxifen, when taken by itself, compares to oral once daily exemestane (a medication that decreases the amount of estrogen in the body, also known as an aromatase inhibitor) and monthly injections of goserelin. Exemestane and goserelin taken together is a standard treatment regimen for premenopausal patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Study participants are randomly assigned to treatment with an equal (50/50) chance to be assigned to (Z)-endoxifen or standard treatment.\n\nStudy participation is up to 24 weeks of treatment followed by surgery."
