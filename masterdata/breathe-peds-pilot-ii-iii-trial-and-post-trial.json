            "briefSummary": "The overall aims of this study are to develop and pilot test BRief intervention to Evaluate Asthma THErapy (BREATHE)-Peds, a dyadic shared decision-making intervention, to improve asthma by supporting self-management among racial and ethnic minority early adolescents receiving care for uncontrolled asthma in federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) in urban communities. Aim 1 (Phase I) involves developing the intervention through focus groups with early adolescents and caregivers. Aims 2 and 3 (Phase II) involve preliminary testing of the intervention through a pilot randomized controlled trial. This record is for Phase II and III only",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite high asthma prevalence and morbidity among adolescents (highest among Black and Hispanic youth and early adolescents aged 10-14), there is a lack of developmentally appropriate interventions for this at-risk group. Racial and ethnic minority early adolescents have sub-optimal asthma self-management. Critical health behaviors that emerge during early adolescence affect lifelong patterns; therefore, early adolescence offers a unique opportunity to intervene. Additionally, successful self-management requires the right division of responsibility between adolescents and their caregivers. Thus, intervening simultaneously with early adolescents and their caregivers who can help support the adolescent's growing autonomy to self-manage their condition has the potential for a synergistic effect.\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated the effects of improved asthma control of BREATHE, a brief one-time shared decision-making intervention for Black adults with uncontrolled asthma that utilizes motivational interviewing delivered by primary care providers. This study (i.e., Phase II and Phase III) ) a pilot validation phase will conduct a group-randomized trial in two FQHCs with 85 dyads treated by 8 PCPs (10 dyads/PCP) randomized to 1 of 2 study arms: (a) BREATHE-PEDS-Peds (n=42 dyads), or (b) dose-matched attention control (n=43 dyads). Post-trial interviews with PCPs, caregivers, and their children to evaluate satisfaction with the intervention will be conducted; caregiver-child dyads will be followed for 3 months post-intervention to assess the impact of BREATHE-PEDS-Peds on asthma outcomes."
