All patients will be assigned the same initial treatment plan, modified by interim response assessment (IRA) after Cycle 4. All patients will start treatment with four 21-day cycles (C1-4) of mosunetuzumab alone (using step-up dosing during C1), followed by IRA. Patients who achieve CR at IRA will continue with additional 4 cycles (C5-8) of mosunetuzumab. Patients who achieve PR at IRA will receive mosunetuzumab with lenalidomide augmentation during C5-8. Primary response assessment (PRA) will occur after C8. Patients who remain in PR at PRA will continue for additional 4 cycles (extended augmentation)."

Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document and to comply with the study protocol procedures.\n2. Age \u226518 years at the time of signing informed consent. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of mosunetuzumab in patients \\<18 years of age, they are excluded from this study.\n3.

Patients in whom definitive pathologic subtype of FL/MZL is undetermined due to limited biopsy material can be enrolled if in the investigator's opinion integrated clinicopathologic data are consistent with the eligible diagnosis.\n4. Agreement to provide, if available, lymphoma tissue for correlative analyses.\n5. At least one bi-dimensionally measurable nodal lesion, defined as \\>1.5 cm in its longest dimension, or one bi-dimensionally measurable extranodal lesion, defined as \\>1.0 cm in its longest diameter; with the exception of splenic MZL, which must be evaluable using the International SMZL Group criteria.\n6. No prior systemic therapy for B-cell lymphoma, except for palliative corticosteroids; prior local therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, or antibiotics) is allowed.\n7.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \u226540 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Mayo Quadratic Formula.\n11. The effects of mosunetuzumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.

History of other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results; patients with a curatively treated skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or another malignancy treated curatively with a documented remission \\>2 years before registration are eligible.\n13. Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study enrollment or any major episode of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization within 4 weeks before the first dose of mosunetuzumab.\n14. Clinically significant liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.\n15. Any major surgery within 4 weeks before the first dose of mosunetuzumab, other than lymph node biopsy for diagnosis.\n16.

Any radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to first dose of mosunetuzumab.\n19. Pregnancy, breast-feeding, or prisoner status.
