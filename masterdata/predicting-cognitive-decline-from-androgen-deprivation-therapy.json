            "briefSummary": "Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in men with prostate cancer. Pre-clinical data suggest that ADT-induced hypogonadism leads to accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the hippocampus, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Neuroimaging Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies also demonstrate that ADT decreases metabolic activity in the parietal, occipital, and prefrontal cortices. Multiple prospective cohort and population-based clinical studies have been conducted to test the association between ADT and cognitive impairment and/or dementia.\n\nPlasma biomarkers have been developed to predict brain amyloidosis, a key pathological feature of AD and a risk factor for developing dementia due to AD. The advantage of a blood-based assay is the lower cost, invasiveness, and time compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-based biomarkers.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-site, non-randomized prospective observational study of men with prostate cancer.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate whether baseline plasma Amyloid-beta 42/40 (A\u03b242/40) ratio is associated with cognitive decline in men upon starting ADT.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate whether ADT is associated with a decline in plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio.\n\nII. To evaluate whether intensified ADT (iADT) receipt is associated with greater cognitive decline compared to ADT."
