The data collected from this study will serve the purpose of confirming the safety and performance of the JuggerStitch Device used for meniscal repair according to the product labelling (IFU).\n\nThe objectives of the study are to calculate the overall clinical success rate and the performance, and confirm the safety of the JuggerStitch Meniscal Repair Device. The primary endpoint of this study is defined by the absence of reoperation due to meniscal tear. This will be measured against the success criteria of the absence of reoperation in 90.2% of the cases at one year."
