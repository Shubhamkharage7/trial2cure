            "briefSummary": "This study will assess the combined effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and telehealth based therapy in helping manage mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) related headaches. The investigators hypothesize that active rTMS combined with telehealth therapy will provide marked reduction in mTBI related headaches and symptoms in comparison to their placebo counterparts.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be enrolling a total of 240 veterans or active military over a 4 year period at the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS). Participants will be randomized into one of four groups:\n\nGroup A: active rTMS with telehealth headache management therapy Group B: active rTMS with telehealth headache education control Group C: sham rTMS with telehealth headache management therapy Group D: sham rTMS with telehealth headache education control\n\nIndividual participation will consist of 19 visits to the VASDHS and 11 telehealth sessions over the course of 6-7 months. The in person visits will be divided into the following phases:\n\n1. PRE-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS PHASE (weeks 1-2) which consists of Visit 1 (Screening Visit) and Visit 2 (Baseline Assessments with MRI scan);\n2. INDUCTION TREATMENT PHASE (weeks 3-4) consists of Visits 3-12 (10 weekday neuronavigation guided rTMS sessions at \\>24 and \\<72 hours apart); and\n3. POST-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS AND MAINTENANCE TREATMENT PHASE (weeks 5-24) consists of 4 initial biweekly post-induction treatment assessments and maintenance treatments (Visits 13-16)) and two additional monthly post-induction assessments and maintenance treatments (Visits 17-18) and one final study visit (Visit 19).\n\nEight weekly telehealth therapy/education sessions will be conducted from week 3 to 10 with additional three bolster sessions at 4 weeks apart. During the baseline and follow up visits, assessments will be conducted to evaluate headaches, neurobehavioral symptoms, depressive symptoms, post-concussion symptoms, and quality of life."
