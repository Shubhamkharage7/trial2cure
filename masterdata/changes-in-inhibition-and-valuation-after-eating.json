This project aims to understand how predictions and value-based decisions about control may be abnormally influenced by eating in individuals with BN, thereby maintaining cycles of binge eating, purging, and restriction.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal of this project is to test a neurocomputational model of BN that incorporates learning and decision-making components of control. The study combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), computational modeling, and real-time mobile assessments to examine the influences of acute fasting and eating on brain function and associated control-related updating and effort-valuation processes in BN. More specifically, the study has the following main objectives: 1) To determine the influence of eating on control-related prediction updating in BN.; 2) To determine the influence of eating on control-related cognitive effort valuation in BN; 3) To use state-specific neural activation to predict BN symptoms."
