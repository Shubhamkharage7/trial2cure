            "briefSummary": "This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the clinical outcomes of bioabsorbable screws to conventional metal screws in pediatric patients (aged 0 to 18) undergoing surgical fixation for trauma or elective procedures. Conducted by the pediatric orthopedic department at Children's Hospital New Orleans, the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these screws in bone healing over key post-operative intervals (6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year). It seeks to determine if bioabsorbable screws offer significant advantages over metal screws in terms of reducing the need for secondary surgeries, based on their hypothesized noninferiority in complication rates. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either bioabsorbable or metal (titanium or stainless steel) screws after obtaining informed consent from a parent or guardian.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with the use of bioabsorbable screws compared to conventional metal screws in children aged 0 to 18 who are undergoing surgical fixation in the setting of trauma such as medial epicondyle fractures of the elbow or elective procedures. The research will be conducted within the pediatric orthopedic department at CHNOLA, and participants will be assessed at key intervals, including 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year post-operation post-operation. The primary objective of this study is to assess and compare the effectiveness of conventional metal screws and bioabsorbable screws in bone healing. This study aims to determine whether bioabsorbable screws are significantly superior to conventional titanium screws. The investigators hypothesize bioabsorbable screws are significantly noninferior to conventional metal screws in terms of complications based on prior surgical constructs that demonstrate bioabsorbable screws eliminate the need for a second surgery After informed consent has been obtained from the parents of patients, eligible patients undergoing cannulated screw fixation will be randomized into two groups: one group who will receive bioabsorbable screws and the other group who will receive metal screws (titanium or stainless steel)."
