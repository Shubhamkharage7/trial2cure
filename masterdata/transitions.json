The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. compare the efficacy of the virtual health coaching intervention vs. web-based information alone in improving self-care in caregivers of hospitalized community-dwelling older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) who transition from hospital to home,\n2. compare outcomes among Black/African American and White caregivers who receive the intervention vs. digital health information alone, and\n3. explore the estimated the cost of the interventions and acute care resource use among patients of caregivers who received virtual intervention vs. digital health information alone.\n\nParticipants who enroll will agree to enroll will:\n\n* be randomly assigned to either the health information group or the health coaching intervention plus health information group for six months, and\n* be asked to complete a baseline interview, a check-in call at one month post-hospital discharge, and two follow-up interviews at 3- and 6-months after enrollment.\n\nResearchers will compare the two groups of caregivers on the following outcomes: self-care, caregiver self-efficacy (aka confidence), coping, stress, and health status."
