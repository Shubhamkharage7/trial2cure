For the first two weeks, the patients will continue to take T92 at half dose and the T92 administration will be stopped from week 3 of the follow-up period.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to receive T92 or matching placebo based on individual body weight. The calculated amount of investigational product (T92 or placebo) will be administrated orally twice daily. Morning dose and evening dose should be administrated at about the same time every day and irrelevant to meals."
