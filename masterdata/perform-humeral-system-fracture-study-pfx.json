Data will be collected for the commercially available Perform\u00ae Fracture shoulder system in both the anatomic and reversed configurations.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is to demonstrate decreased pain and improved subjects' shoulder functionality of daily living by achieving a mean of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder score higher than 62 points, at 2-year follow-up post-operatively, regardless of configuration (anatomic or reverse).\n\nRetrospective inclusions are allowed: preoperative and intra operative data can be collected retrospectively up to 2 months after the surgery date.\n\nSecondary outcome measures include patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and standard radiographic findings, including, but not limited to: bone erosion, device migration/subsidence, component breakage, radiolucency, and ossification.\n\nSafety and performance data will be collected at surgery, immediate post-op, and up to 10 years post-operation. Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), device revision and Adverse Events (AEs) will be assessed annually throughout the study.\n\nRange of Motion (ROM), strength and radiographic imaging assessments of the study shoulder will also be performed for in-person milestones visits at 6 months (radiographic imaging assessments), 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-year, post-operatively."
