The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part A will be a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children aged 2 to \\<6 years old with uncontrolled asthma and/or recurrent severe asthmatic wheeze. At the end of Part A, all eligible participants will be offered participation in Part B, an optional open-label extension phase.\n\nStudy details include:\n\nPart A:\n\nThe study duration of part A will be up to 68 weeks consisting of a 4-week Screening, a 52week treatment period, and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period. For participants who will chose to participate in Part B, the study duration will be up to 120 weeks (additional 52-week treatment period).\n\nPart B:\n\nFor participants who will choose to participate in Part B, the study duration will be up to 120 weeks (Part A \\[4-week Screening and a 52-week treatment period\\] plus additional 52-week treatment period and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period).",
