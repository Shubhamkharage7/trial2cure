Information gained from interviews and surveys of participants taking part in the virtual genetics board may lend insights into perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, acceptability, self-efficacy, genetics knowledge, and barriers/facilitators to implementation to refine the process.",

To assess acceptability/feasibility, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy for recommendations, genetics knowledge.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants complete a survey about genetic knowledge and self efficacy and then attend virtual genetics board. After virtual genetics board meeting, participants complete a second survey about perceived usefulness, ease of use, acceptability, feasibility, self-efficacy and genetic knowledge. Participants may also complete a semi-structured interview after virtual genetics board."
