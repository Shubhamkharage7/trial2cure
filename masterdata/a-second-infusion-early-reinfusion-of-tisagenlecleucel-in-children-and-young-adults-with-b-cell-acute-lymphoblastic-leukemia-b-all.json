Dose adjustments based off ideal body weight (IBW) and/or per institutional guidelines are allowed. LDC should be completed 2 to 14 days prior to the first tisagenlecleucel infusion. LDC may be repeated in cases where tisagenlecleucel has been delayed by more than 4 weeks. No additional LDC will be given prior to the early reinfusion."
