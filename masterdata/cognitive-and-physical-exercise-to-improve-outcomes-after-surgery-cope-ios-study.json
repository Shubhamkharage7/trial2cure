To accomplish these goals, the Investigators are randomizing 250 patients \u226560 years old undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery with expected hospitalization \u22653 days to a pragmatic comprehensive training program (computerized cognitive training and supervised progressive physical exercise) or to active control (control computer game, stretching exercises) for 2-4 weeks prior to surgery and for 3 months after discharge. At baseline and after discharge, the Investigators will assess global cognition, activities of daily living, depression, endothelial and blood brain barrier function (blood biomarkers), and neuroimaging (anatomical and functional MRI). In this early stage trial, the Investigators will determine if certain subgroups benefit most, program aspects with greatest effect on outcomes, mechanistic associations with outcomes, and additional exploratory analyses."
