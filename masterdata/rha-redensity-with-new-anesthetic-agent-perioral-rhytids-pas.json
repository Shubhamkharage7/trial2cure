            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, within-subject (split-face), multicenter, prospective study to investigate whether RHA\u00ae Redensity with new anesthetic agent is non-inferior to RHA\u00ae Redensity with lidocaine in terms of injection site pain felt by the subject during injection.\n\nAt screening, the Principal Investigator (PI) evaluated subjects' perioral rhytid severity (using the Perioral Rhytid Severity Rating Scale; PR-SRS) to confirm eligibility and to establish a pre-treatment score for assessing aesthetic improvement.\n\nAt Visit 1, RHA\u00ae Redensity with new anesthetic agent was administered in a random sequence (first or second injection) and side of the mouth (left or right) and RHA\u00ae Redensity with lidocaine was administered to the other side. Study subjects and the PI injecting study devices were blinded.\n\nImmediately after injection of an upper perioral quadrant, subjects rated the injection site pain experienced during injection using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Injection site pain in each side of the mouth was also assessed at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after injection of the upper quadrant.\n\nSafety evaluation consisted of AE assessments, a 30-day CTR (Common Treatment Response) diary and a follow-up call performed by the study site at 72 hours after injection.\n\nSubjects attended Visit 2 (30 days post-injection) where effectiveness and safety assessments were conducted.\n\nSubjects who presented with an unresolved clinically significant device related AE at Visit 2 received a optional follow-up phone call no later than 30 days after Visit 2.\n\nIf the clinically significant AE remained unresolved, the Investigator requested that the subject attended the optional in-clinic follow-up visit (i.e., Visit 3) within 5 working days. Follow-up of the clinically significant AE continued until the AE was resolved or the TI determines that additional follow-up was not necessary."
