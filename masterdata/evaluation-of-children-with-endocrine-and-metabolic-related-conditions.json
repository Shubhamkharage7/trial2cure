            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nEndocrine glands give off hormones. Researchers want to learn more about the disorders that affect these glands in children. These disorders might be caused by changes in genes. Genes contain DNA, which is the blueprint of how a cell works. Researchers want to identify the genes involved in endocrine and metabolic disorders. This might help develop new ways to diagnose and treat the disorders.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the inheritance of endocrine or metabolism disorders.\n\nEligibility:\n\nChildren ages 3month-18 with known or suspected endocrine or metabolism disorders.\n\nFamily members ages 3months-100. They may participate in the DNA part of the study.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a review of their medical records. Their parents or guardians will allow the records to be released.\n\nParticipants will have a clinic visit. This may include a physical exam and medical history.\n\nParents or guardians will give their consent for the study. Participants may have tests, surgery, or other procedures to help diagnose or treat their condition. These could include:\n\nBlood, urine, and saliva tests\n\nGrowth hormone test\n\nPituitary and adrenal function tests\n\nPicture of chromosomes\n\nImaging tests. These may include X-ray, ultrasound, scans, or a skeletal survey.\n\nGenetic tests\n\nSleep study\n\nMedical photographs\n\nIf surgery is done, a tissue sample will be taken.\n\nParticipants may have follow-up visits for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nParticipating relatives will have one visit. This will include medical history and blood and saliva tests. The blood and saliva will be used for DNA testing.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis protocol is designed to allow endocrine-related evaluations of children with known or suspected endocrine or metabolic disorders.\n\nChildren with endocrine or metabolic-related condition(s) who may or may not be eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol. Standard clinically indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the child participant may receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) according to current clinical practice. Family members of children evaluated on this protocol (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index case) may be enrolled in the genetic/DNA testing part of the protocol.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n-Comprehensive evaluation of pediatric endocrine diseases and conditions as well as track natural progress of the development of such\n\nconditions in diverse population of pediatric subjects with a known or suspected endocrine or metabolic disorder.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\n-Samples for molecular genetic or WES testing\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nAppraisal of number and diversity of endocrine related diagnosis of patients evaluated on this protocol.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n-Number of samples for molecular genetic or WES testing."
