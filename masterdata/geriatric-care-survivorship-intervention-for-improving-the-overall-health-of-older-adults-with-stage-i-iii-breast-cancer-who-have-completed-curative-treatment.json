            "briefSummary": "This trial studies the effect of a geriatric care survivorship intervention in improving the overall health of older adults who have completed curative treatment for stage I-III breast cancer. Geriatric assessment is the complete examination of an elderly individual, which includes a full valuation of the physical and mental conditions, as well as a check of emotional state. Geriatric assessment and survivorship visits after treatment may reduce health burdens and improve the well-being and quality of life of elderly patients with breast cancer. Researchers hope to improve the overall health of older adults who have undergone curative treatment for stage I-III breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of implementing the geriatric care survivorship intervention in older adults who have completed curative-intent chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the impact of a Geriatric Assessment (GA)-guided intervention on patient-reported quality-of-life/physical function (assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast \\[FACT-B\\]), geriatric assessment measures (assessed by GA) and objective physical function (assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery \\[SPPB\\]) in older survivors from baseline to 6- and 12-months +/- 4-weeks post-chemotherapy.\n\nII. Determine the impact of intervention on patient reported cognitive function (FACT-Cog) and objective cognitive function (Mini-Cog) from baseline to 6- and 12-months +/- 4-weeks post-chemotherapy.\n\nIII. Estimate the effect of the intervention on completion of referral appointments and contacts with primary care providers.\n\nIV. Estimate the effect of the intervention on emergent healthcare utilization (emergency room \\[ER\\] visits and hospitalizations) at 6- and 12-months +/- 4 weeks post-chemotherapy.\n\nV. Determine the impact of the intervention on both patient and caregiver satisfaction with care (\"Health Care Climate Questionnaire\") from baseline to 6- and 12-months +/- 4-weeks post-chemotherapy.\n\nVI. Determine the impact of intervention on caregiver distress (\"Burden Scale for Family Caregivers\") and satisfaction with care (\"Health Care Climate Questionnaire\") from baseline to 6- and 12-months +/- 4-weeks post-chemotherapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete geriatric assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months later. Based on the assessments, patients may receive further intervention at survivorship visit. Patients also receive survivorship care educational materials and wear a wearable activity tracking device for 1 year on study."
