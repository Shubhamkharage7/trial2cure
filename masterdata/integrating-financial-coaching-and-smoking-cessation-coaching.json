The study will recruit and randomize 900 low-income smokers (n=450 per arm) to either: (1) Control: Standard Smoking Cessation Counseling or (2) Intervention: Integrated Financial-Smoking Cessation Counseling. Both groups will receive 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy. The study will survey participants at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to assess outcomes and mechanisms, and biochemically verify self-reported abstinence at 12 months (our primary outcome). The study will assess and compare the costs and cost-per-quit in the two treatment arms."
