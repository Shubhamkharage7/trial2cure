            "detailedDescription": "This study is a randomized pilot study to test the acceptability and feasibility of a CC pathway, called the Kidney Care at Home Program, with patients with advanced CKD who have chosen to forgo dialysis, their caregivers and providers. The novel CC program will be developed upon an existing home-based multidisciplinary care (MDC) program in the Veterans Affairs (VA) called the Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) program. HBPC provides for Veterans with multimorbidity and functional limitation with the goal of supporting Veterans' quality of life and mitigating the complications of illness through to the end of life.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that HBPC serves as the ideal starting ground to build the VA's first CC program for Veterans with advanced CKD. The investigators will use implementation science and ethnographic research methods, including field observations, interviews, medical record review, and serial structured surveys on quality of life, symptom burden, care satisfaction and goal concordant care to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Kidney Care at Home Program (intervention) vs. usual care (control)."
