The order of active stimulation versus sham will be randomized such that half of the participants in each group get the sham stimulation during the first session and half will get active stimulation in the first session then crossover. EEG and eye-tracking will take approximately 60-minutes and will be collected pre-and-post TMS administration."

Stimuli will consist of standard, unattended (nontarget) auditory click trains from a three-stimulus oddball tasks. The output is thus measured in the EEG recording which is analyzed in the frequency domain. Measures of inter-trial coherence (ITC) are used to determine neural synchrony through the ASSR task, by quantifying the degree of phase consistency across trials.
