This information will allow a more definitive description of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency to be developed, which will permit development of treatment strategies for these diseases.\n\nDuke will be the only site where this study takes place. However, since these are rare disorders, participants who receive care at other institutions will be included. The investigators will collect retrospective data from patient charts on diagnosed individuals, as far back as necessary to capture the clinical course of the disorder. Prospective data collected from patient charts after enrollment will be captured as well. Participant's medical records will be continually reviewed for the duration of the study.\n\nData will be collected from medical records and will only pertain to clinically relevant information, including, but not limited to: demographic and diagnostic information, tissue biopsy results, medical and family history, review of systems, imaging studies, results of liver and/or muscle testing, and urine and blood laboratory results."
