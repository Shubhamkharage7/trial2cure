A 20 mL blood sample as well as a urine sample will be obtained for eligibility screening laboratories and baseline LDL-C.\n\nFollow-up phone call: At 3 months post-randomization, participants in both arms will be briefly contacted by phone by the Research Assistant to thank them for their participation and to answer any study related questions.\n\nEnd of study 6 month visit. Participants will engage in a virtual visit for end of study procedures. At this follow-up visit, the Research Assistant will assess for any adverse events and direct the participant to collect a fasting blood sample for repeat LDL-C measurement. The Research Assistant will administer an electronic survey and knowledge questionnaires. Additional clinical visits as desired by the participants' physicians will be allowed at their discretion."
