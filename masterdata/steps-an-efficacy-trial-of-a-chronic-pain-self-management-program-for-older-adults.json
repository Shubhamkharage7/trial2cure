Specific aims are: to test, in a sample of 414 primarily African American older adults, whether the STEPS pain self-management intervention, delivered over 7 weeks through telephone sessions with a CHW and mobile health tools, improves pain outcomes at 2 and 12 months compared to a usual care control group. We will also assess the mechanisms by which the intervention may bring about positive changes in pain outcomes. We will use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to assess participant engagement and satisfaction, and factors affecting implementation."

Each week participants will watch a brief video on the STEPS website; they may also be asked to complete handouts in the workbook. They will have a weekly 30-minute telephone session with the CHW. CHWs will review the weekly topic, help participants practice new skills, and set a related goal. CHWs will screen for social needs and make appropriate community referrals.
