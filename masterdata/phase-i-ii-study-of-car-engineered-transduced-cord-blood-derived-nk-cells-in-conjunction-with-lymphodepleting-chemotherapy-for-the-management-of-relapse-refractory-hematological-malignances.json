Researchers think that NK cells you receive from a donor may react against cancer cells in your body, which may help to control the disease.",

The efficacy and optimal dose will be identified for individual diseases.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To quantify persistence of infused allogeneic donor CAR-transduced CB-derived NK cells in the recipient.\n* To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies."
