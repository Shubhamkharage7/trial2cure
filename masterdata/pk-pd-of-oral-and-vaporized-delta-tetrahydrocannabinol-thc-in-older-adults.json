            "detailedDescription": "This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, commencing with an oral THC Sub-Study. Following the completion of this sub-study, the Primary Study will commence.\n\nOral THC Sub-Study: 10 men and women aged 65 years or older, will be randomized to two doses of oral THC (5 mg and 10 mg). Across three, 8-hour test sessions, participants will receive a random sequence of 3 conditions: 5 mg oral THC; 10 mg oral THC; oral placebo.\n\nPrimary Study: 20 men and women aged 65 years or older will be randomized to two doses of oral THC (5 mg and 10 mg) and vaporized THC (2 mg and 4 mg). Across six 8-hour test sessions, participants will receive a random sequence of 6 conditions: 5 mg oral THC; 10 mg oral THC; oral placebo; 2 mg vaporized THC; 4 mg vaporized THC; and vaporized placebo.\n\nFor both the sub-study and primary study, blood samples will be regularly collected from an intravenous line, up to 8 hours post-dose, and at 24 hours post-dose, to assess the PK of THC and its phase I and II metabolites. PD effects of THC on pain will be measured with Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), a psychophysical technique used to reliably measure pain sensitivity and investigate pain modulatory mechanisms. The abuse liability of THC will be measured using an established drug reinforcement paradigm."
