            "detailedDescription": "RATIONALE:\n\nOptune therapy with tumor treatment fields (TTFields) has recently been FDA approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma due to a recent clinical trial that showed improvement in progression free survival and overall survival compared to standard therapy. (1) TTFields also have a role in the recurrent glioblastoma treatment where it has demonstrated equal efficacy to second-line chemotherapy also has been shown to tumor progression and improve overall survival.(2) Though preclinical studies are ongoing, glioblastoma patients who have undergone TTField therapy have not yet been assessed at autopsy to determine both the pathological signature of TTField treatment, and the pattern of failure. This study will determine how the underlying pathological signatures of tumors treated with TTFields differ from those na\u00efve to TTFields by comparing tumor tissue at autopsy.\n\nSTUDY:\n\nAll patients undergoing TTField therapy for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma will be considered for inclusion for this study. The investigators expect to enroll five patients per year for four years, totaling 10 patients treated upfront and 10 patients treated at tumor recurrence. An objective of this study is to determine differences in the pathological pattern of failure when patients are treated with TTFields at initial diagnosis (up-front) compared to those treated at tumor recurrence."
