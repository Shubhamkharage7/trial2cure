The result of this study will provide detailed data regarding the nutrition and body composition within this Cystic Fibrosis population and also provide a baseline evaluation for use of these biomarkers in the future studies including evaluation of nutritional intervention. Further, the study will also include psychosocial and other patient-reported outcomes and medical contributors to understand their contributions to the nutritional failure in the adult advanced lung disease population. Finally, the study will evaluate both established and emerging nutritional and body composition parameters and link them to clinical outcomes in adults with CF across the spectrum of pulmonary function."
