During Stage 1, four cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in this study:\n\nCohort 1 will consist of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive participants who have received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic or inoperable locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (first-line \\[1L\\] PD-L1+ cohort).\n\nCohort 2 will consist of participants who had disease progression during or following 1L treatment with chemotherapy for metastatic or inoperable locally-advanced TNBC and have not received cancer immunotherapy (CIT) (second-line \\[2L\\] CIT-naive cohort).\n\nCohort 3 will consist of participants with locally-advanced or metastatic HR+, HER2-negative disease with PIK3CA mutation who may or may not have had disease progression during or following previous lines of treatment for metastatic disease (HR+cohort).\n\nCohort 4 will consist of participants with locally-advanced or metastatic HER2+ /HER2-low disease with PIK3CA mutation who had disease progression on standard-of-care therapies (HER2+ /HER2-low cohort).\n\nIn each cohort, eligible participants will initially be assigned to one of several treatment arms (Stage 1). In addition, participants in the 2L CIT-na\u00efve cohort who experience disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to continue treatment with a different treatment combination (Stage 2), provided Stage 2 is open for enrollment."
