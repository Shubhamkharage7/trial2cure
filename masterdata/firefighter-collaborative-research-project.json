            "briefSummary": "The goal of this research is to test interventions to reduce firefighter cardiovascular, cognitive, and overall disease risks, including but not limited to risks associated with Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances (PFAS) exposure. Approximately 1,500 - 2,000 firefighters will be enrolled in the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS). Among these individuals, those that express interest will then be screened for eligibility for the Firefighter Collaborative Research Project (FCRP) using information they provided for the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study. Firefighters enrolled in the study will provide an initial blood sample and urine sample. The blood sample will be analyzed to determine the participant's PFAS levels. Based upon serum PFAS levels and responses from the screening survey, eligible participants will be randomly assigned into one of the following interventions: 1. Blood Donation, or Plasma Donation or Blood/Plasma Control Group; 2. Zone 2 Training or Zone 2 Control; 3. Intermittent Fasting or Intermittent Fasting Control. Individuals participating in the blood donation, plasma donation or blood/plasma control group would donate blood every 12 weeks, plasma every 6 weeks, or not donate blood or plasma. Participants in this intervention arm would continue this for a 12-month period. Individuals in the zone 2 training, zone 2 training control, intermittent fasting or intermittent fasting control group would participate in their intervention or control for a 4-month period. After 4 to 12 months participating in an intervention or control group, participants will be asked to provide a final urine sample and blood draw to determine if and to what degree their PFAS levels or other cardiovascular disease and other health risks have changed."
