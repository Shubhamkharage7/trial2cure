After completion of an open pilot, participants will be randomly assigned into one of two study intervention groups.\n\nThe names of the study intervention groups involved in this study are:\n\n* Palliative care (PEACE) plus usual oncology care\n* Usual care (standard oncology care)\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for up to 2 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 90 people will take part in this research study.",

Once the palliative care intervention has been refined by feedback from the pilot participants, the study will enroll 80 participants and will randomly assign the participants into one of two study intervention groups. Randomization means that a participant is put into a group by chance.\n\nThe names of the study intervention groups involved in this study are:\n\n* Palliative care intervention (PEACE) plus usual oncology care\n* Usual care (standard oncology care)\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for up to 2 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 90 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology is supporting this research study by providing funding support."
