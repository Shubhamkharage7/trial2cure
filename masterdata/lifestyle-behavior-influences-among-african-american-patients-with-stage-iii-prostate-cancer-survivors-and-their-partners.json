How patients cope with stress may affect their lifestyle behaviors. This study may help understand not only survivors' behaviors but also partners' behaviors and how they interact.",

Identify social and physical contexts in which health behaviors occur/co-occur among survivors and their partners.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Investigate potential moderators for the associations between stress and dyadic coping.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients and partners complete questionnaires over 60 minutes about demographic information, stress, coping, and lifestyle behaviors at baseline and end of study. Patients and partners also receive an accelerometer and complete Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) questionnaire on stress, coping, physical activity, and eating behaviors over 5-10 minutes four time daily (QID; 7:30 am, 11:30 am, 3:30 pm, and 7:30 pm) via an smartphone application (app) for 14 days. Patients and partners also complete a survey on nutrition twice weekly (BIW) for a total of 4 surveys."
