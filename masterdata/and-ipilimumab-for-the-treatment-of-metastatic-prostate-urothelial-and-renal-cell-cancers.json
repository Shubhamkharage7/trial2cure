            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of DS3201 when given together with and ipilimumab for the treatment of patients with prostate, urothelial, or renal cell cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). DS3201 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving DS3201 and ipilimumab may help to control the disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and confirm the safety and tolerability of valemetostat (DS3201) given in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic aggressive variant prostate cancers (AVPC), urothelial carcinomas (UC) and renal clear cell carcinomas (RCC).\n\nII. To screen for associations between changes in the tumor microenvironment and clinical outcomes.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the immunologic and molecular effects on tissue samples of participants treated with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and RCC.\n\nII. To estimate the time to treatment failure (TTF) of patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and RCC treated with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab.\n\nIII. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and RCC treated with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab (in patients with AVPC ORR will be reported separately for prostate specific antigen \\[PSA\\], circulating tumor cells \\[CTC\\] and measurable and non-measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] 1.1).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of valemetostat.\n\nPatients receive valemetostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1 and 3. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 and 60 days after the last valemetostat dose and/or 100 days after the last ipilimumab dose and then every 6 months thereafter."
