They can also be inborn anomalies of the reproductive tract. Researchers want to gather data over time from a large group of young people with these conditions.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo create a database about child and teenage gynecologic conditions.\n\nEligibility:\n\nParticipants of any age with known or suspected pediatric and adolescent gynecologic conditions, and their adult family members\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a review of their medical records.\n\nParticipants may have a medical history and physical exam.\n\nParticipants will have blood drawn using a needle. The blood will be used for genetic tests.\n\nParticipants will have saliva collected. They will spit into a small plastic container. Or their spit will be absorbed from their mouth using a small sponge. The saliva will be used for genetic tests.\n\nParticipants may have samples collected from their vagina. A small cotton swab will be used to gather the samples. This procedure is optional.\n\nIf participants have a surgery related to their condition, a small tissue sample will be taken. It will be stored for future research.\n\nParticipants may complete optional surveys. These surveys ask about their physical and emotional health. They can choose not to answer any of the questions.\n\nResearchers will collect medical data from participants standard tests. Such tests may include blood and urine tests, X-rays, nuclear medicine scans, and other tests. Data will also be collected from standard treatments they may receive.",
