            "briefSummary": "This study is a Phase I/II study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of focused radiation therapy (radiosurgery) together with olaparib, followed by immunotherapy, for patients with brain metastases from triple negative or BRCA-mutated breast cancers.\n\nThis study will have a Phase I portion in which subjects will be enrolled based on 3+3 dose escalation rules. Three dose levels of olaparib will be studied.\n\nCycle 1 of study treatment will consist of Olaparib given twice daily concurrently with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Olaparib will start one week prior to SRS and continue during and following SRS (1-5 fractions) for up to 28 days total. The number of doses of Olaparib will be dependent on how long it takes a subject to recover from SRS (ideally the subject will be off steroids, if they are required, at the start of Cycle 2, with exceptions outlined later in this section).\n\nOnce the subject has recovered from SRS (based on investigator discretion) that will be considered the DLT period. Cycle 2 will be initiated with physician's choice systemic therapy and durvalumab. Cycle 2+ will equal 21 days. During Cycles 2 and 3, physician's choice systemic monotherapy will be given along with durvalumab per protocol. Each cycle will last 21 days. Imaging to evaluate intracranial and extracranial disease will be performed after Cycle 3, and subjects with response will continue with the systemic therapy and durvalumab until progression (intracranial or extracranial), unacceptable toxicity or death."

Patients are permitted to have undergone recent craniotomy and resection of metastasis/metastases if at least 1 other intact metastasis or gross residual tumor planned for definitive SRS is present. Patients may have had prior SRS as long as the previously treated brain metastases are stable and not planned for additional therapy. Re-irradiation of a lesion previously treated with SRS is not allowed. Discrete dural lesions are allowed.\n4. Subject may have other sites of extracranial metastatic disease (does not need to be stable, as long as no signs of impending visceral crisis).\n5.

Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 highly effective methods of contraception as described in the protocol from the time of informed consent until 3 months after treatment discontinuation.\n15. Male patients must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after treatment discontinuation. See the protocol for additional information.\n16. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.\n17.

Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.\n28. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product (IP).
