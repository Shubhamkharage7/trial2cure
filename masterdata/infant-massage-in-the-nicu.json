            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the effects of Neonatal Touch and Massage Therapy on premature babies.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Do babies who receive Neonatal Touch and Massage Therapy get discharged sooner from the NICU\n* Does Neonatal Touch and Massage Therapy have a beneficial effect on weight gain, pain and stress responses, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nParticipants assigned to the treatment group will receive Neonatal Touch and Massage Therapy while admitted to the NICU. Researchers will compare their outcomes to a control group, receiving standard NICU care, to see if there are any differences in the length of hospital stay, weight gain, pain scores, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and incidence of other common conditions associated with prematurity.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Neonatal Touch and Massage Therapy on premature infants in the NICU. Babies enrolled in this study will be randomly assigned to receive Neonatal Touch and Massage or standard NICU care. Babies in the therapy group will be given Neonatal Touch or Massage therapy by certified providers 3 days per week for 5 to 15 minutes. Therapy will be done for a minimum of 4 weeks. The investigators will assess pain and stress responses before and after treatment. The investigators will also review participant's medical records to collect information about weight gain, length of hospitalization, and general health status. After a participant is discharged home, information will be collected about participant's developmental assessments at regularly scheduled NICU follow-up clinic appointments. There are no significant risks with this therapy. Potential benefits of therapy include increased weight gain, shorter hospitalization, decreased pain and stress, and improved developmental outcomes. Information gained from this study could also help future babies."
