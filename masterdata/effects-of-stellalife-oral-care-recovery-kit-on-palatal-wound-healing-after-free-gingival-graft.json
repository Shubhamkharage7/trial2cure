            "detailedDescription": "A total of 60 participants will be recruited from those needing and have been treatment planned for a free gingival graft surgery to increase keratinized gum. The study subjects will be randomly allocated to either negative control group (NC), chlorhexidine group (C) or StellaLife group (S) by randomization done using a computer-generated table.\n\nThe NC group is provided normal saline mouth-rinse to rinse 2 times per day along with placebo gel to be applied 2 times and placebo oral spray. The S group will use StellaLife Oral Care mouth-rinse, gel and spray 2 times per day. The C group will use chlorhexidine mouth-rinse and placebo gel and spray 2 times per day. All groups beginning the same day and continuing for the duration of two weeks. All patients will receive a protective splint. Following this, subjective and objective measurements on the success of the mouthwash and oral care kit will be measured.\n\nPatients will be evaluated post operatively following surgery as mentioned below:\n\n* Wound Healing Assessment and Epithelization Assessment: Postoperative Days 1, 5, 14, 21 and 28\n* Oral Health Impact Profile-14 and Functional Pain Scale: Starting on the day of the surgery and Postoperative Days 1, 5, 14, 21 and 28\n* Wound Exudate assessment: Samples collected on Postoperative Days 1, 5, 14, 21 and 28\n* Wound Plaque assessment: Starting on the day of the surgery and Postoperative Days 1, 5, 14, 21 and 28"
