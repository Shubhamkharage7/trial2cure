            "briefSummary": "The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) based sepsis screening and early warning protocol on the timing of early sepsis care in the Emergency Department (ED).",
            "detailedDescription": "Sepsis is life-threatening medical emergency and a common cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Recognizing and treating sepsis immediately is key to achieving optimal patient outcomes after sepsis. The prehospital, EMS setting represents a unique opportunity to implement best practice by operationalizing guideline-recommended, system-wide sepsis screening protocols in an effort to facilitate earlier recognition of sepsis and minimize delays in evaluation and treatment. Unfortunately, evidence-based screening tools to assist EMS providers in recognizing this heterogenous syndrome are lacking, and recognition by EMS providers is generally poor.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the prehospital sepsis (PRESS) protocol, which is an evidence-based sepsis screening and early communication protocol designed for use in the prehospital, EMS environment. The PRESS protocol pairs a validated sepsis screening tool with a prehospital sepsis alert to the receiving ED for patients who are screen positive. This innovative approach has been used to improve patient care and outcomes in other life-threatening, time-sensitive medical emergencies including heart attack and stroke. Prehospital screening and an early warning call to the ED before patient arrival provides valuable lead time that makes immediate evaluation and treatment by EMS providers possible once a patient arrives in the ED.\n\nThis study includes three study sites which are each comprised of cluster pairs of one EMS organization and one partnered acute care hospital. Each cluster pair will participate in both a baseline and intervention phase of study. EMS providers will be trained to screen for sepsis according to the PRESS protocol. The PRESS EMS protocol includes 2 major components: 1) an evidence-based sepsis screening tool, and 2) a prehospital sepsis alert call to the receiving hospital for participants who screen positive. Upon arrival to the ED, ED providers will provide immediate medical assessment to the patient to determine whether there is concern for sepsis. The overarching hypothesis is that implementation of an EMS-based sepsis screening and early warning protocol will be associated with a reduction in time first antibiotic administration in the ED among patients with sepsis."
