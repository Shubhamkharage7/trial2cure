            "detailedDescription": "The Purpose of the Research:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the effect of blood on the protein to creatine (PC) ratio in pregnant patients.\n\nThe Scientific or Scholarly Rationale:\n\nThe PC ratio is used to diagnosis proteinuria in pregnancy. It is thought that blood in the urine will cause the PC ratio to be elevated but there are no current studies to prove this hypothesis.\n\nThe Procedures to be Performed:\n\nUpon presentation to the Labor and Delivery Triage or the Antepartum Unit, patients will be enrolled in the study. Urine collection that is not needed for medical workup will be collected and saved, and an extra 8 mLs of blood will be drawn during routine lab collection by phlebotomy team. Additional lab costs will be covered by Marshall Obstetrics \\& Gynecology.\n\nLab protocol: Divide urine into 4 different specimen cups with 20 mLs of urine each to measure urinalysis (UA) and PC ratio:\n\n1. UA and PC ratio on original sample\n2. UA and PC ratio with 1 mL of whole blood added\n3. UA and PC ratio with 2 mL of whole blood added\n4. UA and PC ratio with 5 mL of whole blood added\n\nSubjects medical records will be reviewed for past obstetrical history after consent to be in the study.\n\nThe Risks and Potential Benefits of the Research:\n\nRisks: 8 mLs of additional maternal blood will be drawn for study purposes. Possible risks could include pain, bleeding, fainting, bruising, infection, or hematoma (blood clot under the skin) at the injection site. Please note that routine blood would be drawn regardless of study enrollment.\n\nBenefits: Our hypothesis is that the PC ratio will be elevated by contamination with blood. It is unknown if this hypothesis is correct.\n\nComplete Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (may be submitted separately if extensive):\n\nInclusion criteria includes patients presenting to Labor and Delivery Triage or Antepartum Unit at Cabell Huntington Hospital between the ages of 18 and approximately 45 years and gestational age of \\>20 weeks.\n\nExclusion criteria includes pre-existing proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) or hematuria (blood in the urine)."
