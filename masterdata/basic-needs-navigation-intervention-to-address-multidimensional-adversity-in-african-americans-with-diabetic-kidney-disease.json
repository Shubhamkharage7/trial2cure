            "briefSummary": "The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a basic needs navigation intervention on improving clinical outcomes, self-care behaviors and quality of life in low-income African Americans with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) experiencing multidimensional adversity.\n\nThe study objective will be achieved with the following aims:\n\nAim 1: To determine the feasibility of a basic needs navigation intervention as measured by recruitment, session attendance and retention in low-income Africans Americans with DKD experiencing multidimensional adversity.\n\nAim 2: To test the preliminary efficacy of a basic needs navigation intervention on clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, lipids) in low-income Africans Americans with DKD experiencing multidimensional adversity.\n\nHypothesis 1: Individuals randomized to the basic needs navigation intervention will have improved HbA1c at 6 months of follow-up compared to an enhanced usual care group.\n\nHypothesis 2: Individuals randomized to the basic needs navigation intervention will have improved blood pressure at 6 months of follow-up compared to an enhanced usual care group.\n\nHypothesis 3: Individuals randomized to the basic needs navigation intervention will have improved lipids at 6 months of follow-up compared to an enhanced usual care group.\n\nAim 3: To test the preliminary efficacy of a basic needs navigation intervention on self-care behaviors and quality of life (SF-12) in low-income Africans Americans with DKD experiencing multidimensional adversity.\n\nHypothesis 1: Individuals randomized to the basic needs navigation intervention will have improved self-care behaviors at 6 months of follow-up compared to an enhanced usual care group.\n\nHypothesis 2: Individuals randomized to the basic needs navigation intervention will have improved quality of life at 6 months of follow-up compared to an enhanced usual care group.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multidimensional adversity, defined as having three or more social adversities such as housing instability, food insecurity, transportation needs, utility needs, interpersonal safety, and financial strain impacts the complex self-management of DKD and negatively impacts health outcomes. Evidence suggests patient navigation programs may be a promising strategy to improve health outcomes in low-income individuals with chronic disease. However, there is limited evidence on the use of patient navigator programs to address multidimensional adversity in individuals with chronic disease. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to address this gap in knowledge.\n\nStudy overview: This will be accomplished using a two-arm pilot randomized control trial. One hundred (100) African American adults with DKD experiencing multidimensional adversity will be randomized into one of two arms: 1) Intervention arm and 2) Enhanced usual care arm.\n\nDescription of intervention: Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive the manualized study intervention which includes three components 1) DKD education, 2) Individualized basic needs navigation, and 3) Lifestyle coaching and skills training. Participants will be provided a FORA 2-in-1 device with glucose test strips to allow testing at least once a day. The device automatically uploads blood pressure and glucose readings to a secure server in real time and the health educator will have access to this secure server. Readings will be used to guide lifestyle coaching and skills training. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 3- and 6-months for clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, lipids), self-care behaviors (diet, exercise, and medication adherence), and quality of life (SF-12).\n\nControl arm (Enhanced usual care arm): Participants randomized to the control arm will receive the manualized study intervention which incudes only DKD education.\n\nAll participants will be assessed at baseline, 3- and 6-months for clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, lipids), self-care behaviors (diet, exercise, and medication adherence), and quality of life (SF-12)."
