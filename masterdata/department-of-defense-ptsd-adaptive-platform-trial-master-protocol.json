            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate multiple potential pharmacotherapeutic interventions for PTSD utilizing an adaptive platform trial design. Participants are randomized among the multiple cohorts in the study and the resulting randomization enables sharing/pooling of control participants, where all interventions may be compared to a common control (placebo). This master protocol describes the default procedures and analyses for all cohorts; treatment-specific procedures will be described in the Master Protocol cohort-specific appendices. Individual cohorts may have additional eligibility requirements, safety and efficacy procedures, or endpoints, which will be described in corresponding intervention-specific clinicaltrials.gov records.",
            "detailedDescription": "The general structure of this Adaptive Platform Trial (APT) consists of a 30-day Screening Period, a 12-week Platform Treatment Period, and a 4-week Safety Follow-up. The trial begins with 3 open platform cohorts (it is possible for 1 of the cohorts to begin sooner than the others, as necessary). Importantly, the integration of multi-modal biomarker assessments within the Department of Defense (DOD) PTSD APT allows for defining future cohorts based on to-be-determined biomarker signatures in a multi stage approach. Initial testing in non-biomarker-defined cohorts will be referred to as \"main stage\" testing, while testing in biomarker-defined cohorts will occur within \"biomarker extensions.\"\n\nInitially viewed as a 3-arm trial versus control, the adaptive platform trial will continue enrollment until decisions are made to stop all of the cohorts. At quarterly interim analyses, unblinded data will be reviewed by an independent, firewalled Independent Statistical Analysis Committee (ISAC) and a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). At each interim analysis, the possible cohort-level decisions that could be made include stopping enrollment to a cohort for futility, anticipated success, or for reaching the maximum sample size. New cohorts for investigation can be added at any time. The DSMB may recommend stopping a cohort for safety reasons.\n\nCandidate biomarker data will be retrospectively analyzed after each cohort has completed main stage testing, and cohort testing may be re-initiated for prospective evaluation of the treatment in a subject population enriched (eg, either only biomarker \"positive\" or only biomarker \"negative\" participants would be enrolled) or stratified based on biomarker status. In addition, candidate biomarkers (which may also be characterized or validated externally to the DOD PTSD APT) may be used to stratify randomization across cohorts or as a prospective enrichment strategy at the initiation of a cohort. Exploratory biomarker data will be evaluated throughout the trial to identify additional candidate biomarkers for testing within the APT, or to inform candidate drug selection for additional cohorts.\n\nFor information specific to each intervention included in this platform trial, please refer to the below corresponding, separate, clinicaltrials.gov records:\n\nVilazodone NCT05948579; Fluoxetine NCT05948553; Daridorexant NCT05948540\n\nParties interested in having their intervention considered for testing within the DOD PTSD APT should complete a request for information form using this webpage https://citeline.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0oDoJXvIL7EFM1M."

The tablets/capsules used in the cohorts may not be visually similar between cohorts and blinding to cohort assignment is not necessary to avoid bias. However, within each cohort, participants, site personnel, contract research personnel and the sponsor will be blind to treatment assignment (intervention vs. placebo).",

Has any history of suicide-related hospitalization following initiation of a medication used for psychiatric symptoms or disorders.\n3. Is taking any prohibited medication per Section 8.5.1 or cohort-specific restrictions (Table 3), is unable/unwilling to discontinue medications, or in the PI's judgement, cannot discontinue medications. Subjects must agree to a washout period of at least 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note, the half-life of the parent drug (not metabolites) should be used in this calculation.\n4. In the 3 months prior to the Baseline visit, has initiated or terminated individual or group PTSD specific psychotherapy (eg, Eye Movement Desensitization \\& Reprocessing, Prolonged Exposure, Cognitive Processing Therapy, Stress Inoculation Training, Present Centered Therapy), or therapy is anticipated to conclude during the study. Completion of \u22642 sessions in the prior 3 months with no plans to continue is not exclusionary. Participants in stable trauma-focused or non-trauma focused therapy must agree to continue treatment for the duration of participation in the study.\n5.

Has a history of neoplastic disease or completion of treatment in the last 5 years, except for treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n11. Has any clinically significant abnormal findings on the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at the Screening or Baseline visits, such as:.\n\n    1. Abnormal heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, or torsade de pointes)\n    2. ECG with a QTc interval \\>450 msec for males or \\>470 msec for females (QT interval corrected with Fridericia correction \\[QTcF\\]) At Screening, eligibility will be based on the central ECG reading. At baseline, eligibility will be based on the local ECG reading by a qualified site investigator.\n12.

ALT or AST \\>2 \u00d7 ULN\n    2. total bilirubin level \\>1.5 \u00d7 ULN (unless previously known Gilbert syndrome)\n    3. prolonged prothrombin time \\>1.5 \u00d7 ULN\n14. Has a prior history of drug induced liver injury characterized by ALT or AST \\>3 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) AND total bilirubin level \\>2 \u00d7 ULN without cholestasis (ie, Alkaline Phosphatase \\<2 \u00d7 ULN).\n15. Has any other clinically significant laboratory result at Screening that could impact the participant's safety or participation in the study, as determined by the Site PI.\n16. Has any other concurrent psychiatric or medical condition that would impact the participant's safety, ability to appropriately complete evaluations, or participation in the study, as determined by the Site PI.\n17. Does not have a stable method of contact over the duration of the study.\n18. Is currently involved in litigation, medical evaluation for disability benefits or damages, or benefit examination related to the PTSD diagnosis.\n19.
