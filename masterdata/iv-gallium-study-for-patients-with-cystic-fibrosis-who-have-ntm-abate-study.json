Documentation of a CF diagnosis as evidenced by one or more clinical features consistent with the CF phenotype.\n5. Documentation of persistently positive NTM culture results that are positive for the same species or sub-species (either M. avium complex, M. abscessus complex, or both M. avium and M. abscessus). Persistently positive cultures are those which meet ONE of the following criteria, after first ignoring any negative culture results that occur within 7 days of a positive culture:\n\n   1.

At least one NTM culture result in the previous 4 months from sputum or BAL is positive. If there are four or more cultures in the last 12-months at least 3 out of the 4 most recent cultures must be positive for NTM. If there are three or fewer cultures in the past 12 months, then at least 2 of the 3 most recent cultures must be positive for NTM even if some of those cultures are more than 12 months ago.\n6.

Any of the following abnormal lab values at screening:\n\n   * Hemoglobin \\<10g/dL\n   * Platelets \\<100,000/mm3\n   * Absolute neutrophil count \\< 1500/mm3\n   * Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u22653 x upper limit of normal\n   * Serum creatinine \\> 2.0 mg/dl and \u22651.5 x upper limit of normal\n   * Ionized calcium \u2264 lower limit of normal (only performed if total calcium is \u2264 lower limit of normal)\n2. History of solid organ or hematological transplantation\n3. Use of bisphosphonates within 7 days prior to Day 1\n4. Known sensitivity to gallium\n5. Use of any investigational drug and/or participated in any interventional clinical trial within 28 days prior to Day 1\n6. In the opinion of the Investigator, features of active NTM disease are present (e.g., clinical worsening is likely due to NTM disease despite definitive treatment of co-pathogens and/or acute exacerbations)\n7. Undergoing treatment for NTM disease or anticipate beginning treatment within 3 months\n8. Current diagnosis of osteoporosis\n9. For people of childbearing potential:\n\n   * Positive pregnancy test at Visit 1 or\n   * Lactating or\n   * Unwilling to practice a medically acceptable form of contraception (acceptable forms of contraception: abstinence, hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, or barrier method plus a spermicidal agent), unless surgically sterilized or postmenopausal during the study\n10.
