The device is FDA approved for the treatment of scarring in all skin types. The study team seeks to observe the efficacy and tolerability in patients without active HS lesions. The study may enroll up to 19 subjects looking for improvement in their HS scarring in the axillary region. The subjects will receive treatment with the Sciton Joule Er:YAG 2940nm laser along with treatment with topical tretinoin, hydroquinone, and hydrocortisone starting 1 month prior to first laser treatment as per standard of care for scar treatment. Each patient will receive 3 treatments spaced approximately one month apart. The patients will be surveyed about their quality of life due to HS scarring, as well as their perspectives on their axillary scarring before and after their assigned treatments. All patients included in the study will have no contraindications to either laser or the use of standard treatment protocol (tretinoin and hydroquinone). Subjects in the laser group will complete a DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) survey, patient satisfaction survey, and clinical photographs at each treatment visit and at follow-up 1, 2, and 3 months after the last treatment. Subjects in the topical treatment group will be evaluated at the initial visit, month 3 and month 6."
