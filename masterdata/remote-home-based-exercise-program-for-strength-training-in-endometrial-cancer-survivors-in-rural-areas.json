            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies how well a remotely delivered home-based exercise program for strength training works to positively impact endometrial cancer (EC) survivorship for patients with decreased cancer survivorship access. Cancer survivors in rural areas face barriers to supportive care, including geographic and environmental barriers to exercise and technology. Rural areas in the Midwest are underserved in terms of cancer care thus, it is essential to develop and test interventions that are scalable and can reach many individuals including those living in rural areas. Remotely-delivered exercise intervention approach allows for cancer survivors who may live far away from their primary treatment center to engage in supportive therapy via exercise interventions delivered in a sustainable context. In addition, historically black, hispanic and native endometrial cancer survivors have shorter survival and less access to survivorship care, so alternative models for healthcare delivery are needed in this underserved group. Information gained from this research may help determine whether utilizing a remotely delivered exercise program can positively impact EC survivorship for patients with decreased cancer survivorship access.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To develop and tailor a fully remote home-based exercise intervention for EC patients.\n\nII. To test the recruitment and retention and acceptability of a fully remote home-based telehealth exercise intervention in older adult patients that live in rural America and are survivors of early stage, low risk endometrial cancer.\n\nIII. To measure the effectiveness of exercise intervention on quality of life in endometrial cancer patients, specifically in the realm of physical functioning.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants participate in a home-based exercise program with an exercise prescription that will include resistance band and body weight exercises targeting the 5 major large muscle groups along with 3 booklets about exercise and exercise training and attend weekly exercise coaching sessions to report on exercise adherence and to progress exercise over 10 weeks on study.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 6 months."
