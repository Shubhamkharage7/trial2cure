FMISO provides information about the oxygen levels in a tumor, which may affect how the tumor behaves. PET/MRI imaging produces images of the brain and how the body functions. FMISO PET/MRI may help investigators see how much oxygen is getting in the brain tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of obtaining \u00b9\u2078F- fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET (hypoxic volume and tumor to blood background values \\[T/B\\]) and dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced (DSC) \\& diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI measures in patients with intracranial brain tumors.\n\nII. Determine if MRI contrast-enhancement and hypoxic volume are imaging profiles of glioblastoma immunotherapy-mediated pseudoprogression or true progression in a clinical trial.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of baseline and follow-up FMISO PET and MR imaging co-registration.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET imaging metrics as assessed by baseline \"test\" and \"retest\" experiments.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants receive FMISO intravenously (IV). Participants also undergo dynamic PET/computed tomography (CT) or PET/MRI over 120 minutes beginning 1 minute prior to FMISO injection, and static PET/CT or PET/MRI over 20-40 minutes approximately 90 minutes after FMISO injection. Participants then undergo a retest examination within 7 days. Participants may undergo 2 more PET/MRI or PET/CT scans no sooner than every 4 weeks. Supplemental oxygen may be administered to effect MRI signal.\n\nAfter conclusion of the diagnostic tests, participants are followed for up to 5 years."
