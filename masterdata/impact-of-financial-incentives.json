This trial will look at the impact of clinic-level financial incentives to improve provider communication and increase HPV vaccine uptake. The recruitment goal for the trial is 34 clinics in healthcare systems, including 9 rural-serving clinics. The researchers will randomize clinics using simple randomization (1:1). Some clinics will receive communication training. Other clinics will receive the same training and a clinic-level financial incentive program with a monthly data feedback report to increase HPV vaccine uptake. The researchers will use medical record data to compare changes in HPV vaccination among children ages 9-12. Clinics will be followed for 24 months. The study will engage clinical staff. Researchers will not have direct contact with children or their families."
