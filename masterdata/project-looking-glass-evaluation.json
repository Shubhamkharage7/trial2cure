A cohort of subjects undergoing standard of care radiation therapy will be selected based on malignancies from six disease sites. The Halcyon 4.0 images acquired in place of standard evaluation CT scans during the course of treatment will be used for target volume delineation and normal structures segmentation. Treatment plans will be recalculated based on the Halcyon 4.0 images from this system and compared to the original treatment plan. Dose differences will be evaluated. Two-tailed t-test will be used to compare the statistical significance of the dosimetric results as well as the volumetric differences among target volume and the volumes of organs at risk."
