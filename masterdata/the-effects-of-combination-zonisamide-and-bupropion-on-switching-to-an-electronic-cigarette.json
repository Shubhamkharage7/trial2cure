There will be a data collection period of at least five days to obtain baseline information on the use of combustible cigarettes. All participants enrolled in the study will receive a JUUL e-cigarette at Visit 2 for ad libitum use. After the first week of e-cigarette use (at Visit 3), participants will be given bupropion (150 mg each morning for days 1-3, then 300 mg daily) with either zonisamide (100 mg daily) or placebo (group 1 and group 2 respectively), or placebo for both medications (group 3) in addition to continued use of the e-cigarette. At each visit, participants will receive enough study drugs (or placebos) and e-cigarettes to last until their next study visit. The combination of zonisamide and bupropion use will continue until Visit 6 (7 weeks of treatment), and e-cigarette use will continue until the end of treatment (Visit 7)."
