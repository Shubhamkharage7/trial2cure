The hypothesis is that this combination therapy will be safe, well-tolerated, and effective. If so, patients with PTLD will be able to be spared the toxicity of anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Additionally, the role of the tumor microenvironment and the role of anellovirus, a non-human pathogen virus, will be explored as prognostic markers in PTLD."
