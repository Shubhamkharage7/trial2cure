            "briefSummary": "The multilevel socio-ecological barriers to physical activity experienced by people with physical disabilities cut across structures and systems, community, institutions and organizations, interpersonal, and individual levels. Several studies have attempted to understand these barriers and facilitators, but to date, no study or system has attempted to systematically resolve these multilevel barriers and capitalize on the potential facilitators that can increase access to exercise and recreation programs, services and facilities for people with disabilities.\n\nIn RecTech's previous cycle of funding, this void was addressed in a Proof of Concept product called the Activity Inclusion Mapping System (AIMS). AIMS enabled people with disabilities to quickly and precisely identify accessible and usable community-based physical activity resources and services. Based on the positive feedback received at the annual RESNA conference and from our Consumer Research Advisory Committee (CRAC) during preparation of this application, the investigators propose to develop an innovative person-centered geotagged Social Networking System (SNS) based on the social-ecological model of health.\n\nThe focus of this proposed Proof of Product project is to address multilevel barriers and facilitators associated with community-based leisure time physical activity (LTPA) using crowdsourcing principles for gathering data. The project is targeted to all people with physical disabilities.",
            "detailedDescription": "The stage of development for a RecTech Match website is a Proof of Product. The RecTech Match website will be a new online resource that will provide physical activity resources inclusive of people with disabilities. Users will be able to search for accessible opportunities for physical activity near them, watch videos on-demand related to exercise, and read articles to learn about exercise or introduce them to new community exercise opportunities. Once successful feasibility testing is completed, the investigators will work with nchpad.org, to seed information and launch nationally.\n\nThirty users with physical disabilities, ages 18 to 64, will participate in a 12-wk two-arm parallel randomized control trial (15 per group) aimed at reducing barriers to physical activity, increasing social support and increasing leisure-time physical activity minutes. A sample of 15 per arm will be sufficient for our pilot/feasibility study. The control arm will have access to generic information available on the National Center on Health Physical Activity and Disability (NCHPAD) website, which includes the same information but is not delivered through RecTechMatch.com. All users will be recruited online. Fitbit sensors will be provided to participants to objectively measure physical activity minutes Process feasibility outcome measures will include recruitment, retention and adherence, and Intervention efficacy outcomes will include the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Barriers to Physical Activity Questionnaire for People with Mobility Impairments (BPAQ-MI), and Chogahara's Social Influence on Physical Activity questionnaire. Daily self-report physical activity will be collected by secure email or text. Health Coaching calls and exit interviews will be recorded via Twilio Flex.\n\nAfter baseline assessments are completed by all participants, each will be randomized to the 2 study arms in a 1:1 Each participant will be randomly assigned (through REDCap) to 1 of 2 treatment conditions: (1) RecTech match intervention with tele-coaching support, and (2) control. All participants will receive a welcome call and asked to provide days and times that are most convenient to attend tele-health coaching calls. Intervention group participants will receive an orientation call once shipment is received of the Fitbit device to help set the device up and ready for data collection.\n\nThe intervention group will be mailed a Fitbit device and provided access to the RecTech Match website. These participants will receive weekly calls for the first 6 weeks, and a call every other week for the following 6 weeks (9 in total) from a health coach to discuss intervention progress, facilitate setting physical activity goals, and help mitigate obstacles to participate in physical activity in the community. Participants will be free to access the features and resources of the website. The Fitbit data will be collected on an ongoing basis and the participants will receive daily texts asking them to rate the amount of physical activity for the day.\n\nThe control participants will not have access to the RecTech Match website; however, control participants will be directed to generic information available on the NCHPAD website, which includes the same information but is not delivered through RecTechMatch.com.\n\nAll participants will receive survey packets through RedCap's auto-delivery system. Survey packets will be delivered at 12 and 24 weeks. Additionally, Intervention participants will participate in a short exit interview."
