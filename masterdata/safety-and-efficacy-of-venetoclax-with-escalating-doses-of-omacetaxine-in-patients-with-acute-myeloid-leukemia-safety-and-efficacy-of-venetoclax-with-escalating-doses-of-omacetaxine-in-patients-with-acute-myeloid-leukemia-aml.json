            "briefSummary": "This will be a single arm, open label Phase Ib dose-escalation study of the combination of VEN and OM, conducted using an innovative Bayesian Optimal Interval-design, to find the MTD in participants with AML failing treatment with venetoclax-containing regimens. Treatment plan will consist of an induction phase, followed by a consolidation phase if applicable.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase Ib study of VEN and OM, the investigator will conduct a Bayesian Optimal Interval-designed trial following the approach of Yuan et al 40 to find the MTD with a target DLT rate of 2%, 4 pre-specified doses, and between 24 and up to 30 participants. Beginning with the first participant treated at the lowest dose of OM 0.625 mg/m2 q12h with VEN 400 mg, dose escalation and de-escalation of OM will involve a comparison of the observed DLT rate (p) at the current dose with a pair of fixed, pre-specified boundary rates: \u03bbe (escalation) with p \u2264 0.157; \u03bbd (de-escalation) with p \u2265 0.238; or otherwise remain at the same dose per the dosing schedule. The trial will start with a cohort size of 1 participant (unless DLT is experienced) and escalated for each subsequent participant until the first DLT occurs and the current dose cohort is expanded to 3.40 In a simulation of these conditions with a target DLT rate of 20% (1), the percentage correct selection of the MTD is between 60% with enrollment of 20 participants and 70% with enrollment of 24 participants. Implementation of the trial design will be performed using R package 'BOIN'. If the investigator observes an unexpected toxicity in Cohort 1 the investigator will use OM 0.5 mg/m2 daily with VEN for Cohort -1 Following each cycle, participants will be evaluated for complete response (CR) by International Working Group (IWG) criteria 41\n\nThe subject visit schedule and procedures are below:\n\nScreening Visit:\n\nPhysical Exam (vital signs, medical history, prior therapies, height and weight) Urine Pregnancy Test, EKG, Blood Work (Complete blood count, (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), Uric Acid, Albumin, ALT/AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, protein, LDH, PT/INR, PTT and fibrinogen, HIV, Hepatitis B/C) Bone Marrow Aspirate\n\nTreatment Visits:\n\nDay 1 of Each Cycle:\n\nPhysical Exam Urine Pregnancy Test, EKG, (only after 1st, 7th and 11th dose of study medication) Blood Work (Complete blood count, (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), Uric Acid, Albumin, ALT/AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, protein, LDH, PT/INR, PTT and fibrinogen, HIV, Hepatitis B/C) Study Drug (s) Given\n\nDay 28 of each Cycle:\n\nBone Marrow Biopsy Safety Follow Up Visit: (14 days + 7 days after the last dose of treatment) performed 14 days (\u00b17 days) after the last dose of treatment.

Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study).\n13. Patients who have received strong and/or moderate CYP3A inducers or inhibitors within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment unless therapy is deemed necessary by the treating physician. (See Section 8.7.2, Table 3 and Appendix 3).\n14. Patients who have consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Starfruit within 3 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n15. Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration.\n16. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study compliance and follow-up.\n17. Unable or unwilling to undergo a screening bone marrow study.\n18. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.",
