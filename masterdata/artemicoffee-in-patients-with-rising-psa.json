Approximately 50-90% of men with high-risk prostate cancer will experience a BCR. Artesunate has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in both in vivo and in vitro cell lines. It is hypothesized that Artemisia annua (Aa) coffee has the potential to decrease rising PSA among patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.",
