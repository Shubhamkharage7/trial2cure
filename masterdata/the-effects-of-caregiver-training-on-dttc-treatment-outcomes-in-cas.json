Forty children with CAS, between the ages of 2;5 and 7;11 years of age, will be recruited for this study. All children will receive DTTC treatment at the frequency of standard care (2x/week) in a university clinic over and 8-week period. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Direct Training Group; the Indirect Training Group. All caregivers will complete an educational module about CAS, will observe all sessions, and will engage in home practice with their children. Caregivers in the Direct Group will receive coaching in the use of DTTC with their child during a portion of each treatment session to support home practice, whereas those in the Indirect Group will not receive detailed guidance for home practice. Caregivers in both groups will practice at home with their children during the treatment phase (3x/week). Following the treatment phase, home practice will continue at a higher frequency (6x/week) during a 4-week follow-up phase. Treatment outcomes will be compared between groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "Forty children with CAS, between 2;5 and 7;11 years of age will receive DTTC treatment 2x/week over an 8-week period along with home practice with a caregiver. Prior to treatment, all caregivers will complete an online self-guided educational module about CAS and DTTC. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) Direct Training Group (DTTC + Home Practice + Direct Caregiver Training); 2) Indirect Training Group (DTTC + Home Practice + Indirect Caregiver Training).\n\nChildren in the Direct Training Group will receive DTTC treatment during one half of each session administered only by the SLP, while the caregiver observes. DTTC will be administered by the caregiver with direct coaching by the speech language pathologist (SLP) in the other half of the session. Children in the Indirect Training Group will only receive DTTC treatment administered by the SLP, while the caregiver observes. In both groups, caregivers will review home practice guidelines with the clinician at the end of each therapy session, and engage in home practice with their children. Home practice will consist of 30-minute practice sessions 3x/week during the 8-week treatment phase and 6x/week during the 4-week follow-up phase. Caregivers in the Direct Training Group will be provided specific guidance regarding practice techniques, whereas caregivers in the Indirect Training Group will only be provided treatment words to be practiced at home and instructed to apply what they have observed during SLP-administered DTTC.\n\nProbe data will be collected during the Pre-Treatment, Treatment and Follow-Up phases. The study duration is 16 weeks in total duration, for all participants. Probe words will consist of 20 potential treated items to evaluate treatment gains and 30 generalization items to assess carryover of treatment gains to untreated words.\n\nThe study will address the following aims:\n\nAim 1: Quantify the effects of direct vs. indirect caregiver training during a period of DTTC combined with home practice on whole word accuracy in treated and generalization probes at post-treatment and maintenance.\n\nAim 2: Quantify the effects of direct vs. indirect caregiver training during a period of DTTC combined with home practice on phoneme accuracy in treated words and generalization probes at post-treatment and maintenance.\n\nAim 3: Quantify the effects of direct vs. indirect caregiver training during a period of DTTC combined with home practice on speech intelligibility at post-treatment and maintenance.\n\nAim 4: Quantify the effects of direct vs. indirect caregiver training during a period of DTTC combined with home practice on functional communication at post-treatment and maintenance."

Treatment follows a temporal hierarchy where children receive multisensory cueing to establish accurate movements. First, the child imitates the clinician's production. If inaccurate, the child simultaneously produces the target with the clinician while cueing is provided. Upon achieving accuracy within simultaneous productions, the target is practiced within direct imitation while the clinician adds/fades cues based on the child's productions. When the child accurately produces the target in direct imitation, the target is practiced with varied prosody. Next, the target is practiced within delayed imitation where a child produces a word following a 2-3 second delay after the clinician's production. Upon accurately producing the target at all levels, the word is practiced within spontaneous productions.",
