            "detailedDescription": "This is a non-randomized phase II trial in adult male and female subjects diagnosed with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated Recurrent Respiratory Papilloma to test the safety and efficacy of the drug combination Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Pembrolizumab or Lenvatinib for HPV-associated Recurrent Respiratory Papilloma but they have been approved for other uses. Lenvatinib works by blocking certain proteins that are associated with tumor growth. Lenvatinib also blocks the growth of blood vessels feeding tumors to cause tumor cell death. Pembrolizumab helps the body's immune system destroy cancer cells. This study is investigating whether the combination of Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab may eliminate HPV-associated RRPs.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment and evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years and will be followed for 1 year.\n\nIt is expected that about 21 people will take part in this research study.\n\nMerck is supporting this research study by providing Pembrolizumab and supporting the research study procedures.\n\nEisai is supporting this research study by providing Lenvatinib."

NOTE: No testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n* Uncontrolled blood pressure (systolic BP\\>150 mmHg or diastolic BP \\>90 mmHG) in spite of an optimized regimen of antihypertensive medication.\n* Significant cardiovascular impairment: history of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months of the first dose of study drug, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment at screening.\n* Has QTc prolongation \\>480 msec, as calculated by either the Bazett or Fridericia formula, as per institutional standard\n* Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.\n* Has \\>1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment indicates that the urine protein is \\< 1g/24 hours.\n* Has clinically significant gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome.\n* Has a known history of colitis.\n* Has a known history of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).\n* Participants with history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab and/or lenvatinib, and breastfeeding should be discontinued.",
