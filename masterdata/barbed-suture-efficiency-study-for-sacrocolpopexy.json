One of the time consuming parts of the procedure is vaginal mesh attachment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research study is to compare two different suture types that are used to attach vaginal mesh that is typically used in women undergoing robotic or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (attachment of the vagina to the sacral promontory). The barbed suture is one continuous suture, while the delayed absorbable suture involves placing individual sutures and tying a knot for each. All women will have permanent sutures that attach the mesh to the sacral promontory, which is standard of care. The goal is to determine if the barbed delayed absorbable suture decreases the time of vaginal mesh attachment."
