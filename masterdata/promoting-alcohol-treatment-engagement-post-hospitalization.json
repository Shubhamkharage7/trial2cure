The main goals of the BNI are to: 1) lessen ambivalence about reducing alcohol use; and 2) negotiate strategies for change. During BNI, the HPA will: 1) Raise the subject of alcohol; 2) Provide feedback: review the patient's alcohol consumption, make a connection to the patient's medical condition and reason for hospitalization; review guidelines for lower risk alcohol use; 3) Enhance motivation: have the patient identify on a readiness change ruler and develop discrepancy; and 4) Negotiate and Advise: negotiate goal, give advice, have patient complete drinking agreement; summarize and arrange follow-up.",

The program tracks, for each participant, time logged onto the program, modules accessed, progress through the program from session to session, completion of homework assignments, and learning of CBT principles through brief quizzes. Participants will be allowed to repeat modules as desired. During the BNI telephone booster, the HPA will inquire about engagement with CBT4CBT, address any questions and problems with the program, and encourage practice of coping activities (i.e., homework).",
