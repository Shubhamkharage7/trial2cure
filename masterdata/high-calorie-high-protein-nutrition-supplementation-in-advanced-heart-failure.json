The investigators hypothesize that participants with advanced heart failure who receive the high calorie high protein nutrition supplementation strategy will experience an improvement in quality of life compared to those patients that receive usual care.",

Study subjects will receive a calorie and protein nutritional supplement, Ensure Original, manufactured by Abbott laboratories for 30 days after hospital discharge. The study site will be Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment and dietary recalls until the completion of the study."
