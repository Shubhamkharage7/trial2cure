The PI and staff will conduct this study in partnership with the Wake Forest Infectious Diseases Specialty Clinic, one of the largest Ryan White-funded clinics in North Carolina, which serves more than 2,000 PWH annually from a predominantly rural catchment area that includes South Central Appalachia. This area has high rates of both FI and HIV.",
