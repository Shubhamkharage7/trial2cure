The liver stiffness measurements are then translated into a score that tells how much liver fibrosis or fat is present. Patients identified with potential for fatty liver or specific liver-related diseases causing fibrosis would be approached for a voluntary FibroScan measurement. From these patients, the investigators will collect information related to demographics, disease history, medical comorbidities, social history, laboratory and radiologic parameters. This information, along with clinical data associated with the patient will be placed in a database for use in identifying potential subjects for future trials."

The velocity of returning shear waves, measured at a depth of 25-65 mm, is converted into a liver stiffness measurement (LSM). The LSM obtained from a given VCTE exam is the median value of at least 10 successful measurements.
