            "detailedDescription": "Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, a large proportion of patients experience significant weight regain with longer follow-up.\n\nIn this randomized controlled trial employing a SMART design, a total of 120 subjects with weight regain after bariatric surgery, will be initially randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to daily treatment with topiramate (TPM) 50 mg or phentermine (PHEN) 7.5 mg or placebo. After 4 months, responders (those with \u22655% weight loss) will continue the same treatment, while nonresponders will be re-randomized to a higher dose of the same drug or phentermine/topiramate 7.5/50 mg combination (PHEN/TPM) during Months 5-12. All subjects will receive diet and lifestyle counseling throughout the study.\n\nAim 1: To determine whether pharmacotherapy can reverse post-bariatric surgery weight regain.\n\nHypothesis: Compared to placebo, all three active drug therapies - TPM, PHEN, and PHEN/TPM will lead to greater percent weight loss at Month 12.\n\nAim 2: To examine change in energy intake assessed by a dietitian interview.\n\nHypothesis: Compared to placebo, active drug therapies will lead to greater reduction in energy intake at Month 12.\n\nAim 3: To examine changes in the most common maladaptive eating behaviors in the post-bariatric surgery patients - grazing, loss-of-control eating, and binge eating.\n\nHypothesis: Compared to placebo, active drug therapies will lead to decreased maladaptive eating behaviors."
