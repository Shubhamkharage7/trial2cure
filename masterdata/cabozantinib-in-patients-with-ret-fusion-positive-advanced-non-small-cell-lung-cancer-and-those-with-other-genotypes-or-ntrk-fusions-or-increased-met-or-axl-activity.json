            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this phase II study is to find out what effects cabozantinib (XL184) has, good and/or bad, in patients whose tumors one of the following gene changes RET, ROS1, or NTRK fusion, or increased MET or AXL activity.\n\nA phase II study looks at how effective a medication is at treating a specific type of cancer and collects information on the side effects of the study treatment.\n\nRET, ROS1, or NTRK fusion or increased MET or AXL activity gene leads to lung cancer cell growth. Cabozantinib is an oral medicine that inhibits of RET, ROS1, NTRK, MET, and AXL. In addition, this drug interferes with other cell pathways that also cause cancer cells to grow, form new blood vessels, and spread to other organs of the body. The goal of using cabozantinib is to shrink the cancer and to prevent it from growing\n\nCabozantinib has been studied and shown to cause cancer shrinkage in other cancers such as medullary thyroid cancer and prostate cancer. We thus have a good idea of what side-effects it causes and can anticipate them."
