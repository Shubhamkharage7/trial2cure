            "briefSummary": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, is a common injury sustained by Veterans. While most individuals who sustain mTBI experience a complete recovery within several weeks of injury, many Veterans with history of mTBI report frequent and long-lasting neurobehavioral complaints and functional impairment. Though research suggests that these outcomes are strongly influenced by co-occurring conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and chronic pain, evidence-based interventions capable of addressing this wide array of concerns are lacking. This study seeks to address this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of a brief and flexible behavioral health treatment (Problem-Solving Training for Concussion, or PST-Concussion), which was designed to be delivered by generalist providers working in VA primary care settings. If PST-Concussion is shown to be effective, this skills-focused intervention may help improve Veterans' recovery experience following mTBI.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be a longitudinal randomized two-arm parallel group clinical trial. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either PST-Concussion or treatment as usual (TAU). Participants assigned to PST-Concussion will receive six, approximately 30-minute telehealth treatment sessions. Assessments will include standard self-report and cognitive measures that will be administered at baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of PST-Concussion in reducing psychological distress compared to TAU. Secondary and tertiary objectives will be to evaluate whether PST-Concussion is associated with appreciable change in subjective neurocognitive functioning, objective neurocognitive functioning, psychosocial functioning, and disability and quality of life. Multi-level modeling will be used to evaluate treatment effects at post-treatment and three-month follow-up. A test of non-inferiority will be conducted to evaluate the potential durability of observed treatment effects from post-test to follow-up. A portion of participants assigned to PST-Concussion will also be interviewed at post-treatment or follow-up to gain insight into the practical impact of intervention on psychosocial functioning and quality of life."
