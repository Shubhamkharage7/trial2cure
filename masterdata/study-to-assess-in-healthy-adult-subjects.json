All SAD cohorts will follow a sentinel design. Following completion of each cohort, safety and tolerability data through 96 hours post-dose will be reviewed to determine whether to progress to the next dose level and the dose level for the next cohort.\n\nPart 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of SC MAD administrations (once weekly for 4 weeks) of PDM608 across up to 4 cohorts of subjects. Following completion of each cohort the safety and tolerability data 96 hours post last dose will be reviewed to determine whether to progress to the next dose level and the dose level to be administered."

Prior to database lock and unblinding, all original randomization materials including the original final signed and dated randomization schedule will be held by the Quality Assurance department at the study site. The Data Sciences department will not have access to the randomization schedule before database lock/unblinding. There may be instances where interim data has the potential to reveal treatment. In these cases, every effort will be made by the unblinded pharmacokinetic scientist to maintain blinding by appropriate presentation of data to the study team.",
