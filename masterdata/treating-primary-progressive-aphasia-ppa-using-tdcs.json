            "briefSummary": "This is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in which subjects with the non-fluent/agrammatic and semantic variants of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA and svPPA, respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and functional brain imaging before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of real or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with modified constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be repeated immediately after completion of and up-to 24 weeks following completion of treatment. The investigators will examine changes in language performance induced by tDCS + mCILT compared to sham tDCS + mCILT. The investigators will also use network science to analyze brain imaging (fMRI) data to identify network properties associated with baseline PPA severity and tDCS-induced changes in performance. This study will combine knowledge gained from our behavioral, imaging, and network data in order to determine the relative degrees to which these properties predict whether persons with PPA will respond to intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "The central framework for the project is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in which subjects with the non-fluent/agrammatic and semantic variants of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA and svPPA, respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and functional brain imaging before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of real or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with modified constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be repeated immediately after completion of and up-to 24 weeks following completion of treatment.\n\nSubjects with naPPA and svPPA will be randomized to one of two study arms: tDCS+mCILT or sham stimulation+mCILT paired with pre- and post-stimulation imaging and behavioral measures. Equal numbers of subjects with naPPA and svPPA will be randomized to the tDCS + mCILT and sham + mCILT study arms. The study is double-blinded, in that neither the subject nor the study personnel administering tDCS or sham stimulation will know which arm of the study the subject has been randomized into. Study coordinators will administer tDCS by entering a pre-determined code that has been programmed into the device by another member of the study team. Data will be digitally audio-recorded and analyzed off-line, such that study team members performing data coding and analysis will likewise be blinded to the treatment condition of each subject.\n\nSubject participation in this protocol will occur during 36 planned visits that will span approximately 12 months. The events of the study visits are described below:\n\nVISIT 1:\n\nInformed consent and screening\n\nVISIT 2:\n\nBaseline MRI\n\nVISIT 3 \\& 4:\n\nBaseline language assessment\n\nVISITS 5-14:\n\ntDCS+mCILT OR sham stimulation+mCILT, depending on the study arm to which they had been randomized.\n\nVISIT 15 \\& 16:\n\nFollow-up language assessment Follow-up MRI\n\nVISIT 17:\n\n6-Week follow-up language assessment\n\nVISIT 18 \\& 19:\n\n12-week follow-up language assessment 12-week follow-up MRI\n\n\\*\\*CROSSOVER\\*\\*\n\nVISIT 20:\n\nCrossover baseline language assessment\n\nVISITS 21-30:\n\ntDCS+mCILT or sham stimulation+mCILT\n\nVISIT 31 \\& 32:\n\nFollow-up language assessment Follow-up MRI\n\nVISIT 33:\n\n6 Week follow-up language assessment\n\nVISIT 34 \\& 35:\n\n12-week follow-up language assessment 12-week follow-up MRI\n\nVISIT 36:\n\n24 week follow-up language assessment"

Other key elements of CILT include massed practice of goal-directed speech and shaping of desired responses by increasing response demands as participants improve. MCILT differs from traditional constraint-induced language therapy (CILT) in three ways: 1) it will be done as an individual therapy with the examiner in the role of a communication partner; 2) treatment will be delivered in short sessions (1 hour rather than a more typical 3-4 hour session); 3) targeting nouns + semantically related verbs to generate noun + verb phrases in treatment, a modification that may be better suited to addressing syntactic structure.",
