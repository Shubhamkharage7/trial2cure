            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm open label phase I trial of the menin inhibitor, revumenib, in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin (7+3) chemotherapy and the multikinase inhibitor midostaurin for the frontline treatment of Nucleophosmin (NPM1) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).\n\nInvestigators are trying to determine the highest dose of revumenib that can be given safely in combination with these chemotherapy drugs. Treatment consists of 1-2 cycles of so-called \"induction treatment\" (initial chemotherapy to induce a remission of the leukemia). This \"induction treatment\" consists of revumenib + 7+3 (7 days of cytarabine + 3 days of daunorubicin) chemotherapy + midostaurin.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of revumenib, cytarabine, daunorubicin, and midostaurin as a treatment for AML.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, blood and urine tests, bone marrow biopsies, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment as long as there are no serious side effects and the disease does not progress.\n\nThe trial will include up to 12 participants in dose finding phase and 10 additional participants in the dose expansion phase for a total participant number of 22 participants.\n\nSyndax Pharmaceuticals is supporting this research study by supply revumenib (SNDX-5613)."

Inversion 16 and t(8;21): CBF chromosomal abnormalities may be assessed by molecular (PCR), metaphase cytogenetics, or FISH.\n* Subject has known active CNS involvement with AML.\n* Subject has received a strong CYP3A4 inducer (APPENDIX C) within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment\n* Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (APPENDIX C) are contraindicated except strong CYP3A4 inhibitor antifungal azole medications (systemic itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole). For strong CYP3A4 inhibitor antifungal azole medications, the starting dose of revumenib has to be adjusted (Table 1).\n* QTc using Fridericia's correction \\[QTcF\\]) \\> 450 msec. Drugs that prolong QTc should be avoided if possible. A list of common QTc prolonging drugs and alternatives that are not QTc prolonging can be found in APPENDIX D.\n* Subject has tested positive for HIV (due to potential drug-drug interaction between antiretroviral medications and Midostaurin/revumenib). Note: HIV testing is not required.\n* Subject is known to be positive for hepatitis B or C infection with the exception of those with an undetectable viral load within 3 months. (Hepatitis B or C testing is not required).
