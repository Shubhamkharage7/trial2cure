To determine the use of the CPWalker rehabilitation platform, a robotic device composed by an exoskeleton linked to a walker that provides support and balance, as a gait training intervention in the pediatric cerebral palsy population.\n2. To create and define detailed guidelines consisting of robotic based treatment methods for gait rehabilitation.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n1. CPWalker can be used as a gait training intervention for pediatric patients with gait impairments due to cerebral palsy\n2. Performing lower limb training in conjunction with active head and trunk control therapies will improve functional gait levels\n3. Following 16-24 CPWalker training sessions, persons with cerebral palsy will show improvements in functional mobility when comparing pre-training measurements to post-training measurements\n\nProcedures:\n\nParticipants will engage in an 8-week training program, consisting of 2-3 sessions per week based on the level of gait impairment. Percentage range of motion (ROM), partial body weight support (PWBS), and gait velocity are the principal parameters under variation during training.\n\nAdditionally, screening, baseline and post-training testing sessions will be conducted"
