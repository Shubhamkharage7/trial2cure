            "detailedDescription": "The potential candidates for the study are patients scheduled for primary TKA. Scheduled patients will be sent an invitation letter detailing the study's objectives and design. Should they choose to take part, individuals will be requested to utilize MyChart for the completion of PROMs. The information gathered from these PROMs will play a pivotal role in assessing their suitability for inclusion in the study. Subsequently, once deemed eligible, our coordinator will arrange a convenient session to meticulously review and facilitate the signing of the informed consent form (enrollment visit). This enrollment visit will take place approximately 2-3 months prior to the scheduled surgery. Subsequently, enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to:\n\ni) Standard of Care ii) Standard of Care + TKA Personalized Outcome Prediction Tool (Mental Health Screening/Intervention \\& Physical Therapy Pre-surgery Assessments/Intervention)\n\nTKA Personalized Outcome Prediction Tool aids in setting expectations for surgery and the results (calculated from patient information and baseline PROMs) will be provided and discussed with the patients by the surgeon.\n\nThe primary outcome of the study will be the proportion of patients who fail treatment, defined as patients who answer \"no\" to the PASS anchor question at 1-year postoperative. The treatment and control groups will be compared using a chi-square test between the randomized groups with p=0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance. We will follow the intent-to-treat principle, and patients assigned to the treatment/intervention arm will be analyzed as such regardless of his/her compliance with the intervention."
