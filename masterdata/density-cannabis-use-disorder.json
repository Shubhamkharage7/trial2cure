Furthermore, any change in synaptic vesicle density will be placed in functional context by measuring verbal memory, which is sensitive to hippocampal function, before and after at least 4 weeks of confirmed abstinence. Finally, the relationship between hippocampal \\[11C\\]UCB-J binding in CUDs with measures of cannabis exposure (e.g., age of initiation, cumulative lifetime dose) will be explored."

Medications that could alter synaptic density and, therefore, confound the interpretation of study data.\n6. MRI incompatible implants and other contraindications for MRI, such as pace-maker, artificial joints, non-removable body piercings, metal fragments in head and/or body, or history working with ferrous metals either as a vocation or hobby in such a way that might have led to unknown, indwelling metal fragments that could cause injury during MRI etc.\n7.
