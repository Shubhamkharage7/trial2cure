            "briefSummary": "Ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which use phones to deliver messages to reduce alcohol use and related risk behaviors during or prior to drinking events, can help to address triggers in real-time. GPS tracking can determine when individuals visit places they have previously reported drinking or triggers to drink and then EMI messages can be delivered upon arrival to prevent risky alcohol use. A mobile app has been developed that uses GPS tracking to determine when emerging adult sexual minority male and transgender (SMMTs) persons visit \"risky\" places and then delivers a survey asking what behaviors they engaged in while at the location.\n\nThe goal of the proposed study is to use this app to enhance the Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption (TRAC) intervention by delivering messages that encourage participants to employ strategies discussed during TRAC sessions when arriving at risky places. When they leave these places, they will complete a survey and breathalyzer reading in order to collect event-level self-report and biological data on alcohol use and HIV risk. If their breathalyzer result indicates alcohol use, they will receive harm reduction messaging. It is expected that combining TRAC with EMI (\"TRAC-ER\") will increase effectiveness by reinforcing topics discussed during these sessions, providing in-the-moment messaging to address triggers, and collecting real-time alcohol use data.",
            "detailedDescription": "For this study, the investigators will enhance an existing mHealth intervention (TRAC) to reduce alcohol use among SMMT individuals by combining the intervention with an app which delivers EMI messages in real-time. Upon enrollment, participants will be randomized into one of 3 arms: TRAC-ER (EMI messaging, TRAC intervention, and smartphone-based alcohol monitoring), TRAC (TRAC intervention and smartphone-based alcohol monitoring), or a comparison group (smartphone-based alcohol monitoring only).\n\nParticipants will be recruited from Kentucky and Connecticut through community-based recruitment and health clinics that serve SMMT individuals.\n\nPreliminary data used for this study were collected from a study (PI: Lauckner, K01AA02530) testing the TRAC intervention with people living with HIV/AIDS, which has shown promising preliminary results, with high feasibility, acceptability, and encouraging preliminary outcomes."
