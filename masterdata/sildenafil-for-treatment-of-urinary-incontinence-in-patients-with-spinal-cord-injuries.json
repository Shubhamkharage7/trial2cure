            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine whether administration of sildenafil will decrease urine leakage in patients with spinal cord injuries.",
            "detailedDescription": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition affecting 291,000 women and men in the US alone. Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common problem in these patients, affecting 52% of the population, with episodes of incontinence occurring daily in 20-27% of affected persons. UI after spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of distress and morbidity amongst patients with SCI, and is associated with decreased quality of life in general, physical, and emotional domains. UI has the undesirable side effects of perineal irritation and infection, increased odor, disrupted sleep, embarrassment, need to change clothes/bedding, and sexual dysfunction, as well as significant financial burden. Persons living with a SCI have ranked urinary problems as the most important health problem after injury. Addressing this significant problem and providing relief has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients with SCI.\n\nTypical treatment options are geared toward the type of UI in each patient. For stress UI, the goal of treatment is to provide support to the pelvic floor and urethra. Pessaries (devices placed inside the vagina in women) or surgery (e.g. suburethral sling) to elevate the urethra and/or bladder neck to increase the resistance to leak through the urethra are commonly used. Urethral bulking agents or pelvic muscle floor therapy are also employed to strengthen the closure pressure of the urethra in patients with stress UI. No pharmacologic agents are currently available to treat stress UI. For urge UI, medications or electrical stimulation aimed at relaxation of the detrusor muscle, including anticholinergics, are used. For overflow or obstructive UI, treatments are aimed at shrinking or removing the obstruction, such as medications to shrink the prostate, prostatectomy or mass removal. For neurogenic UI, surgery for diversion or implant placement may be utilized.\n\nSildenafil (Viagra) has been well studied and used extensively in males to treat erectile dysfunction. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including sildenafil, are potent vasodilators that enhance tissue perfusion, relax smooth muscle of the vasculature and bladder, and stimulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis. It has been reported to improve lower urinary tract symptoms, including urge UI and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. In our team's recent study using sildenafil for treatment of UI in women, the investigators found improvement in quality of life and a decrease in the number of incontinence episodes in women taking sildenafil. Higher sildenafil plasma levels were associated with greater improvement in symptoms. While the types of UI in women are somewhat different than in men, studies have shown improvements in UI in both sexes.\n\nThus, the investigators propose to conduct a two month randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial of sildenafil in male and female adult SCI patients with UI to assess the therapeutic potential of sildenafil to reduce the symptoms of urinary leakage.\n\nAims:\n\nAim 1: To determine whether sildenafil will decrease episodes of leakage of UI in adult women and men with SCI.\n\nAim 2: To determine the effects of sildenafil on the subjective measures of UI, including quality of life.\n\nExperimental Protocol:\n\nInvestigators will study patients with spinal cord injuries (aged 18-70) with current urine leakage of more than 3 times/week (n=24). Subjects will undergo a double blinded randomized cross over treatment of sildenafil (20mg TID) and placebo. Each treatment period will last 4 weeks with a 2 week washout between treatment periods.\n\nBefore and after each treatment period, subjects will undergo testing which will consist of measurements of urine post void residual volume (PVR), adverse event assessment, and questionnaires of quality of life and urinary health."
