The study will enroll 24 participants at UAB who are seen at the Emergency Department Post-Discharge Clinic. Half of the participants (12 patients) will be asked to measure their blood pressure at home, and half of the participants (12 patients) will continue to receive usual care. Participants who measure their blood pressure at home will also meet with a pharmacist weekly over the phone to discuss blood pressure readings and have blood pressure medications prescribed if needed. This program will last 3 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "For all participants:\n\n1. Participants will receive information on the importance of measuring blood pressure and ways to improve blood pressure.\n2. Participants will complete questionnaires describing current socioeconomic position, medical history and healthcare needs.\n3. Participants will come in for one research clinic visit to get blood pressure measured 3 months after enrollment in this study.\n\nFor participants asked to measure blood pressure at home:\n\n1. Measure blood pressure twice a day at home, following the instructions provided. The study will provide participants with the device and send text message reminders each week day. Participants will return the device at study visit 3 months from now.\n2. Following the instructions provided, participants will talk to a pharmacist over the phone weekly to discuss blood pressure and medications. All medication changes will be discussed with a collaborating physician.\n3. Participants will complete questionnaires on satisfaction with the program."
