The study is divided into two parts: Phase 1 (Part A) focuses on determining the pharmaceutically active dosage range and evaluating the safety profile of PTT-936 when administered as a monotherapy. Phase 2a (Part B) will assess the safety and efficacy of PTT-936 combined with anti-PD-1/L1 therapy in patients suitable for anti- PD-1/L1 monotherapy. The study aims to understand how PTT-936, alone or in combination, impacts tumor progression and patients\\&#39; overall response."

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS): 0-1 for Part A and Part B.\n8. Adequate end-organ and hematopoietic function, defined based on the following laboratory results obtained within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment \\[Day 1\\]):\n\n   1.

History of primary malignancy other than the diseases under study, not in remission greater than three (3) years prior to Day 1. Exceptions that do not require a 3-year remission include: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or squamous intraepithelial lesion on Papanicolaou (PAP) smear, in situ prostate cancer (with no evidence of active disease for two \\[2\\] years prior to Day 1), or resected melanoma in situ and radically resected papillary thyroid carcinoma.\n3.

History of myocardial infarction, unstable or severe angina, or arterial thrombotic event (such as cerebrovascular attack \\[CVA\\] or transient ischemic attack \\[TIA\\]) within 12 months prior to Day 1.\n   2. Significant abnormalities on the screening of ECG, including corrected QT interval (QTc interval) \\&gt; 470 msec (average of triplicate measurements, corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula), second degree (Mobitz type II) or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or other clinically significant (in the Investigator's opinion) arrhythmia.\n   3. Current New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage II-IV congestive heart failure (CHF).\n   4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\&lt; 50%.\n\n      \u2022 Note that LVEF assessment by echocardiogram (ECHO) scan performed as part of the patient's regular care within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit may be used for confirmation of eligibility.\n   5. Other clinically significant (in the Investigator's opinion) cardiac diseases (e.g., valvular disease, cardiomegaly, ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, etc.).\n   6. Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as a systolic blood pressure \\[SBP\\] \u2265 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2265 100 mmHg at screening), despite appropriate antihypertensive therapy, or poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen.\n8.
