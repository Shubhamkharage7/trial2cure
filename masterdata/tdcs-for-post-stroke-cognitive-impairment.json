The findings will help determine how stimulation affects the brain's activity, cerebral blood flow, and circulating blood biomarkers of neuroinflammation after stroke. The study will use different forms of non-invasive brain imaging to see whether stimulation changes how the brain responds during a memory task. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalograph (EEG) will be used, we will also collect blood samples for the biomarkers of inflammation. The study also uses cognitive tests and questionnaires."
