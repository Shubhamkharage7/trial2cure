Approximately 65 subjects per group will be enrolled to assure that approximately 50 subjects in each group complete the study. the study will be conducted in Ireland. The study will last approximately six month for each subject and will consist of 5 visits. The L. reuteri 3613 will be taken daily for 6 months and the frequency of UTIs will be assessed to determine the potential for the probiotic to decrease or prevent UTI occurrence."
