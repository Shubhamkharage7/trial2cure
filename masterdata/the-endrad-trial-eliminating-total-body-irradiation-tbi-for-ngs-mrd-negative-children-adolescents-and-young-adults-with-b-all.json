Patients diagnosed with B-ALL who are candidates for HCT will be screened by NGS-MRD on a test of bone marrow done before the HCT. Subjects who are pre-HCT NGS-MRD negative will be eligible to receive a non-TBI conditioning regimen as part of the treatment cohort of the study. Subjects who are pre-HCT NGS-MRD positive will be treated as per treating center standard and will be followed in an observational cohort (HCT center standard of care).",

The accrual period is 3 years.\n\nPatients that are NGS-MRD negative with B-ALL may be eligible for the Treatment Arm, which is myeloablative non-TBI conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa followed -matched related, unrelated, and umbilical cord blood transplants. Patients that are NGS-MRD positive will be followed on the observational arm for outcome.\n\nStudy sampling will include NGS-MRD bone marrow (BM) aspirate and peripheral blood (PB) samples collected \\[same day when possible\\] pre-HCT (within 4 weeks), and post-HCT on days 42 \u00b1 14, 100 \u00b1 20, and 365 \u00b1 60; PB samples only will also be collected day 180\u00b1 60 and 270\u00b1 60; day +30, day +100, and 1-year post-HCT. NGS-MRD peripheral blood sample only at 6 months and 9 months post-HCT; (Blast specimen at time of diagnosis or relapse is required for NGS-MRD testing)."

Inotuzumab treatment may increase the risk of VOD/SOS for any allogeneic HCT recipient, but could potentiate the risk for with busulfan-based myeloablation (study-directed non-TBI conditioning). All inotuzumab-treated patients are eligible for the observational arm (HCT center standard of care).\n* Patients receiving non-myeloablative conditioning are not allowed on the observational arm (reduced toxicity conditioning with Flu/Mel/Thio is allowed on the observational arm).\n* Pregnant or lactating females are ineligible as many of the medications used in this protocol could be harmful to unborn children and infants.\n* Patients with HIV or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections are excluded. Patients with history of fungal disease during induction therapy may proceed if they have a significant response to antifungal therapy with no evidence or minimal evidence of non-progressive disease remaining by CT evaluation.\n* Patients with active CNS leukemia or any other active site of extramedullary disease at the time of enrollment are not permitted.\n* T-ALL and MPAL patients are only allowed on the observational arm.\n* Patients with genetic disorders (generally marrow failure syndromes) prone to secondary AML/ALL with known poor outcome are not eligible (Fanconi Anemia, Kostmann Syndrome, Dyskeratosis Congenita, etc).",
