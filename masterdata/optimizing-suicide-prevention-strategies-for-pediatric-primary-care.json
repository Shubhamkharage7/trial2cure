            "briefSummary": "Increasing rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adolescents must be addressed. The study will adapt and collect preliminary effectiveness data on a digital suicide prevention intervention that can be delivered in pediatric primary care settings by front line pediatricians. The study has the potential to offer a low-cost and scalable primary care intervention that may decrease risk of suicide among at-risk youth.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study proposed is a treatment development study to enhance the capacity of pediatric primary care (PPC) to identify and manage suicidal youth by adapting iCHART for PPC settings that lack onsite behavioral health (BH) providers.\n\nStepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Pilot Trial: Conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized pilot trial of iCHART-cASAP vs. usual care across 4 PROS practices (across urban, suburban, and rural settings). Up to 20 providers (up to 5 providers per practice) will be enrolled. Following a 3-month baseline period when all practices provide usual care, practices will be randomized to onset to offering the intervention at one of the four, 3-month intervention onset intervals. Each practice will enroll a total of 15 youth across the 15-month pilot trial period for a total of 60 youth. 30 youth will receive usual care and 30 youth will receive iCHART-cASAP.\n\nDelivery of Intervention Intervention will be delivered to adolescent patients and their caregivers receiving services at pediatric primary care practices within the PROS network.When PPC providers are assigned to the usual condition, patients will receive usual practices following identification of suicide risk on the PHQ-9-M. When PPC providers have crossed over to the iCHART- cASAP intervention condition, patients who are identified as suicidal will receive links from PPC providers/office staff to complete cASAP + onboard BRITE app to receive the safety planning and skills training intervention for adolescent and parent/caregiver. Once that is completed, PPC providers receive a summary report and review the safety plan with the patient and parent/caregiver, making revisions as needed. The provider then reviews treatment plan, including behavioral health referrals and schedules follow-up appointment. Next, the PPC provider/office staff enters referral recommendations and follow-up appointment reminders into iCHART's Text2Connect feature, which will increase engagement with the safety plan and facilitate adherence with treatment recommendations.\n\nProviders will approach patients and parents/caregivers about the research study during their office visit, and interested families will complete a permission to contact form for research staff. Research staff will contact and describe the study, answer any questions, and obtain parental consent/youth assent.\n\nSample Size and Power Considerations Once usability testing is complete, 60 participants will be recruited from 4 practices randomized to begin utilizing iCHART during one of the 3-month intervention intervals. At the end of the trial, 30 participants will be enrolled when practices were delivering usual care and 30 participants will be enrolled when practices were delivering iCHART- cASAP.\n\nSample size and power considerations center on the precision of confidence interval (CI) width estimation for feasibility outcomes. Based on best practices for feasibility studies, and given the sample size of 60 and 5% type I error rate, there is ability to estimate 95% confidence interval with margin-of-errors \u22640.33 for the primary outcomes of depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors."

All sites will be initially monitored for at least 3 months during TAU. This will be followed by a staggered adoption of iCHART-cASAP. At each time period, a new site will begin implementing the intervention. Block randomization determines the order each site begins the intervention phase. Each time period (approximately 3 months), a web-based system will be used to assign the next clinic to begin using iCHART-cASAP. Research staff will be available to assist with consenting participants and assisting with study procedures.",
