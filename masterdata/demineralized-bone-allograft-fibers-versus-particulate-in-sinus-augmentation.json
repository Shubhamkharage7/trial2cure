Specifically, we will assess histologically the percent vital bone formation with each of the groups during implant placement, six months after the sinus augmentation procedure. We will also evaluate the radiographic volume achieved with both groups of materials.",
            "detailedDescription": "This entire protocol involves procedures that are standard care and will randomize subjects to of one two routine care procedures. Patients needing maxillary sinus augmentation will be enrolled. There will be two subject groups in this study both of which will randomized to one of two standard care procedures. No risk or benefit is expected from being assigned to either group as both procedures are both standard care. In both groups a bone sample (core) will be obtained as a by-product of implant placement. Bone will not be extracted solely for research purposes, the bone sample attained for research will only be from bone left over after the SOC implant placement.\n\nAllocation of subjects into test group or control group will be based on numbers drawn from a stack of sealed envelopes."
