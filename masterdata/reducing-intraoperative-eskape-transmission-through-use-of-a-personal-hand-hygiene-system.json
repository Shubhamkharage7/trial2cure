            "detailedDescription": "This will be a prospective, single center, unmasked, controlled before and after study.\n\nIntervention Arm: Use of SafeHaven hand hygiene system in the operating room\n\nControl Arm: Standard of care hand hygiene\n\nOperating Room Selection: Two patients (case-pair) having surgery in a serial manner in a randomly selected operating room will be evaluated for detection of pathogenic bacteria. The operating room for investigation will be randomly selected through the following process:\n\n1. All the operating rooms with scheduled surgeries in the South Operating Rooms on a particular day will be entered into a random number generator (example: operating rooms 2, 3, 5, 7).\n2. The random generator will sort these operating rooms into a rank list (example: operating rooms 5, 3, 2, 7).\n3. The investigators will start at the top of this list and work down until the first operating room meeting all inclusion criteria is found (example: operating room 5 only has one surgery, operating room 3 has pediatric surgery, operating room 2 meets inclusion criteria)\n4. This process will be duplicated for each case-pair\n\nThe goal of the study is to map transmission of bacteria through the operating room and compare mapping with the SafeHaven Hand Hygiene system to mapping without the SafeHaven Hand Hygiene system. Thus, case-pairs will be randomized to the same assignment. For example, subject 1 and 2 will have surgery in South Operating Room 8 and both will be randomized to the control group. The first 10 case-pairs will be assigned to the control arm and the second 10 case-pairs will be assigned to the intervention arm."
