            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) can be used to address clinical anxiety in marginalized and low-income pregnant people in California. The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nWhat is the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBTI) for reducing clinical anxiety among marginalized and low-income pregnant people?\n\nParticipants will receive digital cognitive behavioral therapy immediately, or 10 weeks after enrollment (i.e., waitlist control). Participants will complete surveys and interviews until 6-8 weeks postpartum.",
            "detailedDescription": "Although therapist-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective for treating clinical anxiety in non-marginalized pregnant populations, barriers to access exist among pregnant people (e.g., long waitlists, childcare issues, limited appointment windows). Recent innovations have focused on addressing barriers to CBT by adapting it for automated, digital delivery. Digital CBT (dCBT) has been shown to be effective for treating clinical anxiety in mostly White, higher socioeconomic status, pregnant, and non-pregnant populations. Person-centered adaptations of dCBT are likely needed to maximize access in marginalized and low-income pregnant people. This study addresses the critical need to evaluate whether dCBT can be used to address clinical anxiety in marginalized and low-income pregnant people in California."

Daylight is designed to be self-paced, with the app encouraging users to practice techniques both within the app and in real-life situations on a daily basis.
