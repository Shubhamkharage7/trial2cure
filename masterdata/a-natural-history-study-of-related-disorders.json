            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nCongenital myopathies (CM) are genetic disorders that can cause decreased muscle tone and muscle weakness. Most CMs in the United States are related to the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene. Researchers need more natural history data to learn about these CMs in children and adults.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about the signs, symptoms, and course of RYR1-related disorders.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 7 years and older with an RYR1-related disorder.\n\nDesign:\n\nAmbulatory participants will come to the Clinical Center and non-ambulatory participants will visit via telehealth.\n\nVisits will be once a year for 3 or 5 years. Clinical Center visits will take 2 to 3 days.\n\nAll participants will undergo tests including:\n\nPhotos and videos. These will be taken to document the participant s condition.\n\nBlood and urine tests.\n\nActivity Tracker. Participants will wear a device to record their activity.\n\nQuestionnaires. Participants will answer questions about their health, pain, fatigue, stress, quality of life, and other topics.\n\nParticipants who visit the Clinical Center will also undergo:\n\nTests of heart and lung function.\n\nMotor skills and strength tests. Participants will walk, climb stairs, kneel, crawl, stand up, and perform other movements to test their strength and abilities. They will squeeze and pinch a handheld device to test their grip.\n\nImaging scans.\n\nSkin biopsy. Adult participants may opt to have a sample of skin taken (one time only).\n\nEye exam",
            "detailedDescription": "STUDY DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis prospective natural history study seeks to characterize the clinical manifestations and course of Ryanodine Receptor 1 -related disorders (RYR1-RD). RYR1-RD include a wide range of rare congenital and adult-onset neuromuscular phenotypes that are typically slowly progressive. The study is observational and comprises a primary data collection phase (Years 1-3) and extended follow-up phase (Years 4-5). During each phase, there will be one visit per year. The study will enhance the foundational knowledge of RYR1-RD and support clinical trial readiness.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nCharacterize phenotype and disease course over a three-year period\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nCharacterize phenotype and disease course over an extended (2-year) period (total 5 years)\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\n1.
