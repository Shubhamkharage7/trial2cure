            "briefSummary": "The Aims of this study are 1) to develop a traditional plant-based diet that is palatable and acceptable to the Latino population and which contains the appropriate calorie and macronutrient composition needed to lose weight and improve metabolic function and; 2) to develop a culturally sensitive (based on previous literature and stakeholder input) lifestyle intervention program, that will be delivered by community health workers (CHWs), that focuses on consuming a traditional plant-based diet and overcoming the barriers to incorporating this dietary therapy as part of the family lifestyle but with a focus on the adult participant with obesity. Ultimately, in Aim 3 the investigators will conduct a 16-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 40 Latino adults with obesity (20 control, 20 treatment) to evaluate the intervention's: i) clinical efficacy; ii) fidelity of the implementation by CHWs; and iii) acceptance by CHWs and study participants. The current status of the RCT is not yet ready to begin. The current activities are only preparatory to research, and/or activities that do not involve human subjects research (Aims 1 and 2). The investigators will submit a separate project before conducting the human subjects research that is described in this In-Concept project."
