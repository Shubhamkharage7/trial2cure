Based on ISHLT criteria, the following have been proposed for diagnosis of CAV by PET:",

This will help determine whether MCG is a potential test for regular surveillance of CAV in transplant recipients."

These magnetic fields have been used for decades via electrocardiogram to help diagnose and treat both acute and chronic cardiac pathology. The CardioFlux device reaches the potential of this phenomenon by sensing a complete magnetic field map. It is equipped with a magnetic shielding chamber and can attenuate magnetic field noise by a factor of nearly 1500 which maximizes signal to noise ratio. CardioFlux is an easy to operate, noninvasive modality that can detect the presence of ischemic cardiac tissue in symptomatic patients in a less than 5-minute scan. The device uses the proprietary software called Faraday which processes MCG scans, create diagnostic functional images, and run analytics.",

CAV often progresses without symptoms, and transplant recipients undergo regular surveillance to detect CAV. Current tests used to detect CAV, such as invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and intravascular ultrasound (US) have clear limitations; in addition to being invasive with risk of complications, they are also expensive, time consuming, and require iodinated contrast, a concern in a population with high rates of kidney dysfunction. In addition, these tests may not be able to detect CAV in its early stages. Additionally, the diagnosis of CAV remains a challenge as angiography, the standard method for detecting focal plaques, lacks sensitivity in detecting CAV, and intravascular ultrasonography, a more sensitive method, lacks the ability to evaluate the entirety of the coronary arteries.",
