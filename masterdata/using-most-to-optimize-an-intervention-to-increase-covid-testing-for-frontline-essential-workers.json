            "briefSummary": "COVID-19 testing is essential to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic to break transmission chains and reduce community transmission. However, Black and Latino/Hispanic populations in lower status frontline essential occupations such as food preparation, retail, building maintenance, personal services, and in-home health care have serious barriers to COVID-19 testing and, therefore, insufficient testing rates. The proposed study will use the multiphase optimization strategy framework to address the problem of low COVID-19 testing rates for this population: We will test the effects of four distinct candidate intervention components and then create an efficient multicomponent made up of the most effective combination of the components that can be rapidly scaled up in community settings to boost COVID-19 testing rates.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study responds to RFA-OD-21-008 which calls for community-engaged interventions to support COVID-19 testing in underserved and vulnerable populations. Among those at highest risk for exposure to COVID-19 is the large population of frontline essential workers (FEW) in lower status occupations (e.g., retail, in-home health care), among whom Black and Latino/Hispanic (BLH) persons are over-represented. The CDC recommends testing for all those experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. For those not vaccinated, testing is recommended after exposure to individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis, and regular COVID-19 screening testing is recommended even when asymptomatic for those with frequent close contact with others in indoor settings such as FEW. However, BLH-FEW experience serious impediments to COVID-19 testing at individual/attitudinal- (e.g., lack of knowledge of guidelines, distrust), social- (e.g., social norms), and structural-levels of influence (e.g., poor access to testing). Indeed, testing rates are lower among BLH than White populations and only 25-50% of BLH-FEW are currently vaccinated. The proposed community-engaged study is led by a collaborative team at New York University and the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation (NMIC). Its main goal is to optimize a behavioral intervention to boost COVID-19 testing rates for BLH-FEW. Consistent with RFA-OD-21-008, the proposed study uses the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to test four candidate intervention components grounded in our past research. The candidate components are informed by critical race theory and guided by the theory of triadic influence, are brief or do not require substantial staff time, and will be tested in a highly efficient factorial experimental design. They are A) motivational interview counseling, B) a text message component grounded in behavioral economics, C) peer education, and D) access to testing (via navigation to a test appointment vs. a self-test kit). All participants receive the standard of care, namely, health education on COVID-19 testing, and referrals. The specific aims of the study are to: identify which of four candidate components contribute meaningfully to improvement in the primary outcome, COVID-19 testing with medical confirmation; the most effective combination of components will comprise the \"optimized\" intervention (Aim 1), identify mediators (e.g., distrust, access) and moderators (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics) of the effects of each component (Aim 2), and use a mixed-methods approach to explore relationships among barriers to, facilitators of, and uptake of COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 vaccination (Aim 3). Participants will be N=448 BLH-FEW who have not been tested for COVID-19 in the past three months and have not been vaccinated for COVID-19 in the past 12 months, randomly assigned to an intervention condition, and assessed at 6- and 12-weeks post-baseline; N=50 participants will engage in qualitative in-depth interviews. We will also uncover, describe, and plan for implementation issues so the optimized intervention can be rapidly scaled up by NMIC and other community-based organizations."

Participants first receive a brief orientation to the component (15 min.), and the participant will put the study phone number into his/her phone and a test TM and QQ will be sent. TMs and QQs are programmed into the Telerivet program and sent automatically. Twice a week participants will receive a TM with information about COVID and COVID-19 testing followed by a true/false question about that TM two days later, for which they earn 10 points for a correct answer, and 5 points for an incorrect answer. Participants earn modest prizes based on their points.",

Then, participants are given the opportunity to educate three peers who are Black and Latino/Hispanic frontline essential workers on the core messages. These peers contact the study directly and receive a brief assessment and referrals to testing, but are not enrolled in the study.",
