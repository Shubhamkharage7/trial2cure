The MUSE 2 is an adjustable headband that is placed across the forehead and over and behind the ears. It contains EEG sensors for active sites across the forehead and behind the ears, and an additional reference site behind the ear. These sensors use EEG technology to passively record children's brainwaves. During a session, caregivers will help children place the MUSE 2 on their heads and connect it to the app on their personal device. Children's brain activity is recorded by the MUSE 2 and is represented on the app through audio-based feedback that children will listen to with earbuds, and use their volition to influence in real time, with the goal of gaining increased control over their own brain activity.",
