Four tax proposals will be modeled: Tobacco Parity, Nicotine-Content, Harm-Reduction, and MRTP. Tobacco products are placed into three tax tiers: high-, medium-, and no-tax, according to the goals of each proposal. In a within-between subject design (tax proposals between subjects; control condition within subject), cigarette smokers will complete two conditions in the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace, representing one control condition and one of the four tax proposals. Within each condition, taxes will be increased proportionally across 6 trials (relative to tax tier) to examine how cigarette purchasing, substitution, and poly-tobacco purchasing (i.e., diversity in products purchased) are affected."

As such, we expect participants to defend their purchase of cigarettes in the high-tax tier under a variety of conditions.

This yields slope measures of each tax tier's product purchasing, wherein more positive slopes indicate greater substitution (i.e., greater increases in purchasing of substitutes as tax magnitudes increase). Ordinary least squares regression is used here to model purchasing in the medium- and no-tax tier because it is capable of measuring positive slopes, indicative of substitution, and distinguishing these tiers from those that do not show substitution.

In this proposed use, entropy is minimized for a participant who only purchases one type of product (no inherent information) in a given trial. Entropy is maximized for participants that purchase equivalent quantities of all products in a given trial.
