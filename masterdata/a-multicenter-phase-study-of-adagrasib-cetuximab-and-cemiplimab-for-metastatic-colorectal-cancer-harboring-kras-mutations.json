Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test during screening\n* Breast-feeding or planning to breast feed during the study or within 6 months after end of treatment.\n* Participants with symptomatic leptomeningeal disease.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of any study drug.\n* History of intestinal disease or major gastric surgery likely to alter absorption of study treatment, to be determined by the treating physician\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acute or chronic hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) infection as tested in a CLIA certified lab using a positive HIV antibody test. For Hepatitis B and C, an antigen that is drawn and positive. Note that the following are permitted:\n* Participants treated for HIV with no detectable viral load on current regimen for at least 1 month prior to randomization;\n* Note: Please refer to exclusion criteria regarding drug-drug interactions of concomitant anti-HIV agents, and in particular CYP3A substrates.\n* Participants with prior HBV infections who are:\n* considered to have past or resolved HBV infection, defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \\[HBcAb\\] and absence of hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\]; or\n* considered to be in an inactive HBV carrier state, defined as HBsAg-positive with normal ALT, and HBV DNA \\< 2,000 IU/mL or \\< 10,000 copies/mL;\n* Note: For participants in an inactive HBV carrier state or with a resolved HBV infection, the risk of HBV reactivation should be considered and the need for anti-HBV prophylaxis prior to randomization should be carefully assessed in accordance with local guidelines.\n* Participants treated for HCV with no detectable viral load.\n* Any serious illness, uncontrolled inter-current illness, psychiatric illness, active or uncontrolled infection, or other medical history, including laboratory results, which, in the investigator's opinion, would be likely to interfere with the participant's participation in the study, or with the interpretation of results.",
