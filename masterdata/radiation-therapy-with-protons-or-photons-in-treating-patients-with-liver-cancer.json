            "briefSummary": "This phase III trial studies how well radiation therapy with protons works compared with photons in treating patients with liver cancer. Radiation therapy, such as photon therapy, uses high energy x-rays to send the radiation inside the body to the tumor while proton therapy uses a beam of proton particles. Proton therapy can stop shortly after penetrating through the tumor and may cause less damage to the surrounding healthy organs and result in better survival in patients with liver cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if Overall Survival (OS) is different for hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with protons compared to photons.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the difference in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with protons compared to patients with HCC treated with photons.\n\nII. To determine the difference in local progression (LP) in patients with HCC treated with protons compared to patients with HCC treated with photons.\n\nIII. To determine differences in toxicity in patients with HCC treated with protons versus photons.\n\nIV. To determine differences in fatigue, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue in patients with HCC treated with protons, versus photons; as well as quality-adjusted survival, if the primary endpoint is met.\n\nV. To determine if there are correlations between the baseline values of HGF and outcomes (OS/PFS/fatigue).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine differences in overall Quality of Life, measured by FACT-Hep in patients with HCC treated with protons.\n\nII. Biospecimen collection for future correlative science projects.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo proton therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo photon therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years."

For patients with three lesions, no lesion may be greater than 6 cm in greatest dimension. Portal vein involvement or thrombosis combined with a single legion that is \u2265 1 cm and \u2264 15 cm in greatest dimension is allowed.\n* Zubrod performance status 0-1 within 30 days prior to registration\n* Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential within 7 days prior to study entry\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,000 cells/mm\\^3\n* Platelets \\>= 50,000 cells/mm\\^3\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9.0 g/dl; (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve hemoglobin \\[Hgb\\] \\>= 9.0 g/dl is acceptable)\n* Total bilirubin \\< 4 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] and alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\]) \\< 6 x institutional ULN\n* Albumin \\>= 2.5mg/dl\n* Creatinine \\< 2 mg/dl\n* Prior chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy (e.g. sorafenib), surgery, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), ablation for present disease is acceptable\n* Must have Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) A or B7\n* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study registration\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* PRIOR TO STEP ONE RANDOMIZATION:\n* Definitive clinical or radiologic documentation of extrahepatic tumor, defined as extrahepatic metastases or malignant nodes (that enhance with typical features of HCC) \\> 3.0 cm, in sum of maximal diameters (e.g. presence of one 3.4 cm metastatic lymph node or two 2 cm lung lesions).
