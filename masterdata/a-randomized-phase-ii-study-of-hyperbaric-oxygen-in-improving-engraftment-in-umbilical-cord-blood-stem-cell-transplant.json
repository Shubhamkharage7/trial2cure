            "briefSummary": "The UCB transplant is a type of stem cell transplant used to treat cancer of the blood or lymph glands. The UCB transplant has advantages over other types of transplants such as ease of obtaining the umbilical cord blood, absence of donor risks, reduced risks of contagious infections, and the availability for immediate use. The UCB transplant is also associated with a lower incidence of graft versus host disease, or GvHD (in GvHD, the transplanted graft attacks the recipient organs).",
            "detailedDescription": "However, UCB as a graft source for a bone marrow transplant has drawbacks related to the limited cell dose available for transplant and defects in homing. Homing is the process of UCB stem cell lodging in the bone marrow. If the homing is not efficient it could delay the re-population of the stem cells (or engraftment), possibly lead to engraftment failure, and delay the rebuilding of the immune system after transplant. This could, in turn, provide a higher risk to infection after the UCB transplant.\n\nThis research study is aimed at investigating the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy prior to the UCB transplant to find out if it will improve the stem cell homing, and subsequently, the engraftment. HBO therapy involves breathing 100% pure oxygen while in a sealed chamber that has been pressurized at 2 \u00bd times the normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nThere is a specific hormone which tells stem cells in the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. This hormone (called EPO) is increased when blood oxygen levels are low. When the EPO is increased, it might impair the bone marrow homing process of your transplant. Therefore, the researchers conducting this study hope to determine if providing 100% pure oxygen to you prior to your UCB transplant will decrease this hormone, and in turn, improve the homing process after your transplant."

Patients with chronic sinusitis or sinus headaches are excluded unless cleared by ear, nose, throat provider.\n* Evidence of pneumothorax or significant pulmonary fibrosis on chest imaging within 60 days of transplant.\n* Prior chest surgery requiring thoracotomy or direct chest irradiation.\n* Recent of sinus or ear surgery, excluding myringotomy or ear tubes (within the last 5 years).\n* Claustrophobia\n* Patients who had intrathecal chemotherapy within 2 weeks of starting preparative regimen or cranial irradiation within 4 weeks of starting preparative regimen.\n* History of seizures\n* No active tobacco use 72 hours prior to transplant until complete transplant recovery.",
