            "briefSummary": "The goals of this pilot randomized clinical trial are three-fold: 1) to test the feasibility of conducting a larger randomized trial using a brief Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) group intervention for women veterans with pelvic pain compared to usual care; 2) assess treatment acceptability by women veterans, and 3) identify appropriate pain-related treatment outcomes for the larger randomized trial.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to participate in either the ACT condition or treatment as usual condition, complete three surveys (before, after, and 3-months after first survey), and complete a phone interview (if assigned to the ACT condition).\n\nResearchers will compare the ACT condition and treatment as usual condition to see if there are meaningful differences in health outcomes. Due to the small sample size and pilot nature of this study, significance testing will not be performed.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a debilitating pain condition that disproportionately affects women veterans (30% vs. 16% of nonveteran women vs. 3% of men). Pain intensity and disability are further exacerbated by psychosocial factors (such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic distress) that may not be fully addressed through pharmacological and surgical interventions. Cognitive and behavioral therapies, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), are identified as first-line nondrug treatments for pain conditions. Given the multifactorial nature of CPP, ACT may be of particular benefit to these patients as it provides a unified (transdiagnostic) approach to the treatment of co-occurring disorders, such as chronic pain, depression, and anxiety. Specifically, ACT targets core psychological and behavioral factors (e.g., avoidance) that underlie many psychiatric and medical conditions. Several meta-analyses show ACT is effective, even when compared to active interventions such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy.\n\nIn this pilot study, researchers will examine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a larger randomized controlled trial to establish the efficacy of a brief ACT group treatment for women veterans experiencing pelvic pain. This pilot study builds on previous work adapting an empirically supported one-day ACT workshop to the specific needs of women veterans based on their feedback."
