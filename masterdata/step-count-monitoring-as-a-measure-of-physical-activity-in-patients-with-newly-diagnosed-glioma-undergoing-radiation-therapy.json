Evaluate the feasibility of monitoring step count as a measure of physical activity in patients with newly diagnosed glioma undergoing radiation therapy (RT) at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Estimate the effects of physical activity as measured by step count on cognition, fatigue, anxiety and depression scores and assess differences between groups.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients wear a pedometer for step count monitoring over 6 weeks.\n\nGROUP II: Patients wear a FitBit for step count monitoring over 6 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months after completing radiation therapy."
