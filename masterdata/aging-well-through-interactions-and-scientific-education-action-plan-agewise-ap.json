            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of AgeWISE-Action Plan (AgeWISE-AP), a 20-week program designed to provide education and individualized planning with a goal of improving brain health.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this proposal is to conduct a fully powered randomized controlled trial of a multi-component intervention designed to provide education about brain aging, improve feelings of control over brain aging, and deliver practical assistance with creation of an executable action plan (AgeWISE-Action Plan). The AgeWISE-Action Plan (AgeWISE-AP) is intended to extend our prior AgeWISE program by adding an individualized action plan component to increase older Veteran engagement in brain healthy lifestyle activities.\n\nAIM 1 (primary): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP increases older Veterans' engagement in lifestyle factors that promote brain health. AgeWISE provides information about the differences between normal and diseased brain aging and lifestyle factors that contribute to brain health. The action plan (AP) component will use this foundation to collaboratively create an individualized brain health plan to increase Veteran engagement in brain healthy lifestyle activities. H1. AgeWISE-AP participants will demonstrate increased engagement in brain-healthy lifestyle activities compared to the control group.\n\nAIM 2 (primary): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP improves psychological wellness. AgeWISE provides information about the relationship between cognitive aging and affective states (e.g., depression) and attitudes about aging, and teaches stress reduction techniques. The action plan (AP) will provide additional individualized supports to improve psychological well-being with personalized goals and lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, exercise, sleep, cognitive stimulation). H2. AgeWISE-AP participants will show increases in perception of control over cognitive aging, meaning and purpose in life, quality of life, and self-efficacy, as well as improved attitudes toward aging and decreased loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared to the control group.\n\nAIM 3 (primary): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP improves cognition. Cognitive strategies to improve cognition and functioning are presented and practiced over three AgeWISE sessions, with homework to improve generalization to day-to-day life. Engagement in brain-healthy lifestyle activities will be accomplished through the action plan (AP). H3. Self-reported memory contentment, ability, and compensatory strategy use will increase and objective cognitive testing will be better for AgeWISE-AP participants compared to the control group.\n\nAim 4 (exploratory): To determine whether AgeWISE-AP influences biomarkers of brain health using structural neuroimaging methods. H4. At one-year follow-up AgeWISE-AP participants will have less volumetric decline in dementia-related brain regions compared to the control group."
