            "briefSummary": "Older adults at risk for dementia show a variety of cognitive deficits, which can be ameliorated by different cognitive training (CT) exercises. The best combination of CT exercises is unknown. The aim is to discover the most efficacious combination of CT exercises as compared to cognitive stimulation (which will serve as a stringent, active control) to modify the functional trajectories of older adults' with MCI, who are at high risk for dementia. The primary objective of the U01 phase was to design and pilot-test an adaptive, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of cognitive training (CT) combinations aimed to enhance performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the R01 phase, the objective is to identify the best combination of CT exercises to delay dementia onset among persons with MCI. The longitudinal endpoint goal is reducing incident dementia. The primary aim of the study is to determine which CT combination has the best probability to delay dementia by producing the largest IADL improvements. The study further aims to explore neuroimaging and novel blood-based biomarkers.",

The longitudinal endpoint goal is delaying dementia onset.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the U01 phase were:\n\n- To pilot test a plan to recruit and enroll under-represented minorities with the goal of obtaining a sample representative of the USF population in race and ethnicity.\n\nIn the current R01 phase:\n\nThe primary objective is to conduct an adaptive, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of cognitive training (CT) combinations aimed to enhance performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The longitudinal endpoint goal is reducing dementia incidence.\n\nDesign: The design is an adaptive randomized trial to identify the best combination of CT exercises to improve IADL function and thereby delay dementia onset among persons with MCI. Four arms of CT will be compared to an active control condition.\n\nOutcomes: incident dementia is the primary outcome. Secondary outcome is Everyday Function: measures include Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and iFunction. A composite of performance (measured by time and accuracy) will be derived.\n\nInterventions and Duration: Four combinations of computerized cognitive training and an active control computerized stimulation will be investigated. The five arms will be equivalent in terms of frequency and duration of each session (60 min/day, two-three days/wk, 16 weeks).\n\nSample size: The study team plans to enroll up to 1305 participants. Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MCI will be included in the study."
