            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot clinical trial to test the efficacy of intermittent treatment with the flavonoid compound fisetin for improving vascular endothelial function and reducing aortic stiffness in older adults. This trial will also determine the potential mechanisms by which fisetin may improve vascular function, including by decreasing mitochondrial oxidative stress, cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors in circulation. Lastly, safety, tolerability and adherence of fisetin treatment will be assessed.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cellular senescence increases with aging and contributes to physiological dysfunction. Studies in animal models show that the flavonoid compound fisetin is an effective treatment for reducing cellular senescence and improving vascular function with aging. No published studies have used fisetin to target cellular senescence in older adults to improve vascular function. In addition, the biological reasons (mechanisms) by which fistin may improve vascular function in older adults has not been assessed. This study will evaluate if intermittent treatment with fisetin in older adults improves vascular function, reduces biological markers of cellular senescence, oxidative stress and inflammatory factors produced by senescent cells (i.e., senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors). The study will also evaluate safety, tolerability and adherence with fisetin treatment."
