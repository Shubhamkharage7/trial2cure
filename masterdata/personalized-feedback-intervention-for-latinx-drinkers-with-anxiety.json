            "detailedDescription": "In the first phase, the investigators will collect qualitative and quantitative feedback from focus groups to refine intervention content and evaluate treatment acceptability and feasibility of a novel, brief, integrated, culturally adapted computer-based personalized feedback intervention (PFI). In the second phase, Latinx hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the refined culturally adapted anxiety-alcohol PFI (AA-PFI 2.0) or a control PFI (C-PFI). Initial screening will be conducted via telephone; baseline and post-treatment data will be collected in-person; and 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up data will be collected online remotely."
