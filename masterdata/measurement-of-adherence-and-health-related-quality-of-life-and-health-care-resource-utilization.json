Up to 260 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 170 will take part in MD Anderson.",

These questionnaires will be about your quality of life and experiences with treatment for VTE. It should take less than 10 minutes to complete the questionnaires each time.\n\nInformation from your medical record may also be collected at these time points.\n\nYour participation will be over after the last questionnaires are completed at about 12 months after you enroll in the study."
