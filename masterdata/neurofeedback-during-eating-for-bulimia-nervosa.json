The investigators will examine how this training may influence inhibitory control and BN symptoms.",

Specifically, the study aims 1) to demonstrate ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) neurofeedback target engagement in women with BN using fNIRS; and 2) to link changes in PFC activation to changes in inhibitory control and eating-related symptoms.\n\nData will be collected from women with BN who will be randomly assigned to one of two group conditions (real or sham-control neurofeedback during eating). Participation includes a phone screening assessment, psychodiagnostic assessment, one in-person evaluation, one neurofeedback session, behavioral tasks, online questionnaires before and after the neurofeedback session, and a remote follow-up assessment."
