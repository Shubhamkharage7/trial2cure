            "briefSummary": "Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) has emerged and been increasingly adopted as a modality to allow preparative conditioning pre transplant to be tolerated by older adults or those patients that are otherwise unfit for myeloablative conditioning. In this study, we aim to use RIC followed by matched related/unrelated donor, 7/8 matched related/unrelated donor, or haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Standard strategies to control the alloreactivity following HCT utilize immunosuppressive or cytotoxic medications. In this study, we explore donor graft engineering to enrich for immmunoregulatory populations to facilitate post transplantation immune reconstitution while minimizing graft versus host disease (GVHD) with post-transplant immunosuppressive agents.",
