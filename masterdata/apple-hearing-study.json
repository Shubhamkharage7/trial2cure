This groundbreaking study will advance the understanding of how hearing could be impacted over time by exposure to sound at certain levels. The investigators will measure headphone and environmental sound exposures over time among participants, and determine how these exposures impact hearing and stress levels. US residents who own an iPhone, download the Apple Research app and consent to participate will be randomly assigned to two groups, one with a \"Basic\" user interface in the Research app, and one with an \"Advanced\" user interface. Users in the \"Advanced\" group will receive additional information about their exposures and be given additional surveys and hearing tests based on their music and environmental sound exposures. The study will provide investigators with a better understanding of listening behavior and its overall impact on hearing health. This information will in turn help guide public health policy and prevention programs designed to protect and promote hearing health in the US and globally."

The survey will ask for confirmation that they reviewed the exposure data and perceive it as accuracy, whether or not they used any hearing protection (e.g., ear plugs worn at a rock concert), and any intended listening behavior change resulting from their data review.
