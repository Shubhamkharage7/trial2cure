            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot randomized clinical trial is to assess feasibility and acceptability of a brief parent-adolescent dating violence prevention intervention (Engaging Together for Healthy Relationships; ETHR) delivered in pediatric primary care settings. The main questions it aims to answer is if ETHR is acceptable and feasible. 4 healthcare providers will receive ETHR to share with their patients which includes clinician training, provider-delivered scripts, resource guides, and a comprehensive website. This will be compared to providers conducting routine well-child care with their patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators are conducting a pilot randomized clinical trial to test a brief parent-adolescent dating violence prevention intervention (Engaging Together for Healthy Relationships; ETHR). ETHR has been developed for parents and adolescents, to be implemented within pediatric primary care settings. ETHR is a comprehensive intervention which includes a training for clinicians, brief educational scripts for providers, resource guides for the adolescent, parent, and dyad, a comprehensive website, and warm referral processes to connect families with local resources. The investigators will be comparing ETHR with routine care. The specific goal of the pilot trial is to test trial feasibility, as well as intervention acceptability and fidelity. The investigators also will be examining exploratory changes in secondary outcomes and early implementation barriers and facilitators.\n\nFour pediatric clinics will participate in this study. The investigator will recruit two providers from each clinic and randomize them into the intervention provider or control provider. The intervention provider will receive ETHR and the control provider will complete their regular well-child care. The investigators will enroll 15 families in the intervention arm and 5 in the control arm (3:1 enrollment). Families who are seeing the intervention provider for a well-child visit will be enrolled in the intervention arm; those seeing the control provider will be enrolled in the control arm. Families will be eligible if they are seeing the intervention or control providers for a well child visit, if the adolescent coming for the well-visit is between 11 to 15, if both the caregiver and adolescent are interested in participating, and if the family speaks and understands English. Families will be called 2 weeks ahead of their visit to enroll, consent, and complete a baseline survey (both the adolescent and parent will complete the survey). Participants will then attend their well -visit (where they will receive ETHR or routine care, depending on their provider). They will complete an acceptability and fidelity survey immediately post-visit, a resource utilization survey 1 month post visit, and a follow up survey (identical to the baseline survey) 3 months post visit. Providers will complete a brief fidelity and acceptability survey after each study visit (15 for intervention providers, 5 for control providers). All providers and a subset of families enrolled in the intervention arm (20 dyads, 40 participants) will also complete post-intervention interviews."
