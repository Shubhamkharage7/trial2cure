            "detailedDescription": "Remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) is a reimbursable clinical service. Pilot investigation conducted by our lab demonstrated promise that this service is feasible to add to clinical care. It is unclear still if RTM is able to provide clinical benefit to patients including improving and sustaining physical activity (PA) and exercise behaviors over a longer period of time (\\>1 year). Our central hypothesis is that the addition of RTM to physical activity, both in a skilled rehabilitation program and within a home program, will improve long term outcomes related to physical activity including self-efficacy for exercise, consistent participation in home exercise recommendations, and quality of life in people living with PD and MS. Thus the specific aims of this study are as follows:\n\n1. To assess PA and exercise behaviors over 1-year period using a remote therapeutic monitoring platform\n\n   a. We will track steps per day, minutes of aerobic activity per week, and frequency of workouts including flexibility, balance, and resistance training.\n2. To understand how engagement with RTM for PA tracking affects overall self-efficacy for exercise, readiness for exercise behavior change, and quality of life.\n\n   1. Assessed through monthly self-report of usability survey for RTM and self-efficacy for exercise survey."
