Study will assess changes in coronary atheroma volume comparing tirzepatide 15 mg/week plus Standard of Care (SOC), as compared to placebo plus SOC. Potential eligible participants may be prescreened for eligibility prior to the screening visit and must have a diagnosis of atherosclerosis (as assessed by \\>10% atheroma on CCTA) and T2DM.\n\nPatients must be on a stable medical regiment (\\>4 weeks on statin therapy and diabetes medications) and undergo screening CCTA to demonstrate coronary plaque. Participant eligibility will be assessed by the Imaging Core Lab.\n\nIf the participant meets all entry criteria during baseline visit, then consenting participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive tirzepatide on top of standard of care for treatment period of 12 months. Participants will be asked to maintain stable doses of statins and diabetes medications. Persistent hyperglycemia will be treated by primary physician or endocrinologist,"
