            "briefSummary": "Multiple prior studies have compared self-administered Subcutaneous Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate(DMPA-SC) to both provider-administered DMPA-SC and Intramuscular Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA-IM) and found that continuation rates for self-administered DMPA-SC are higher. Thus far, studies investigating self-administered DMPA-SC have focused on patients presenting for contraception. Self-administered DMPA-SC has not been widely studied in patients seeking abortion and has been more extensively studied in international settings than in the US. The project will be a prospective cohort study of patients at a large, free-standing abortion clinic in Chicago, Illinois. Patients who indicate that they desire DMPA for post-abortion contraception will be recruited. They will choose either provider-administered DMPA-IM or self-administered DMPA-SC. Patients in both groups will complete a baseline survey that will collect demographic and clinical characteristics. Patients who choose self-administered DMPA-SC will receive self-injection teaching from study staff and will self-inject their first dose of DMPA-SC in the clinic. Patients who choose provider-administered DMPA-IM will receive their first dose of DMPA-IM in the clinic. Both groups will receive a prescription for three additional doses of DMPA and will receive an injection calendar. Study participants will receive a reminder prior to the start of the injection window for their second and third doses. After the injection window for the second and third doses closes, participants will complete follow up surveys. These surveys will assess whether patients received the subsequent doses of DMPA, reasons for discontinuing DMPA for patients who did not receive a dose, pregnancy status, and patient satisfaction with DMPA use. Follow up will be primarily via secure text messaging application with phone calls, email, and mail reserved for patients who cannot or prefer not to be contacted via text message. The primary outcome is continuation rates of DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC at 3 and 6 months after initiation. Secondary outcome measures include pregnancy, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction. We will also determine associations between patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and continuation of DMPA. This project will generate evidence that will support expanding access to DMPA-SC and providing patient education on self-injection, allowing for increased patient contraceptive autonomy."
