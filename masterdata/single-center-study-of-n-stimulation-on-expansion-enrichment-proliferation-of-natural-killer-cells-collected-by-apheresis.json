            "detailedDescription": "This phase 1, single cohort study will enroll up to 10 healthy subjects. All subjects will be pre-screened for eligibility. If the subject meets eligibility for study participation, informed consent will be obtained. Screening will include a history and physical, review of concomitant medications, assessment of NYHA functional status, assessment of ECOG performance status, clinical laboratory tests, pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing abilities), assessment of peripheral venous access, and a donor history questionnaire (DHQ). If subjects meet eligibility criteria, they will be asked to undergo two apheresis collections and donate their mononuclear cells (MNCs) for research purposes.\n\nSubjects will be scheduled for the first apheresis collection on study Day 1. Two total blood volume (TBV) will be processed during each apheresis collections, which is currently the collection centers standard practice. All subjects will receive N-803 at a fixed dose of 1 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection 4 to 5 days prior to the second apheresis collection. The N-803 dose may be administered starting on study Day 8 but no later than study Day 24. The study day for N-803 administration will be determined based on the planned date of the second apheresis collection. The second apheresis collection should occur between study Day 12 and study Day 29. Two TBV will be processed during this collection.\n\nSubjects will be followed for collection of adverse events (AEs) from study Day 1 (first apheresis collection) through the end of study (EOS) visit. Subjects will be instructed to contact the study team in the event they experience AEs post N-803 administration (e.g., injection site reaction). In addition, AEs will be elicited from subjects during follow-up phone calls."
