Up to one additional systemic anti-cancer therapy for SCLC is allowed, for a total of up to two prior lines of therapy. This study is intended to identify the biomarker-defined subgroup(s) that may benefit most from alisertib treatment and to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of alisertib."
