Additionally, the second aim is to examine whether smoking deprivation moderates the relation between microaggressions and multiple facets of smoking behavior, subjective withdrawal, and urge/craving.",
            "detailedDescription": "This proposal will employ a novel multi-modal approach to evaluate the role of microaggressions in relation to smoking lapse and topography among a sample of Latinx smokers. Adult Latinx daily smokers will attend two counterbalanced experimental sessions - (1) smoking deprivation (16 hours of smoking abstinence) and (2) smoking as usual - during which microaggressions during the relapse analog task will be assessed."
