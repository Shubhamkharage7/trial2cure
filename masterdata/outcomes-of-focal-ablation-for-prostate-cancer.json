Ablative therapies may be delivered via a whole gland or focal approach by systems including cryoablation (CA), brachytherapy, irreversible electroporation (IRE), high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) procedure or future novel prostate ablation systems.\n\nThese are single, outpatient treatments lasting between 2-4 hours and include treatment planning and energy delivery under guidance and are either administered via transperineally approach (cryoablation, IRE, brachytherapy) or via the urethral (TULSA-Pro) or rectum (HIFU).\n\nThis study protocol will not include experimental therapy and the enrolled subjects will undergo the ablative therapy as part of their standard of care treatment."
