            "briefSummary": "Patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are at high risk of recurrence. Pre-operative radiotherapy is used to increase the safe removal of tumors and improve local control in these patients. Increasing the preoperative radiotherapy dose with standard techniques might lead to normal tissue toxicity and postoperative wound complications.\n\nGRID radiation therapy is a technique that may increases radiation dose with minimal added toxicity. It is hypothesized that GRID radiation dose will improve tumor response without increasing post-operative wound complications. While GRID has been used in many patients, there have been few formal studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the technique. In this study, a single priming dose of GRID will be administered to subjects with high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcoma prior to standard radiotherapy and tumor resection to determine the safety and clinical efficacy of the GRID dose. This single-arm pilot study will assess the safety of spatially fractionated grid radiation therapy (GRID) on 20 subjects with resectable extremity soft tissue sarcoma, followed by standard-of-care conventional radiotherapy (XRT) and tumor resection."
