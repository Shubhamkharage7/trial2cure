The study researchers will test increasing doses of Illuminare-1 to find the dose that makes the nerve structures fluoresce (light up) but causes few or mild side effects. When the researchers find this dose, it will be tested in new groups of study participants to see whether surgery performed using Illuminare-1 guidance is better than surgery performed without intraoperative guidance. The researchers will also do tests to study the way the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of Illuminare-1. This study is the first to test Illuminare-1 in people. Illuminare-1 has received Fast Track designation from the US FDA."
