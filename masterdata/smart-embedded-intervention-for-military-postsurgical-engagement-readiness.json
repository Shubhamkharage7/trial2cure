Aim 1: Evaluate the extent to which a brief preoperative MBI improves TKA patients' postoperative musculoskeletal health and reduces chronic opioid use. Aim 2: Evaluate the extent to which an intensive MBI (MORE) improves musculoskeletal health and reduces chronic opioid use among patients non-responsive to preoperative intervention. Aim 3: (A) Determine patient baseline characteristics that moderate MBI treatment responses. (B) Quantify the degree to which the impact of Phase 1 and 2 MBIs on musculoskeletal health and opioid dose are mediated by changes in mechanistic autonomic marker of self-regulation: heart-rate variability (HRV)."
