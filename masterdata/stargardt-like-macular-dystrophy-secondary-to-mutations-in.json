            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSTDG3 is an inherited eye disease. Currently there is no treatment for STDG3. Past studies of STDG3 have largely looked at members of large families at a single time point. Researchers want to learn more about the disease at an individual level.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo understand the natural history of changes in the retina that occur in people with STDG3.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 10 and older with STDG3 due to a variant in the ELOVL4 gene.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 6 visits. First they will have a screening visit, followed by a baseline visit. Then they will have a visit 6 months later. Then they will have a visit 1, 2, and 3 years after the first visit. Visits will last 4 to 8 hours.\n\nVisits will include the following:\n\nMedical history and physical exam.\n\nComplete eye exam. Participants' eye pressure and ability to see letters on a vision chart will be tested. Their pupils will be dilated with eye drops. Pictures will be taken of the retina and the inside of the eye.\n\nQuestions about participants' family history, especially the presence of eye disease.\n\nVisual field test. Participants will be seated in front of a large dome and asked to press a button when they see a light within the dome.\n\nElectroretinogram. Participants will sit in the dark with their eyes patched for 30 minutes. Then they will wear special contact lenses and watch flashing lights.\n\nOptical coherence tomography. Cross-sectional pictures will be taken of participants' retinas.\n\nFundus autofluorescence. Blue light will be shone into participants eyes to assess the health of the retina....",

Cross-sectional studies of large families suggest progressive macular atrophy in STDG3 but there is a paucity of longitudinal data for these patients. The overall goal is to establish a natural history study of STDG3.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in retinal structure in STDG3 patients.\n\nThe secondary objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in retinal function in STDG3 patients.\n\nAn exploratory objective is to assess the longitudinal changes in functional vision and the participant s perceived effect on activities of daily living (e.g., mobility).\n\nEndpoints: The primary endpoints are: A) the growth rate of the square root area of loss of the inner segment/outer segment band (EZband) obtained from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and B) the rate of atrophy enlargement obtained from fundus autofluorescence\n\nThe secondary endpoints are: A) the change in BCVA total letters read from baseline to Year 3 and B) the rate of loss of retinal sensitivity measured with perimetry\n\nStudy Population: Up to 25 patients with Stargardt-like macular dystrophy 3 who are \\>= 10 years of age.\n\nDescription of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Patients will be seen in the Ophthalmic Genetics Clinic at the National Eye Institute within the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda.\n\nStudy Duration: 84 months (7 years).\n\nParticipant Duration: 36 months (3 years)."
