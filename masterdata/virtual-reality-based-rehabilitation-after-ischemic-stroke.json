The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nFeasibility and tolerability of using immersive Virtual Reality technology-based therapy for patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke in an inpatient hospital setting Participants will receive 1 or 2 virtual reality therapy sessions and complete surveys at the end of each session."
