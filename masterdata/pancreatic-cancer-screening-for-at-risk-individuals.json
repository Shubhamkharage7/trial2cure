High-risk patients who are undergoing pancreatic cancer screening in accordance with national guidelines at participating study centers will be eligible for the study. Information regarding patient characteristics, findings at screening examination, and patient outcomes will be collected.\n\nPrimary Outcome (Primary Aim):\n\nTo identify the proportion of patients who meet International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening Consortium screening criteria 3rd update (CAPS Jan 2020), or more updated national guidelines, who are found at the screening to have high-risk pancreatic lesions amenable to treatment (definition of \"high-risk lesions amenable to treatment\" is provided under the section on study outcomes).\n\nSecondary outcomes (Secondary Aims) will include (details are provided under the section on study outcomes):\n\n1. Proportion of patients diagnosed with any stage pancreatic cancer\n2. proportion of patients undergoing pancreatic surgery\n3. Cancer-related outcome, defined as a cancer-related death\n4. proportion of patients experience harms, defined as any complications/adverse event due to screen related procedures\n5. Comparison of cancer outcome, defined cancer-related death, in screen-detected cancer with cancer outcomes reported by the SEERs population-based registry. Study overview Study type: a prospective observational cohort High-risk patients who meet study inclusion criteria at study centers will be identified.\n\nScreening and patient follow-up will be performed at individual study centers per standard clinical practice. Patient characteristics, screening performed and screening results, clinical outcome data will be collected by individual study centers. This data will be stored and analyzed at central study REDCap located at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC)"

Lynch syndrome or Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) mutations with at least one affected first-degree relative (FDR). Lynch syndrome could be diagnosed either by using clinical criteria or Mutator L homolog 1 (MLH1), Mutator S homolog 2 (MSH2), Mutator S homolog 6 (MSH6), Postmeiotic Segregation Increased, S. Cerevisiae, 2 (PMS2) or EPCAM mutation.\n\n   Screening to be initiated at age 45 or 10 years younger than the youngest family member with pancreatic cancer.\n3.
