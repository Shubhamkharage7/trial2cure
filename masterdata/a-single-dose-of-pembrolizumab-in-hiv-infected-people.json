            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system. Some people with HIV have a low CD4+ T-cell count despite taking antiviral medicines that control HIV replication. These cells fight disease, so a low count makes it easier for people to become sick. Researchers want to see if a new drug can improve the immune system, including T cells. The drug is called pembrolizumab\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if pembrolizumab is safe to use in people with HIV who have a low CD4+ T cell count despite taking medcines that control HIV replication, and to see if it strengthens the immune system.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople age 18 years or older with HIV who are taking antiretroviral drugs as treatment, have blood HIV levels below detection limits of commercial assays, and have a low CD4+ T-cell count (below 350 cells/mm3).\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nHeart, blood, and urine tests\n\nSexually active participants must use 2 kinds of birth control.\n\nParticipants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in one arm. A machine will remove white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into the other arm.\n\nParticipants will have a baseline visit. They will have blood tests. They may have a pregnancy test.\n\nA needle will insert a thin plastic tube (IV) into an arm vein. The participants will get the study drug or a placebo through the IV for 30 minutes. They will be watched for a couple hours after.\n\nParticipants will have 11 follow-up visits over the next 48 weeks. They will have a physical exam, vital signs, medical review, and blood tests.\n\nParticipants may have another leukapheresis.\n\nParticipants will be called every 12 weeks after their last follow-up visit to talk about how they feel and their health. Participation ends after the week 96 phone call.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "A subset of HIV-infected patients, those with poor immunologic response to combined antiretroviral therapy (CD4+ T-cell count of less than 300-350 cells/mm\\^3) despite control of viremia, are at increased risk for both HIV-related and non-HIV-related complications compared to immunologic responders. Thus, novel approaches for treating HIV infection are needed to facilitate management of this patient population.\n\nOne potential drug target for HIV treatment is the T-cell receptor PD-1. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, inhibits proliferation of T cells and production of cytokines. This naturally serves to dampen potentially harmful excessive immune responses. Upregulation of PD-1 and/or its ligands can be observed in tumors and people with chronic viral infection, including HIV. This upregulation can inhibit T-cell immune surveillance, which may result in tumor growth or poor control of infection.\n\nPembrolizumab is an IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1, thus blocking the receptor from binding with its ligands. In cancer indications, inhibition of PD-1 induces an antitumor immune response, which in turn reduces tumor growth. The Food and Drug Administration has approved pembrolizumab for treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and other cancers. Similarly, in animal models of HIV and in vitro studies, PD-1 blockade was associated with a decrease in viral load and an increase in CD8+ T cells. A clinical trial to examine the effects of PD-1 inhibition by pembrolizumab on HIV infection is thus supported by the data.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the safety and tolerability of a single dose of pembrolizumab in HIV-infected participants who have controlled viremia with a low T-cell count (\\> 100 cells/mm3 and less than or equal to 350 cells/mm\\^3). Study participants will be followed for 96 weeks after receiving the study drug and will be assessed for adverse events, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, PD-1 expression, CD8+ T-cell anti-HIV activity, and viral load. If a single dose of pembrolizumab appears to be safe and tolerable, then larger multi-dose and efficacy studies can be planned."
