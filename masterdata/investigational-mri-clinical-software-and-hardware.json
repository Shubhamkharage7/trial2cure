Conduct clinical protocol development and validation: The settings of an MRI machine are commonly adjusted according to the body part being scanned and the reason for the exam. When testing out new sequences and settings or adjusting existing settings, human subjects (patients and healthy volunteers) may be scanned in order to make sure that the quality of the images produced by the MRI machine is adequate for diagnostic purposes and to obtain normative values.\n2. Demonstrate and train: In some cases, human subjects may be scanned for the purposes of demonstrating equipment or for training operators on the safe and effective use of MRI systems."
