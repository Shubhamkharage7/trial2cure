This study will test a telehealth PEth-based CM model in a sample of adults with AUD (n=200), recruited via online platforms by randomizing individuals to six months of 1) an online cognitive behavioral therapy for AUD (CBT4CBT) and telehealth PEth-based CM (CM condition) or 2) CBT4CBT and reinforcers for submitting blood samples (no abstinence required) (control condition). Investigators will assess group differences in PEth-defined abstinence and regular excessive drinking (PEth \\>= 200 ng/mL), and alcohol-related harms (e.g., smoking, drug use). This study will address important gaps in CM research by assessing outcomes during a 12-month follow-up, which is much longer than most previous CM studies; using a conceptual model to identify predictors of post-treatment abstinence. Investigators will conduct an economic analysis to place the cost of this model in the context of downstream CM-associated cost-offsets and improvements in personal and public health.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall objective of this study is to utilize phosphatidylethanol (PEth), a blood-based biomarker that can detect alcohol use for up to 28 days to deliver a feasible telehealth-based 26-week CM intervention. In a pilot trial, we developed a telehealth-based PEth CM intervention where participants used a medical device, the TASSO-M20 to self-collect blood for PEth testing under the observation of research staff over Zoom. This intervention used a two-phase approach where the frequency of PEth testing and reinforcement was decreased from once a week, to as infrequently as every four weeks once participants achieved a PEth level consistent with two to four weeks of abstinence (\\< 20 ng/mL). Seventy-one percent of CM participants achieved \\>4 weeks of abstinence versus 21% of the treatment as usual (TAU) group, and 43% of CM participants achieved \\>24 weeks of abstinence compared to 0% of the TAU group (p \\< 0.05). Based on these promising results, this study will test a telehealth PEth-based CM model in a sample of adults with AUD (n=200), recruited via online platforms by randomizing individuals to six months of 1) an online cognitive behavioral therapy for AUD (CBT4CBT) and telehealth PEth-based CM (CM condition) or 2) CBT4CBT and reinforcers for submitting blood samples (no abstinence required) (control condition). Investigators will assess group differences in PEth-defined abstinence and regular excessive drinking (PEth \\>= 200 ng/mL), and alcohol-related harms (e.g., smoking, drug use). This study will address important gaps in CM research by assessing outcomes during a 12-month follow-up, which is much longer than most previous CM studies; using a conceptual model to identify predictors of post-treatment abstinence. The primary barrier to the dissemination of this model is the cost of PEth testing and CM reinforcers. Investigators will conduct an economic analysis to place these costs in the context of downstream CM-associated cost- offsets and improvements in personal and public health. If this model increases alcohol abstinence and is cost-effective it could reach millions of Americans with AUD that cannot or do not seek in-person care."
