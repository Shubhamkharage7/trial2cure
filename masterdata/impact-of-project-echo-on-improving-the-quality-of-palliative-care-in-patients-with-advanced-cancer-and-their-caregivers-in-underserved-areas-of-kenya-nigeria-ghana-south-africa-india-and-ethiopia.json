Project ECHO is a model of medical education and care management that empowers clinicians to provide better care to more people where they live. Understanding the experiences and satisfaction of patients and caregivers may help improve healthcare workforce capacity and increase access to specialty care for the world's rural and underserved populations.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the effects of Project ECHO on patient-reported quality of life (QOL) (as assessed by the change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy FACT-General \\[G\\]) in seriously ill patients of providers receiving ECHO model-based comprehensive educational and telementoring intervention (ECHO-Palliative Care, or ECHO-PCT).\n\nSECONDARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To examine the effects of ECHO-PCT on patients' symptom distress as assessed by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), Symptom Distress Scores (SDS), as well as patient and caregiver experience and satisfaction as assessed by the FAMCARE-P 16-item (16)-patient and FAMCARE-caregiver questionnaires.\n\nII. To explore the effects of ECHO-PCT on providers' efficacy in, knowledge of, and competence to deliver Palliative Care to Patients with serious life limiting illness, as well as their satisfaction with providing Palliative Care services as assessed by Palliative Care Participant Initial Survey, Palliative Care Participant Follow Up Survey, and Feedback Survey.\n\nIIa. Increase patient access to quality palliative care in these regions (morphine consumption).\n\nIIb. Increase patient access to quality palliative care in these regions (morphine consumption).\n\nIIc. Increased patient access to palliative care (PC) measured by the number of patient visits (new and follow-ups).\n\nIId. Provider turnover. IIe. Adherence, measured by the number of ECHO sessions held, the number of ECHO participants at each session, and the number of cases reviewed.\n\nIIf. Comfort with the ECHO platform and ability to learn/engage via distance technology, assessed by the Palliative Care Participant Initial Survey and Palliative Care Participant Follow Up Survey.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I (ECHO PARTICIPANTS): Participants participate in online ECHO clinics over 1 hour twice monthly for 12 months and in-country workshops twice per year. Participants complete 5 online surveys between baseline through end of year 2 for up to a total of 26 minutes .Participants complete a 15-minute interview in person or phone about their experience in the ECHO project.\n\nARM II (PATIENTS): Patients complete 3 in-person or phone questionnaires over a total of 20 minutes every 3 months for 2 years about their symptoms, emotional and physical well-being, and their experience and satisfaction with outpatient oncology care. Patients' medical charts are reviewed for data collection. Patients complete a 15-minute interview in person or phone about their care received by their physician at baseline, end of month 4 and month 12.\n\nARM III (CAREGIVERS): Caregivers complete an in-person or phone questionnaire over 5 minutes up to 8 times about their experience and satisfaction with the cancer care their family member has received. Caregivers complete a 15 minute interview in person or by phone about the care their family member received by their physician."
