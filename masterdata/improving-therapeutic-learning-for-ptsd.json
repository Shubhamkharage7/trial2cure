Participants will include 120 women aged 21-50 with a current diagnosis of PTSD related to physical or sexual assault, English speaking, and medically healthy. Participants will complete the stages of the study across 2-3 days, depending on participant need.",
            "detailedDescription": "Specific Aim 1: Test the degree to which exogeneous manipulations of dopamine neurotransmission affect exposure therapy learning across multiple indices. Hypothesis: L-DOPA will decrease measures of fear responding across indices.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Test the degree to which post-exposure functional connectivity within dopaminergic neural networks mediates the effect of dopaminergic manipulation on fear responding after exposure therapy. Hypothesis: L-DOPA will predict enhanced post-exposure dopaminergic functional connectivity, which in turn predicts decrease fear recall."
