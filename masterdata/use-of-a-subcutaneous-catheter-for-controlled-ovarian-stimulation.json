This is a feasibility study to evaluate the use of the Neria Guard\u2122 (Unomedical, Convatec) subcutaneous catheter for ovarian stimulation in IVF.",
            "detailedDescription": "Daily or twice daily injections are a standard part of controlled ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). These injections are both physically and emotionally burdensome for patients and contribute additional stressors to those already inherent to infertility. Subcutaneous catheters have been demonstrated to be effective for administration of insulin, anticoagulants, and other medications in pediatric patients, and subcutaneous gonadotropin-releasing hormone pumps have also been used in hypothalamic patients. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a subcutaneous catheter in patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF. Primary outcomes will include the incidence of safety and catheter-related issues as well as assessment of patient satisfaction in cycles using the subcutaneous catheter. We will also closely monitor estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels during stimulation to ensure adequate medication administration via the catheter as well as IVF outcomes including mature oocyte yield, embryo maturation, and pregnancy rates."
