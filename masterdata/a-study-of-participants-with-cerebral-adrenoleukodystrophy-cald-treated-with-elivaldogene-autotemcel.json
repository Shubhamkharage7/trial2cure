All enrolled participants with CALD treated with eli-cel in the post-marketing setting will be followed in this study for 15 years. No investigational drug product will be administered in this study. This study will enroll 120 participants with CALD treated with eli-cel in the post-marketing setting. A subpopulation of 24 participants with more advanced early active CALD will be specifically enrolled as required by the US FDA as a condition of accelerated approval and will be considered as a separate cohort for effectiveness outcomes."
