            "briefSummary": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious intestinal disease of preterm and term neonates which remains a major cause of intestinal failure, and an unsolved clinical challenge in pediatrics. While overall mortality of preterm infants continues to decrease due to improvements in general neonatal care, mortality caused by NEC remains high (up to 30-50%) and survivors suffer from reduced quality of life, and long-term disabilities such as debilitating complications of intestinal failure, poor growth and neurodevelopmental delay. Besides prevention, there have been hardly any innovations in the treatment of NEC which underwent trial evaluation.\n\nNEC pathogenesis is multifactorial, but bowel ischemia is known to play an essential role in the development of NEC. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a therapeutic maneuver that involves brief cycles of non-lethal ischemia and reperfusion applied to a limb, which protects distant organs (such as the intestine) from ischemic damage. The investigators have shown that in preclinical models of NEC, RIC effectively reduces intestinal damage and prolongs survival. The investigators have also demonstrated the safety of RIC in preterm neonates with NEC. Before the investigators can evaluate the effectiveness of RIC in treating neonates with NEC in a Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT), a Phase II Feasibility RCT must be conducted to evaluate issues related to the enrollment and randomization of neonates, masking of the RIC intervention, and measurement of clinical outcomes.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that it is feasible to conduct a multicenter RCT to evaluate RIC during the management of neonates with medical NEC.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious intestinal disease of preterm and term neonates which remains a major cause of intestinal failure, and an unsolved clinical challenge in pediatrics resulting in mortality rates as high as 50%, reduced quality of life and long-term disabilities such as short bowel syndrome, poor growth, and neurodevelopmental delay. Experimentally, the investigators have discovered that intestinal and brain damage, as well as mortality following NEC, can be avoided by remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in the early stage of the disease. Remote ischemic conditioning is a therapeutic maneuver involving brief cycles of non-lethal ischemia and reperfusion applied to a limb that protects distant organs (such as the intestine) from sustained ischemic damage. In the clinical setting, the cycles of ischemia and reperfusion can be administered by inflation and deflation of a blood pressure cuff, similar to routine blood pressure measurements. The investigators have also demonstrated that this non-invasive, simple, and easy-to-use maneuver consisting of inflation/deflation of a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm is safe in preterm human neonates with NEC.\n\nHypothesis and Objectives: The investigators hypothesize that a masked multi-center randomized controlled trial of RIC in neonates with early-stage NEC is feasible.\n\nStudy design: This is a Phase II multicenter, masked, randomized controlled feasibility trial consisting of two arms: RIC (intervention) and no RIC (control).\n\nStudy population: Preterm neonates with clinical and radiological evidence of early-stage NEC and receiving medical treatment.\n\nSample size/power of primary endpoint: In the 12 international collaborating centers, the investigators expect to randomize, in 30 months, 78 patients with NEC receiving medical treatment (39 per arm) which represents 40% of approached eligible neonates."
