In this research study, the investigators hope to learn whether or not this combination of prehabilitation interventions has an impact on the recoverability of participants who will undergo cystectomy or bladder removal surgery. The 5 interventions that make up the prehabilitation study are:\n\n* Participant Interview (If one of the first ten participants)\n* Exercise Testing\n* Exercise Training\n* Nutritional Support\n* Clinical Assessment of Nutritional Status"
