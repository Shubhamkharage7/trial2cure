Patients undergoing biopsies, outpatient procedures, superficial resections of cutaneous malignancies, or purely palliative operations are not eligible.\n\nThese procedures are commonly performed in patients with malignant neoplasms, malignant neuroendocrine tumors, or carcinomas in situ, and are commonly \"tracked\" by hospitals and cancer centers participating in the ACS NSQIP Procedure Targeted option because they are often associated with higher rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality (compared to other, less complex cancer procedures).\n\n* Patient must be scheduled for elective major cancer surgery (as listed in 4.1.4) at FCCC \\< 30 days after First Registration.\n\nElective surgery is defined as:\n\n* Patient is scheduled to be brought from their home (or normal living environment) to FCCC on the day of the index surgery (or day prior as scheduled admission) AND\n* Surgery is not scheduled as urgent or emergent\n\n  * Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA consent document\n  * Geographical accessibility and willingness to return to FCCC for all preoperative and postoperative study assessments.\n\nFirst Registration Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any condition that might interfere with the subject's participation in the study, compliance with study requirements, or in the evaluation of the study results.\n\nSecond Registration Inclusion Criteria:\n\nA patient will be eligible for continued inclusion in this study only if ALL of the following criteria apply at the time of Second Registration (one to two days prior to anticipated discharge). No exceptions or waivers will be granted for patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria.\n\n* Post\n\n  * Elective (curative or palliative) major cancer surgery (as listed in 4.1.4 above) at the time of the index surgery (patient may have undergone more than one of these procedures) OR\n  * Elective surgical procedure(s) listed as an option (i.e., CPT code) in the Surgical Risk Calculator webpage (patient may have undergone more than one of these procedures)\n\nFor the purposes of this study, the procedure that was performed with the highest estimated risk of DSC (as predicted by the Surgical Risk Calculator) will be denoted at the time of Second Registration as the \"index procedure\" performed during the \"index surgery\".\n\n* Elective surgery \\< 30 days after First Registration.\n\nSecond Registration Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Status post elective surgical procedure(s) not listed as options in the Surgical Risk Calculator webpage.
