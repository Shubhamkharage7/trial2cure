Pre-clinical data indicates that anti-Netrin-1 therapy can prevent/delay metastatic progression of disease by inducing cancer cell death through its dependence receptor Unc5b as well as prevent epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).\n\nThis pilot study is designed to provide vital translational scientific information that will inform the design of future clinical trials for NP137. This information includes determining the optimal use of NP137 with cytotoxic, as well as the treatment setting of resectable pancreatic cancer."

Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics are eligible.\n* Patients with known untreated hepatitis B or C (HBV/HCV) or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Note: Superficial bladder cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and low-grade prostate cancer not requiring cytotoxic therapy should not exclude participation in this trial. Patients with CLL may be enrolled if they do not require active chemotherapy and their hematologic, renal and hepatic function meets criteria previously mentioned.\n* Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women",
