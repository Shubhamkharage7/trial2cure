MagnetOs Putty is a synthetic bone graft extender product that is routinely used by surgeons as a treatment for patients with degenerative disc disease or spinal trauma undergoing spinal fusion surgery.\n\nIn this study, MagnetOs Putty will be used according to the latest U.S. Instructions For Use, specifically as a bone graft extender mixed with autograft in a 1:1 vol.% in the posterolateral spine.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study, following a screening period of a maximum of 30 days, 30 patients will undergo up to two-level instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) procedure. Prior to surgery, each patient will be randomized to receive MagnetOs Putty on the assigned side of the spine and demineralized bone matrix mixed with autograft bone on the other at the diseased levels. They will be followed up at discharge, Week 2, Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12. An interim analysis will be performed once 15 patients have completed their Month 6 visit and have measurements for the endpoints available to measure effectiveness. The primary endpoint will be analyzed at Month 12.\n\nIn this study, MagnetOs Putty will be applied according to the latest Instructions for Use approved in the United States. Specifically, MagnetOs Putty will be used as a bone graft extender mixed with autograft in a 1:1 vol.% in patients up to two-level degenerative disc disease with up to grade 1 spondylolisthesis requiring treatment or spinal trauma with an instrumented posterolateral spine fusion procedure. The fusion procedure (PLF) will be left to the surgeon's discretion.\n\nRadiographs will be obtained at Screening, Day 0, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12. CT scans will only be obtained at Month 6 and Month 12."
