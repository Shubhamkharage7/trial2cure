This treatment combines a new type of stem cell transplant along with treatment using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that have been engineered to recognize and attack your AML cells.\n\nThe first treatment is a modified stem cell transplant, using blood-forming stem cells donated from a healthy donor. From the same donor, we will also make CAR T-cells, which are leukemia fighting cells, which will be given to the patient via an infusion into the vein after the transplanted stem cells have started to grow healthy blood cells. The modification of the stem cell transplant means that the healthy bone marrow cells will be \"invisible\" to the CAR T-cells that are trying to kill the leukemia cells."

The modification is a type of gene editing - this means changing the DNA of the cells, so that a protein that the bone marrow stem cells usually show on their surface is not shown any more. This makes the bone marrow cells \"invisible\" to the CAR T-cells, and makes this therapy safer for the patient. The protein is called CD33.\n\nCART33: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CART) are immune cells which are modified by adding a CAR molecule, which makes them much more efficient at finding and killing cancer cells. In this case, the CAR T-cells are programmed to target a protein called CD33, which is found on the surface of leukemia cells, and on healthy bone marrow cells.",
