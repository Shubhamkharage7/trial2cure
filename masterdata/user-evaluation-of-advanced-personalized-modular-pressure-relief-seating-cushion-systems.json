Personalized cushions will be created using a cushion fitting process the investigators have already developed and tested. Microenvironmental conditions will be monitored during use. A cost analysis will ensure the customized modular cushion applies value-driven principles. User satisfaction will be measured along with the effects on daily function, skin status and seated tissue health.",
            "detailedDescription": "A repeated measures clinical study design will be carried out with 30 Veterans. 'Pre-baseline' seated interface pressures will be assessed with study participants sitting on their own cushions and pelvic region skin checks carried out by the study Research Nurse. All participants will then receive customized modular cushions. Participants will be randomly assigned to Group A or Group B using a modified randomization scheme. Group A participants will first use a gel ball fitted cushion for 2 weeks during all daily living activities while seated in their wheelchair followed by use of a SquishINS fitted cushion for 2 weeks. Group B will first use the SquishINS fitted cushion then a gel ball fitted cushion. Seated interface pressure distribution will be obtained at the beginning and end of each test period. A dual temperature and humidity sensor placed in the cushion will enable continuous monitoring of microenvironmental status during use. The study Research Nurse will repeat the pelvic region skin check and participants will complete a questionnaire based on the QUEST 2.0 user satisfaction instrument. All responses will be documented as part of the QS/DC program."
