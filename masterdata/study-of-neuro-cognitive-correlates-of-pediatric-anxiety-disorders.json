The study uses neuro-cognitive tasks, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG).

Healthy comparisons will be studied at comparable time points.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nTo compare healthy youth and symptomatic, medication-free pediatric patients studied prior to receipt of treatment. The study seeks to detect relations between clinical features of anxiety disorders at baseline and a wide range of neurocognitive features associated with attention, memory, and response to motivational stimuli.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To document relations between baseline neurocognitive features and response to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or fluoxetine, as defined by the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) Scale.\n2. To document relations between post-treatment changes in neurocognitive features and anxiety symptoms on the PARS following treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or fluoxetine.\n3.

In one component of the active intervention, subjects are asked to indicate the identity of a letter that appears behind a neutral face, opposite from an angry face. In another component of the active intervention, subjects are asked to identify numbers that are hidden within a puzzle, in locations distal from angry faces. In both components of the active intervention, subjects implicitly learn to shift their attention away from angry faces. This is because the faces are systematically arranged to be far removed from letters and numbers that need to be identified. The control arm of the intervention involves similar components. However, unlike in the intervention arm, angry faces appear in various locations near letters and numbers. Therefore, attention is not shaped in the control arm. This intervention requires five minutes per session and is administered before weekly psychotherapy sessions.",

Completion of required activities during the screening visit requires an IQ above 70.)\n* Language: all subjects will speak English (Tasks in this protocol have not been validated in languages other than English)\n\nALL ADULT SUBJECTS\n\n* Age: 18-65\n* Consent: can give consent\n* IQ: all subjects will have IQ\\>70 (Assessment relies on either a WASI or assessment by trained clinical staff during the subject s screening visit.

(All patients will complete a medical history. Healthy volunteer participants will be medication- free and have no current serious medical conditions, based on a review of their medical history. Subjects only will be excluded from the MRI portions of the study based on this exclusion criterion.)\n* Pregnancy (Subjects only will be excluded from the MRI portions of the study based on this exclusion criterion.)\n* Current use of any psychoactive substance; current suicidal ideation; current diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of sufficient severity to require pharmacotherapy. (These factors could complicate treatment with an SSRI. No subject on medication will be accepted into the trial. Subjects will not be taken off of medications to enter the trial.)\n* Current diagnoses Tourette s Disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD); obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic distress disorder, conduct disorder. (These factors may be affected by SSRI treatment, influencing ability to detect effects on anxiety/symptoms of depression. Of note, subjects who present with a diagnosis of MDD or OCD will not be eligible for inclusion at the outset of the study. However, youth with anxiety disorders frequently develop OCD and MDD when followed over time. Subjects will be allowed to remain in the study if they develop these diagnoses after enrollment.)\n* Past or current history of mania, psychosis, or severe pervasive developmental disorder.

Of note, subjects who present with a diagnosis of MDD or OCD will not be eligible for inclusion at the outset of the study. However, youth with anxiety disorders frequently develop OCD and MDD when followed over time. Subjects will be allowed to remain in the study if they develop these diagnoses after enrollment.)\n* Recent use of an SSRI with failure to respond or tolerate SSRI treatment at an adequate dose and duration. (This is designed to exclude subjects who have failed a trial of an SSRI for their current problem with anxiety. For previously enrolled participants, including patients and healthy volunteers, current use of an SSRI does not exclude participation from follow-up research tasks.)\n* NIMH employees and staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the study per NIMH policy.\n* History of any (excepting nicotine-related and cannabis-related) DSM5-defined moderate to severe substance use disorder (or DSM-IV-defined substance dependence).\n\nHEALTHY ADULT SUBJECTS\n\n-Any current psychiatric diagnosis (Assessment relies on SCID)",
