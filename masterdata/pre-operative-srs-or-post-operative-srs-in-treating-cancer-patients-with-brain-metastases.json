            "briefSummary": "This phase III trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) before surgery to see how well it works compared with SRS after surgery in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastases). SRS is the delivery of focused, high-dose radiation given in a single session to the tumors, with a minimal dose given to uninvolved areas of the brain.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate the 1 year leptomeningeal disease (LMD)-free rate among patients with surgically resectable metastatic brain lesions randomized to post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) (standard care) versus pre-operative SRS followed by surgery (experimental arm).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate the local control (LC), distant brain metastasis rate, overall survival (OS) of pre-operative (pre-op) versus (vs) post-operative (post-op) SRS in patients with brain metastasis.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the reliability of different imaging features by using a combination of patient data and phantom data to quantify the uncertainties associated with using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radiomics studies.\n\nII. To assess the correlation of imaging-pathology correlates using multiparametric imaging that characterize the tumor and peri-tumoral microenvironment including features such as tumor vascular characteristics, cellular density, oxygenation and presence of inflammation/immune reactivity.\n\nIII. To investigate the neuro-cognitive impact, patient reported outcomes and health-related quality of life of pre-operative (pre-op) vs post-operative (post-op) SRS in patients with brain metastasis.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I (PRE-OPERATIVE SRS): Patients undergo SRS within 15 days of randomization followed by surgery within 15 days. Patients may undergo additional SRS if disease returns after treatment.\n\nGROUP II (POST-OPERATIVE SRS): Patients undergo surgery within 15 days of randomization followed by standard of care SRS within 30 days. Patients may undergo additional SRS if disease returns after treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
