Hydrogen breath testing and biologic samples collection will also be completed during the study.",

Participating patients will complete a one week screening period when brief daily survey will be answered. Eligible patients will proceed with the treatment phase of the study, when patients will receive a 14 day course of rifaximin. All included patients will complete glucose and lactulose hydrogen breath tests before and after rifaximin treatment. Biological samples (e.g. blood, stool) will be collected at pre-determined time points and patients will answer daily brief survey for the duration of the study.\n\nIt is anticipated that 210 patients will be screened to reach a goal of enrolling 110 patients for the treatment phase of the study."
