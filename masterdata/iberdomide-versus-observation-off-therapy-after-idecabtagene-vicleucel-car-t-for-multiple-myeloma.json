            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial compares iberdomide maintenance therapy to disease monitoring for improving survival in patients who have received idecabtagene vicleucel (a type of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell \\[CAR-T\\] therapy) for multiple myeloma. The usual approach after treatment with idecabtagene vicleucel is to monitor the multiple myeloma without giving myeloma medications. There is currently no medication approved specifically for use after idecabtagene vicleucel treatment. Upon administration, iberdomide modifies the immune system and activates immune cells called T-cells, which could enhance the effectiveness of idecabtagene vicleucel. Iberdomide may keep multiple myeloma under control for longer than the usual approach (disease monitoring) after idecabtagene vicleucel, and may help multiple myeloma patients live longer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To establish and confirm the safety and dose of iberdomide as maintenance after idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) CAR-T. (Safety run-in) II. To assess whether iberdomide maintenance therapy after idecabtagene vicleucel CAR-T cell therapy increases progression-free survival (PFS) relative to observation without additional therapy. (Randomized phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To demonstrate anti-tumor activity, defined as conversion from non-minimal residual disease (MRD) complete response (CR)/stringent CR (sCR) status to MRD-negative CR/sCR, as well as improvement in PFS in the safety run-in cohort. (Safety run-in) II. To estimate the rate of conversion from MRD-positive at baseline to MRD-negative at any time point post-initiation of iberdomide maintenance or observation without additional therapy. (Key secondary objective; Randomized phase II) III. To estimate overall survival (OS) distribution post-initiation of iberdomide maintenance or observation without additional therapy. (Key secondary objective; Randomized phase II) IV. To estimate the minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rate at pre-registration and at one year post-initiation of iberdomide maintenance or observation without additional therapy. (Randomized phase II) V. To estimate rate of deepening hematological response among patients with measurable multiple myeloma (MM) post-initiation of iberdomide maintenance or observation without additional therapy. (Randomized phase II) VI. To evaluate the safety profile of iberdomide maintenance. (Randomized phase II) VII. To evaluate the peripheral blood immunophenotype before and during iberdomide maintenance or observation without additional therapy. (Randomized phase II) VIII. To evaluate persistence of CAR-T cells with iberdomide maintenance or observation without additional therapy. (Randomized phase II)\n\nCORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rate at start of maintenance and at one year post-initiation of maintenance or observation.\n\nII. To estimate the sustained MRD-negativity rate. III. To estimate the rate of conversion from MRD-positive to MRD-negative. (Key objective) IV. To evaluate the peripheral blood immunophenotype before and during maintenance therapy or observation.\n\nV. To evaluate the persistence of CAR-T cells. VI. To evaluate B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) protein expression by immunohistochemistry on myeloma cells from patients that have relapsed/recurrent disease.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP 1: Patients undergo disease monitoring at monthly clinic visits until disease progression. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy throughout the trial, undergo collection of blood samples at screening and on study, and undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and/or skeletal survey x-ray, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening and then as clinically indicated.\n\nGROUP 2: Patients receive iberdomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy throughout the trial, undergo collection of blood samples at screening and on study, and undergo PET/CT and/or skeletal survey x-ray, CT, or MRI at screening and then as clinically indicated.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days, then every 3-6 months until 4 years following registration."

Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure\n* Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the duration of the study and for 28 days afterwards.\n\n  * Male participants: contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies:\n\n    * Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and for 28 days after the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm:\n\n      * Refrain from donating sperm\n\nPLUS, either:\n\n* Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR\n* Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below:\n\n  * Agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, and female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (including pregnant females)\n\n    * Patients may not have polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome or amyloidosis involving any vital organ; amyloidosis found in skin or lymph nodes (\"non-vital organs\"), or incidental observation of amyloidosis on bone marrow biopsy, are both permissible. Plasma cell leukemia is permissible for study enrollment\n    * Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n    * Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months prior to registration are eligible for this trial\n    * For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n    * Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. Patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n    * Patients may not have other, active infections at time of study registration. Recent infections are not exclusionary if antibiotics have been completed and infection is considered to be resolved / controlled. (Chronic maintenance antibiotics for prior infections, such as fungal, are permissible.)\n    * No known allergy to iberdomide\n    * No known medical condition causing an inability to swallow oral formulations of agents\n    * Patients receiving other active therapies for MM since ide-cel infusion are prohibited from participating in the study\n    * Corticosteroids used for the purpose of managing ide-cel toxicity (often neurotoxicity) soon after ide-cel administration are acceptable, provided that the participant will have been off corticosteroids for \\> 30 days by cycle 1 day 1. Physiologically dosed chronic steroids are permitted\n    * Given the potential for interaction with iberdomide, patients who take strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors may enroll after switching to a different agent and after an appropriate washout period for that particular medication, ideally three half-lives, prior to cycle 1 day 1",
