            "briefSummary": "This study investigates the similarity between microbial plaque scores when assessing the entire dentition versus select teeth. The hypothesis posits that plaque buildup on single teeth mirrors that of the entire mouth, facilitating efficient plaque data collection and generalized deductions. Additionally, the research explores the potential of Dental Monitoring\u00a9 photos in accurately identifying plaque indexes, aiming to enhance plaque evaluation efficiency in dental appointments. The null hypothesis suggests no significant difference between full dentition plaque scores and selected teeth. Results may streamline plaque tracking in patient appointments and enable remote monitoring, potentially detecting plaque accumulation issues earlier.",
            "detailedDescription": "Following the obtainment of participant consent, data will be collected during participant's routine prophylaxis appointment or during designated clinic time open for participants to volunteer. Utilizing a scan box provided by Dental Monitoring\u00a9, a scan (series of intra-oral images) will be taken of the participant's dentition. The scan will be taken once before disclosing solution (erythrosine) is introduced to the dentition and once after.\n\nThe disclosing solution will allow for visualization of plaque. The presence of plaque on all teeth surfaces will be recorded using the O'Leary Plaque Index. No procedures (other than the intra-oral photos), interventions, evaluations or tests will be performed more frequently than they would be if the participant was not participating in the research. The only participant demographic information that will be recorded for this study is age.\n\nParticipants who opt to come in voluntarily for only data collection will not receive a prophylaxis. Their plaque information will be collected, and they will be dismissed.\n\nOversight procedures in place: The Scan Boxes will be utilized by the investigators to take intra-oral photographs of each patient's dentition. These will be sterilized between each participant and stored in the College of Dentistry's clinic lockers when not in use."
