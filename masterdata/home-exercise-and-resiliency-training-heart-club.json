Visit one will require participants to complete a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), liver ultrasound, 6-minute walk, grip strength test, arm circumference measure, body composition analysis, anthropometrics measurement, surveys and a biomarker blood sample collection. The second in-person visit will require participants to complete a final cardiopulmonary exercise test, liver ultrasound, 6-minute walk, grip strength test and arm circumference, biomarker blood sample and final survey."
