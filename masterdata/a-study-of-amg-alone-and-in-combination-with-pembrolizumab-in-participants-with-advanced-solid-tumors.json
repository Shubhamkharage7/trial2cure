Additional indications may be explored in consultation with Medical Monitor.\n  * Group B: NSCLC, CRC, GC. Additional indications may be explored in consultation with Medical Monitor.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status 0 or 1.\n* Life expectancy of \\> 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* At least 1 measurable lesion as defined by modified RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Note: this lesion must not be used for the required biopsies on the study.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo 1 or more biopsies as follows:\n\n  * Fresh biopsy prior to enrollment is preferred or, if fresh tissue is not obtainable, an archival tumor sample may be acceptable if the sample was obtained within 6 months of enrollment and participant has not received any other treatment since sample was obtained, consult the Medical Monitor.\n  * Mandatory fresh biopsy during cycle 2 (before the restaging of CT-scan) of treatment with AMG 355 (\u00b1 pembrolizumab).\n\nNote: Samples must consist of a minimum of 10 (20 preferred) freshly-cut, serially, sectioned, unstained slides. A formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded block is preferred if available, but in lieu of a block, unstained slides or fresh wet tissue is acceptable.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant who received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 \\[CTLA-4\\], OX 40, CD137), and was discontinued from that treatment due to an immune-related adverse events.\n* Untreated or symptomatic brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease Note: participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, ie, without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Chronic intake of systemic corticosteroids (eg prednisone \\> 10 mg/day or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* History of organ transplantation.\n* History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* History of any immune-related colitis. Infectious colitis is allowed if evidence of adequate treatment and clinical recovery exists and at least 3 months interval observed since diagnosis of colitis.\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.",

Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
