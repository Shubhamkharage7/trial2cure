            "detailedDescription": "In this trial, we will enroll patients in two cohorts:\n\nCohort 1: A 6 patient safety lead-in for patients receiving capecitabine prior to beginning a randomized trial for the Long Course Chemo-radiation (LCCRT) cohort. There will be trial stopping rules to review safety and PK data prior to initiating the randomized trial of patients receiving LCCRT.\n\nCohort 2: The Randomized Short Course Radiation (SCRT) cohort.\n\nCohort 1 and 2 will begin enrolling concurrently. Cohort 1 will have a safety lead-in of patients receiving LCCRT (with capecitabine). Cohort 2 will begin with the randomized study of patients receiving SCRT, while the LCCRT cohort is going through the safety lead-in portion.\n\nThere are stopping rules for the LCCRT cohort 1 pending PK analysis as well as an AE review from the treatment period plus 1 week post BMX-001 treatment for the 6 patients prior to moving on with the randomized portion of the study for the LCCRT cohort. All patients in the safety lead-in portion of the trial will receive BMX-001 (A loading dose of 28 mg/subject followed by maintenance doses of 14 mg/subject twice a week) with either SCRT or LCCRT. Patients will receive 3 cycles of FOLFOX or 2 cycles of CAPOX and then be assigned to SCRT or LCCRT prior to randomization. Patients will be randomized (stratified by gender) to BMX-001 or no BMX-001. The randomized trial in each cohort will involve SCRT or LCCRT with or without BMX-001. After conclusion of radiation, patients will then receive 6 more cycles of FOLFOX or 4 more cycles of CAPOX. Skin, GI, and GU symptoms will be measured on the day of screening, before and after RT."

History or evidence upon physical/neurological examination of central nervous system disease (e.g. seizures) unrelated to cancer unless adequately controlled by medication or potentially interfering with protocol treatment\n14. Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or recent arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to start of study treatment\n15. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval \\>450 milliseconds (ms) (CTCAE grade 1) using the specific/usual choice by clinical center for correction factor.\n16.
