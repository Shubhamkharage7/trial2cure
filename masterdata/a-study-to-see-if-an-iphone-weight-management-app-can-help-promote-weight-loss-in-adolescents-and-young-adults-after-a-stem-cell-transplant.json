This study may help researchers learn more about how adolescents and young adults can lose weight and develop healthy eating habits.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the effectiveness of an addiction-based weight loss intervention, embodied as a smartphone application (app) with telephone coaching, on weight outcomes of overweight and obese post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) adolescents and young adults.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the changes in metabolic parameters and physical activity levels, in addition to modifications in addictive eating behaviors, motivation, and self-regulatory behaviors.\n\nII. To evaluate the feasibility, adherence, and satisfaction of this intervention.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive an iPhone with W8Loss2Go app, a body scale and a digital food scale to weigh themselves and food daily. Patients interact with coaches via text messages for 4 days weekly and receive weekly 15 minute phone calls for appointment reminders, emotional support, progress discussion, and follow up on items discussed in a prior visit or phone call. Patients also have telemedicine interviews with the coach lasting 60 minutes at 2 and 4 months to elicit both positive and negative impacts on weight management and to identify barriers such as emotional eating, displacement behaviors, poor coping skills to life stressors, and social challenges. Patients who opt to extend the intervention until month 12 attend an additional telemedicine meeting with the coach. Patients also complete questionnaires over approximately 1.5 hours."
