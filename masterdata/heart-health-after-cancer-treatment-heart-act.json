Evaluating the effects of the program on health outcomes including change in exercise capacity, change in quality of life, change in risk factors, and adverse events.\n3. Evaluating changes in patient-reported measures.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants with a history of breast cancer who receive care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) will receive the intervention which is comprised of a 12-week multi-disciplinary health behavior program. Each participant will have an individualized assessment, goal and plan for each component of the program. Follow-up for outcomes will occur at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months."
