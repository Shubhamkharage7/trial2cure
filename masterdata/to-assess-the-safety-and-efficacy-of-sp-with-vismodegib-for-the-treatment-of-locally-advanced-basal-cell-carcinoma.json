The main question it aims to answer is what the objective response rate for a basal cell carcinoma tumor is following 1 or 3 cycles of SP-002 treatment given as an add-on to hedgehog pathway inhibitor therapy.\n\nResearchers will compare the objective response rate for treated Basal cell carcinoma tumors between 3 treatment Arms.\n\n* Arm 1 participants will receive daily hedgehog pathway inhibitor, and 3 cycles of SP-002 treatment.\n* Arm 2 participants will receive daily hedgehog pathway inhibitor, and 1 cycle of SP-002 treatment.\n* Arm 3 participants will receive daily hedgehog pathway inhibitor only.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 2, 3-arm, multi-center, open-label, randomized, clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of SP-002 in combination with vismodegib in subjects with locally advanced Basal cell carcinoma.\n\nThe study will be completed in 2 consecutive parts. Each part consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period.\n\n* Part A: 20 participants who meet study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment arms (Arm 2 and Arm 3) and will provide preliminary safety and performance in a population with target Basal cell carcinoma lesions.\n* Part B: 60 participants who meet study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 treatment arms (Arm 1, Arm 2, and Arm 3) in a population with target Basal cell carcinoma lesions."

Adequate renal function, as defined by the following:\n\n   * Creatinine \\<1.5 x ULN\n10. For female subjects of childbearing potential\\*, agreement to use two acceptable methods of contraception (including one barrier method), during the study and for at least (per United States Prescribing Information \\[USPI\\]) 24 months after discontinuation of vismodegib.\n\n    For male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential\\*, agreement to use a latex condom, and to advise their female partner to use an additional method of contraception during the study and for at least (per USPI) 24 months after discontinuation of vismodegib.\n11. Subjects agree not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least (per USPI) 24 months after discontinuation of vismodegib; male subjects agree not to donate sperm during the study and for at least 2 months after discontinuation of vismodegib.\n\n    * Childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in the absence of other biological causes. In addition, females under the age of 55 years must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone level \\>40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. laBCC that has progressed on systemic HHPI therapy as defined below:\n\n   * Best response of progressive disease (primary progression).\n   * Objective response followed by disease progression while on HHPI treatment.\n   * laBCC with a best response of stable disease on systemic HHPI treatment.\n2. laBCC that has recurred in the same location after two or more surgical procedures, or that has recurred following radiation therapy.\n3. laBCC that has bone involvement (radiologically confirmed if clinically suspected).\n4. laBCC with invasion of underlying soft tissue that is not accessible by standard syringe/needle.\n5. Patients with evidence of metastatic BCC.\n6. Female subjects who are lactating or pregnant.\n7. Life expectancy of \\<12 weeks.\n8. Concurrent non-protocol-specified anti-tumor therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, other targeted therapy, or radiation therapy).\n9. Recent (within 4 weeks of Day 1), current, or planned participation in an experimental drug study.\n10. History of other malignancies within 3 years of Day 1, except for tumors with a negligible risk for metastasis or death, such as adequately treated basal and squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n11. Uncontrolled medical illnesses such as infection requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics.\n12. History of other stable disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the study or renders the subject at high risk from treatment complications.",
