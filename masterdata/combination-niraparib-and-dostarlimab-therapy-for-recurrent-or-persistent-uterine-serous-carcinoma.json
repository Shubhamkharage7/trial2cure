            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well niraparib and dostarlimab work in treating patients with uterine serous carcinoma that has come back (after a period of improvement) (recurrent) and remains despite treatment (persistent). Niraparib belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors that prevent cancer cells from growing. Dostarlimab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Dostarlimab belongs to a class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that uses the patient's own immune system to treat cancer (immuno-therapy). Giving niraparib and dostarlimab may work better in treating patients with uterine serous carcinoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by confirmed overall response rate (ORR) (partial and complete response, PR/CR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version \\[v\\]1.1) based on investigator assessment of the combination niraparib and dostarlimab in patients with recurrent or persistent uterine serous carcinoma (USC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS). II. Estimate clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD).\n\nIII. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of niraparib and dostarlimab combination.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Biomarker evaluation to predict response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive dostarlimab intravenously (IV) and niraparib orally (PO) on study. Patients also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter."

Replacement hormone therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not an exclusion criterion\n* Participant must not have a history of interstitial lung disease\n* Participant is considered a poor medical risk that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study\n* Participant has received a live vaccine within 30 days of initiating protocol therapy\n* Participant has a history of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)",
