YES is a web-based portal (website) to help monitor issues or symptoms women with breast cancer may experience. YES portal may improve the quality of life of young breast cancer survivors. YES portal may help manage symptoms and provide useful information/resources.",

To determine the efficacy of the YES intervention compared to usual care in improving quality of life (QOL), as measured by the Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors (QLACS) at 6-months (primary outcome).\n\nII. To determine the efficacy of the YES intervention compared to usual care in reducing specific adolescent and young adult (AYA) breast cancer (BC) concerns and symptoms at 6-months.\n\nIII. To determine the sustainability of the effects of YES on AYA concerns, symptoms, and QOL at 9 months, after the completion of the 6-month active intervention period.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To explore potential moderators and mediators of intervention efficacy, and to explore the potential effects of the intervention on inflammatory and other biomarkers including genetic profiles.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 to 2 groups.\n\nGROUP A: Patients receive access to YES portal for 9 months. Patients also complete surveys at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months.\n\nGROUP B: Patients receive usual care for 9 months. Patients also complete surveys at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months. After 9 months, patients may also receive access to YES portal for 3 months."
