HSRC is a Texas A\\&M AgriLife Extension initiative that supports the delivery of school-based physical activity and nutrition programs.\n\nElementary schools in North and East Texas (n=16) of similar socio-economic status will be randomized at baseline to receive either 3, 2, 1, or no strategies to support HSRC program implementation. All schools will participate in HSRC during the full school year.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that one strategy will result in significantly greater HSRC implementation and effectiveness than the other strategies tested."
