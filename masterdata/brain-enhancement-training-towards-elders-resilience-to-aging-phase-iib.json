Both the study and the software being investigated meet the criteria of Non-Significant Risk.",

After consent, only the new, untrained participants will complete the screening visit. Then all participants will perform the pre-training visit (cognitive and functional assessments, MRI/fMRI and blood draw), followed by 10 weeks of training, and then followed by post-training visit (cognitive and functional assessments and MRI/fMRI)."
