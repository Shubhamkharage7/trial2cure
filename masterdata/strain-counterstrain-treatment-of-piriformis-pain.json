The sham group will receive strain-counterstrain treatment for the hamstring muscle.\n\nThere will be two treatments, 1-2 weeks apart ideally.\n\nParticipants will fill out the Oswestry Disability Index Questionnaire before the first treatment and after the second treatment (which is 1-2 weeks after the first treatment).\n\nParticipants will also identify pain using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after each treatment. Participants will identify pain at rest prior to treatment using VAS. Participant will then identify pain at the start of treatment while pressure is applied to the piriformis muscle (4.5kg/cm2) and post treatment while pressure is applied to the piriformis muscle (4.5 kg/cm2).\n\nAn algometer will be used pre and post each treatment (2 treatments that are 1-2 weeks apart) to objectively measure any change in pain pressure threshold."
