The study comprises a dose-escalation component (Part A) and a cohort expansion component (Part B). Up to 41 subjects will be treated in this study. Part A will enroll and treat up to 24 subjects and Part B will be conducted after the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) has been identified in Part A and enroll up to 17 subjects. Both parts of this trial will include a Screening Period, a Pretreatment Period, a Treatment Period, a Follow-Up Period, and a Post-Progression Follow-Up Period."
