            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the overall performance and patient outcomes of two video-assisted laryngeal mask airways (VLMAs) devices called Safe and Comfortable (SaCo) VLM and SafeLM\u00ae (Safe VLM) versus video laryngoscopy for airway management in adult patients, without an anticipated difficult airway, that are undergoing elective general anesthesia procedures.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is: Can both VLMAs improve patient-centered outcomes in the perioperative and postoperative periods in comparison to endotracheal tube (ETT) intubation? Thirty participants will undergo randomized VLMA with either the Safe VLM (15 participants) or the SaCo VLM (15 participants). And 15 participants will be intubated with ETT using video laryngoscopy, as the control group. Researchers will evaluate the efficacy of these two video-assisted devices in adult patients without an anticipated difficult airway in elective general anesthesia procedures. Other patient outcomes and exploratory endpoints will be recorded as well.",
            "detailedDescription": "INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICES NAMES SaCo\u00ae (UESCOPE\u00ae 2) by UE Medical Devices, Inc SafeLM\u00ae Video Laryngeal Mask System by Magill Medical Technology Co. Ltd\n\nSTUDY RATIONALE New airway devices for anesthesiology are constantly being developed to improve patient overall safety, reduce perioperative risks and complications, enhance recovery, and prevent postoperative adverse-related outcomes. The first and second generation supraglottic airway devices (SADs) have satisfactory features which provide an effective airway and ventilation without the need for more aggressive endotracheal intubation. Nevertheless, these are inserted in a \"blind\" fashion; malpositioning and potential airway compromise occurs in 50-80% of placements.\n\nThus, direct vision-guided placement using newer third generation video laryngeal mask airways (VLMAs), can ensure optimal positioning, adequate lung ventilation, and perioperative real-time visualization of the airway. This allows for assessment and any needed corrective maneuvers if they become necessary. The two types of FDA-approved VLMAs that this study will test are: 1) the SafeLM\u00ae Video Laryngeal Mask System, which has a camera angle-adjusting handle that allows direct vision up to 140\u00b0 angle of view of the oropharynx and larynx, with a monitor that is embedded in the device; and 2) the SaCo\u00ae Video Laryngeal Mask, which has an embedded camera fixed into the shaft of the device, which attaches to an external monitor. Both devices can guide endotracheal intubation through the ventilation channel under direct vision.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated the various applications of SaCo VLM for the management of difficult airways in adult patients requiring general anesthesia. This pilot study will be a single-center randomized controlled trial of 45 healthy adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. We aim to explore the efficacy of both VLMAs and evaluate patient perioperative and postoperative outcomes; both are expected to replicate and, possibly, even improve on the outcomes from the conventional video laryngoscopy.\n\nINVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE INTENDED USE The intended use of the video-guided LMAs is to aid in optimal placement of supraglottic airway devices, which will require additional ETT intubation, in participants without anticipated difficult airways.\n\nNUMBER OF SITES One study site: Montefiore Medical Center\n\nSUBJECT POPULATION The two devices will be studied in adult patients, without an anticipated difficult airway, presenting for elective general anesthesia and airway management.\n\nNUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS Thirty participants will undergo supraglottic placement with either the SafeLM (15 participants) or the SaCo VLMAs (15 participants). Fifteen participants will be intubated with ETT via video laryngoscopy, as the control group.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of the two video-assisted supraglottic devices in elective adult patients without an anticipated difficult airway; other patient outcomes and exploratory endpoints will be recorded as well."
