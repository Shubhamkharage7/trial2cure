We will gather prospective real-world, large-scale, comprehensive data on these patients who are unable to access traditional clinical trials but are treated with MDA regimens, assigned by stage and BRAF-status.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate effect of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy on the quality of life for ATC survivors\n2. To evaluate how factors such as health insurance and lack of coverage, adherence, and other sociodemographic characteristics influences patient outcomes."
