            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to establish the safe administration of psilocybin in individuals with cocaine use disorder in terms of cardiovascular (e.g., heart rate) and subjective (e.g., mood) effects. The study's subject population consists of men and women between the ages of 21 and 55 from the Los Angeles area that meet criteria for cocaine use disorder and express an interest in ceasing cocaine use. 25 mg oral psilocybin will be administered to 10 individuals (separately) during a single laboratory visit. The laboratory visit will take place from 9 am until 3 pm within a comfortable, living room like environment. Within this study session room, participants will be accompanied by two clinicians. Participants will then consume the psilocybin capsule, and thereafter will be encouraged to lie down on a couch and introspect on the experience. At one-hour intervals following ingestion, participants will be tested briefly for changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and subjective effects. No blood draws, behavioral assessments, or neuroimaging is included in the study. Following the laboratory visit, investigators will check-in on participants remotely, after 48 hours, and 10, 50, and 90 days from the psilocybin session."
