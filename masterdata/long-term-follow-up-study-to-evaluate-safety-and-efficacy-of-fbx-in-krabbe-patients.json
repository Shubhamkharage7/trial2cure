Eligible participants will undergo clinical evaluations at prespecified intervals for at least 3 years from the last visit in the prior clinical trial (up to 5 years post-FBX-101 treatment). Overall safety and additional signs of efficacy will be collected with a series of laboratory tests, diagnostic tests, and performance surveys. Additionally, children participating in interventional trials that are terminated early will be transferred to this LTFU study and will complete any pending visits from the interventional trial before starting the clinical evaluations included in this protocol."
