CBM-I is a digital intervention designed to directly manipulate interpretation bias through repeated practice on a training task, thereby inducing cognitive changes in a relatively automatic or implicit manner. Specifically, this study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes associated with CBM-I.\n\nAdults with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) will be recruited from a treatment program for this disorder and participants will be randomly assigned to either receive: 1) up to 12 sessions of CBM-I, or or up to 12 sessions of psychoeducation as a control condition."
