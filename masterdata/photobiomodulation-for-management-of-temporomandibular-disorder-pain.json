Despite the low quality of the existing evidence, PBM has been increasingly used in other countries for the treatment of TMD. However, in the US PBM is not widely used for the treatment of TMD pain. Due to the multifactorial nature of chronic TMD pain, we propose that a multimodal PBM protocol targeting multiple pathophysiological mechanisms will be the optimal approach for PBM implementation in patients with TMD.",

Therefore, we will use three types of active probes in this investigation including, A) Single Laser 810 NM 200 mw; B) Laser Cluster of 810 NM equivalent to 1 WATT and; C) LED Cluster, 34 X 660nm at 10 mw and 35 850nm, 30mw 1390mw total. As detailed in Table 3. We propose to use these three PBM probes in concert for the treatment of TMD pain. Laser A (Single Diode Laser) is designed for isolated trigger points and superficial muscles. Laser B (Cluster Laser) is designed for a more diffuse treatment area,targeting analgesia, anti-inflammatory, and deep tissue repair. Laser C (LED Cluster) is purportedly designed for the presence of diffuse inflammation.",
