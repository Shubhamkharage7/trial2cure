Infants will be assessed at regular intervals up to 24 months of age, across a variety of childhood development to provide the first comprehensive developmental trajectories of this group. In doing so, it will contribute to the existing knowledge of CP development to assist clinicians and therapists with accurate information on prognosis and provide targeted interventions early and at the 'just-right' challenge. Where indicated, individual participants' results from this study will be used to inform their therapy. This study is intended to form part of a larger multi-site international study."
