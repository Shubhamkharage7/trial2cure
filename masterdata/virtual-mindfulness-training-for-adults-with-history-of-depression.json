            "briefSummary": "Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has shown to be an effective method of preventing relapse of an episode Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MBCT is a group program that integrates mindfulness skills training with cognitive-behavioral strategies. However, the cost of MBCT is not affordable to many families. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility and efficacy of an MBCT intervention designed to be delivered at low cost through a virtual delivery format. This study will recruit 240 participants who are in remission from depression and randomize them to an MBCT intervention group or treatment as usual (TAU) for the wait list control group. The wait list control group will complete the intervention after the MBCT intervention group. Assessment administered at pre-intervention (baseline), post-intervention for experimental group, and post-intervention for the wait list control group and follow-up for experimental group. The primary outcome is to test the efficacy of this community-based delivery in reducing depression severity and psychiatric distress in the relapse of an episode of MDD. The secondary outcomes include perceived stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, adherence to treatment plans not given as part of this study, frequency of relapse of MDD, mindfulness skills, and quality of life. This study will also examine the following potential moderators and correlates of intervention outcomes: comorbid diagnoses, life events history, and MBCT intervention adherence. Finally, the study will examine the following mediators of intervention outcome: mindfulness skills, emotion regulation skills, executive functioning skills, savoring, and positive and negative affect.",

In Phase I, Group 1 will complete the intervention and Group 2 will remain in TAU. In Phase II , Group 2 will complete the intervention and Group 1 will continue TAU. Depending on the recruitment site, TAU may consist of receiving psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or combined treatment within an academic medical center. Data collection will be completed at baseline, post-intervention for Group 1 and pre-intervention for Group 2, and after follow-up for Group 1 and post-intervention for Group 2. This design allows us to provide fair treatment for both trial arms as well as allowing for follow-up assessment of Group 1.",
