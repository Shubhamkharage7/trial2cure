            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab in treating patients with follicular lymphoma or other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which the patient has not received treatment in the past (previously untreated). Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with obinutuzumab may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab may kill more cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if treatment acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab is effective in patients with untreated, low tumor burden follicular lymphoma and other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the complete response (CR) rate for single agent acalabrutinib at the end of a single-agent run-in for patients with untreated low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (FL).\n\nII. Determine tolerability of acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab via assessment of patient-reported outcomes and conventional assessments.\n\nIII. Assess duration of response and long-term outcomes including progression-free survival.\n\nIV. Assess the impact of early treatment with this regimen on health-related quality of life.\n\nTERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the impact of treatment discontinuation in patients who have achieved a complete response at the end of the induction phase.\n\nII. To assess the safety and efficacy of acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab in other subtypes of indolent NHL.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Patients also receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 3, then on day 1 of cycles 4-8. Treatments repeat every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nFOLLOW-UP PHASE: After cycle 12, patients who are in CR are randomized to either discontinue acalabrutinib or to continue acalabrutinib monotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after cycle 12 continue acalabrutinib monotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression after cycle 12 discontinue study treatment. Patients with disease progression at any time prior to the conclusion of cycle 12 may continue study therapy if they are felt to be benefiting by the treating physician, but not past cycle 12.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for 1 year, then every 6 months until disease progression or next anti-lymphoma treatment."

Patients in the low tumor burden FL cohort may not receive corticosteroids as an anti-lymphoma therapy at any time before starting treatment\n* Prior malignancy (or any other malignancy requiring active treatment), except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the subject has been disease free for \\>= 2 years or which will not limit survival to \\< 5 years\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. Note: Subjects with controlled, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation can enroll on study if deemed appropriate by the investigator\n* Has difficulty with or is unable to swallow oral medication, or has significant gastrointestinal disease that would limit absorption of oral medication\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency (HIV) or any active significant infection (e.g., bacterial, viral, or fungal) within 14 days of cycle 1. Patients with uncomplicated viral or bacterial infections that are being managed with oral antibiotics and/or supportive care alone are eligible\n* Known history of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to study drug(s) including active product or excipient components\n* Active bleeding or history of bleeding diathesis (e.g., hemophilia or von Willebrand disease)\n* Uncontrolled AIHA (autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura)\n* Presence of a gastrointestinal ulcer diagnosed by endoscopy within 3 months before screening\n* Requires treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor/inducer\n* Requires or receiving anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists\n* Requires treatment with proton pump inhibitors (e.g, omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, or pantoprazole). Note: Subjects receiving proton pump inhibitors who switch to H2-receptor antagonists or antacids are eligible for enrollment to this study\n* History of significant cerebrovascular disease/event, including stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, within 6 months before the first dose of study drug. Patients with a transient ischemic attack which has resolved and for which there are no ongoing symptoms are eligible\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days of first dose of study drug (not including a diagnostic procedure to make the lymphoma diagnosis). Note: If a subject had major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from any toxicity and/or complications from the intervention before the first dose of study drug\n* Hepatitis B or C serologic status: subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and must be willing to undergo deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) PCR testing during the study to be eligible. Those who are HBsAg positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result to be eligible and have completed appropriate anti-viral treatment. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded. Anti-viral therapy for patients with hepatitis-C associated marginal zone lymphoma will not be considered a prior anti-lymphoma treatment\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\< 1,000/mcL\n* Platelet count \\< 50,000/mcL (Unless felt to be related to underlying disease)\n* Total bilirubin \\>= 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN).
