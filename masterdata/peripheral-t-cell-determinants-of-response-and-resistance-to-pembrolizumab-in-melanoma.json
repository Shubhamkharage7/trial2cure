These systemic tumor directed T cells can be defined by tumor/blood small conditional RNA (scRNA) using T cell receptor (TCR) as a barcode and can help predict response to PD-1 therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective:\n\nTo understand how the systemic immune profile (T cell activation and expansion in TME) changes in response to pembrolizumab therapy in patients with advanced melanoma on pembrolizumab monotherapy.\n\nExploratory Objectives :\n\nI. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with the objective response rate (ORR) at 24 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma on pembrolizumab monotherapy.\n\nII. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced melanoma on pembrolizumab monotherapy.\n\nIII. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma on pembrolizumab monotherapy.\n\nIV. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with toxicity profile. V. Transcriptional and phenotypic features of tumor directed T cells in blood using a combination of phenotypic markers derived from COMET and cite-seq.\n\nPatients will be followed for 6 months from time of treatment initiation. After 6 months, patients do not need to be followed but standard of care scans and survival status can be assessed for up to 5 years."
