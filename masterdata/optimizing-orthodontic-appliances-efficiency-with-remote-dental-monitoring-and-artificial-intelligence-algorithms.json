            "briefSummary": "The decision on aligner changing is based on orthodontists' personal experience and common knowledge that an approximated time span for the aligner have exhausted its biological efficacy. However, a one size fits all approach is not always ideal, as an average determined time is not taken into account of a patient's individual biological response. The aligners could be progressed earlier than the determined time, or they may stay inactive for a while, waiting for the in-office visit. Dental MonitoringTM is the only available technology that provides 3D monitoring of teeth movement, reconstructs 3D digital models remotely, and auto-detect clinical situations by their patented AI algorithms. The investigators have reported high accuracy of DMTM to monitor the tooth movement in vitro. However, the efficacy of DMTM on orthodontic treatment and the accuracy of DMTM in the orthodontic patients has not been investigated yet. In this proposal, the investigators are implementing the Dental MonitoringTM application and 3D tracking of tooth movement powered by AI algorisms as a novel tool to customize aligner changing intervals. The ultimate goal is to reduce in-office visits and treatment duration while maintaining regular monitoring, thus not jeopardizing expected results. It is imperative to investigate the Teledentistry for its effectiveness, reliability, ease of use, patient satisfaction, and value on the overall health and oral health system, especially as a critical tool during public health emergency situations.",
            "detailedDescription": "Specific Aims\n\nClear Aligners:\n\nTo evaluate the effects of implementing Remote Dental Monitoring in orthodontic treatment with clear Aligners. The outcome measures are treatment effectiveness, rate of aligner changing, number of refinements (ratio of added Aligners/planned Aligners- need for midcourse correction), number of appointments, Cost-effectiveness, and patient satisfaction.\n\nHypothesis 1: Remote Dental Monitoring provides a viable option for continuing good quality of care without compromising the treatment outcome and satisfaction. There are no differences in treatment quality, value, effectiveness, and safety between Remote Dental Monitoring and in-office treatment approaches.\n\nHypothesis 2: Remote Dental Monitoring can guide the rate of aligner replacement and optimize the treatment.\n\nHypothesis 3: Remote Dental Monitoring can Improve patient compliance and motivate patients' oral hygiene maintenance"
