            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of evidence-based Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among adult patients who screen positive to one or more risky alcohol or substance use behaviors while seeking care at a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) clinic.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does SBIRT impact patients' alcohol and substance use, SRH, mental health, physical health, quality of life, and wellbeing?\n* Does SBIRT effectiveness differ by ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, gender, and urbanicity?\n* Does SBIRT effectiveness differ by delivery mode (in-person vs. telemedicine)?\n\nParticipants will receive in-person SBIRT, telemedicine SBIRT, or usual care. Participants will complete surveys at interviews at baseline, 30 days, and 3 months.\n\nResearchers will compare patients who received SBIRT to patients who receive usual care to see if patients who receive the SBIRT intervention have a greater reduction in negative outcomes as compared to those who receive usual care. In this setting, usual care consists of basic quantity and frequency questions asked inconsistently as part of the admission process and varying by provider, with no standardized approach to screening, treatment, follow-up, or referral.",
            "detailedDescription": "Risky alcohol and drug use are associated with severe, negative, and long-term health outcomes and disparities, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), among reproductive aged people in the United States. High rates and sequelae of alcohol and drug use disproportionately experienced by structurally marginalized groups shape lifelong health inequities for people of racial/ethnic minority, living in poverty, and residing in under-resourced and under-served communities. Among populations at risk of pregnancy-related sequelae (predominantly those self-identifying as women and thus this study's primary focus), harmful alcohol and substance use and alcohol use disorders (AUDs)/substance use disorders (SUDs) contribute to condom and contraceptive nonuse among those not intending pregnancy, sex while intoxicated, non-consensual sex, violence/rape, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, and maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.\n\nFamily planning (FP) clinics are uniquely well-suited but entirely untapped sites for implementing and scaling integrated alcohol/substance use services. Largely community-based health centers that are publicly funded and/or serve Medicaid enrollees, FP clinics are a trusted care source and primary access point for reproductive aged women, and a safety net for the most socially disadvantaged groups. Yet few, if any, studies have rigorously evaluated interventions or implementation strategies to accelerate the uptake of alcohol/substance services in FP contexts. In obstetrics and HIV, widespread adoption of evidence-based SBIRT (screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment) is precluded by multi-level barriers; data on specific challenges faced by FP providers are lacking. Virtually nothing is known about telemedicine, which has been rolled out for contraception and other routine visits during the pandemic, as a technological infrastructure for SBIRT. Whether and how the promising strategy of Implementation and Sustainment Facilitation (ISF) can bridge systems barriers and support scale up in FP settings is unknown.\n\nThe researchers propose an explanatory, sequential, mixed methods study of alcohol and drug SBIRT in an expansive FP clinic network - a novel and highly impactful setting with a national reach of a diverse and largely structurally disadvantaged population of reproductive-aged women at greatest risk for AUDs/SUDs. The researchers will conduct a randomized Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial within a large Northeastern regional affiliate and its four clinics of a national SRH care organization.\n\nResults will inform an evidence-based, innovative, stakeholder-driven FP SBIRT model in response to the high-level calls for integrated women's health care. With concrete guidance for scaling alcohol/ drug services in SRH settings nationally, findings will promote women's health equity across the U.S."

Patients who screen in the risky/harmful range then receive a brief motivational interviewing-based intervention adapted from the evidence-based Brief Negotiated Interview, lasting 5-10 minutes, which provides feedback, helps explore health risks, and motivates change. Individuals who screen in the severe category, indicating a likely AUD/SUD, also receive a brief intervention, aimed at increasing motivation to accept a referral to treatment, and requiring a more intensive approach will also receive a warm-hand off referral to specialty addiction treatment.",
