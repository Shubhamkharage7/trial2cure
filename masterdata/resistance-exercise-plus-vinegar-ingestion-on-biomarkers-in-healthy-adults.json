            "briefSummary": "Given its capacity to stimulate exercise-induced neuroplasticity at lower doses compared to aerobic exercise, resistance exercise has become the top-recommended rehabilitation approach for individuals with neurocognitive impairments. Despite a large body of evidence supporting its application in the context of cognition, little work has been done to investigate the role of resistance exercise in modifying the structure and function of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Likewise, despite a general understanding of the benefits of short chain fatty acids such as acetate for the gut-brain axis, the impact of exogenous acetic acid has not been sufficiently examined in the context of the intestinal barrier. While self-reported mood disturbance responds favorably to vinegar ingestion, it is currently unknown if these effects are also associated with changes in intestinal permeability.",
            "detailedDescription": "Existing resistance exercise interventions have produced promising outcomes indicating favorable shifts in microbial composition, intestinal barrier integrity, and serum biomarkers of inflammation. These changes appear to be particularly pronounced in individuals experiencing greater enhancements in lean mass, implying a crucial role for the hypertrophic effects of the exercise protocol. Given the current knowledge surrounding age-related cognitive decline and the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders, it seems that many of the mechanisms significantly influenced by resistance exercise could contribute to reducing the risk or, at the very least, delaying the onset of these conditions. Considering the observed neuroplastic and neuroprotective effects of resistance exercise on the brain, it is plausible to hypothesize that the mitigation of excessive intestinal permeability and subsequent neuroinflammation may further support overall brain function. Given the potential for vinegar to enhance these outcomes, investigating the combined effects of exercise and vinegar ingestion may provide valuable insights into how lifestyle interventions can effectively promote cognitive and mental health. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to assess whether the combination of resistance exercise and vinegar ingestion elicits more favorable shifts in gut barrier function, cognition, and mental health compared to resistance exercise alone. This investigation aims to demonstrate the potential efficacy of this integrated approach in fostering long-team health outcomes."
