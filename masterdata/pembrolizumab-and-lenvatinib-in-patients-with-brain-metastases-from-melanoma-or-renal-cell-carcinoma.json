            "briefSummary": "This is a phase 2, Simon's 2-stage designed study with 2 cohorts of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 experienced patients with untreated brain metastases: 1) melanoma and 2) renal cell carcinoma (RCC).",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 2, Simon's 2-stage designed study with 2 cohorts of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 experienced patients with untreated brain metastases: 1) melanoma and 2) renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the best intracranial response of combined pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with untreated brain metastases from melanoma or RCC who are anti-PD-1/PD-L1--experienced. Secondary endpoints include best overall objective response (combined intracranial and extracranial response), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of intracranial response, and rate of adverse events. Exploratory/correlative endpoints will include evaluation of pre-treatment tumor tissue (either intracranial or extracranial) for immunohistochemical markers (PDL-1, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and angiogenic factors) and genetic analysis of tumor mutations or mutational burden. Pre-treatment and on-treatment blood samples will be collected and evaluated for biomarkers of response by cytokine profiling and transcriptomic analysis.\n\nPatients must have at least one evaluable asymptomatic intracranial lesion, no smaller than 5mm and no larger than 3 cm. Patients may have prior radiation to or surgical resection of a symptomatic brain metastasis as long as at least one untreated lesion or unequivocally growing lesion is present for response assessment. Pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks will be administered in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg PO daily for up to 2 years.\n\nPatients must have received at least 2 doses of an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb at some point in their treatment course and must have unequivocal intracranial progression. Intracranial progression in patients who are anti-PD-1/PD-L1 experienced is defined as either development of a new brain lesion(s) or unequivocal progression in a previously irradiated or resected brain lesion(s) site. Patients can be deemed to have progression after discussion and group consensus of the case at tumor board. Secondary imaging assessments to confirm intracranial progression are not required.\n\nPatients who are enrolled from sites outside of the Sponsor (Yale) must have patient eligibility approved by the Sponsor.\n\nArchival tissue from extracranial and/or CNS metastases will be obtained, if available, for correlative studies. A baseline pre-treatment fresh biopsy will also be required from an accessible metastasis unless there is not an easily accessible site to biopsy or if a biopsy is determined to be unfeasible by the treating physician after discussion with the study PI. The tumor tissue will be studied retrospectively for PD-L1 expression, TIL characteristics, and other immune and angiogenic markers that may predict sensitivity to this drug combination.\n\nFirst response assessment will be performed at 6 weeks and will include MRI of the brain and CT body scans (or other clinically indicated body imaging such as MRI or PET CT) to assess systemic disease. Brain metastasis response will be determined using modified RECIST (mRECIST) 1.1 criteria, and extracranial disease response will be determined using RECIST 1.1. Responses will be confirmed with repeat imaging done at 12 weeks. Subsequent imaging will be performed at 12-week intervals thereafter and include an MRI of the brain along with body imaging, which may include CT, MRI, or PET/CT, as clinically indicated. Patients will discontinue treatment for disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal from the study, termination of study, or death. Patients may be treated beyond progression of intracranial metastases after consultation with the study PI, provided symptomatic lesions are treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgery. Dose reduction of pembrolizumab for immune-related toxicities is not permitted. Dose-reduction of lenvatinib for related toxicities is permitted.\n\nNumber of Patients:\n\nA total of up to 62 eligible patients will be enrolled (27 patients with melanoma with allowance for 3 additional patients if any are unevaluable and 29 patients with RCC with allowance for 3 additional patients if any are unevaluable). Either cohort can be stopped for futility according to Simon's two-stage design. The study will accrue for approximately 36 months and will be open for approximately 24 additional months as patients on study are followed."

Participants with \u2264Grade 2 neuropathy, rash, and/or alopecia may be eligible.\n\n   Note: If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.\n8. Has received prior CNS radiotherapy within 1 week of start of study treatment. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities and not require corticosteroids.\n9. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n10. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n    Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n11. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n12. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or is requiring active treatment.\n13. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 3 months or a documented history of clinical severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires chronic systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency with prednisone \\< 10 mg or the equivalent, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Subjects with thyroid disease or vitiligo will not be excluded from the study.\n14. Has presence of gastrointestinal condition including malabsorption, gastrointestinal anastomosis, or any other condition that might affect the absorption of lenvatinib.\n15. Has a pre-existing Grade \u22653 gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal fistula.\n16. Serious non-healing or dehiscing wound.\n17. Has radiographic evidence of major blood vessel invasion/infiltration. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.\n18. Has clinically significant hemoptysis or tumor bleeding within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n19. Has clinically significant cardiovascular disease within 6 months of the first dose of study intervention including New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, or cardiac arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic instability.\n\n    Note: Medically controlled arrhythmia is permitted.\n20.
