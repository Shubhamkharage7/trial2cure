Xerava\u2122 (eravacycline) has a broad spectrum of activity including many multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. It is not an agent used for treatment of febrile neutropenia, making eravacycline a very attractive alternative to consider in this prophylactic setting. Eravacycline has activity against MRSA, VRE, and Clostridioides dif\ufb01cile, all of which are common problems in this patient population. It also covers the majority of enteric gram-negative pathogens while also producing satisfactory tissue penetration and adequate plasma concentrations, which has classically been a concern with prior agents. Eravacycline has activity against coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which is a common catheter-related infection in leukemia and HSCT patients. The primary objective will be report the incidence of breakthrough infections during eravacycline prophylaxis for hematologic malignancy patients with prolonged neutropenia.",
