            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of M1774 when given with ZEN-3694 in treating patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer that has come back (recurrent). M1774 and ZEN-3694 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. M1774 and ZEN-3694 combined together has demonstrated to be better than either drug alone in killing ovarian tumor cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) for combination of tuvusertib (ATR inhibitor \\[M1774\\]) and BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 (BET inhibitor \\[ZEN003694\\]) in women with recurrent clear cell, endometrioid, and platinum resistant high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and clear cell and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma irrespective of ARID1A status (PART I).\n\nII. To determine safety and tolerability in ARID1A pathogenic alteration (ARID1A\\^MUTATION \\[MUT\\]) and ARID1A wildtype (ARID1A\\^WT) cohorts (ARID1A is an integral biomarker) in an expansion phase (PART II).\n\nIII. To determine change in pharmacodynamic biomarker expression of gammaH2AX (for ATR inhibition, integral biomarker) from pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor samples in ARID1A\\^MUT and ARID1A\\^WT expansion cohorts by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (PART II).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate change in pharmacodynamic biomarker expression of cmyc (for BET inhibition, integrated biomarker) from pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor samples in ARID1A\\^MUT and ARID1A\\^WT expansion cohorts by Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) (PART II).\n\nII. To evaluate change in pharmacodynamic biomarker expression of gammaH2AX (for ATR inhibition, integrated biomarker) from pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor samples in ARID1A\\^MUT and ARID1A\\^WT expansion cohorts by DSP (PART II).\n\nIII. To investigate if ARID1A protein by IHC and DSP correlates with ARID1A pathogenic alteration in pre-treatment tumor biopsy samples (PART II).\n\nIV. To estimate objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months in ARID1A pathogenic alteration and wildtype cohorts (PART II).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ZEN003694 and its active metabolite, ZEN003791, when the drug is taken alone and in combination with M1774, as well as M1774 pharmacokinetics in the combination (PART I).\n\nII. To assess if ARID1A pathogenic alteration status by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) correlates with ARID1A protein by IHC utilizing existing archival tissue and evaluate retrospectively (PART I).\n\nIII. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months and to evaluate if these correlate with ARID1A pathogenic alteration status by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and with ARID1A protein by IHC (PART I).\n\nIV. In patients with prior somatic tumor testing by Next Generation Sequencing, will obtain results and correlate molecular profiles (i.e., ARID1A pathogenic alteration, PIK3CA pathogenic alteration, C-myc amplification, ATM pathogenic alteration) with response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or CA-125 by Gynecological Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) (Rustin et al., 2011) (PART I).\n\nV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ZEN003694 and its active metabolite, ZEN003791, when the drug is taken alone and in combination with M1774, as well as M1774 pharmacokinetics in the combination (PART II).\n\nVI. To assess if there is a greater overall response by RECIST 1.1 and CA-125 by GCIG (Rustin et al. 2011) in ARID1A pathogenic alteration cohort (ARID1A\\^MUT ) compared to ARID1A wildtype (ARID1A\\^WT ) cohort (PART II).\n\nVII. To correlate pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in ARID1A\\^MUT and ARID1A\\^WT expansion cohorts at the MTD (determine if drug levels affect drug target engagement and expression (e.g., gamma \\[g\\]H2AX and MYC)) (PART II).\n\nVIII. To estimate overall survival (OS) in ARID1A pathogenic alteration versus (vs) wildtype cohorts (PART II).\n\nIX. To identify biomarkers of response we will correlate ORR and PFS with ARID1A gene alteration, ARID1A protein level (IHC and DSP), gammaH2AX (IHC and DSP), C-myc (DSP), and total (tot) ATM (DSP), and HEXIM1 by ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (Seq) in tumor biopsies (PART II).\n\nX. To explore if liquid biopsies are a good surrogate for tumor ARID1A pathogenic alteration (PART II).\n\nXI. To evaluate if ARID1A expression changes over time, we will compare ARID1A expression by NGS (gene alteration) and IHC (protein) using existing archival tumor to most recent pre-treatment biopsy samples required for PART II expansion cohort (PART II).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tuvusertib followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients receive tuvusertib and BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 orally (PO) on study. Patients in the dose-escalation phase of the trial also undergo electrocardiography (ECG) during screening, collection of blood samples on study, and x-ray, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial. Patients in the dose-expansion phase of the trial also undergo ECG during screening, biopsies during screening and on study, and x-ray, CT, or MRI, and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter study completion, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years, or until the study is terminated."

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Resolution of all toxicities of prior therapy or surgical procedures to baseline or grade 1 (except for hypothyroidism requiring medication, which must have resolved to Grade =\\< 2), alopecia, and other toxicities considered clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy as determined by the investigator).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients who have received prior ATR, ATM, CHK, BET, EZH2, and/or PI3K inhibitors.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ZEN003694 or M1774 used in study.\n* Patients taking proton pump inhibitors given decreased solubility of M1774 with increased pH. Proton pump inhibitors must be discontinued 7 days prior to initiating the trial.\n* Patients with corrected QT (QTc) over 450msec that does not correct with correction of electrolyte abnormalities or family history of long QT syndrome.\n* Patients with severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:\n\n  * No active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.\n  * Known hereditary diseases characterized by genetic defects of DNA repair mechanisms, including ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Werner syndrome, Bloom Syndrome, Fanconi anemia, xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.\n* Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and M1774 is genotoxic in in vivo nonclinical studies. Patients who discontinue breastfeeding are eligible for enrollment and may not resume breastfeeding until 1 month off treatment.\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided. If alternative is not available, the use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is permitted with careful monitoring and approval by study team. At the discretion of the provider, additional monitoring (labs, toxicity checks) may be implemented for use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic window also must be avoided white taking ZEN003694. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are Factor Xa inhibitors are discouraged given concerns for thrombocytopenia (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban) and Factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran). Low molecular weight heparin is allowed. If patients are not willing to switch to low molecular heparin, they must obtain approval by study team.\n* Serious gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months, refractory nausea and vomiting, uncontrolled diarrhea, known malabsorption, significant small bowel resection or gastric bypass surgery, use of feeding tubes, presence of drainage gastrostomy tube, other chronic gastrointestinal disease, and/or other situations that may preclude absorption of oral medications M1774 and/or ZEN003694.\n* M1774 restrictions:\n\n  * Patients who cannot discontinue drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2.\n  * Patients who cannot discontinue drugs that use hMATE1 or hMATE2-K substrates.",
