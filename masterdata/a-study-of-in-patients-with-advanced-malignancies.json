            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of NB003 which comprised of a dose escalation phase to determine the MTD or maximum administered dose (MAD), and the RP2D and a dose expansion phase to further explore the safety, PK and efficacy of NB003.\n\nThe dose escalation phase will enroll patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have progressed on or had an intolerability to imatinib and other standard of cares (SoCs) or refused other SoCs, and patients with advanced malignancies other than GIST that harbors KIT or PDGFR\u03b1 gene alterations who have relapsed or have refractory disease without an available effective therapy. The number of patients to be enrolled during the dose escalation part will vary depending on the underlining dose-toxicity curve and the number of dose levels tested prior to reaching MTD or MAD. After the MTD or MAD has been determined, based on emerging safety/PK data, one or more putative RP2D(s) will be explored in dose escalation phase with approximately 15 patients for each provisional RP2D(s) to establish the RP2D for dose expansion phase. This step will be regarded as RP2D confirmation part of dose escalation phase.\n\nIn the dose expansion phase, additional patients will be enrolled to further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and biological activity of NB003 in specific disease cohorts, including GIST and other malignancies harboring genomic alterations of KIT or PDGFR\u03b1. Dose expansion phase is planned to investigate NB003 at the RP2D determined from dose escalation phase."
