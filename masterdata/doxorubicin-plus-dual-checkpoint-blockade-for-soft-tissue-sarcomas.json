            "briefSummary": "This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-institution, single arm Phase II study conducted using a Simon two-stage design with an additional safety lead-in. The overall objective is to determine the efficacy of combination doxorubicin with dual checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA-4 antibody AGEN1884 and anti-PD-1 antibody AGEN2034. The investigators will estimate the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6mo) of doxorubicin plus AGEN1884/AGEN2034 in comparison to historical PFS6mo with doxorubicin monotherapy, calculated as the mean from two large randomized Phase 3 clinical trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary endpoint for the study is PFS6mo by RECIST 1.1. The sample size calculation is based on a Simon Two-Stage design with incorporation of early stopping rules for safety and futility (See section 9 for statistical considerations). The Investigators will enroll up to 35 patients on the study to obtain 28 evaluable patients for the primary endpoint. Safety of the combination will be evaluated after the first six patients complete the DLT observation period of 9 weeks. This lengthy DLT period is designed to capture safety and toxicity profile, understanding that immune-related toxicities from checkpoint inhibitors may not emerge immediately. This will also ensure adequate evaluation of potential cardiac and hepatic toxicity from combination doxorubicin and checkpoint inhibitor therapy. If two or more patients experience DLT in the initial safety lead-in cohort, the regimen will be declared intolerable. Any patients who do not complete study therapy through the 9-week DLT observation period for any reasons other than toxicity will be replaced for safety lead-in assessment. If fewer than two patients experience DLT, the investigators will proceed to expansion to complete enrollment of 15 patients in Stage 1. Following enrollment of stage one, accrual will pause for analysis of efficacy. If 6 or fewer of the 15 patients are progression-free at 6 months, the investigators will halt the study for futility. If 7 or more patients are free from progression, then the investigators will proceed with enrollment of 13 additional patients to complete stage 2. the investigators are powered to detect improvement in 6-month PFS rate to 63.4% with the combination over the 43.4% historical PFS6mo."

Subjects with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n6. Additional known malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer.\n7.

This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability. Patients without a known history of brain metastases do not require screening brain MRI prior to study enrollment.\n11. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n13. Any uncontrolled, intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia\n14. Prolonged QTc interval on Screening EKG \\>475 ms.\n15. Ejection Fraction \\<50% by 2D ECHO at Screening.\n16.

Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n18.
