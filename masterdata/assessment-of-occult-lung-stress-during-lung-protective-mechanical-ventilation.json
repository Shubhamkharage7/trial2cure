During ventilation, an esophageal catheter will be used to measure the esophageal pressure, which estimates pleural pressure at the level of the catheter. The esophageal catheter's position will be confirmed by a chest radiograph once inserted. The ventilator settings may be changed to see if these ventilator adjustments can reduce potential lung stress in ARDS patients. There is no set criteria for adjusting the ventilator settings based on the study device, but the goal would be to adjust the volume until the inspiratory effort measured by the catheter disappears so as to protect the patient. A one-to-two-hour study session will be performed for data collection. The esophageal catheter will be removed at the end of the study session or can be left in place for use as a feeding tube if needed for patient care.",
