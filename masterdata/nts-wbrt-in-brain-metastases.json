Masking will be applied sufficient to determine the ear responsible for each value. The results of this testing will be used to determine the sensorineural hearing level. If significant conductive loss is found, bone conduction threshold will be used to report sensory ototoxicity. Threshold effects across frequency will be combined into a Pure Tone Average (PTA), defined as the average of audiometric thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000.

The vibration produces a nearly inaudible sound that echoes back into the middle ear. The results are either present or absent. Present OAEs are consistent with normal to near normal hearing. Absent OAEs may be a sign of a problem related to study treatment.",
