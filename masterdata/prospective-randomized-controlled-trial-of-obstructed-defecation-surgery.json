            "briefSummary": "Obstructive defecatory syndrome (ODS) or inability to completely empty bowel is characterized by a combination of straining, incomplete evacuation, and the use of digital manipulation with bowel movement. This is a common condition with estimated incidence of 15-20% in the adult female population.\n\nLaparoscopic abdominal ventral rectopexy is an established surgical technique aimed at restoring rectal support in women with this condition. It is the most common surgery used nowadays to treat ODS. Transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy, is an innovative procedure which has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of stool entrapment. Currently it is unknown whether one of the procedures mentioned is superior to the other regarding surgical outcomes and patient experience. The purpose of this research is to compare the outcomes of these two procedures considering their efficacy to improve symptoms.\n\nDuring the study, participants will be randomized to undergo one of two procedures for treatment of inability to completely empty their bowel and/or rectal prolapse: 1) laparoscopic abdominal ventral rectopexy; 2) transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy. Following the procedure, participants will be asked to return to the office for a follow-up visit 2-weeks, 2-, 12- and 24-months after the surgery. During each follow-up visit participants will undergo symptom evaluation, pelvic exam and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound to evaluate surgical success."
