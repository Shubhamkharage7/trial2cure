Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease.\n* For female subjects, is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant\n* For male subjects, is planning to father a child within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit, during study treatment and through 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab\n* For patients of childbearing potential, is unwilling to use acceptable method(s) of effective contraception during study treatment and through 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.\n\n(Women not of childbearing potential are defined as: post-menopausal \\[age \\> 55 years with cessation of menses for 12 or more months or less than 55 years but not spontaneous menses for at least 2 years or less than 55 years and spontaneous menses within the past 1 year, but currently amenorrhoeic (e.g., spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy), and with postmenopausal gonadotropin levels (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels \\> 40 IU/L) or postmenopausal estradiol levels (\\< 5 ng/dL) or according to the definition of \"postmenopausal range\" for the laboratory involved\\] or who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.)\n\n* Underwent prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological cancer therapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or major surgery within 14 days prior to study Day 1 or has not recovered (i.e., to CTCAE \\</= grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to previously administered therapy. Patients with \\</= grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia are an exception and may qualify for the study.
