            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nA number of diseases can cause a type of lung injury called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Most people who develop PAH do not survive more than a few years. A new study drug (ZMA001) may help. ZMA001 is a monoclonal antibody. This type of drug consists of proteins, made in a facility, that are very similar to proteins in a human body. But before giving ZMA001 to people sick with PAH, researchers want to find out how the drug affects healthy people.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a drug (ZMA001) in healthy volunteers.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy adults aged 18 to 60 years.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. They will have a urine test for drug use. They will have a test of their heart function.\n\nParticipants will come to the clinic for 1 inpatient visit of up to 48 hours.\n\nZMA001 is a liquid administered through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm. Participants will receive this drug only once, during their inpatient stay. Some participants will receive the drug; others will receive a placebo. A placebo is a treatment that looks just like the real drug but contains no medicine. Participants will not know which treatment they are getting.\n\nAfter a screening visit, participants will have 1 inpatient visit and up to 6 outpatient visits over 16 weeks after receiving the treatment. Blood draws and other tests will be repeated. Each outpatient visit is approximately 2 hours long.\n\nThis study is the first time ZMA001 will be administered to people.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nZMA001 is a fully human, monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that inhibits migration of activated monocytes and macrophages and reduces pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary artery pressure in pre-clinical rodent models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The current first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study will determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ZMA001 in healthy subjects.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: Safety and tolerability of ZMA001 in healthy subjects\n\nSecondary Objectives: Determine the pharmacokinetics of ZMA001 in healthy subjects following a single, intravenous dose\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: The number of all-cause, treatment-emergent adverse events, grade 1 and above (following CTCAE v5.0 criteria) through day 113\n\nSecondary Endpoints: For each ZMA001 dose level (1.5, 5, 12 and 20 mg/kg), the following will be determined \\[Timeframe: Pre-infusion, end of infusion, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48h; Days 8, 29, 57, 85 and 113\\]:\n\n1.

Any vaccination within the past 4 weeks or receipt of a live-attenuated vaccine within the past 6 months\n8. Use of tobacco products within the past 3 months\n9. Recreational drug use within the past 6 months or positive urine drug screen at Screening Visit\n10. History of alcohol abuse within the past 2 years\n11. Current clinically significant medical illness that is uncontrolled despite appropriate medical treatment including (but not limited to) hematologic, oncologic, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, infectious, hepatic, dermatologic, psychiatric, neurologic, autoimmune or allergic disease\n12. Body mass index less than 17 or greater than 32 kg/m\\^2\n13. Clinically significant abnormal results on clinical blood testing completed at the Screening Visit\n14.
