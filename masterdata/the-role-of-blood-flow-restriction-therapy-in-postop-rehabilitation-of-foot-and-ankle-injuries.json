            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to determine the role of blood flow restriction (BFR) + neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in improving post-operative physical therapy and recovery after ankle fracture surgery. We expect to see improved muscle strength, less muscle wasting, and improved functional recovery after surgery when making these additions to routine post-operative (postop) physical therapy protocols.",
            "detailedDescription": "Few studies have examined BFR in patients sustaining operative foot and ankle injuries. Due to the weight bearing limitations and prolonged immobilization following these injuries, patients often experience increased time away from work and delays with return to sport. These factors are responsible for the rapid muscle atrophy that occurs in the immediate post injury period because of immobility and disuse. Recently, blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy has been shown to be effective in improving muscle strength and preventing atrophy when combined with low load resistance training physical therapy programs.7,8 Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is an adjunctive agent that has been show to augment the effects of BFR alone.4 The null hypothesis is that a 2 week BFR + NMES + low load resistance training program in patients age \\>= 18 recovering from foot and ankle surgery will have no effect on short term (2 weeks postop) lower extremity muscle hypertrophy or atrophy, patient pain and satisfaction, or functional recovery after foot and ankle surgery."
