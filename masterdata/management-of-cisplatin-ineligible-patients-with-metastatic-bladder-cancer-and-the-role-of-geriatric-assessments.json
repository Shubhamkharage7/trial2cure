In this study, investigators are assessing the role of the survey, the Geriatric-8, and its ability to predict outcomes in older participants undergoing cancer treatments. Additionally, investigators are evaluating the differential impact of treatments on quality of life in an older and at risk population.",

Investigators are specifically assessing the impact on adverse events, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. Additionally, investigators are assessing the role of the survey, the Geriatric-8, and its ability to predict outcomes in older participants.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and completing questionnaires.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for up to 8 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 180 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network and EMD Serono are supporting this research study by providing the necessary funds."
