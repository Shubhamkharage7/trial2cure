Participants will take one of three approaches:\n\n* Yoga classes\n* Educational sessions on the causes and impacts of CIPN, how yoga may help with CIPN, and how different therapies may help with CIPN\n* Usual care with standard-of-care medications for CIPN\n\nThe researchers will compare how these different approaches affect participants' balance, their risk of falls, and their quality of life. This study will also measure how much yoga can help the reduced sense of touch caused by CIPN.\n\nThe functional assessments TUG and CTS can be safely completed either virtually and in-person and will be mandatory for all patients. The functional assessment FRT and QST assessments that can only be completed in-person are optional at these time points."
