Subjects will be enrolled into 1 of 5 cohorts. Each cohort will enroll approximately 5-10 subjects with at least 1 eligible lesion to be treated. A maximum of 5 lesions may be enrolled per subject. Treatment for all subjects and all lesions will be twice daily for approximately 28 days. Post treatment, residual lesions may be excised per standard of care for histological evaluation. The duration of the study is estimated to be approximately up to 12 weeks from the beginning of the Screening period until the last subject's last visit."
