AP technology is a system of devices that closely mimics the glucose-regulating function of a healthy human pancreas. It includes an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). In this study, the investigators will research whether improvements in blood glucose levels and blood glucose variability will in turn decrease biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction while improving cardiovascular function.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cardiovascular disease is a type of disease that affects the heart and blood vessels. The current care for cardiovascular disease prevention in people with type 1 diabetes is to manage blood pressure, cholesterol blood levels, or manage blood glucose levels.\n\nThis study will examine the potential cardiovascular effect(s) of artificial pancreas (AP) technology in patients with type 1 diabetes. AP technology is a system of devices that closely mimics the glucose-regulating function of a healthy human pancreas. It includes an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). In this study, we will use the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Tandem t:slim insulin pump with Control-IQ Technology and the FDA approved Dexcom G6 CGM. This study will research whether improvements in blood glucose metrics lead to reductions in some of the cardiovascular biomarkers that represent harmful effects in people with type 1 diabetes. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups for 12 weeks---Group 1 will be treated with AP Technology and Group 2 will wear the study CGM and continue to use their current diabetes management strategy (i.e., standard care)."

Access to internet and willingness to upload data during the study as needed, including data generated prior to the start of the study\n12. Current use of a glucometer that is downloadable; or willingness to use a study glucometer\n13. Investigator has confidence that the participant can successfully operate all study devices and is capable of adhering to the protocol\n14. Willingness to use personal lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) and to use no other insulin besides lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) during the study\n15.

Prior diagnosis of cardiac disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure)\n4. Cerebrovascular accident in the 12 months prior to enrollment\n5. Uncontrolled resting arterial hypertension\n6. Conditions that would make use of a CGM difficult (e.g., blindness, severe arthritis, immobility)\n7. Current use of oral/inhaled glucocorticoids or other medications, which in the judgment of the investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the study\n8. Concurrent use of any non-insulin glucose-lowering agent (including metformin, GLP-1 agonists, pramlintide, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and/or sulfonylureas)\n9. Hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder\n10. Currently being treated for a seizure disorder\n11. A medical condition or medication, which in the opinion of the investigator or designee, would put the participant or study at risk\n12. Any woman with hemoglobin (Hgb) \\<11 g/dL or any man with Hgb \\<12 g/dL on screening laboratory evaluation (i.e., complete blood count)\n13. Current smokers or those who have quit smoking \\<2 years ago\n14. Screening Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings indicative of arrhythmia, sinus node disease, or ischemic heart disease\n15.
