Pregnancy, delivery, and maternal and infant outcomes to 12 months post-delivery will be examined and compared with a cohort treated with buprenorphine/naloxone.",
            "detailedDescription": "Fifty pregnant women stabilized pre-pregnancy on oral or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and 50 comparison women on buprenorphine/naloxone (BPH) from Boston Medical Center and the University of North Carolina will be enrolled in this multi-center prospective comparative cohort study. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Safety and Efficacy: To compare maternal outcomes (safety, relapse, retention in care), fetal outcomes (growth, fetal distress), and infant outcomes (neonatal abstinence syndrome, growth, neurodevelopment) during pregnancy until 12 months post- delivery; An exploratory part of this aim is to collect safety and efficacy data on women receiving NTX for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We will collect maternal, fetal and infant outcomes related to prenatal alcohol exposure. 2) Pharmacokinetics: To determine the pharmacokinetics of NTX in pregnant and postpartum women; 3) Genetics and Epigenetics: To examine the association between genetic variants and epigenetic modification in the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene, as well as global DNA methylation changes after treatment with NTX and BPH within the mother, placenta, and infant; and 4) Breast milk: To measure breast milk concentrations of NTX and corresponding infant relative dose to determine safety for lactating women."

Measurements are performed every 4 hours, typically with 2-3 consecutive scores that are equal to or greater than 8, or 1-2 scores of 12 or greater, pharmacologic treatment for withdrawal is started. For the ESC assessment, clinicians assess whether or not the infant has poor feeding, is unable to sleep for at least 1 hour after feeding, and is consolable (rating of 1-3) due to symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
