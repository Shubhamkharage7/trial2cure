It will include 144 older adults with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment and their caregiver/administrator who will be trained to lead the remote, home-based brain stimulation. Participants will be randomized into one of four conditions, a) active combination of tACS + tDCS, b) combination of active tACS + sham tDCS, c) combination of sham tACS + active tDCS, and d) combination of sham tACS + sham tDCS. Participants will engage in a set of pre-intervention assessments, the brain stimulation intervention--consisting of 20, once-daily 30-min stimulation sessions administered over a 4-week period, and a set of post-intervention assessments (immediately following brain stimulation, 3 months post-brain stimulation, and 6 months post-brain stimulation). This project is expected to demonstrate that tACS and tDCS can be combined to optimize the functional impact of a home-based tES intervention for older adults with mild dementia."
