            "briefSummary": "Nursing homes are ground zero for the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing homes are ill-equipped for the pandemic; though facilities are required to have infection control staff, only 3% have taken a basic infection control course. Significant research has focused on infection control in the acute care setting. However, little is known about the implementation of practices and effective interventions in long-term care facilities.The investigators propose an intervention utilizing Project ECHO, an evidence-based telehealth model, to connect Penn State University experts with remote nursing home staff and administrators to proactively support evidence-based infection control guideline implementation. Our study seeks to answer the critical research question of how evidence-based infection control guidelines can be implemented effectively in nursing homes",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will recruit 200 nursing homes with approximately 24,560 residents from across the United States through collaborations with our stakeholders. Nursing homes will be randomized to one of two arms: 1) AHRQ-funded COVID-19 ECHO that includes 16 weekly telehealth sessions addressing COVID-19 guidelines and best practices or 2) AHRQ-funded COVID-19 ECHO plus an additional 9 sessions with a focus on CDC infection control training. Randomization will be stratified by characteristics of nursing homes to ensure balance among the two trial groups, including size (number of beds),geographic location, and current COVID-19 infection rate. Patient-centered outcomes (nursing home residents with COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and QOL) will be assessed at baseline, 4, 6, 12, and 18 months. Our study is guided by the RE-AIM framework to critically evaluate both effectiveness and implementation outcomes of the proposed intervention. The RE-AIM framework is frequently utilized to improve sustainable adoption and implementation of effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions like Project ECHO."
