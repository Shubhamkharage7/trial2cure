            "briefSummary": "The objective of the proposed study is to scale social risk factor screening and referral for cancer survivors and to solidify information exchange between clinical and community settings in order to improve survivor health and well-being. This will be completed through three primary aims: 1) To ascertain workflow and map community resources needed to facilitate social risk factor screening and referral for breast and prostate cancer survivors in Washington, District of Columbia. 2) To determine impact of Community Health Worker (CHW) support on Black breast and prostate cancer survivor health and wellbeing as measured through quality of life (QOL) and social connection. 3) To determine impact of anti-racism training for staff and clinicians at three cancer centers on patient-reported discrimination.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite improvements in cancer outcomes over time, significant disparities remain between Black and White cancer survivors. It is estimated that clinical care, including access to care and quality of care, accounts for an estimated 20% of health outcomes, while other factors, including social determinants of health (SDoH) and an individual's social risk factors, explain 80% of health outcomes. The goal of this research is thus to simultaneously target unequitable health care systems and accelerate the evidence base for scalable social determinants of health screening and referral to reduce inequities in cancer survivor health and well-being. This project is intended to establish sustainable clinical-community linkages and improve survivor health and well-being. Understanding the burden of social needs in this population, the available community resources, and solidifying integrated, closed-loop referral systems to address those needs is critical to improving quality of life for cancer survivors. The long-term goal of this research is to develop scalable interventions to address social needs and support for cancer survivors.\n\nThe study aims to: 1) improve care coordination and information exchange through mapping available resources for cancer survivors across Washington DC and building a universal screening and referral process at three cancer centers in DC; 2) determine impact of Community Health Worker (CHWs) support on cancer survivor health and wellbeing as measured through social connection and quality of life; 3) determine impact of anti-racism (inclusive of SDOH) training for staff and clinicians at three cancer centers on provider cultural competency and patient reported perceived discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, this work evaluates the implementation, impact, and causal mechanisms of SDOH collection and referral to reduce racial inequities among cancer survivors. The investigators include innovative approaches to linking clinics and communities drawing on systems engineering and social network analyses and supported by ongoing DC efforts to bolster health information exchange systems to address social needs. Our approach is also integrated with existing community resources including key community-based organizations in the Washington DC region.\n\nResults from this study will provide the foundation for future research examining the intervention's generalizability to other marginalized cancer survivors and sustainability of the proposed screening and referral system. Findings will also provide a basis for further research on community health workers to support our target population, to improve shared resources in supporting cancer survivors, and to maintain relevance within the evolving health information exchange environment."
