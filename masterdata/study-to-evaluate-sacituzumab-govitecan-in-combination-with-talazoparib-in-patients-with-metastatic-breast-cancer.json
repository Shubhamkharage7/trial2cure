            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. You are being asked to participate in the Phase I portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sacituzumab govitecan as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe FDA has not approved talazoparib for this specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses in breast cancer.\n\nSacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate which means it's made up of an antibody attached to an anticancer drug. An antibody is a protein normally made by the immune system (the system in the body that fights off diseases). Sacituzumab govitecan is believed to work by binding the antibody portion of the drug to the tumor(s) while the anticancer drug portion works to prevent the cancer cells from growing/spreading.\n\nTalazoparib belongs to a group of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP is a protein that is involved with repairing damaged DNA (the genetic material of cells). Talazoparib is believed to work by inhibiting (stopping) the PARP proteins from working in the cancer cells so that the cancer cannot fix its damaged DNA.\n\nThe investigators believe that the combination of sacituzumab govitecan and talazoparib may help stop the cancer from growing and spreading by administering an anticancer drug directly to the cancerous tumor(s) through sacituzumab govitecan and by stopping the cancer's cells from fixing its damaged DNA through talazoparib."

Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of study medications is not established in pregnant women.\n* Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, or fertile men, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and after study drug discontinuation (till 8 weeks in women and six months in males, post-study). Male patient should not donate sperm while on treatment and up to 6 months after last dose. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:\n\n  * Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n  * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\n  * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate \\<1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n  * In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.",
