The overall objective of this study is to investigate whether the use of specific spinal cord epidural stimulation will affect bowel function. This study will also examine how alterations in bowel function influence quality of life outcomes. The results of this study may aid in the development of treatments to help individuals with spinal cord injuries that have impaired bowel function.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants in this study must be enrolled in the TS - EPI study (IRB# 16.0179) which provides the spinal cord epidural implant and training interventions. You will receive two sets of interventions, each one lasting 80 sessions for a total of 160 sessions. Assessments for bowel function and quality of life will be performed as part of this study and are conducted at baseline/pre-training, post-Intervention 1, post-Intervention 2, and at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Your participation in this study will last up to 24 months."
