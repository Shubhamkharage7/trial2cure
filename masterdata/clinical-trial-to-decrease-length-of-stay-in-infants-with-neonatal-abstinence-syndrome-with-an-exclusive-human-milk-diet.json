Parents who decline participation for their infants in the study will be asked to consent to data gathering on their infants who will be treated and fed per institutional practice. The data on these individuals will be summarized and evaluated descriptively in comparison with the actual trial results.\n\nAll experimental group participants will receive exclusive maternal human milk or donor human milk prior to randomization. Once randomized, patients in Group One will receive an exclusive human milk diet throughout the 28-day feeding period or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Patients in Group Two (Control Group) will receive maternal human milk or formula (per standard of care). Fortification will be implemented with a standard protocol."
