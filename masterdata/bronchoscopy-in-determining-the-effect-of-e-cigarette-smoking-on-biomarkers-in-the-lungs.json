Studying samples of lung cells from participants who smoke e-cigarettes may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid and identify biomarkers related to cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess inflammatory changes over 10 weeks for lung and urine biomarkers in smokers who undergo serial bronchoscopy. The randomized trial includes four conditions: continued use (n=32), complete switching to the nicotine standardized research electronic cigarettes (e-cig) (SREC) (n=32), complete switching to the placebo (nicotine free) SREC (n=32), and complete switching to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)(n=32).\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. Participants continue to smoke their usual brand of cigarettes. Participants undergo a second bronchoscopy on day 71.\n\nGROUP II: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. After the baseline bronchoscopy, participants learn to use the SREC with nicotine for 2 weeks and switch completely to the SREC with nicotine for 2 weeks and switch completely to the SREC with nicotine starting day 15 for 8 weeks. Participants undergo a second bronchoscopy on day 71.\n\nGROUP III: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. After the baseline bronchoscopy, participants learn to use the SREC without nicotine for 2 weeks and switch completely to the SREC without nicotine starting day 15 for 8 weeks. Participants will be offered varenicline to aid cessation. Participants undergo a second bronchoscopy on day 71.\n\nGROUP IV: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. Beginning 1 week before the day 15 quit date, participants stop smoking using NRT comprising either patch, gum, or lozenge for 8 weeks. Participants undergo a second bronchoscopy on day 71.\n\nAfter completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months."

The omics (miRNA, mRNA, and metabolomics) analysis and visualization of the data will be performed in the R statistical language. Data will be log2-transformed and normalized using either quantile normalization for gene expression (miRNA and mRNA) or normalization for metabolomics. Unsupervised clustering analysis, including PCA and hierarchical clustering will be performed to visualize natural clusters in the dataset and evaluate data quality.",
