History of systemic corticosteroids (e.g. an equivalent dose of prednisone of \\> 20 mg daily for \\> 14 days), immunosuppressive anti-cancer, interleukins, systemic interferons, systemic chemotherapy or other medications considered significant by the trial physician within the last 6 months.\n3. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition (e.g. such as autoimmune diseases, cirrhosis), other than HIV infection, that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation.\n4.
