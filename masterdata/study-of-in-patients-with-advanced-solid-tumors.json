The second phase will include a dose expansion using the best dose selected from the first phase of the study. Multiple cohorts will be opened with eligible patients having selected solid tumors (monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab)."

Short-term administration of systemic steroids (eg, for allergic reactions or the management of irAEs) is allowed. Note: Patients receiving bisphosphonate or denosumab are eligible, provided treatment was initiated at least 14 days before the first dose of DF9001.\n5. Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated in this study within the last 3 years. Exceptions (eg, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or cervical carcinoma in situ) can be considered on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the Medical Monitor.\n6. Life expectancy of less than 6 months.\n7. Receipt of any organ transplantation, including autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.\n8. Significant acute or chronic infections (including historic positive test for human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\], or active or latent hepatitis B or active hepatitis C tested during the screening window). If HBsAg is negative and the anti-hepatitis B core antibody is positive, then hepatitis B viral DNA load must be undetectable.\n9. Preexisting autoimmune disease (except for patients with vitiligo) needing treatment with systemic immunosuppressive agents for more than 28 days within the last 3 years, or clinically relevant immunodeficiencies (eg, dysgammaglobulinemia or congenital immunodeficiencies). Patients with a history of immune-related endocrinopathies (eg, hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes mellitus \\[TIDM\\], and adrenal insufficiency) that are stable on hormone replacement therapy may be eligible for this study.\n10. Patients with a known medical history that may place them at risk of known toxicities of EGFR blockade.\n\n    1. History of or ongoing keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, or corneal perforation.\n    2. History of cardiopulmonary arrest unless this was caused by an acute, reversible etiology that is no longer present.\n    3. History of or ongoing pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease.\n11. Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to mAbs (\u2265 Grade 3 of the NCI-CTCAE v5.0), any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma (ie, 3 or more features of partly controlled asthma).\n12. Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy \\>Grade 1 NCI-CTCAE v5.0; however, alopecia \u2264Grade 2, endocrinopathies \u2264Grade 2, and sensory neuropathy \u2264 Grade 2 is acceptable.\n13. Patients who have received an anti-PD-(L)1 as a previous line of therapy that have experienced either of the following:\n\n    1. a Grade 3 or Grade 4 drug-related toxicity.\n    2. a Grade 2 drug-related toxicity that impacted either the lungs, cardiac, or the nervous system, caused by the administration of the anti-PD-(L)1.\n14. Received any prior immunotherapy and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher irAE (except endocrine disorders that can be treated with replacement therapy) or was discontinued from that treatment due to Grade 2 myocarditis or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.\n15. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test (within 72 hours) prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n16. Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention. Administration of killed vaccines are allowed.\n17. Pregnancy or lactation in females during the study.\n18. Known alcohol or drug abuse.\n19. Serious cardiac illness or medical conditions, including but not limited to:\n\n    1. History of New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure or systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction \\[LVEF\\] \\<55%).\n    2. High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias (eg, tachycardia with a heart rate \\>100/min at rest).\n    3. Significant ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia) or higher-grade atrioventricular (AV) block (eg, AV-block, second degree AV block Type 2 \\[Mobitz 2\\], or third-degree AV-block).\n    4. Angina pectoris requiring anti-anginal medication.\n    5. Clinically significant valvular heart disease.\n    6. Evidence of transmural infarction on electrocardiograms (ECGs).\n    7. Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as systolic \\>160 mm Hg or diastolic \\>100 mm Hg).\n    8. Clinically relevant uncontrolled cardiac risk factors, clinically relevant pulmonary disease, or any clinically relevant medical condition in the opinion of the Investigator that may limit participation in this study.\n    9. Severe dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy.\n20.
