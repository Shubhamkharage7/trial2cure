            "briefSummary": "Ankle range of motion is an important degree of freedom for performing activities of daily living. Limited range of ankle motion has been related to Achilles tendonitis, lower limb injury, and abnormal gait leading to overuse injury. While stretching and massage can help increase range of motion the amount and frequency of manual manipulation needed to affect range of motion is not accessible to an individual in their home. A new device has been developed to allow deep stretching of the ankle and surrounding muscles to help increase ankle dorsiflexion. This device can be used in an individual's home, without assistance, allowing more frequent stretching without increased visits to physical therapy. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of using this device during a course of treatment to improve ankle dorsiflexion in individuals with decreased ankle range of motion."

The Ankle Flex device is used to stretch patients into a dorsiflexion position by securing the foot to the base of the device and the shin to the leg strap attached to the pulley system. The patients can then pull the handle of the pulley system, giving them the mechanical advantage to gently mobilize their ankle into dorsiflexion with their foot firmly secured to the base of the device. This can allow for a deeper and more controlled stretch than previous stretching methods done during at home care.",
