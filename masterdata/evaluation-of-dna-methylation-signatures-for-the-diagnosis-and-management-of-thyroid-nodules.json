The purpose of this research is to develop a new test for thyroid cancer. This test will use needle biopsies (small collections of tissue with a needle) from the thyroid to determine whether the participant has a malignant (cancer) or benign (not showing cancer) thyroid tumor. The information learned from this trial may help develop a more accurate test so that patients do not have unnecessary surgeries for nodules that are thought to be suspicious but are actually benign.",

To evaluate the effect of Diagnostic DNA Methylation Signatures (DDMS-2) results (positive predictive value \\[PPV\\], negative predictive value \\[NPV\\], sensitivity and specificity) on physician decision-making for clinical management of 800 indeterminate thyroid nodules.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine sensitivity and specificity, PPV, NPV of DDMS-2 with 1450 needle biopsies including 800 needle biopsies with indeterminate cytopathology.\n\nII. Compare the diagnostic accuracy between DDMS-2 and two currently used diagnostic approaches based on genetic alterations and gene expression within the same prospective cohort of 800 indeterminate needle biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo needle biopsy for collection of tissue samples. Tissue samples are analyzed using DDMS-2. Patients' medical records are also reviewed."
