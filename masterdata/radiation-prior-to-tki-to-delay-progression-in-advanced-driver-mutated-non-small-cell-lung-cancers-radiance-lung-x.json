            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, two-part, single-arm, phase II trial that will evaluate whether the use of definitive radiation to the primary lung lesion prolongs PFS in treatment-na\u00efve, metastatic, driver-mutated NSCLC patients who are subsequently put on a TKI. Part 1 will enroll up to 34 patients who are are treatment-na\u00efve and have metastatic NSCLC. Enrolled subjects will be given radiation doses, at the discretion of the treating physicians, that range from 24-60 Gy in 1-15 fractions with a minimum biologically effective dose (BED10) of 58 Gy.\n\nImmediately following the completion of radiation therapy, patients who have an actionable driver mutation will be eligible to continue on to Part 2 of the study; those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for Part 2 will discontinue trial participation. Twenty-nine subjects will receive a standard-of-care targeted TKI therapy. The choice of TKI will be at the discretion of the treating oncologist, provided that their decision aligns with preferred TKIs per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. While on TKI therapy, patients will be assessed every three months for disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and survival."

A subject may receive up to 2 cycles of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for NSCLC prior to trial enrollment. For example, a cycle of carboplatin and pemetrexed is given once every 3 weeks.\n7. Patient must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1.\n8. Patient must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 to 2.\n9. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.\n\nInclusion Criteria Part 2\n\n1. Must have an actionable driver mutation for which an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved and/or National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) -recommended front-line TKI is available.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Anticipated prognosis \\< 3 months.\n2. Inability to swallow oral medications or history of GI abnormality that would impair absorption of oral medications.\n3. Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy are eligible provided the investigator assesses this malignancy does not have potential to interfere with evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study treatments.\n4. Patient must not have any unresolved toxicities from prior cancer therapy greater than CTCAE grade 2 at time of study enrollment. Any grade alopecia is allowable.\n5. Patient must not have medical contraindications, as determined by treating radiation oncologist, that would preclude safe delivery of radiation therapy.\n6.
