            "briefSummary": "This pilot study will include grade IV glioma patients treated with SSRIs during approximately a 17 week study period. Changes in cognition and evaluation of psychosocial factors from baseline to after 17 weeks of treatment with SSRI study drug will be calculated.",
            "detailedDescription": "As many as 85% of glioma patients experience cognitive impairment. This is not only from direct tumor involvement, but also worsens with therapy such as cranial radiation and chemotherapy, which further degrade neuronal function. Commonly, impairments in visuospatial skills and executive function are seen. There is evidence that serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as escitalopram improve modulation and function of resting state networks, contribute to neuroplastic changes in brain regions subserving these abilities, and provide general functional support to neuronal cells. In addition to either improving cognition or preventing cognitive decline, treatment with an SSRI may also improve outcomes critical to overall survival in this vulnerable population, including functional independence, psychosocial stability, and quality of life.\n\nWe hypothesize that following treatment with escitalopram patients will experience improved cognitive and mood function over time. We will also correlate changes in mood structural MRI and electrophysiological correlates of visual pathway function. The addition of escitalopram has the potential to enhance cognitive function and hence functional independence thereby improving quality of life in these patients."

It has been validated on groups of patients with Spinal Cord Injuries, Traumatic Brain Injury and Stroke.

Results suggested good tolerance on the part of the patients and benefits of having a standardized battery that can be employed across sites.\n\nPaired t-test will be used to determine if the changes from baseline to the 17 week visit are significant.
