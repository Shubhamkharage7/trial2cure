This research study will give doctors and participants results of Galleri\u00ae blood tests which is designed to detect many types of cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures including screening for eligibility, blood draws, questionnaires, and clinic visits.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for up to 1 year.\n\nIt is expected that about 1,500 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) is funding this study."
