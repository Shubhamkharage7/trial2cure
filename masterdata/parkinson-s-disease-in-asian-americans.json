This study will serve as a first step towards developing broader community and patient education programs and active outreach campaigns to increase PD-specific literacy among Asian Americans. The results from this study will elucidate the role that language barriers, cultural perceptions, family influence, and other predisposing, enabling, or need factors have on delaying care for PD among Asian Americans. It will also provide much needed insight on how to improve inclusion of Asian Americans in PD research studies."
