            "briefSummary": "The goal of this trial is to pilot a way for orthopaedic surgeons to safely screen for depression and provide treatment for depression with medication. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. What are the outcomes of patients who screen positive for depressive symptoms and are prescribed either an Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).\n2. What are the outcomes of patients who screen positive for depressive symptoms and choose not to pursue treatment with medication?",
            "detailedDescription": "Depression is common among orthopaedic trauma patients and associated with worsened outcomes including pain, opioid consumption, patient-reported outcomes ,complications, and length of stay. Addressing depression, therefore, should lead to improved outcomes. Orthopaedic surgeons may believe treating depression is outside their scope or that they lack tools to address depressive symptoms. In fact, only 45% of surgeons report they are likely to screen patients, and only 27% are likely to refer patients for psychological treatment."
