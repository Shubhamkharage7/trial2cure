During the Dose Escalation portion of the study, different dose levels of CA-4948 in combination with FOLFOX/nivolumab will be evaluated by BOIN algorithm.\n\nDose Expansion will include Cohorts A and B. Expansion Cohort A will enroll up to 12 patients with HER2 negative gastric, GEJ, and esophageal cancer at the expansion dose of CA-4948 determined during Dose Escalation and will use the same treatment regimen of FOLFOX/nivolumab. Expansion Cohort B will investigate CA-4948 at the dose determined during Dose Escalation in combination with FOLFOX/pembrolizumab and trastuzumab in up to 12 patients with HER2 positive disease; however, the initial 6 patients will be considered safety lead-in to confirm the safety and tolerability of this combination; if determined to be safe, an additional 6 patients will be enrolled for a total of 12 in Cohort B."

Radiotherapy to the brain must be completed \\> 10 days prior to planned C1D1.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CA-4948, FOLFOX, nivolumab, trastuzumab or other agents used in the study.\n* Concomitant use of drugs with a known risk of causing prolonged QTc and/or Torsades de Pointes or a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes.\n* Presence of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis \u2265 G2\n* Administration of a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment.\n* QTc (Bazett) \\>470ms on screening EKG\n* Gastrointestinal condition which could impair absorption of CA-4948 or inability to ingest CA-4948\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to DHHS treatment guidelines is recommended. Recommend exclusion of specific ART agents based on predicted drug-drug interactions (i.e., for sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, concurrent strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir and cobicistat) or inducers (efavirenz) should be contraindicated).\n* Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, euthyroid participants with a history of Grave's disease (participants with suspected autoimmune thyroid disorders must be negative for thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin prior to first dose of study treatment), psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll after discussing with the PI.\n* Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study treatment except for adrenal replacement steroid doses \\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Note: treatment with a short course of steroids (\\< 5 days) up to 7 days prior to initiating study treatment is permitted. Inhaled intranasal, intra-articular, and topical steroid uses are permitted.\n* Patients are unwilling to adhere to the lifestyle guidance in protocol.",
