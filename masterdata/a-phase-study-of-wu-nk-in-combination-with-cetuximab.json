            "briefSummary": "This study is a Phase 1b open-label study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WU-NK-101 in combination with cetuximab in patients with advanced and/or metastatic CRC (Cohort 1), and in patients with advanced and/or metastatic SCCHN (Cohort 2). The overall study will be comprised of two phases, a Dose Escalation Phase, and a Cohort Expansion Phase.",
            "detailedDescription": "In the Dose Escalation Phase, up to 12 patients with either advanced and/or metastatic CRC or advanced and/or metastatic SCCHN will be treated with WU-NK-101, alone and in combination with cetuximab, in successive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients using a standard 3 + 3 design. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. Patients may receive up to one 8-week cycle of treatment. Each 8-week cycle is divided into two 28-day segments, (Segments A and B).\n\nDuring Segment A, only WU-NK-101 (monotherapy) will be administered. Segment A will consist of two doses of WU-NK-101 infused on Day 1 and Day 15. Patients that do not experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will proceed to Segment B.\n\nDuring Segment B, WU-NK-101 will be administered in combination with cetuximab (combination therapy). WU-NK-101 cells will be administered on Days 30 and 44. Cetuximab will be administered on Days 29 and 43 at 500 mg/m2 (FDA-approved dose).\n\nOnce the MTD/MAD is defined in the Dose Escalation Phase, up to 9 additional patients will be enrolled in 2 parallel, disease specific, expansion cohorts (Cohort 1 \\[patients with CRC\\] and Cohort 2 \\[patients with SCCHN\\]) to further characterize the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WU-NK-101 cells in combination with cetuximab. Patients will receive cetuximab dosed at 500 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 15, and WU-NK-101 on Days 2 and 16, in each 4-week cycle.\n\nAt the end of Cycle 2, patients who achieve a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) may receive up to 4 additional cycles of treatment of WU-NK-101 cells in combination with cetuximab with disease assessments on Day 28 (+/- 3 days) of each even numbered cycle, for a maximum of 6 cycles."

New progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest CT scan that have not been evaluated with bronchoscopy. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/ improving after 1 week of appropriate therapy (4 weeks for presumed or proven fungal infections).\n10. Received any investigational drugs within the 14 days or 5 half- lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of fludarabine.\n11. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of fludarabine.\n12. Severe renal impairment, defined as creatinine clearance \\<40 mL/min.\n13.
