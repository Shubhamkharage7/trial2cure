            "briefSummary": "The need for exploration of more definitive and cost effective non-arthroplasty treatments of osteoarthritis (OA) has been demonstrated by the orthopedic and health economic research.\n\nEmbolotherapy of neovessels associated with OA joints has been shown to be promising in patients with knee OA. There is a need for level one evidence drawn from randomized clinical trials to prove the safety, feasibility and efficacy of knee embolotherapy compared to standard of care.\n\nThis randomized pilot study will assign 10 patients with mild-moderate OA to undergo geniculate artery embolization plus standard of care (defined in this study as: physical therapy and oral anti-inflammatory medications, with a maximum of 1 joint injection at the time of enrollment) and 10 patients to receive only medical standard of care (also having had a maximum of 1 joint injection prior to enrollment). The goal of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary estimates of safety and efficacy of embolotherapy to provide sustained symptom control and modify disease progression in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single center, two-arm, open label, pilot study to assess feasibility and safety and obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of geniculate artery embolization in reducing pain compared to a control group undergoing conservative presurgical management. The 20 patients will be randomly divided into two groups of 10 in 1:1 allocation. One group will have embolization of the geniculate artery branches and standard of care while the other will have only the standard care. Following the completion of the 10 participants in each arm, a safety and data review will be undertaken (Visit 4 in the GAE group and Visit 2 of the SOC). The data will be assessed regarding the trends between the groups as they relate to KOOS/WOMAC pain scale, MRI / Xray evaluation of OA, and presence of inflammatory biomarkers."
