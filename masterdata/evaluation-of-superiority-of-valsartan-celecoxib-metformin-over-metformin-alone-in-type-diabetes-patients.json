To rule out latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), screening for other diabetes-related antibodies, such as insulinoma-associated protein (IA-2 and IA-2 beta), zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8), islet cell antibodies (ICA) or insulin autoantibody (IAA) will also be considered.\n3.

Poor metabolizers of Cyp450 2C9 to avoid very high concentration (Since Cytochrome 450 2C9 is responsible for the metabolism of both Valsartan and Celecoxib, patients who are known or suspected to be poor Cyp450 2C9 metabolizers based on previous history will be excluded from the study).\n12. Any of the following cardiovascular (CV)/Vascular diseases within 3 months of the enrollment visit:\n\n    1. Myocardial infarction (MI)\n    2. Cardiac surgery or revascularization (coronary artery bypass surgery, Coronary Artery Bypass Graft \\[(CABG\\]/Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)\\].\n    3.

Unstable or previously diagnosed arrhythmia\n    7. Congestive heart failure, defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV, unstable or acute heart failure and/or known left ventricular ejection fraction of \u226440%.\n    8.
