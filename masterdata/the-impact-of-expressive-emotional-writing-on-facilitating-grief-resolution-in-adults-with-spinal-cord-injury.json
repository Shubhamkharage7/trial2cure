Expressive emotional writing (EEW) provides an outlet for these individuals to explore and express feelings and emotions that arise from their losses related to limb paralysis. Using a randomized controlled trial design, the proposed project will attempt to confirm the benefits of an online coach-guided EEW program for improving psychosocial health among adults with SCI. Benefits of participating in the program will be evaluated using validated assessments to measure reduction of grief intensity and improvement in other psychosocial dimensions and social participation."
