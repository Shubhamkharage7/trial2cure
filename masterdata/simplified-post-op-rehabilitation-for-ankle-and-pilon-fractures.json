            "detailedDescription": "Ankle fractures and pilon fractures represent common injuries in orthopedics. These injuries are addressed with re-aligning the bones with surgery, and in some particular cases, they are treated closed reduction and immobilization during healing. The trauma to the ankle as a result of the injury, the prolonged immobilization in a cast or splint and the scar tissue formed during surgery often lead to post injury and post-operative stiffness. Many patients have limited ability to flex the ankle upward (dorsiflexion) following cast or splint removal for these injuries. Physical therapy and rehabilitation represent an an industry-accepted practice for alleviating stiffness and improving function. Currently there are varying studies on the benefits of manual therapy or passive stretch when compared with exercise alone. Neither a supervised exercise program such as formal physical therapy nor a home exercise regiment offer a clear benefit over the other, leading to the question of, if this process can be further simplified to use with the wooden block.\n\nThe main functional complaint of patients is \"stiffness\" or decreased range of motion is in dorsiflexion of the ankle and is cited at approximately 77% of patients following cast or splint removal. This motion is key when walking normally, descending stairs or kneeling and is important to a greater degree when walking up hills , running or rising from a chair. These activities require 10 degrees passive dorsiflexion and 20 degrees on average, respectively. The functional effects of limited ankle dorsiflexion sometimes results in the need for a shoe heel insert or additional surgical procedures to free up the scar in the front of the ankle.\n\nThis randomized control trial aims to analyze two currently-used standards of care for ankle and tibial plafond injuries, simplifying the standard post-operative physical therapy/rehabilitation regiment, which would begin a the time of rigid splint removal, when stretching and range of motion is tolerated. Weight bearing with ambulation is slowly adjusted for the weeks following this. This simplified wooden block protocol ankle exercises focus strictly on ankle dorsiflexion using a wooden block. The investigators aim of doing so is to increase compliance with the exercises and with an improved functional outcome as compared with the standard, more complex exercises and time burdensome options.\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare the standard post injury/surgery rehabilitation with this new simplified wooden block stretching protocol and analyze the simplified protocol's effectiveness verses other industry accepted exercises/therapy regiments. This study will evaluate pain scores, compliance, range of motion of the ankle and include a Lower Extremity Functionality Score survey, over the course of 3 standard post-operative visits following the subjects injury."
