            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized control group is to learn about effective treatments for college students experiencing anxiety and/or depression. The main questions this clinical trial aims to answer are: 1) Can alternative treatments decrease anxiety and/or depression among college students? 2) Can alternative treatments increase retention rates among college students experiencing anxiety and/or depression?\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: external qigong, mindfulness meditation, or psychoeducation. Researchers will compare outcomes from each group to explore treatment differences.",
            "detailedDescription": "Method/Design. This study will be a single-site, three-arm, randomized, controlled trial. College students (N=51) with elevated depression and/or anxiety will be randomized to either external qigong (EQ), mindfulness meditation (MM), or psychoeducation (PE). Each intervention will be applied for 30 minutes, once a week for three weeks in a community setting. The co-primary outcomes, depression and anxiety, and the secondary outcome, intention to persist in college, will be assessed by a blinded researcher at baseline, one-week post treatment, and one-month follow-up. Change in sense of connection during the treatment session, measured with a comprehensive battery of self-report indices, will be the primary therapeutic mechanism.\n\nAims and Objectives. The proposed project's central hypothesis is that EQ will increase students' mental health and intention to persist in college by balancing the flow of energy in their bodies. Aim 1. Examine EQ's acceptability in a sample of college students with depression and/or anxiety. Hypothesis: Student retention (i.e., attendance in both treatment sessions) and self-reported treatment acceptability will be better for EQ relative to PE. EQ and MM will demonstrate equivalent acceptability. Aim 2. Determine EQ's effect on anxiety, depression (co-primary outcomes), and intention to persist in college (secondary outcome) over time. Hypothesis: EQ will decrease depression and anxiety while increasing intention to persist in college relative to PE from baseline to one-month follow-up. The co-primary and secondary outcome scores will not differ between EQ and MM. Aim 3. Investigate EQ's immediate effect on students' sense of connection (therapeutic mechanism). Hypothesis: EQ will increase students' sense of connection relative to PE during the treatment sessions. EQ and MM will have equivalent effects on sense of connection."
