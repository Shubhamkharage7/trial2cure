NutriConnect seeks to compare the effectiveness of two produce prescription approaches on F\\&V intake and food security: credit to Rewards account (NutriConnect Credit) vs. produce box delivery (NutriConnect Delivery), while exploring implementation outcomes such as reach, sustainability, implementation, and cost.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Produce Prescription Program, as one type of Food is Medicine (FIM) initiatives, involves healthcare providers prescribing fruits and vegetables to patients often have low incomes, food insecurity, and diet-related illnesses. Previous systematic reviews have shown that these programs are associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, improved diet quality, reduced food insecurity, and better management of diet-related diseases. However, the diversity in study designs, small sample sizes, and varied intervention intensities have limited the conclusive understanding of the full effects of these programs. Despite their potential benefits, critical gaps persist, notably in identifying the most effective strategies for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients. Additionally, challenges surrounding scalability, implementation, and sustainability hinder the widespread adoption of these programs.\n\nTo address these gaps, the NutriConnect team employs a Designing for Dissemination and Sustainability (D4DS) approach informed by the PRISM/RE-AIM framework. This involves early engagement of key partners crucial for scalability and sustainability. The study team initiated a collaborative consortium comprising Washington University in St. Louis, BJC Healthcare, and Schnucks (regional grocery chain). NutriConnect integrates multilevel, multicomponent intervention components, including in-hospital social needs screening, produce prescription, grocery rewards, and a health and wellness program, all aimed at promoting better nutrition and health in the community. NutriConnect seeks to compare the effectiveness of two produce prescription approaches on fruits and vegetables intake and food security: credit to Rewards account (NutriConnect Credit) vs. produce box delivery (NutriConnect Delivery), while exploring implementation outcomes, with the following aims.\n\nAim 1. Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of NutriConnect Credit with NutriConnect Delivery on changes in fruit and vegetable intake, food security, and self-reported health status.\n\nAim 2. Explore the scalability, sustainability, and determinants of the NutriConnect program guided by PRISM/RE-AIM, aiming to identify factors crucial for future scale-up.\n\nAim 3. Determine the implementation costs of NutriConnect using time-driven activity-based costing approach."
