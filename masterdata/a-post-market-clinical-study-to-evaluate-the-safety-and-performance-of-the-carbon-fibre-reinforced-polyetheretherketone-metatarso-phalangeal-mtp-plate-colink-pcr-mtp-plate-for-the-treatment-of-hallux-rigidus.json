This type of degenerative arthritis affects the joint of the big toe (hallux) which is attached to the foot. Taking part in this research will involve collecting data of the surgery to remove damaged cartilage and fix the two bones together with screws and a plate (called the CoLink\u00ae PCR MTP Plate)."
