A total of 25 patients will be accrued at UW Carbone Cancer Center. Subject enrollment will occur over 12 months with the total duration of the trial expected to be 3 years.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated in the treatment refractory setting with liposomal irinotecan in combination with TAS102 and bevacizumab.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of liposomal irinotecan in combination with bevacizumab and TAS102.\n* To assess the safety and tolerability of these regimens in this setting.\n* To determine the impact of the timing of irinotecan use in prior lines of therapy on the ORR and PFS observed with these nal-IRI containing treatment regimens"
