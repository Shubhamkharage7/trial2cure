            "detailedDescription": "With little evidence available to guide the provision of clinical care for patients on long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) in whom the risks outweigh the benefits, major questions remain about optimizing the risk/benefit profile of LTOT, including: how to best engage patients voluntarily in this process; the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of newer treatment approaches; and optimal treatment selection. The primary objective of the proposed study is to begin to systematically address gaps in this important area to improve pain, reduce risk, and improve quality of life for individuals on LTOT."
