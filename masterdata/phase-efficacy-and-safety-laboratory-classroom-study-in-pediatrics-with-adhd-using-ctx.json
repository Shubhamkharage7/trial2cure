Subjects will undergo a screening visit prior to entering into a 8-week dose-optimization phase. During the dose-optimization phase, subjects will have weekly visits and will be titrated to doses ranging between 6.25mg-37.5mg of CTx-1301. Eligible subjects will be randomized phase to their optimal dose or placebo in a 1:1 ratio at the end of Visit 10 completing the practice laboratory classroom study. Subjects will take their assigned/randomized dose over the following 7-day period. On the 7th days subjects will complete the full laboratory classroom study. The duration of the full laboratory classroom study will be approximately 15 hours. Subjects will have an in-clinic safety follow-up visit within 7 days after the full classroom day."

Inclusion of subjects who are na\u00efve to pharmacological therapy for ADHD or are newly diagnosed with ADHD is permitted.\n4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum b-human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at Screening. Child-bearing potential is defined as any female who has had their first period or is 12 years or older (or will be 12 during the study). Female of childbearing potential or that become child-bearing potential during the study must agree to use a highly effective, medically acceptable form of birth control for 30 days prior to Screening until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Alternatively, subject may remain abstinent until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Episodic abstinence is not reliable to avoid pregnancy, so is not considered a highly effective contraceptive method. Investigator discretion should use judgement and familiarity with the subject's \"preferred and usual lifestyle\" to assess if reporting of abstinence may be trusted to achieve required effectiveness. Male subjects with female partners must agree at Screening to remain abstinent or agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of birth control from Screening to 90 days after the last dose of study drug.\n5. Subject must be in general good health defined as absence of any clinically significant abnormalities as determined by the Investigator based on physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, ECGs, medical history, and safety laboratory tests at screening. If any of the exams or tests are not within the laboratory reference range, the Investigator must assess and determine if clinically significant.\n6.

Adequate washout of non-stimulant ADHD medications will be defined as no medication for the previous 21 days.\n10. Subject must have a score of 4 (moderately ill) or higher on the clinician-administrated Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale at screening (Visit 1). For subjects requiring washout of ADHD medications, adequate washout of stimulant ADHD medications will be defined as no medication for the previous 5 days. Adequate washout of non-stimulant ADHD medications will be defined as no medication for the previous 21 days.\n11. Subject must be able and willing to wash out of stimulant ADHD medications (except study drug as indicated per protocol), including herbal medication, from 5 days prior to the start of the dose optimization phase (Visit 2) and for the duration of the entire study, defined as completion of the safety follow-up visit. Additionally, subject must be able and willing to wash out from non-stimulant ADHD medications 21 days prior to the start of the dose optimization phase (Visit 2) and for the duration of the entire study, defined as completion of the safety follow-up visit.\n12. Subject and parents/legal guardians, and/or caregiver (if applicable) must be able to read, write, speak, and understand English and be able to communicate with the Investigator and study coordinator in a satisfactory fashion and complete any study-related materials.

Subject must provide written assent prior to study participation\n15. Subject, subject's parents/legal guardians, and/or caregivers (if applicable) must understand and be willing and able to comply with study procedures as well as the visit schedule. If the subject is cared for by a caregiver for relevant portions of the day, the caregiver may be more suitable for certain assessments, and the caregiver will need to agree to the applicable procedures and visits. The most appropriate assessor should be determined prior to the double-blind, randomized, efficacy portion. The assessor for each individual subject should be the same assessor throughout the double-blind, randomized, efficacy portion of the study.\n16. Subject must be able to swallow the CTx-1301 tablet as evidenced by ability to swallow a similar size tablet (placebo) at screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. If female and of child-bearing potential, the subject must not be pregnant or breastfeeding at any time during the study or for 30 days following the completion of the study. If of child-bearing potential, urine hCG tests will be administered at protocol-specified time points. Any positive pregnancy test during the study will exclude them from further participation in the study.\n2. Subject has any psychiatric diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder, major depressive disorder, conduct disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), intellectual disability, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorder, anxiety disorder (including generalized anxiety disorder), any history of psychosis, autism spectrum disorder, a history of motor or vocal tics or Tourette's Syndrome, confirmed genetic disorder with cognitive and/or behavioral disturbances, or any other diagnosis/significant medical history that at the discretion of the Investigator excludes the subject from entry into the study.\n3.

Subject has any clinically significant and/or unstable/uncontrolled medical abnormality, chronic medical condition, persistent neurological symptoms, history of cardiovascular abnormality, abnormalities of respiratory, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, or any disorder or history of a condition that would impact or interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion during the study or may interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n5. Subject has family history of early cardiovascular disease or sudden death.\n6. Subject has any history of attempted suicide, clinically significant suicidal ideation based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) assessment, or answers \"yes\" to \"Suicidal Ideation\" item 4 or 5 of any lifetime history on the C-SSRS Children's Lifetime/Recent assessment at screening.\n7. Subject has a known primary sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea, narcolepsy, etc.)\n8. If the subject's blood pressure is \\< 90th percentile for their age, sex, and height, the single read is sufficient. If the subject's blood pressure is \u2265 90th percentile, two additional reads will be taken, and the three reads will be averaged. If the average of the three readings is \u2265 95th percentile at screening they will be excluded.\n9. Subject is considered treatment refractory by the Investigator or is intolerant to stimulant ADHD medication.\n10. Any use of anticonvulsants currently or within the past 2 years.\n11. Uncontrolled thyroid disorder indicated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) \u22640.8 x the lower limit of normal (LLN) or \u2265 1.25 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) from the reference laboratory.\n12.
