Veterans with dysphagia will be assessed at three time points: baseline, 4 weeks after treatment initiation, and 8 weeks after treatment initiation. A non-dysphagic Veteran control group will also undergo data collection at parallel time points, without completion of a treatment paradigm. The investigators will then compare patients to non-dysphagic controls using manometry, videofluoroscopy, diet assessment, functional reserve tests, and patient-reported outcome measures.\n\nThe investigators aim to 1) quantify change in pressure measures of swallowing function resulting from dysphagia treatment; 2) determine which combination of standard of care and/or pressure-based metrics best track with outcome measures; and 3) develop multimodal prognostic algorithms that predict treatment success. This research will establish a precise outcome measurement paradigm suitable for dysphagia clinical care and research, thus improving clinical confidence and paving the way for a personalized medicine approach for dysphagia rehabilitation in Veterans.",
