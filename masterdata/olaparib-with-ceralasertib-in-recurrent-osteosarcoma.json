The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Olaparib\n* Ceralasertib\n\nEach treatment cycle lasts 28 days and participants will receive study treatment up to 24 cycles (2 years).\n\nIt is expected that about 63 people will take part in this research study.\n\n* The study is looking to test: whether olaparib and ceralasertib given together are effective in patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma.\n* how safe and how well tolerated olaparib and ceralasertib are when given together in patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma.\n* markers in the blood and in tumor tissue to see if there are certain features of the tumor that may indicate this combination of drugs is effective or not effective.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Ceralasertib as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThis is the first time that Ceralasertib will be given to children.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved olaparib for recurrent osteosarcoma but it has been approved for other uses."
