Patients with cTanyN1-3M0 via American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging30 will be considered tor enrollment in this trial. We plan to enroll 60 patients. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to the intervention arm with durvalumab plus NAC vs SOC NAC. In patients randomized to receive, durvalumab will be continued as maintenance every 4 weeks until either relapse or 1 year, whichever event occurs first.\n\nTissue collection will occur as a biopsy prior to initiation of neo-adjuvant therapy via both transurethral biopsy of bladder and lymph node biopsy. Tissue will again be collected at the time of radical cystectomy or, in patients who are no longer surgical candidates, in the form of biopsy as standard of care. Blood and urine will be collected at baseline, week 2, week 6, week 16, and at the 6 week-post surgery visit for analysis of correlative studies.",
