            "briefSummary": "Both Tart Cherry and Omega 3 FAs have better side effect profiles compared to other commonly used medications for AIMSS, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, steroids, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Additionally, in our clinics the investigators often find that patients tend to be more receptive to taking a supplement as opposed to an additional medication. Further, both Tart Cherry concentrate and fish oil have beneficial properties for helping with joint stiffness in general, in addition to other health issues like insomnia.\n\nThere is some evidence in mouse models that when given together, these supplements may have an even greater anti-inflammatory effect than when taken separately. Although to our knowledge, no human studies have tested this hypothesis. This study has been designed to test the hypothesis that Tart Cherry and fish oil when given in combination over a 12-week period could produce beneficial changes in arthritis symptoms when compared to a control group in an obese breast cancer population experience AIMSS and on an AI. Secondary outcomes to be assessed include pain, functional performance, quality of life and cognition."
