            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to learn about the natural progression of DCM (dilated cardiomyopathy) caused by BAG3 gene mutations. DCM is a condition as the heart muscle is weakened and the heart becomes enlarged. This makes it hard for the heart to pump enough blood for the body.\n\nThe study is seeking up to about 35 participants who have:\n\n* BAG3 mutation (change in the gene) that causes or is likely to cause dilated cardiomyopathy\n* NYHA (New York Heart Association) Class I-IV at screening (Stage B-D)\n* Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction less than or equal to 50% (meaning reduced heart function)\n\nAll participants in this study will receive their usual treatment. The investigators will observe the natural progression of people who have BAG3 DCM. This will help the investigators better understand the disease and aid in future research.\n\nParticipants will take part in this study for one year. During this time, participants will visit the site at least 4 times (about every 3 months). Participants will undergo study procedures and give information about their health. These procedures will include a physical exam, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, ECG monitoring, activity monitoring, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and blood tests. Participants will answer questions about health and quality of life. The study team will also call participants about 1 time over the phone."
