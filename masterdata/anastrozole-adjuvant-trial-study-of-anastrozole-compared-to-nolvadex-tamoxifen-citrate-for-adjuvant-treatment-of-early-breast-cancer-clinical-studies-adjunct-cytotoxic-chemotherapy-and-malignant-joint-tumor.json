Among these patients, 54% had node positive disease and 46% had node negative disease.\n\nThe Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) conducted worldwide overviews of systemic adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer in 1985, 1990, and again in 1995. In 1998, 10-year outcome data were reported for 36,689 women in 55 randomized trials of adjuvant NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate) using doses of 20-40 mg/day for 1-5+ years. Twenty-five percent of patients received 1 year or less of trial treatment, 52% received 2 years, and 23% received about 5 years.\n\nForty-eight percent of tumors were estrogen receptor (ER) positive ( \\> 10 fmol/mg), 21% were ER poor ( \\< 10 fmol/l), and 31% were ER unknown.\n\nThis following study is for an alternate treatment plan.
