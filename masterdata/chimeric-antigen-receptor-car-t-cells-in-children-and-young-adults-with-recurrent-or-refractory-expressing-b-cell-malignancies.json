            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nB-cell leukemias and lymphomas are cancers that are often difficult to treat. The primary objective of this study is to determine the ability to take a patient's own cells (T lymphocytes) and grow them in the laboratory with the CD19/CD22-CAR receptor gene through a process called 'lentiviral transduction (also considered gene therapy) and growing them to large numbers to use as a treatment for hematologic cancers in children and young adults.. Researchers want to see if giving modified CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to people with these cancers can attack cancer cells. In addition, the safety of giving these gene modified cells to humans will be tested at different cell doses. Additional objectives are to determine if this therapy can cause regression of B cell cancers and to measure if the gene modified cells survive in patients blood.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the safety and effects of giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to children and young adults with B-cell cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 3-39 with certain cancers that have not been cured by standard therapy. Their cancer tissue must express the CD19 protein.\n\nDesign:\n\nA sample of participants blood or bone marrow will be sent to NIH and tested for leukemia.\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nUrine and blood tests (including for HIV)\n\nHeart and eye tests\n\nNeurologic assessment and symptom checklist.\n\nScans, bone marrow biopsy, and/or spinal tap\n\nSome participants will have lung tests.\n\nParticipants will repeat these tests throughout the study and follow-up.\n\nParticipants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be drawn from a plastic tube (IV) or needle in one arm then go through a machine that removes lymphocytes. The remaining blood will be returned to the participant s other arm.\n\nParticipants will stay in the hospital about 2 weeks. There they will get:\n\nTwo chemotherapy drugs by IV\n\nTheir changed cells by IV\n\nStandard drugs for side effects\n\nParticipants will have frequent follow-up visits for 1 year, then 5 visits for the next 4 years. Then they will answer questions and have blood tests every year for 15 years.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 25% of childhood cancer. Survival rates have improved, but outcomes for some subgroups, including infants and young adults remain poor, and survival for patients who relapse is \\< 50%, despite allogeneic stem cell transplant following second remission.\n* CD19 immune escape has been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy for B-ALL. Investigation of this phenomenon reveals a complex biology responsible for loss or downregulation of CD19 expression observed in these cases.\n* Sequential therapy using CD22-CARs to treat CD19 dim/lo escape is associated with rapid development of resistance due to CD22 downregulation. This trial will test whether simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 using a novel bivalent CD19/22-CAR is safe and feasible.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR engineered T cells that meet established release specifications in children and young adults with CD19+CD22+ B cell ALL, isolated CNS ALL, or lymphoma following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine conditioning regimen.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Participants between \\>= 3 years and \\<= 39 years of age, with CD19+/CD22+ B cell ALL, isolated CNS ALL, or lymphoma who have relapsed or have refractory disease after at least one standard chemotherapy regimen and one salvage regimen, with no alternative curative options who meet standard Phase I eligibility criteria.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation design using the following dose levels: -1: 1 x 10\\^5 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 1: 3 x 10\\^5 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 2: 1 x 10\\^6 transduced T cells/kg; and 3: 3 x 10\\^6 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 4: 1 x 10\\^7 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%).\n* Participants will receive a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine (25 mg/m\\^2/d x 3 on Days -4, -3, -2) and cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m\\^2/d x 1 on Day -2) followed by infusion of CD19/CD22-CAR T-cells on D0. Participants who are CAR pretreated (with exception for those with an interval HSCT) will receive increased lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine (30\\^mg/m2/d x 4 on Days -5, -4, -3, -2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2/d x 2 on Days -3, -2) followed by infusion of CD19/CD22-CAR T-cells on D0. If fludarabine is unavailable, pentostatin may be given as an alternative.\n* Patients will be evaluated sequentially for toxicity, antitumor effects, CAR expansion and\n\npersistence, as well as research correlatives."

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\n* Subjects will be excluded related to the following prior therapy criteria:\n\n  * Systemic chemotherapy, anti-neoplastic investigational agents, or antibody based therapies =\\<2 weeks (6 weeks for clofarabine or nitrosoureas) prior to apheresis with the following exception:\n\n    ---No time restriction with prior intrathecal chemotherapy, steroid therapy, hydroxyurea or ALL maintenance type chemotherapy (vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, oral methotrexate, or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for participants with Ph+ ALL) provided there is recovery from any acute toxic effects.\n  * Radiation therapy =\\<3 weeks prior to apheresis with the following exception:\n\n    ---No time restriction with radiation therapy if the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and the subject has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation window.\n  * History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation prior to apheresis that meet the following criteria:\n\n    * Less than 100 days post-transplant\n    * Evidence of active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\n    * Taking immunosuppressive agents within 30 days prior to apheresis\n    * Less than 6 weeks post donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)\n  * History of prior CAR therapy or other adoptive cell therapies prior to apheresis that meet the following criteria:\n\n    * Less than 30 days post-infusion\n    * Circulating CAR T cells (or genetically modified cells) \\>5% by flow cytometry in peripheral blood.\n* HIV/HBV/HCV Infection:\n\n  * a.
