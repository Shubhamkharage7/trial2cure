            "detailedDescription": "The study will employ a RCT to test the two hypotheses. The study will incorporate a 2 x 3 two-way factorial design with repeated measures at three time points. The two between-subject factor conditions will be participation in a yogic breathing exercise program (YBEP) versus a waitlist control condition that will be evaluated at baseline, immediately post-program, and at 3-month follow-up. Thirty adults with ALS will be recruited for this study.\n\nHypothesis #1: Adults with ALS who participate in a YBEP will demonstrate improvement in breathing, speech function, and emotional well-being compared to waitlist controls at the conclusion of a 6-week YBEP.\n\nHypothesis #2: The positive impact of the YBEP on the participants' improved breathing, speech function, and emotional well-being will be maintained at 3-month follow-up."
