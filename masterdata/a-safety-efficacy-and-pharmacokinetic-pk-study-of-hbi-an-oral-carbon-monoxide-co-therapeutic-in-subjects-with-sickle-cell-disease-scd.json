History of drug abuse, including administration of opioids for reasons other than pain control. Use of opioids for control of pain is permitted.\n18. Use of voxelotor or crizanlizumab or prescription drugs other than prescribed for SCD, within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing. Herbal and vitamin supplements (excluding L-glutamine) must be discontinued 14 days prior to dosing. Prescribed analgesics for regular self-administration are permitted provided that dosing of such has not been increased or new drugs added over the past 7 days.\n19. Unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n20. Treatment with an investigational drug within the longer of 30 days or five half-lives.\n21. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure lower than 90 or above 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure lower than 50 or above 90 mmHg, or heart rate less than 45 or above 100 bpm or arrhythmia) at screening and/or baseline, as determined by the Investigator. Heart rate corrected QT interval-Frederica's method (QTcF) \\>450 msec male, \\>470 msec female.\n22. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into the study.\n23. Any coincident disease or condition that in the opinion of the investigator will make the subject inappropriate for entry into the study or will confound the assessment of safety.\n24.
