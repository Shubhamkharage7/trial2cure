            "briefSummary": "To determine if a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Ketorolac (Toradol), can improve pain control and decrease narcotic use after undergoing egg retrieval.",
            "detailedDescription": "Postoperative pain control is an essential component to any surgical procedure. Surgery represents a time during which opioid-na\u00efve patients may be exposed to narcotics, risking opioid related complications and future opioid-use disorder. Approximately 150,000 oocyte retrievals are performed per year in the United States, according to the 2017 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report. A reduction in exposure to narcotics in this field has significant public health implications, particularly given that approximately 6% of new persistent opioid use occurs following minor surgical procedures.\n\nKetorolac (Toradol) has been demonstrated to be a safe and efficacious agent to achieve pain control postoperatively with no significant increase in adverse events.\n\nThe purpose of this prospective randomized blinded placebo controlled trial is to determine if a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Ketorolac (Toradol), can improve pain control and decrease narcotic use after undergoing egg retrieval.\n\nApproximately 400 women (n=200 in each arm) will be enrolled according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria among patients of Shady Grove Fertility. Participants will undergo a standard in vitro fertilization cycle (IVF) followed by egg retrieval (ER). Participants will be randomized to receive either IV ketorolac or IV placebo at the conclusion of the egg retrieval, administered by the anesthesia provider. All enrolled patients will receive standard post-operative pain management. The investigational component of this study lies in assessing post-operative pain control in the immediate post-operative period and in the post-operative period after discharge as reflected by pain scores and narcotic medication usage."
