The study will employ a split-scar randomized control trial with established outcome measurement tools. Prospective participants undergoing this procedure will be enrolled, with the vertical forehead scar as the primary area of interest.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the control group, which will receive treatment with a silicone patch only, or the experimental group, which will receive a combination of CBD oil and a silicone patch. The allocation of treatment to the top or bottom vertical half of the scar will be randomized for each patient.\n\nParticipants will be monitored for a duration of 6 months, during which they will complete the Modified Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale at each postoperative visit. After the 6-month period, a blinded rater will evaluate photographs of the scars using the Scar Cosmesis and Rating Scale, without knowledge of the treatment received."
