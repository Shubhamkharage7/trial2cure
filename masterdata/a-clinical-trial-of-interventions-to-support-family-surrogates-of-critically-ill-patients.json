            "briefSummary": "Hypotheses 1a and 1b: Compared to Supportive Conversation arm, the EMPOWER intervention will significantly decrease surrogate decision makers' symptoms of grief and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (primary outcomes); and H1b. experiential avoidance, depression, regrets, and increases in patients' value-concordant care (secondary outcomes) at T1-T4.\n\nHypothesis 2. Qualitative data will provide insights not captured by quantitative data.\n\nHypothesis 3. Reductions in experiential avoidance will mediate reductions in grief and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, highlighting it as important to target in future implementation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are stressful places fraught with grief for family members who witness dying loved ones, often in pain, struggling to breathe and/or maintain consciousness. Compounding their distress, family members are often thrust into the position of patient \"surrogate,\" needing to make life-and-death decisions on the patient's behalf. Researchers have shown that end-of-life (EoL) decision-making is undermined by grief, which interferes with acceptance of the patient's impending death and leads to care choices that adversely affect patients' quality of care and death.1-3 These circumstances heighten surrogates' risk of meeting criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and decisional regret about the EoL care that the patient received, each associated with poor bereavement outcomes.4-7 Nearly 60% of ICU surrogates report moderate to extreme grief; 34% report extreme levels of peritraumatic stress symptoms.1\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made an already bad situation worse. At the start of the pandemic, social distancing policies forced millions of families to confront obstacles to communication, medical decision-making, and care.8-10 Surrogates were left struggling with severe pre-loss grief and peritraumatic stress -- intensely longing to be near to the patient, confused about their roles, lonely, horrified, angry, disoriented and emotionally numb.10,11 Now, as the Delta variant creates a new \"wave\" of mortality and infection, bereaved family members may have remorse about vaccine refusal,12 feel guilty for transmitting the virus to the patient, or regret decisions about EoL care. With over 35 million cases and 600,000 deaths in the United States from COVID-19,13 the need for psychosocial interventions to support surrogates in the ICU is clear.\n\nPrior efforts to address the plight of family surrogates of critically ill patients have proved disappointing14-20 - with one ICU intervention significantly increasing the surrogate's severity of PTSD symptoms.14 A key limitation of these interventions is that while they targeted psychological outcomes, they were not psychological interventions. To address this, the investigators developed a brief, flexibly administered cognitive-behavioral, acceptance-based psychological intervention called EMPOWER (Enhancing \\& Mobilizing the POtential for Wellness \\& Emotional Resilience).21,22 Our pilot NIH-R21 (N=39) showed that EMPOWER had superior efficacy to enhanced usual care for reducing symptoms of PGD (d=1.20) and PTSD (d=.99). Consistent with mediation, EMPOWER reduced experiential avoidance (d=1.20); these reductions were correlated with PGD and PTSD change scores (p\\<0.01). Large reductions in decisional regret (d=1.57) were observed, with no notable differences by surrogate race or delivery format (telehealth vs. in-person).\n\nInvestigators propose to conduct a Phase II mixed methods randomized controlled trial (RCT) to further evaluate the efficacy of EMPOWER for reducing surrogate symptoms of PTSD and PGD. Surrogates (N=172) will be randomized to EMPOWER (n=86) or a standardized supportive conversation (SC; n=86). Effects of the intervention will be assessed via measures administered pre-intervention (T1), immediately post-intervention (T2), and at 3 months (T3), and 12 months (T4) following the T2 assessment. Investigators will also conduct semi-structured interviews with surrogates (n\u224848) to probe intervention effects on mental health and explore contextual factors (e.g., medical mistrust, visitation restrictions) likely to affect surrogates during the pandemic."
