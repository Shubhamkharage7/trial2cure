The trial will be the first fully powered randomized trial of treatment for any psychiatric disorder following perinatal loss.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to conduct a fully-powered randomized efficacy study of IPT for MDD following perinatal loss. Our perinatal-loss adapted group IPT will be compared to a standard depression intervention (CWD, also delivered in a group format) in a sample of 274 women experiencing MDD following perinatal loss. The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test the hypotheses that: (1) IPT for perinatal loss will result in reduced time to recovery from MDD (primary), depressive symptoms, and PTSD symptoms (secondary) relative to CWD; and that among women meeting criteria for PTSD, IPT will result in reduced time to recovery from PTSD; (2) IPT for perinatal loss will result in increased social support, social role functioning (including parental functioning for women with living children), and well-being, and decreased grief and fear of subsequent pregnancies, relative to CWD; and (3) social support and grief will mediate the effects of IPT on time to MDD recovery."
