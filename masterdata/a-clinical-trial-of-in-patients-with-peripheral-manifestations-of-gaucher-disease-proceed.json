Following this, up to 6 patients may be enrolled into an expansion cohort.\n\nFor each enrolled patient, the study will be approximately 5 years in duration, including up to a 45-day screening period. During the first 18 months after dosing, subjects will be evaluated for the effects of LY3884961 on safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and efficacy. Patients will be followed up for an additional 42 months to monitor safety, immunogenicity, and selected biomarker and efficacy parameters."
