            "detailedDescription": "In recent decades, new cancer cases have consistently risen. Participants diagnosed with cancer commonly face psychological symptoms including distress, anxiety, and depression in addition to physical symptoms (i.e., pain). Importantly, these symptoms might be exacerbated during chemotherapy sessions. New innovative technological strategies have been under development to control the symptoms and improve quality of life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that enables participants to interact with an artificial three-dimensional visual and auditory environment. VR could be an innovative intervention to relieve psychological symptoms associated with chemotherapy."
