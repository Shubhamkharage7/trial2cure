Both study groups will receive standard TYRO Champion Dads services (the TYRO Dads and TYRO Core Communication evidence-based curricula, plus support services), but only the treatment group will be offered the additional Ray of Hope curriculum hours focused on mitigating risk factors related to domestic violence.",
            "detailedDescription": "Anthem Strong Families (ASF) is reviewing the Ray of Hope curriculum as a possible addition to standard TCD services to better meet the needs of populations that may have unmet needs to address domestic violence in their families. The Ray of Hope curriculum is designed to help participants develop communication and conflict management skills like Core Communication but is a more robust approach since it adds a sharp focus on the dynamics of domestic violence and related risk factors.\n\nThe impact of the addition of the Ray of Hope curriculum will be assessed by comparing outcomes for participants who receive standard TYRO Champion Dads (TCD) services, which includes the TYRO curriculum plus support services, and participants who receive both standard services plus 10 Ray of Hope curriculum hours.\n\nGoal 1: determine if treatment group participants who receive enhanced TCD services report healthier parenting attitudes compared to control group participants who receive only standard TCD services 6 months after TCD enrollment.\n\nGoal 2: determine if treatment group participants who receive enhanced TCD services report healthier partner relationship behavior compared to control group participants who receive only standard TCD services 6 months after TCD enrollment.\n\nGoal 3: determine if treatment group participants who receive enhanced TCD services report healthier parenting behavior compared to control group participants who receive only standard TCD services 6 months after TCD enrollment.\n\nGoal 4: determine if treatment group participants who receive enhanced TCD services report healthier co-parenting behavior compared to control group participants who receive only standard TCD services 6 months after TCD enrollment."
