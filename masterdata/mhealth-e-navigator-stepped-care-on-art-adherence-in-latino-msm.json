            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of stepped care strategies to improve ART adherence among adult Latino MSM with HIV using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART). The trial will compare a stepped care strategy of delivering TXTXT (\"Treatment Text\") first and stepping up to remote patient navigation for non-responders vs. a stepped care strategy of delivering TXTXT + e-Navigation first and stepping up to EMA-supported e-Navigation for non-responders. Both TXTXT and the foundations of the e-Navigation interventions are CDC evidence-based interventions (EBI). We propose to use a SMART design which explicitly allows building, testing, and optimizing stepped care strategies without compromising rigor or randomization. We propose three specific aims:\n\nAim 1. Compare the immediate (6-month) and sustained (9- and 12-month) efficacy of two static (non-stepped) treatment regimens (TXTXT alone vs. TXTXT + e-Navigation) on ART adherence and viral suppression among Latino MSM with HIV. Hypothesis 1a. TXTXT + e-Navigation will be more efficacious than TXTXT alone. Aim 2. Compare the immediate (6-month) and sustained (9- and 12-month) efficacy of two stepped care strategies (TXTXT with added e-Navigation for non-responders vs. TXTXT + e-Navigation with added EMA support for non-responders) on ART adherence and viral suppression among Latino MSM with HIV. Hypothesis 2a: TXTXT + e-Navigation with added EMA support for non-responders at the 3-month follow-up will be more efficacious than TXTXT with added e-Navigation for non-responders at the 3-month follow-up. Aim 3. Identify baseline and time-varying moderators on the association between stepped care strategy and ART adherence and viral suppression among Latino MSM with HIV. Hypotheses 3a-c: TXTXT with added e-Navigation for non-responders will be less efficacious than TXTXT + e-Navigation with added EMA support for non-responders for individuals who are: (a) older at baseline, or report (b) substance use, or (c) symptoms of depression between baseline and the 3-month follow-up."
