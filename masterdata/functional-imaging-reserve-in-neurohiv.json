Results of this study may provide insight into the pathophysiology of disease and may reveal arenas for future possible interventions in PLWH who have impaired neuropsychological performance.",
            "detailedDescription": "This proposal systematically characterizes brain efficiency and recruitment in virologically suppressed persons living with HIV (PLWH) and demographically similar HIV uninfected (HIV-) controls. This proposal collects advanced functional neuroimaging that provide critical information about cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain connectivity (functional connectivity strength; FCS); quantitative measures of immune dysfunction in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (immune activation and immune exhaustion); and neuropsychological performance testing. This overall goal of this proposal is to delineate the interplay between dysfunction in frontal networks and recruitment of compensatory networks that underlie the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in PLWH."
