Bulimia nervosa is when individuals binge eat (overeat while feeling like they lost control) and purge (do something extreme or unhealthy to lose weight or prevent weight gain). Bulimia nervosa happens across different ages and body sizes. This study is focusing on adolescents who have a larger body size. Adolescents will receive treatment that is 4 months of 45-minute sessions, weekly. Treatment will occur over telehealth (e.g., zoom), and the whole study is online."
