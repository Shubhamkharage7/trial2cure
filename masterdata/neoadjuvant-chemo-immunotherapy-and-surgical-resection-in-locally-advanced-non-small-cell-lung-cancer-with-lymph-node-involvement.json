Patients will receive a 3 drug combination for 4 total treatments given every 3 weeks before surgery. After surgery, patients will have the option to undergo radiation therapy if it is recommended by their treatment team. After this, they will receive cemiplimab every 3 weeks for one year."

Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n15.
