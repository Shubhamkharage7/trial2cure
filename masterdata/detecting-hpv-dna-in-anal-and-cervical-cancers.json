Doctors leading this study will use blood tests to find out if they can detect the HPV virus in the blood of study participants before, during, and after radiation treatment. They will also collect blood and archival tumor tissue (from a previous biopsy) to perform other tests in the future that could provide more information about HPV-associated cancers and how they respond to treatment. Participation in this study will last approximately 2 years."
