The GameDay Ready program promotes increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary time, and improving dietary habits through education, behavioral self-monitoring, and goal setting. Each 60-minute intervention session includes a brief educational component followed by a group discussion of weekly progress. Following a short warmup walk, participants engage in group-based competitive physical activities and then a short cooldown walk. Participants then set individual and group-based goals for the upcoming week and discuss strategies for overcoming barriers to achieving goals. The program is sensitive to intersectional influences of gender, race, and rurality on health; and strategies to enhance motivation are threaded throughout the program.",
