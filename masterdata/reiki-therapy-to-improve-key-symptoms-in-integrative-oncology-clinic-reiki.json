Systematic reviews and meta-analyses report Reiki to be effective for improving psychological and physical health symptoms. With respect to adults with cancer, Reiki has been shown to improve participants' relaxation, pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, stress, and wellbeing/quality of life compared to care as usual. However, one study showed no improvement in comfort and wellbeing in those receiving Reiki compared to sham Reiki control, but those receiving Reiki reported improvements above usual care."
