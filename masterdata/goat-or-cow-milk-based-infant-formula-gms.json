Parent/legal guardian who has previously decided to exclusively feed infant formula and is willing to continue with formula feeding throughout the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA participant who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the study:\n\n1. Infant born with medical complications (e.g., neurological, cerebral palsy, etc.)\n2. Infant with failure to thrive, fever, any GI tract abnormalities (e.g., short gut, gastroesophageal reflux, etc.), any congenital illness or malformation that may affect infant feeding or normal growth\n3. Infant has been treated with prescription medications that in the Investigator's opinion could impact growth, gastrointestinal tolerance and/or development\n4. Infant that has received oral or parenteral antibiotics prior to enrollment\n5. Infant is taking and parent/legal guardian plans to continue (including over-the-counter medications, such as Mylicon\u00ae for gas), home remedies (such as juice for constipation), gastroesophageal reflux medications, herbal preparations, or rehydration fluids that, in the Investigator's opinion, might affect gastrointestinal tolerance. Use of the following are strongly discouraged for the duration of the trial:\n\n   1. Solid foods and juices\n   2. Vitamins and/mineral supplements, as the study product provided is nutritionally complete\n   3. Pre- and probiotics\n6. Infant with family history (biological siblings or parents) of confirmed milk protein allergy (Parent's lactose intolerance is not disqualifying)\n7. Parent(s)/Legal guardian(s) intent on feeding non-study formula, breastmilk, juices, or solid food during the study.",
