The investigators will collect infant stool before and after support group attendance. The investigators will use qPCR and metagenomic sequencing to test if the study probiotics or other bacteria transmit between infants. The investigators anticipate HMO consuming bacteria will and non-HMO consuming bacteria will not transmit between infants.",

The investigators will collect a baseline infant stool sample and maternal milk sample before attendance at the first lactation support group meeting. At the first support group meeting, mothers will be provided with the open label probiotic their infant was randomized to receive, and will give the probiotic daily for the next 28 days. The investigators will collect a second infant stool sample and a second milk sample at the final lactation support group meeting. The investigators will use qPCR and metagenomic sequencing to test if the study probiotics or other bacteria transmit from the infants who received a specific species to the infants who did not receive that species. We will also test to see if the probiotic given to infants is detectable in milk samples. The investigators anticipate HMO consuming bacteria will and non-HMO consuming bacteria will not transmit between infants."

After the first session, infants will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 probiotics. Both probiotics are marketed in the US as dietary supplements for infants. At the first support group session and at the final session, infant fecal samples and mother's milk samples will be collected and tested for detectable levels of both probiotics to determine if horizontal transmission of the probiotic species occurred in the setting of a lactation support group.",

COVID vaccination is required for maternal participation as this is a study meant to enable transmission of beneficial bacteria species between infants, and infants are too young to be vaccinated.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Maternal drug abuse\n* Infant congenital abnormalities\n* Infant age greater than 1 month at first lactation support group meeting (younger infants will have less developed microbiomes, increasing the chance of successful transmission of bacteria)\n* Intent to provide a non-study probiotics to the infant\n* Known immunocompromised status of the infant.",
