Disability and health agencies lack effective tools to support the information and support needs of TD siblings and their families, in particular for ethnic minority and rural families. The aims of this proposal are to complete development and evaluation of the dual language SIBTime app, designed to build parents' and children's knowledge, skills, and engaging family routines to nurture TD siblings' (ages 3-6) social-emotional health and well-being.",
            "detailedDescription": "An 8-week RCT will be conducted to evaluate the full-scale SIBTime program in a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial evaluation (sample size = 160 parent/child dyads). SIBTime will be assessed in terms of its relevance, acceptability, cultural appropriateness, and efficacy. Participants will complete measures pre- and post- intervention selected to detect changes in parenting stress and adjustment, parent-child relationship, parents' self-efficacy and frequency of engagement in the targeted parenting strategies, and TD sibling behavior and adjustment. Information will also be collected on family demographics, consumer satisfaction, usability ratings, usage metrics, and recommendations for modifications to the program."
