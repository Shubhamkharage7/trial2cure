            "briefSummary": "The goal of this research study is to determine the feasibility and potential effects of physical therapy and enhanced patient education delivered before breast cancer treatment. Physical therapy before cancer treatment aims to help with early identification and self-management of physical and functional side effects from cancer treatment. Side effects could be joint pain, muscle weakness, or fatigue that contribute to functional impairment.\n\nThe main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Determine the feasibility (acceptability and suitability) and potential effects of an early intervention called 'Moving On-After Breast Cancer' (MOve-ABC) on physical and functional side effects of cancer compared to enhanced usual care in a large academic medical system to help us refine and adjust the intervention in preparation for a large randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial.\n2. Determine whether MOve-ABC also affects patient self-management and provider knowledge and behaviors related to detection and management of physical and functional effects associated with cancer.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to either of the two arms of the study which are 'Intervention' and 'Enhanced usual care.'\n\nParticipants in the intervention arm will receive:\n\n1. Planned care per their oncology physician team plus: 1.1. Patient education on physical function in breast cancer 1.2. Physical therapy evaluation 1.3. Individualized home exercise prescription 1.4. Education materials in the form of a study booklet, study website, text messaging, and phone calls 1.5. Monthly monitoring of physical and functional survey scores to identify the need for physical therapy and provide referrals as needed\n\nParticipants in the enhanced usual care arm will receive:\n\n1. Planned care per their oncology physician team plus 1.2. Monthly monitoring of their physical functional scores to identify the need for physical therapy and provide referrals as needed\n\nAll participants will attend three in-person visits for clinical measurements."
