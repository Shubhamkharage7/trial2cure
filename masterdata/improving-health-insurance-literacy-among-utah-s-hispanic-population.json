            "briefSummary": "This is a test of an existing health insurance education program (HIEP) in the Utah Hispanic community (aged 18-64). The study will evaluate whether the HIEP delivered by Utah Health Policy Project (UHPP) staff improves participants' health insurance and cost-related literacy. Participants will complete a brief baseline survey, be guided through the HIEP by UHPP staff, and complete a brief survey/interview after completing the sessions.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this research is to refine and pilot test an existing health insurance education program (HIEP) to improve health insurance and cost-related literacy among the Hispanic community in Utah. This study will be conducted in conjunction with the Utah Health Policy Project, which has long been active in the Hispanic community and has been instrumental in reducing the number of uninsured adults and children in Utah. Initially, community and key-informant feedback on how to best adapt this intervention to the Hispanic community, including what topics are most important, and how the intervention should be delivered, will be obtained. After the HIEP is adapted accordingly, it will be investigated to see if it improves participants' health insurance and cost-related literacy.\n\nUpon enrollment, participants will fill out a survey containing questions about their current health insurance, employment, demographics, acculturation, preferred language and health insurance knowledge. Participants will then receive 4 educational sessions surrounding health insurance use and laws (four sessions total occurring approximately every two weeks). These educational sessions will be conducted, in person, over video conference calls, or over the telephone, and will cover:\n\n* Overview of health insurance options and understanding of insurance and costs\n* Learning about types of insurance coverage and how to select/access coverage\n* Navigating one's coverage plan\n* Managing care costs\n\nThese sessions will be 30 minutes, with one session done each week over a four week period.\n\nAfter completing the HIEP participants will be given a second survey including similar questions to those in the first survey. After the post survey is complete, participants will also be given brief open-ended interview questions to obtain feedback on the acceptability of the content and potential implementation issue areas, as well as any discordance in cultural values, beliefs, or feelings about health insurance."
