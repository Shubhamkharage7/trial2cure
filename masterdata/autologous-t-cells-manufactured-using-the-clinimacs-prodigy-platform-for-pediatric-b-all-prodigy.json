The time and significant personnel resources in this process can result in patient safety issues - with patients growing sicker, with harder to control leukemias - in the waiting period between T cell collection and completed CAR T cell product manufacture. Use of the CliniMACS Prodigy platform, that allows for semi-automated clinical-scale processing of huCART19 cell products in a functionally closed, sterile system, rapidly, without many of the logistical burdens encountered in the first-generation manufacturing method, can help to surmount these issues. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of moving to a second-generation manufacturing process using the CliniMACS Prodigy platform to manufacture huCART19 cells."

Steroids for disease treatment at times other than cell collection or at the time of infusion are permitted. Use of physiologic replacement hydrocortisone or inhaled steroids is permitted as well.\n5. CNS disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.\n6. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.\n7.
