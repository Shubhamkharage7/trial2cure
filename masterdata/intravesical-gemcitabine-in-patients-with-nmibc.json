            "briefSummary": "Intravesical immunotherapy or chemotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is a well-established treatment for preventing or delaying tumor recurrence after bladder tumor resection. For high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, immunotherapy in the form of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) can be effective as first-line, nevertheless, the response rate to BCG is suboptimal with many patients failing treatment. Following BCG-failure, however, very few effective therapeutic options exist besides life-changing cystectomy. In addition, nationwide shortages of BCG have pushed the use of alternative intravesical therapies for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. At Banner University Medical-Tucson, the use of intravesical Gemcitabine is considered as standard treatment for patients with bladder cancer who are unable to get BCG or have failed prior BCG treatment. The role of Gemcitabine as treatment for NBMIC is poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the use of Gemcitabine intravesical chemotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in a prospective cohort of patients."
