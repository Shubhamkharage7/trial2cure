In partnership with clinical investigators, patients will work on the development and management of data collection, the research agenda, and the sharing of research findings. The PCOSC Study will promote the advancement of research that provides reliable, useful, and meaningful information to patients with PCOS and their clinicians.\n\nThe population for The PCOS Challenge Study will include individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PCOS, individuals self-diagnosed with PCOS, individuals with symptoms of PCOS (e.g., hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles), and demographic-matched controls without PCOS."
