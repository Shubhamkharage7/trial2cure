            "briefSummary": "The National Eye Institute estimated about 3 million people over age 40 in the US had low vision in 2010 and projects an increase to nearly 5 million in 2030 and 9 million in 2050. Current assistive technologies are a patchwork of mostly low-technology aids with limited capabilities that are often difficult to use, and are not widely adopted. This shortfall in capabilities of assistive technology often stems from lack of a user-centered design approach and is a critical barrier to improve the everyday activities of life (EDAL) and the quality of life (QOL) for individuals with low vision.\n\nAn intuitive head mounted display (HMD) system on enhancing orientation and mobility (O\\&M) and crosswalk navigation, could improve independence, potentially decrease falls, and improve EDAL and QOL. The central hypothesis is that an electronic navigation system incorporating computer vision will enhance O\\&M for individuals with low vision. The goal is to develop and validate a smartHMD by incorporating advanced computer vision algorithms and flexible user interfaces that can be precisely tailored to an individual's O\\&M need. This project will address the specific question of mobility while the subject crosses a street at a signaled crosswalk. This is a dangerous and difficult task for visually impaired patients and a significant barrier to independent mobility."
