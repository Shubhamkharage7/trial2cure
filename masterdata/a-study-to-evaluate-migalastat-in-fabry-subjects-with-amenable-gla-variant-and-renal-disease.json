Subjects may have had previous exposure to migalastat, either commercially or as a participant in a previous migalastat study.\n\nTwo distinct populations of subjects with Fabry disease and renal impairment will be enrolled into this study:\n\n* Cohort 1: Subjects with SRI not receiving any type of dialysis treatment\n* Cohort 2: ESRD subjects who are receiving hemodialysis treatment, either standard hemodialysis (HD) or hemodiafiltration (HDF). Only subjects who can receive HD/HDF at the study clinic or at an affiliated center where the Investigator already has oversight should be enrolled into Cohort 2.\n\nSubjects entering into this study will undergo screening (Visit 1) to confirm enrollment eligibility including confirmatory GLA genotyping. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will have a Baseline Visit (Visit 2) within 30 days of screening. Subjects who do not meet eligibility criteria (eg, subjects with an eGFR \\> 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) may be re-screened."
