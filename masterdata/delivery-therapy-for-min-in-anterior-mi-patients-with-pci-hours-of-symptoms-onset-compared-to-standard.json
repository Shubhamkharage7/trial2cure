Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the required study medications or contrast that cannot be adequately premedicated.\n16. Subjects presenting with or developing in the cath lab prior to completion of the PCI procedure any of the following conditions: cardiogenic shock (SBP \\<80 mmHg for \\>30 minutes), or requiring IV pressors or emergent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella, or other hemodynamic support for hypotension treatment, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation for \\>10 minutes, or ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia requiring cardioversion or defibrillation.\n17. Severe known cardiac valvular stenosis or insufficiency, pericardial disease, or cardiomyopathy.\n18. Subject is a member of a vulnerable population or has any significant medical or social condition which in the investigator's opinion may interfere with the subject's participation in the study or ability to comply with follow-up procedures, including MRI (e.g. alcoholism, dementia, lives far from the research center, etc.).\n19. Current participation in other investigational device or drug study that has not reached its primary endpoint.\n20. Previous enrollment in this study.\n21. Subject is currently hospitalized for definite or suspected COVID-19.\n22.

Subject is asymptomatic (never ill) and COVID-19 PCR/antigen or antibody test is positive within the prior 4 weeks unless subject remained asymptomatic for\u22654 weeks after the last positive test.\n\n    ANGIOGRAPHIC EXCLUSION CRITERIA: These are evaluated after the subject has provided signed Informed Consent and has undergone cardiac catheterization and PCI if indicated:\n24. Treatment during the index procedure of any lesion in either the left main, LCX (including the ramus), and/or RCA.\n25. Post-index procedure planned intervention within 7 days (i.e., PCI of non-target lesions in any vessel, or CABG). Note: Planned revascularization (PCI or bypass) of a non-target lesion \\>7 days following the index procedure and after performance of the 2-7day MRI is allowed.\n26. Anterior MI is due to thrombosis within or adjacent to a previously implanted stent.\n27. Left ventriculography (mandatory before or after PCI, but in all cases before randomization) demonstrates severe mitral regurgitation, a ventricular septal defect, a pseudoaneurysm, aortic dissection or other mechanical complications of MI.\n28. Any left main coronary artery stenosis \\>20%.\n29. Any untreated LAD or diagonal branch lesion is present with diameter stenosis \\> 50% in a vessel with reference vessel diameter \\> 2.0 mm (visually estimated).\n30.
