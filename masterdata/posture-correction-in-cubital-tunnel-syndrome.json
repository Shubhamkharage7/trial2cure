All patients who are eligible to participate and who consent to participate will be randomized to either receive standard of care treatment alone, or standard of care treatment with the additional intervention of posture training. The nature of the intervention prevents blinding. All patients will be followed for 6 weeks and evaluated for symptom improvement or resolution.\n\nAll patients aged 18 and older who present to clinic with cubital tunnel syndrome of any severity and who have not previously undergone surgical intervention for this condition will be eligible to participate in this study. All participants must be amenable to conservative management of CuTS, wearing a posture training device daily, completing the accompanying questionnaires throughout the study, and returning for follow-up."
