            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to assess sulfasalazine as a potential treatment to prevent recurrent preterm birth. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does sulfasalazine down regulate corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) levels in pregnant persons with a prior history of preterm birth?\n* Does sulfasalazine reduce the incidence of recurrent preterm birth in pregnant persons given drug vs. controls?\n\nConsenting participants will be randomized to receive sulfasalazine or to a control group and will undergo serial blood draws to assess plasma CRH levels.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a study to assess the potential for sulfasalazine to prevent recurrent preterm birth. The investigators' main objective is to assess the effects of sulfasalazine on the maternal serum biomarker CRH, which is associated with preterm birth.\n\nThe will be a pilot randomized controlled trial of pregnant multiparous patients who have had a prior preterm delivery. Pregnant women with a prior preterm birth are at high risk (about 20-30%) of having a recurrent preterm birth. The goal of the study will be to evaluate the effect of sulfasalazine on the maternal serum biomarker CRH at 28, 32, and 36 weeks gestation after randomization of patients to the study drug.\n\nSecondary objectives include evaluating the effect of sulfasalazine on the outcome of delivery less than 37 weeks gestation in this group of high risk pregnant women. Additional composite neonatal outcomes will be assessed.\n\nThe proposed study has the potential to identify a novel, low-cost, orally available treatment for preterm delivery based on in vitro evidence and epidemiologic studies suggesting that sulfasalazine may be an effective intervention to prevent preterm birth. If the hypothesis put forth by the investigators is confirmed, sulfasalazine would be an attractive therapeutic intervention that could be implemented for the prevention of preterm birth in both developed and developing nations."
