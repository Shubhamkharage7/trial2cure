Total duration of enrollment, 12 month follow-up and analysis is expected to take approximately 30 months. The clinical investigation has been designed to follow the surgeon's standard of care for subjects treated with a cephalomedullary nail for femoral fractures or and deformities, in addition to a 12 month follow-up visit.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is demonstration of bone consolidation by 12 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy/performance of the Gamma 4 System. Enrolled subjects will undergo an initial assessment, with follow-up evaluations at 3 Months, 6 Months, and 12 Months after the index procedure.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is demonstration of bone consolidation by 12 months, as measured by the Investigator.\n\nSecondary endpoints will include safety through reporting the incidence of device related intra-operative and post-operative adverse events by 12 months, patient reported outcome measures (SF-35v2 and Modified Harris Hip Score), and other specific health outcomes.\n\nEfficacy will be assessed through non-inferiority of bone consolidation proportion compared to the pooled literature control, as well as the SF-36 score results by 12 months."
