            "detailedDescription": "This is a two phase pilot study to develop and pilot the UPLYFT (Understand and Prevail: Lymphoma Fear of Recurrence Therapy) program intervention that includes lymphoma survivorship information and acceptance and commitment therapy strategies to alleviate fear of cancer recurrence, reduce distress, and improve quality of life among lymphoma survivors.\n\nPhase 1 will be a two-part development process of the UPLYFT program based on interview feedback from lymphoma and mental health clinicians and then feedback from a six-person group of lymphoma survivors after participation in an UPLYFT program field test. Phase 2 is a randomized pilot study using the UPLFYT program finalized in Phase 1.\n\nResearch procedures include:\n\n* In depth interview (lymphoma and mental health clinicians)\n* Screening for eligibility\n* 6 weekly intervention sessions (lymphoma survivors)\n* Baseline Assessments and Questionnaires (lymphoma survivors)\n\n  74 people are expected to participate in this study with 14 in Phase 1 and 60 in Phase 2.\n\nThe American Society of Hematology is providing funding for the trial."
