            "briefSummary": "This study, A3921210 is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of tofacitinib in pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC. In the US and EU, patients with prior TNFi failure or intolerance will be enrolled. Outside of the US or EU, patients having had inadequate response or intolerance to oral or IV corticosteroids or azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine or TNFi will be enrolled.\n\nAll eligible participants will initially receive open label tofacitinib at a dose expected to produce equivalent systemic exposure to that observed in adults receiving 5 mg BID with the option for individual dose increase to 10 mg BID adult dose equivalent if dose escalation criteria are met.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tofacitinib based on remission in pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC. The primary endpoint is remission by central read Mayo score following 44 weeks in the maintenance phase. Remission is defined by a Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0.\n\nThe study Design is an open-label Phase 3 study that includes a screening period of up to 4-weeks duration, an 8-week or 16-week induction phase, a 44-week maintenance phase, and a 24-month extension phase for pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC. Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last dose of study intervention and a telephone contact 8 weeks later to assess for any adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs). The total maximum duration of this study will be up to 180 weeks."
