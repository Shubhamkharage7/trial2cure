Women of child-bearing age who are sexually active but decline to take proper contraceptive measures during the study period, unless the female is post-menopausal for at least 2 years or are surgically sterile.\n\n    * Note: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and Women not of childbearing potential are eligible to participate. Women of childbearing potential should use an approved method of birth control and agrees to continue to use this method for the duration of the study (and for 30 days after taking the last dose of investigational product).\n    * Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, female subject/partner's use of hormonal contraceptive (oral, implanted, or injected) in conjunction with a barrier method (WOCBP only), female subject/partner's use of an intrauterine device (IUD), or if the female subject/partner is surgically sterile or 2 years post-menopausal. All male subjects/partners of WOCBP must agree to consistently and correctly use a condom for the duration of the study and for 30 days after taking the study drug. In addition, subjects may not donate ova or donate sperm for the duration of the study and for 30 days after taking the last dose investigational product.\n\nA subject who is randomized into the study, but who does not complete the study will be considered prematurely discontinued.\n\nAt any point during the study all subjects have the right to withdraw without prejudice to future care. Documentation to whether or not each subject completed the clinical study will be recorded. If for any subject, study treatment was discontinued, the reason(s) will be documented.\n\nThe Investigator can discontinue a subject at any time if in their clinical judgment it is considered to be medically necessary. Investigators considering discontinuing study treatment should contact the medical monitor prior to such discontinuation. Subjects who have study treatment discontinued will continue to be followed per protocol (i.e., to complete EOT Visit and Visit 11 assessments), whenever possible. Subjects who have study treatment discontinued due to a serious adverse event will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. Reasons for subject withdrawal/discontinuation may constitute one of the following:\n\n* Voluntary withdrawal of his/her informed consent\n* Administration of any prohibited medication unless otherwise approved by the investigator(s)\n* Serious adverse event or adverse drug reaction that causes withdrawal from the study, such as development of acute pancreatitis\n* Severe breach against this protocol such as breach of any inclusion or exclusion criteria\n* When Investigator judges aortic valve surgery or procedure is necessary due to progression of disease as per the Critical Pathways presented in American and European Society of Cardiology\n* Failure to trace the subject - out of contact, etc. - for follow-up observation\n* Pregnancy\n* Discontinuation of study by the Sponsor",
