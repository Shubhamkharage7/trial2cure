The purpose of this study is to determine if 12 weeks of the culturally adapted and fully remote De Pie y a Movernos intervention improves self-efficacy, habit strength, social support, and enjoyment for physical activity (PA), thus promoting adherence to moderate-intensity physical activity (MIPA) guidelines (150 minutes/week).",
            "detailedDescription": "Building on the cultural adaptation of our preliminary R61 De Pie pilot study, study staff will randomize 130 Hispanic/Latino adults without dementia and over age 55 from Southern California to either the culturally adapted De Pie physical activity intervention or an active comparison program, Healthy Actions and Lifestyles to Avoid Dementia (HALT-AD), focusing on general brain health topics. The investigators will determine if De Pie improves physical activity (Aim 1) and psychosocial mediators (self-efficacy, habit strength, social support, and enjoyment for physical activity, \\[PA\\]), thus promoting adherence to moderate-intensity physical activity (MIPA) guidelines (150 minutes/week; Aim 2). The intervention period lasts 12 weeks.\n\nThe investigators target middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino adults that are under-studied and have a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), compared to non-Hispanic White older adults. Study staff employ a community engaged and collaborative approach to culturally adaptive the intervention framework and a staircase intervention approach designed to build self-efficacy, PA habit strength, social support, and PA enjoyment. Results will inform culturally adapted, theory-based approaches to prevent ADRD in the Hispanic/Latino community."
