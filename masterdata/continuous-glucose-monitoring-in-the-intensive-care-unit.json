The overall goal is to validate the accuracy and practicality of the Dexcom G7 when used to assess glycemia in critically ill patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "The specific goals are 1) to work with intensive care unit (ICU) staff, in a respiratory ICU setting, to determine how best to place and maintain Dexcom G7 continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) on patients and how to place recording devices and chargers in that environment, 2) download CGM readings to the Dexcom Dashboard in an analyzable format, and 3) to compare simultaneous CGM readings with glucose measurements obtained in the course of routine care as recorded in the electronic medical record. The primary analytical goal is the correlation of CGM glucose measurements with those obtained in the course of routine care. A secondary goal is to determine the frequency of device malfunctions that occur either as a result of device failure (e.g. it falls off) or adverse events (e.g. removal due to skin irritation).\n\nStudy subjects will be patients admitted to the 6-ICU UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMMC) University Campus medical intensive care unit for any reason who have known diabetes or who are hyperglycemic (blood glucose concentration \u2265200 mg/dL) with diabetes that was previously undiagnosed or unrecognized. All enrolled volunteers will have a Dexcom G7 CGM place on the skin according to manufacturer's specifications. The devices will remain in place for 10 days or until discharge from the ICU"
