Learning more about the characteristics of potentially eligible patients, including reasons for inpatient admission, rates of major complications, and situations or treatments that would be difficult to deliver in an at home setting may help to inform future program development.",

Estimate the major complication rate among patients potentially eligible for a hospital at home program for management of neutropenic fever.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients potentially eligible for admission to a hospital at home program for management of neutropenic fever.\n\nII. Describe situations or treatments experienced by potentially eligible patients admitted for neutropenic fever that would be difficult to accomplish in a hypothetical hospital at home program (e.g., blood transfusions, echocardiograms, computed tomography \\[CT\\] scans).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients' medical charts are reviewed."
