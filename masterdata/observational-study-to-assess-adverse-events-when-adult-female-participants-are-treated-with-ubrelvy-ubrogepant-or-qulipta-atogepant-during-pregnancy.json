The purpose of this study is to evaluate fetal, maternal, and infant outcomes through 12 months of age among women exposed to Ubrelvy or Qulipta during pregnancy, as well as in 2 comparator groups.\n\nUbrelvy (ubrogepant) and Qulipta (atogepant) are approved drugs for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Approximately 628 pregnant women with migraine exposed to Ubrelvy, 628 pregnant women with migraine exposed to Qulipta and 628 pregnant women with migraine in comparator group will be enrolled in this study in the United States.\n\nParticipants enrolled in the Ubrelvy-exposed group and Qulipta-exposed group will receive Ubrelvy and Qulipta respectively as prescribed by their physician."
