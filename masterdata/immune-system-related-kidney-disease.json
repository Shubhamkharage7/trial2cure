It will attempt to provide information about the causes and specific abnormalities associated with autoimmune kidney disease.\n\nPatients with kidney disease as a result of their immune system, and patients with diseases of the immune system who may later develop kidney disease, will be potential subjects for this study.\n\nPatients will undergo a history and physical examination, and standard laboratory test to more closely understand the causes, signs, symptoms, and responses to medication of these diseases. Based on these evaluations the patients may qualify as candidates for other experimental studies. At any time these patients may be asked to submit blood or urine samples for further research.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study evaluates participants with known or suspected immunologically-mediated kidney diseases, including but not limited to nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and nephritis associated with other systemic or connective tissue disorders. Participants who have immunologically-mediated diseases with potential for kidney disease will be evaluated as well. Studies will include characterization of the clinical and laboratory features of these disorders, studies of natural history and complications, evaluation of responses to standard treatment. Blood and urine samples will be collected for immunological research conducted under this protocol.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary:\n\n-To collect samples and data obtained during standard clinical care that can be used to better understand rare forms of immunologically-mediated renal disorders, atypical renal disease that have not been fully characterized, and to allow for future research studies.\n\nExploratory:\n\n* Characterize immunologically-mediated kidney diseases with regard to immune dysregulation, immune cell populations and role of complement activation.\n* Development of assays for novel antibodies.\n* Search for additional antibodies involved in the pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy and other glomerular diseases.\n* Assess changes in metabolic (e.g. vitamin D, lipids) and endocrine function (e.g. thyroid, adrenal function) during the evolution of the nephrotic state, during treatment and during remission.\n* Identify disease-causing memory B cells in participants with membranous nephropathy and correlation with membranous nephropathy relapse. Assess biological effects of phospholipase A2-receptor antibody epitope on the isolated memory B-cells.\n* Compare immune cell types, including B and T cell populations and cell type specific markers in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated kidney disease.\n* Compare changes in metabolome and proteome of urine and blood during the nephrotic syndrome, during treatment and in remission.\n* Computational analysis of renal structures which may provide predictive methods that would discriminate progressors from non-progressors beyond sclerosis in membranous nephropathy."
