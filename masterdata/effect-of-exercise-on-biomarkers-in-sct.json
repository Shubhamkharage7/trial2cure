            "briefSummary": "This study measures the effect of exercise on a variety of biomarkers in blood and urine selected to evaluate the physiological pathways of hemolysis, myolysis, thrombosis, inflammation, and renal function in subjects with sickle cell trait. These pathways have been shown to be associated with adverse events in athletes and warfighters with SCT upon protracted, repeated, strenuous exertion. Changes in biomarkers post-exercise compared to pre-exercise (and compared to healthy controls) suggest activation of the associated pathway(s) which may contribute to exercise-related events in athletes and warfighters and subclinical complications in non-athletes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects with sickle cell trait and healthy controls will be subjected to a single bout of moderate, controlled exercise on a treadmill. Blood and urine samples will be collected before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 24 hours after exercise. Fifteen biomarkers, three selected to evaluate each of the five physiologic pathways previously listed, will be tested at each of the three time points. Abnormal biomarkers before exercise suggest chronic pathway activation while exacerbated levels after exercise suggest further activation stimulated by exercise. Biomarker levels 24 hours post-exercise will be used to evaluate continued pathway activation or pathway recovery. By definition, 95% of health controls will show normal biomarker levels pre-exercise and biomarker patterns post-exercise will serve as the expected standard by which to compare the test subjects."

Written data sharing requests from outside researchers will be reviewed by the PI and other members of the research team. Sharing will require a written agreement between the involved parties, which specifies the following: (1) what data will be shared, (2) who will have access to the shared data, (3) how the data will be shared and where the shared data will be stored (including details about security for data transfer and storage), (4) when the data will be shared, and (5) details about the data (i.e. data formats/transformations for sharing, meta-data to be included, etc.). The agreement will also require a commitment to using the data only for the specified research purposes and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Before sharing occurs, the written agreement will also be reviewed and approved by the the appropriate University units.",
