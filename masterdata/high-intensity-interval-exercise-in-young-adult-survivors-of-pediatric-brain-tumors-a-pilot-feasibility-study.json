            "detailedDescription": "This is a Pilot/Feasibility, randomized control, research study that will compare an exercise group to a control group on physical, social, and overall quality of life needs of pediatric brain tumor survivors who are now young adults.\n\nParticipants will be randomized (selected at random) for two groups: HIIT program group will complete a 16-week intervention period followed by a 16-week period with no intervention and the waitlisted control group will complete a 16-week period and will perform their usual, daily activities followed by an optional 16-week period in which they can complete the HIIT program.\n\nResearch procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including in-clinic evaluations of fitness and strength, blood collection, at-home zoom exercise sessions, self-administered activity logs, and survey questionnaires.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last about 8 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe Stahl Family Charitable Foundation, Pedal 4 Pediatrics, and the Childhood Brain Tumor Foundation are supporting this research study by providing funding for the study."
