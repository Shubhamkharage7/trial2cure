Two year actuarial survival\n2. Freedom from procedures to repair, or replace the implanted device\n3. Freedom from stroke resulting in a Modified Rankin Score of \\>3 at the two-year follow-up\n\nStudy Success for Primary Endpoint B will be established if the proportion of subjects in the Treatment Group meeting the Subject Success Criteria B is determined to be superior to that of the Control Group (at three years) according to the pre-specified statistical analysis.\n\nSubject composite success requires the subject to achieve the Effectiveness Endpoint:\n\n1.
