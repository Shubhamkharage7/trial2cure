A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u2264 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease\n14. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has had an allogeneic tissue transplant\n15. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention. Note: Administration of killed vaccines are allowed\n16. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ, excluding carcinoma in situ of bladder, that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded\n17. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment\n18. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265 Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients\n19. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis / interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis / interstitial lung disease\n20. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n21. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality, or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study or interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, such that it is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n22. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study\n23. For Combination Arm 2 Only: Has received radiation therapy to the lung that is \\> 30Gy within 6 months of the first dose of trial treatment",
