Patients will undergo surgical excision or Mohs surgery as is clinically indicated and part of usual care. The study will be a double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be assigned to one of three participant categories: 1) patients undergoing repair with skin flap or graft on the nose, 2) patients undergoing repair with skin graft, flap, or wedge resection on the ear, or 3) patients undergoing Mohs surgery with closure or partial closure or surgical excision on the lower extremity below the knee. Within each category, participants will be randomized into one of two groups: group one will receive a preoperative placebo pill and group two will receive preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (either a single dose of Cephalexin 2g PO or single dose of Clindamycin hydrochloride 600 mg PO if allergy to penicillin or cephalosporin).\n\nPatients will followed for 30 days +/- 7 after surgery to evaluate for any surgical site infection."
