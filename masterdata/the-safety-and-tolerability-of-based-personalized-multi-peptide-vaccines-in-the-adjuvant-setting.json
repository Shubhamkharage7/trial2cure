Somatic mutations may be characterized through the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies, and the resulting sequence data used to identify TSA. Sequence data can inform the design of patient-specific immune-based therapies, which may be capable of inducing quantitative changes in the concentration of circulating antigen-specific T lymphocytes directed against TSA, which may in-turn lead to immune-mediated elimination of residual malignant cells."

Non-invasive non-melanoma skin cancer such as superficial basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.\n  2. Subjects with tumors of the prostate with a combined Gleason Score \u2264 7\n  3. Patients with other completely resected malignancies in the prior three years and no evidence of disease will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with eligibility determined based on discussion with the Principal Investigator.\n* The subject has a prior history of unrelated neoplastic disease and has received systemic therapy for the secondary malignancy within the twelve (12) month period preceding the screening evaluation.\n* The subject has a history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C with positive PCR.\n* The subject has a history of, or is reasonably suspected to meet criteria for the diagnosis of a known congenital or acquired disorder causing systemic immunosuppression; or the subject is currently receiving any drug or supplement which is known to be associated with systemic immune suppression including those drugs which are prescribed for solid organ or stem cell transplant, autoimmune/inflammatory disorders, or other related medical conditions.\n* The subject has a history of, or is reasonably suspected to meet criteria for the diagnosis of a systemic auto-immune/inflammatory disease or other autoimmune disorder with the exception of:\n\n  1. Vitiligo\n  2. Hypothyroidism\n* The subject has a history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions relating to administration of any components of the investigational product.\n* The subject has a history of serious allergic reaction to any substance, resulting in hospitalization or requiring other emergent medical attention.\n* The subject has a history of advanced cardiac, hepatic or renal disease or other chronic illness.\n* The subject has been diagnosed and treated at an external facility, and the resulting tissue specimen is of insufficient quality such that it precludes clinical sequencing or any other necessary study procedure, and the subject is unwilling to undergo an additional biopsy procedure.\n* Previous treatment with therapeutic cancer vaccine of any type\n* The subject is less than eighteen (18) years of age, or otherwise unable to give informed consent due to minor status.\n* The subject is a prisoner, as defined by \\[45 CFR 46.303(c)\\].\n* The subject is cognitively impaired, and unable to give informed consent.",
