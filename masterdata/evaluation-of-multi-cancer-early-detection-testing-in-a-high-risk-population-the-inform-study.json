The test looks for small pieces of genetic material called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the blood that may indicate the presence of cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, blood tests, questionnaires, and clinic visits.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last up to 3 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 1,000 people will take part in this research study."
