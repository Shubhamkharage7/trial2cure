Second, premalignant lesions such as adenomatous polyps, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia can be discovered and removed with local resection, akin to polypectomies during screening colonoscopies, preventing the development of cancer. Third, EGD discovery and treatment of active Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection of the stomach provides an opportunity for primary prevention of GC.",

Estimate Median added time needed for EGD at the time of routine screening colonoscopy\n2. Estimate the frequencies of adverse events\n3. Estimate the percentage of pre-cancer and cancerous lesions including H. pylori infection, chronic atrophic gastritis, IM, dysplasia and GC among this high GC risk population\n4. Investigate whether high-risk racial/ethnicity groups have different likelihood of uptake of EGD, and whether the likelihood is associated with patient beliefs, attitudes and knowledge of GC, perceptions of risk, motivators and barriers, and sociocultural factors, as well as patient preference and satisfaction with EGD-SC"
