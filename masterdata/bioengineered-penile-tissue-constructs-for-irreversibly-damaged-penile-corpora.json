            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of autologous engineered corpora cavernosa + albuginea constructs for treatment of complex penile deformities. Autologous endothelial and smooth muscle cells obtained from enrolled subjects' corpora cavernosa biopsy sample, will be culture expanded in vitro and used to seed decellularized corpora cavernosa + albuginea obtained from cadaveric-donors to create autologous bioengineered corpora cavernosa/albuginea constructs for repair of damaged penile tissues.",
            "detailedDescription": "Damage to penile tissue due to infection, inflammation or trauma often leads to structural deformity that may result in loss of sexual function that can profoundly affect quality of life. Traumatic injuries in civilians and battlefield related injuries in soldiers often require reconstructive procedures to restore the anatomy and functionality of the penis. However, these procedures are often limited by poor availability of functionally intact penile tissue. Various penile reconstructive procedures, such as penile prostheses and autograft implantation have been attempted. While cosmetic appearance may be improved, restoration of spontaneous and natural erectile function is usually not achieved. This is often due to critical defect of the corpora cavernosa, which are responsible for erectile function. Recently, the concept of a tissue engineering-based therapy has been proposed for reconstructing damaged penile corporal tissue.\n\nThe primary objective of this Armed Forces Institute for Regeneration Medicine (AFIRM II) sponsored clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of autologous engineered corpora cavernosa + albuginea constructs for treatment of complex penile deformities. The proposed study design is a prospective non-randomized and uncontrolled, multi-center investigation. Autologous endothelial and smooth muscle cells obtained from enrolled participants' corpora cavernosa biopsy sample, will be culture expanded in vitro and used to seed decellularized corpora cavernosa + albuginea obtained from cadaveric-donors to create autologous bioengineered corpora cavernosa/albuginea constructs for repair of damaged penile tissues.\n\nA total of ten male patients, referred for the treatment of damages of albuginea and/or corpora cavernosum without concurrent urethral injury will be recruited for this study. The estimated duration of the study for each subject following treatment is 36 months. The study team anticipates a duration of approximately 48 to 60 months to complete all enrollment and follow up. Enrolled participants will undergo a corporal tissue biopsy as an out-patient surgical procedure. Autologous corporal smooth muscle cells and corporal endothelial cells will be isolated and then seeded on cadaveric decellularized corporal bodies. Approximately 3-4 weeks later, the engineered construct including corporal tissue with attached tunica will be transplanted into the surgically prepared site of penile injury. Participants will be followed through 36 months post-implantation to monitor for safety."
