            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well pirtobrutinib in combination with rituximab works in treating patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Pirtobrutinib is a BTK inhibitor. It works by blocking the action of the protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving pirtobrutinib in combination with rituximab may be an effective treatment for MZL.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy of the combination of pirtobrutinib and rituximab based on overall response rate (ORR) at the end of cycle (C) 6.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Complete response (CR) rate at end of C6. II. Duration of response (DOR). III. Median and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). IV. Median and 2-year overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the rate of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) at end of C6 and C12.\n\nII. To characterize BTK and PLCG2 gene mutations, concurrently activated oncogenic pathways and the pharmacodynamic response to treatment from peripheral, bone marrow and/or tumor/lymph node biopsies before and during treatment and after disease progression (PD), in select patients.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pirtobrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients with a CR receive pirtobrutinib for an additional 6 cycles and patients with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) receive pirtobrutinib and rituximab for an additional 6 cycles. Patients who then achieve a CR after cycle 12 may continue pirtobrutinib for an additional 6 cycles. Patients with a PR or SD after cycle 12 may continue pirtobrutinib until PD. Patients also undergo blood sample collection, computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and PET throughout the study. Patients may also undergo tissue biopsy at screening and relapse.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months up to disease progression or next anticancer treatment then every 6 months."

In the event of the receipt of radiation therapy, the minimum wash out period is 14 days\n* Patients with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma must be H. pylori negative or have failed a trial of H. pylori eradication\n* Patients with localized MALT lymphoma must be ineligible for, have refused or failed radiation therapy (washout period of 14 days)\n* Adequate coagulation, defined as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin (PT) or (international normalized ratio \\[INR\\] not greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\])\n* Life expectancy of \\> 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator\n* Willingness of women of reproductive potential and their partners to observe highly effective birth control methods for the duration of treatment and for 1 month following the last dose of pirtobrutinib and 12 months following the last rituximab infusion\n* Patients must have an indication for treatment\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 750 cells/mm\\^3 ( \u2265 0.75 x 10\\^9/L) independent of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor \\[G-CSF\\] support, unless there is documented bone marrow involvement or splenomegaly with ensuing cytopenia in which case ANC of 500 cells/mm\\^3 (0.5 x 10\\^9/L) is permissible. Also, there should be no evidence of myelodysplasia or hypoplastic bone marrow\n* Platelet count \u2265 50,000 cells/mm\\^3 (\u2265 50 x 10\\^9/L) independent of transfusion support unless there is documented bone marrow involvement in which case platelet count of 30,000 cells/mm\\^3 (0.3 x 10\\^9/L) is permissible. Patients must be responsive to transfusion support if given for thrombocytopenia and patients refractory to transfusion support are not eligible. Also, there should be no evidence of myelodysplasia or hypoplastic bone marrow\n\n  * The platelet count threshold in the current study (\u2265 50,000 cells/mm\\^3 or \u2265 50 x 10\\^9/L) is lower than normal threshold (\u2265 75,000 cells/mm\\^3 or \u2265 75 x 10\\^9/L) as the majority of MZL patients have lower than normal platelets due to splenomegaly and or autoimmune phenomena (which are related to the underlying lymphoma) and hence the lower than normal platelet count threshold for study entry\n* Hemoglobin of \u2265 8 g/dL (\u2265 80 g/L) independent of transfusion support unless there is documented bone marrow involvement or splenomegaly with ensuing cytopenia in which case hemoglobin of 7 g/dL (70 g/L) is permissible.

QTcF is calculated using Fridericia's Formula (QTcF):\n\n  * Correction of suspected drug induced QTcF prolongation can be attempted at the investigator's discretion and only if clinically safe to do so with either discontinuation of the offending drug or switch to another drug not known to be associated with QTcF prolongation\n  * Correction for underlying bundle branch block (BBB) allowed\n  * Note: Patients with pacemakers are eligible if they have no history of fainting or clinically relevant arrhythmias while using the pacemaker\n* Patients who have tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are excluded due to potential drug-drug interactions between anti-retroviral medications and pirtobrutinib and risk of opportunistic infections with both HIV and irreversible BTK inhibitors\n* Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection based on criteria below:\n\n  * Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are excluded. Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and negative HBsAg require hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation before enrollment. Patients who are HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) PCR positive will be excluded. Patients with positive anti-HBc and negative HBV DNA should be on prophylactic nucleo(t)side analogue therapy to prevent reactivation with serial HBV DNA PCR monitoring\n  * Hepatitis C virus (HCV): positive hepatitis C antibody. If positive hepatitis C antibody result, patient will need to have a negative result for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) before enrollment. Patients who are hepatitis C RNA positive will be excluded\n* Known active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Unknown or negative status are eligible\n* Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including but not limited to, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection (except for fungal nail infection), or other clinically significant active disease process which in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor may pose a risk for patient participation. Screening for chronic conditions is not required\n* Active uncontrolled auto-immune cytopenia (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia \\[AIHA\\], idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura \\[ITP\\]) for which new therapy was introduced or existing therapy was escalated within the 4 weeks prior to study enrollment to maintain adequate blood counts\n* Active second malignancy unless in remission and with life expectancy \\> 2 years\n* Pregnancy or plan to become pregnant during the study or within 1 month of the last dose of pirtobrutinib or 12 months following the last rituximab infusion\n* Lactation or plan to breastfeed during the study or within 1 week of the last dose of pirtobrutinib or 6 months following the last rituximab infusion\n* Patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin or another vitamin K antagonist\n* Receipt of live-virus vaccines within 28 days prior to the initiation of study treatment or need for live-virus vaccines at any time during study treatment\n* Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of Pirtobrutinib",
