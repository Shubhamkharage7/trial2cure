            "detailedDescription": "A patient advisory council (PAC) was recruited from established hospital and community networks (North Carolina Cancer Hospital's Patient and Family Advisory Board, and the Lineberger Community Outreach and Engagement Office's Community Advisory Board). The PAC informed the content of interview guides, questionnaire/survey instruments, and mHealth app design, and will be involved in the analyses of qualitative and quantitative data, and dissemination of study results.\n\nAfter analysis of the in-depth interviews, the Connected Health for Applications and Interventions (CHAI) core staff developed a progressive web application \"mHealth app\". mHealth app was tested in a pilot study included 20 African American (AA) patients diagnosed with breast cancer were interviewed to answer questions that will better inform the clinical trial education and communication needs of Black women with breast cancer.\n\nEighty African American women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who have access to a mobile device or computer will be recruited for the study intervention. Women will receive access to the \"mHealth\" app, a list of available clinical trials within a 50-mile radius of their zip code, and the existing standard of care packet of cancer center resources. Participants will complete a brief questionnaire that will assess clinical trial knowledge, how often a clinical trial discussion occurred during their oncology appointment, and if a therapeutic trial was offered."
