            "briefSummary": "The investigators will compare the application of two different creams for the treatment of low-risk skin cancers-superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCis). 5-Fluorouracil cream is currently FDA approved for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma and is routinely used by dermatologists across the country and at Boston Medical Center (BMC) for SCCis. The normal treatment regimen is 4 weeks of the 5-fluorouracil cream for both skin cancers.\n\nThe application of a compounded cream consisting of 1:1 ratio 5-fluorouracil with calcipotriene will be tested. This combination cream has been shown to clear pre-skin cancers called actinic keratoses and prevent future skin cancers from developing. This combination cream for 7-14 days to see if this shorter treatment course provides clearance of the 2 types of skin cancer. This combination cream is successfully used in this manner to treat other subtypes of related skin cancers. This will be a pilot study with\n\nThe primary endpoint for this pilot randomized single blinded clinical trial will be the response to treatment (yes versus no). The lesions will be assessed clinically for clearance of cancer, as would normally be done and is consistent with how comparable studies have assessed clearance. Participants will be followed closely afterwards for three years with visits at 6 months, which does not vary from standard practice. If the lesions are not clear of cancer or equivocal clinically, the lesions will be re-biopsied and normal standard of care procedure will take place."
