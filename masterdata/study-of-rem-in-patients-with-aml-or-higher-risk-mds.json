The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REM-422 in patients with higher risk MDS or relapsed/refractory AML. The purpose of Dose Expansion is to further evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of the RP2D carried forward from Dose Escalation.\n\nParticipation in this study will continue until disease progression, therapy intolerance, or participant withdrawal."
