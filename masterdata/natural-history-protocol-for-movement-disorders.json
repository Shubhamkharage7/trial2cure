            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nA movement disorder is a condition that causes a person s body to move in ways that are not normal. There are different types. Some disorders cause movements people can t control, such as tics or shaking. Some cause reduced or slow movements. Movement disorders can cause disability in people. Sometimes members of the same family will have the same disorder. Researchers want to learn more about how people develop these disorders. This research could lead to better treatments.\n\nObjective:\n\nThis natural history study will collect data on people with different types of movement disorders. It will also collect data on their family members. The data will support further research.\n\nEligibility:\n\nChildren and adults aged 2 years and older who have a movement disorder. Family members of people with movement disorders are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will undergo screening. They will have a physical exam. Researchers will look at their existing medical images. Any photographs or videos of their movements will also be reviewed.\n\nMost participants will come to the NIH clinic for only 1 visit. They will answer questions about their condition. They will have normal tests used to diagnose their condition. They may have blood tests and different types of imaging scans. They may have tests to see how well their nerves function. The tests used will depend on the type of disorder they have.\n\nFamily members will have some of the same tests as people with disorders.\n\nParticipants will not receive any new treatments.\n\nSome participants may be asked to return for a follow-up visit.\n\nUp to 4000 people may participate.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is a Natural History and Screening protocol for movement disorders, no research procedures will be done but the resulting data will be used for research.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To collect data as part of standard of care evaluation of patients who have or are suspected to have a movement disorder and their family members for use in future secondary research.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nCollection of data from clinical/routine care that will contribute to/be used for future research."
