Secondary objectives include characterization of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and other biomarker efficacy assessments of the impact of AMXT 1501 in combination with IV DFMO on polyamine uptake by circulating lymphocytes (blood cells). To these aims, the study will evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and other biomarker efficacy profiles of orally-administered AMXT 1501 and IV DFMO. Approximately, 56 patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMXT 1501 and IV DFMO in combination. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below at which dose escalation is stopped."

In the event that a single QTcF is \\>480 ms, the patient may enroll if the average QTcF for the 3 ECGs is \\<480 ms.\n  * For patients with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval \\>120 ms), the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTcF with Sponsor approval. The JTc must be \\<340 ms if JTc is used in place of the QTcF.\n  * Patients with an intraventricular delay due to a left bundle branch block are excluded.\n\nNote: QTcF prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal\n\n* Had major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4-weeks prior to Day 1.\n* Have active bacterial, viral, or fungal infections requiring systemic therapy.\n* Women who are pregnant or lactating: NOTE: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment.\n\n  * Women not OCBP is defined as\n  * (i) Postmenopausal with \\>1 year since last menses\n\n    * -- (a) If \\<65 years old, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) \\>40 mIU/mL.\n    * -- (b) If \u226565 years old and not on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), FSH \\>30 mIU/mL.\n    * -- (c)If \u226565 years old and on HRT, the FSH requirement is not applicable. Postmenopausal females on HRT will be allowed if HRT has been stable for \u22656 months prior to dosing of study drug(s).\n  * Written medical documentation of being sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy, double oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) with the procedure performed \u22656 months prior to dosing study drug(s).\n\nNote: Tubal ligation is not considered a form of permanent sterilization.\n\n* Patients may not have any unresolved toxicity \\>Grade 1 from previous anticancer therapy, except for stable chronic toxicities that are not expected to resolve (i.e., peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, etc.). Patients who have an ongoing requirement for thyroid replacement therapy from prior exposure to a checkpoint inhibitor but who are clinically euthyroid are permitted.\n* Have an unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol.\n* Current active liver disease from any cause, including hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M \\[Hep A IgM\\] positive), hepatitis B (hepatitis B virus \\[HBV\\] surface antigen positive), or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\] antibody positive, confirmed by HCV ribonucleic acid). Patients with HCV with undetectable virus after treatment are eligible. Patients with a prior history of HBV are eligible if quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HBV DNA is negative. Note that elevated levels of biotin may interfere with viral serology testing.\n* Have a serious nonmalignant disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Medical Monitor, could compromise protocol objectives.\n* Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agent or who have received an investigational agent within the last 28 days, with the exception of any patient who participated in Study AMXT1501-101A.\n* Known GI disease or procedure that could interfere with the absorption of study drug, including inability to swallow whole capsules or conditions that may interfere with absorption. The Medical Monitor should be contacted for any questions regarding this exclusion criterion.\n* Patients who have exhibited allergic reactions to a similar structural compound, biological agent, or formulation.\n* Use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist / antagonists are not permitted.\n* Use of biotin (i.e., Vitamin B7) or supplements containing biotin higher than the daily adequate intake of 30 \u00b5g (NIH-ODS 2020; Section 5.9.2.1). NOTE: Patients who switch from a high dose to a dose of \u226430 \u00b5g/day are eligible for study entry.\n* Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2. o Exception: Patients with well-controlled HIV (e.g., CD4 \\>350/mm3 and undetectable viral load) are eligible.",
