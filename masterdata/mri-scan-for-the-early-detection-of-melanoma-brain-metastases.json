The standard MRI brain imaging is done on 3T or similar MRI machine, but the 7T MRI machine has a larger magnet which has been shown to have superior resolution of the brain and of non-cancerous brain lesions. Diagnostic procedures such as 7T MRI may help find and diagnose melanoma brain metastases earlier than standard 3T MRI.",

Assess the potential superiority of contrast-enhanced (CE) 7T MRI by comparing to standard of care CE 3T MRI in detecting occult brain metastases lesion at time of diagnosis of new brain metastases.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Describe the imaging characteristics of melanoma brain metastases on 7T MRI of the brain.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate incidence of diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease on CE 7T MRI brain.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nWithin 2 weeks of initial standard of care 3T MRI, patients undergo 7T MRI scan with and without contrast over 1-2 hours."
