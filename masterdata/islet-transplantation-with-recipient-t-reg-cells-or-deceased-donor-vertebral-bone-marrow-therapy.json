The participants will receive either their own immune cells, called regulatory T cells, or immune cells from the bone marrow of the islet donor.",
            "detailedDescription": "Islet transplantation success remains limited by the immediate loss of islet after transplantation, rejection, and side effect from immunosuppression. Preclinical animal models provide evidence that donor bone marrow cells OR regulatory T cells infused at the time of islet transplantation can improve the survival of islets after transplantation and reduce the need for immunosuppression. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of combining an islet transplant with the recipient's Tregs OR deceased donor bone marrow cells in patients with brittle type 1 diabetes."
