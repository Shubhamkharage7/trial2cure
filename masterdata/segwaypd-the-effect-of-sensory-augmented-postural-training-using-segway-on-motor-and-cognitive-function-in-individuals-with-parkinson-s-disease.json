            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of postural training emphasized on the integration of multiple sensory information into motor control in individuals with PD (Parkinson's disease). This project is a proof-of-concept study to assess the effectiveness of postural training using Segway, which serves a platform to provide augmented and continuous proprioceptive and visuospatial information during postural training. Specifically, we will measure postural sway during quiet standing, single and dual-task walking performances, and brain activation during single and dual-task walking from the regions involved in planning and execution of locomotion; these include dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex and primary motor cortex. The changes in visuospatial function and proprioception after training will also be assessed. Individuals with moderate disease stage of PD exhibiting postural instability will be recruited. The participants will receive 1-week training and be assessed at 3 time points: 1-week before, before, and after the training."
