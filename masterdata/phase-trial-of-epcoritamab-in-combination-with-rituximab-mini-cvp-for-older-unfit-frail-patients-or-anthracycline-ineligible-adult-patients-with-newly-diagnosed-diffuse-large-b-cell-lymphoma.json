Hepatitis B or C serologic status: subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are surface antigen negative will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects with a history of Hepatitis C who received antiviral treatment are eligible as long as PCR is negative.\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or intolerance to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy or any bispecific antibody.\n* History of immunodeficiency (with the exception of hypogammaglobulinemia) or concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, etc., or chronic administration glucocorticoid equivalent of \\>10mg/day of prednisone) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug with exception of steroid used for IV contrast allergy. In addition, use of inhaled, topical, intranasal corticosteroids or local steroid injection (eg, intra- articular injection) is permitted.\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of Screening, or any Class 3 (moderate) or Class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification.

For corticosteroids, prednisolone \\>20 mg daily (or equivalent) qualifies as immunosuppressive and thus is excluded for this use. Note: corticosteroids at any dose are permitted for control of lymphoma-related symptoms, including during screening, and for prophylaxis or AE management during the trial.\n* Life expectancy \\< 6 months\n* Neuropathy \\> Grade 1\n* Prior exposure to epcoritamab, independently from indication\n* Patients who have an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* Patients who have a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that require steroids or has current pneumonitis.",
