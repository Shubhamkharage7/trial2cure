Treatment for FSGS is considered unsuccessful if the patient is unresponsive to standard therapy (e.g., at least 8 weeks of corticosteroids) and fails to achieve complete or partial remission. A standard treatment is considered not well tolerated if the patient experiences severe side effects without providing an acceptable level of clinical benefit.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will enroll up to 35 adult patients at 3-10 clinical sites. The duration of the treatment phase of the study will take approximately 9 weeks for a total of 12 apheresis treatments with the LIPOSORBER\u00ae LA-15 System; the treatments will be given twice weekly for 3 weeks followed by once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients will undergo follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the final apheresis treatment.\n\nThis study is conducted as a Post Approval Study imposed by Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) order to confirm the safety and efficacy of the LIPOSORBER\u00ae LA-15 System in the treatment of drug-resistant primary FSGS and post Transplant recurrence."

It was originally developed for prevention of coronary atherosclerosis progression in patients with serious hyperlipidemia such as familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nIn the late 1980's, LDL-A was used to improve dyslipidemia in Nephrotic Syndrome, initially to prevent organ damage. LDL-A was found to improve both the dyslipidemic condition and clinical symptoms (proteinuria and hypoproteinemia).",
