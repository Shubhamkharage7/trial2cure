Participants will also complete three brief questionnaire packets over the 12-week course of the study.\n\nIt is expected that up to 35 people will take part in this research study. The investigators plan to enrich the study sample for patients of a racial and/or ethnic minority in order to ensure the generalizability of the study findings."
