The asynchronous video will be available outside of the office and can be viewed multiple times. The primary endpoint is patient anxiety, measured via the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, assessed before surgery. The secondary outcomes of anxiety following surgery as well as patient satisfaction with counseling type (measured via the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18)) before and after surgery will be compared between groups. Both groups will complete questionnaires following their initial consultation (but before surgery) and at their post-operative visit. For the telemedicine group, the duration and frequency of video views will be collected. Participants completing both surveys will receive a survivorship gift bag."
