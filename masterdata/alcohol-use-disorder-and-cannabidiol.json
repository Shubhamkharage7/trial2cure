If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "To better understand the effects of hemp-derived CBD with and without a small amount of THC, we propose a Phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT) to examine the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of Full Spectrum CBD (fsCBD, contains less than 0.3% THC) vs. Broad Spectrum CBD (bsCBD, does not contain THC), vs. a matching placebo in a population of AUD subjects.\n\nThis is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the efficacy of fsCBD and bsCBD, compared to a placebo control, to reduce drinking in participants with moderate alcohol use disorder according to the DSM-V. If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 12 weeks. The current study will test the hypothesis that a moderate dose of CBD leads to a reduction in alcohol consumption, alcohol craving, peripheral markers of inflammation, and anxiety. It is further hypothesized that CBD will lead to increased sleep duration and quality among individuals with AUD who want to quit or reduce their drinking. The study will also determine whether the small amount of THC found in full spectrum hemp-derived CBD products produces any negative effects."
