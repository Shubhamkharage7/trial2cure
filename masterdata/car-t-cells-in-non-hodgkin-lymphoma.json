            "detailedDescription": "This is a two-part, non-randomized, open label, single-site Phase 1 study of CD79b-19 CAR T cells as a treatment for relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.\n\nThis study consists of 2 parts:\n\n* Part A (Dose Escalation): The investigators are looking to find the highest dose of the study intervention that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study intervention. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated. Once determined, this highest dose will then be used in the dose expansion part of the study.\n* Part B (Expansion Cohort): Participants will be treated at the respective dose as determined during Part A (Dose Escalation).\n\nCD79b-19 CAR T cells is an investigational treatment that uses a person's own immune cells, called T cells, to try to kill their cancerous cells. T cells fight infections and can also kill cancer cells in some cases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved CD79b-19 CAR T cells as a treatment for any disease. This is the first time that CD79b-19 CAR T cells will be given to humans.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive one infusion of the study treatment and will be followed for up to 2 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 24 people will take part in this research study."

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Intermittent topical, inhaled, or intranasal corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Ongoing systemic immunosuppression for acute and/or chronic GVH as a result of previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant and at least 12 weeks out from prior allogeneic SCT.\n* Presence of active CNS disease\n* Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Principal Investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the study; examples include, but are not limited to, cirrhotic liver disease, sepsis, and/or recent significant traumatic injury.\n* Active, uncontrolled, systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.\n* Subjects with a history of class III or IV congestive heart failure or with a history of non- ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n* Subjects with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control within the previous 3 months.\n* Subjects with arterial vascular disease such as history of cerebrovascular accident or peripheral vascular disease requiring therapeutic anti-coagulation.\n* Subjects with history of a new pulmonary embolism (PE) /deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 6 months of beginning lymphodepletion requiring ongoing anticoagulation.\n* Subjects with second malignancies if the second malignancy has required therapy in the last 3 years or is not in complete remission; exceptions to this criterion include successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma, or prostate cancer that does not require therapy other than hormonal therapy.\n* Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CAR-79b-19 T cell drug product is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CAR-79b-19 T cell drug product, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CAR-79b-19 T cell drug product.\n* Prior treatment with a construct containing truncated EGFR (tEGFR).
