            "detailedDescription": "This study will look at how well metyrapone controls blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipids and weight.\n\nMetyrapone is approved in the United States of America (USA) by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. It is not approved in the USA for the treatment of MACS. It is approved in Europe for the treatment of ACTH dependent Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nMetyrapone is currently being tested to evaluate the safety (side effects/risks) and efficacy (benefits), so its use for the treatment of MACS is experimental in the USA. Its effectiveness is unproven in the USA and metyrapone is considered an investigational study drug in the USA. The Mayo Clinic IRB has given approval for this drug to be used in this setting.\n\nPatients diagnosed with MACS have abnormal cortisol levels above the normal range. Cortisol acts by binding with the cortisol receptors in many tissues of the body. Metyrapone works by reducing cortisol production, thereby decreasing the effects of too much cortisol. Metyrapone doesn't affect levels of other hormones in your body."
