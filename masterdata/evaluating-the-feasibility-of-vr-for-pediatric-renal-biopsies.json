The standard of care of sedation medications will still be available to patients who are unable to complete the procedure with only the VR headset without pharmacologic sedation. Pain and anxiety will be monitored continuously using validated scales by a pediatric hospitalist and sedation nurse. These providers, as well as patients and parents, may ask for additional medications for adequate analgesia and anxiolysis."
