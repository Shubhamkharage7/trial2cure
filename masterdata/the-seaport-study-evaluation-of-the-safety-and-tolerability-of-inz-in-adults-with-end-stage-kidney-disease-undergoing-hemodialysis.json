In addition, the effect of hemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of INZ-701 and PPi levels will be evaluated.",
            "detailedDescription": "INZ-701 is an ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) recombinant fusion protein in development for the treatment of calciphylaxis. The SEAPORT 1 (INZ701-401) Study is a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of INZ-701 in study participants aged \\>18 to \\< 70 years with HD-dependent ESKD. Anticipated enrollment in the study is up to 10 study participants. The purpose of this study is to determine if INZ-701 increases PPi levels, as well as assess the PK/ PD characteristics of INZ-701 in patients with clinically low PPi levels.\n\nThe study will consist of a Screening Period lasting up to 30 days, a Treatment and Assessment Period lasting 26 days, an end of study (EOS) Visit 30 days after the last dose of INZ-701, and if necessary, a safety visit 60 days after the last dose of INZ-701."
