            "briefSummary": "Hispanic men and children experience health disparities for overweight and obesity-related medical conditions, and therefore family level obesity prevention programs for Hispanic populations are needed. 'Healthy Dads Healthy Kids' is the first program to primarily target fathers for obesity prevention for themselves and their children, with significant and clinically relevant treatment effects. This is an efficacy trial to assess a culturally adapted 'Healthy Dads Healthy Kids' for Hispanic families.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hispanics in the United States face health disparities for obesity and related medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Targeting families to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent obesity. With the importance of familism (family cohesion) among the Hispanic population, a family based intervention is especially desirable as an engaging strategy to promote behaviors that support a healthy weight status and decrease obesity related health disparities for Hispanics. Emerging evidence supports the need to include and target fathers in family based lifestyle behavior interventions. Healthy Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) is an evidence based program developed in Australia, shown to have significant weight and behavior treatment effects for fathers and their children, compared to controls. The HDHK program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Family Systems Theory and aims to promote increased physical activity and improved dietary intake for fathers and their children. An important innovation in the program is that fathers and children attend together and are both targeted as agents of behavior change for each other (reciprocal reinforcement) and to participate in fun, family activities together. HDHK was culturally adapted for Hispanic families following the Ecological Validity Model by this research team, with input from a community Hispanic family panel, expert committee and the developer of the HDHK program. The resulting Pap\u00e1s Saludables, Ni\u00f1os Saludables (PSNS) program is a 10-week group-based intervention that meets weekly.\n\nThis randomized controlled trial of PSNS is powered to detect a clinically meaningful change in father's weight and children's moderate to vigorous physical activity. The study will also assess other behavioral (dietary intake, sedentary time, screen media use, and parenting practices), psychosocial (familism, acculturation, and co-parenting alliance) and biological (child BMI z-score, father's non-HDL, HgbA1C, and BP) outcomes. Hispanic men with overweight or obesity who are a father figure (biological father, step father, grandfather, adult older brother, etc) to a 5-11 child will be enrolled in the study in waves. Participants are enrolled as a family unit and includes the father, child(ren) (up to 3 siblings) and mother/partner (if available). After screening and baseline data is complete for a wave, the family is randomized to receive a standard of care control or the group-based culturally adapted PSNS. Follow-up assessments will be done at 4 months and 12 months.\n\nThe study includes a partnership with the YMCA of Greater Houston to provide a venue for where to deliver the program."
