By studying how these nutritional and skeletal factors, doctors leading this study hope to learn how malnutrition and sarcopenia may be able to predict certain outcomes --such as how long study participants with poor nutrition and muscle loss can live after chemotherapy- for older (age 60+) individuals with AML."
