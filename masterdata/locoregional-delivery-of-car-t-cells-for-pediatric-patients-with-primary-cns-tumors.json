B7-H3-CAR T cells will be locoregionally administered via a CNS reservoir catheter. Study participants will be divided into two cohorts: cohort A with B7-H3-positive relapsed/refractory non-brainstem primary CNS tumors, and cohort B with brainstem high-grade neoplasms. Participants will receive six (6) B7-H3-CAR T cell infusions over an 8 week period. The purpose of this study is to find the maximum (highest) dose of B7-H3-CAR T cells that are safe to give patients with primary brain tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "Treatment on this study includes six (6) B7-H3-CAR T cell infusions over an 8 week period. B7-H3-CAR T cells will be locoregionally administered via a CNS reservoir catheter without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of B7-H3-CAR T cells using a 3+3 study design and an 8 week evaluation period. The total study duration will be 1 year, at which point patients will enroll on our existing institutional long-term follow up protocol."
