            "detailedDescription": "The intent of this study is to determine if intra-arterial chemotherapy is a safe and effective option for subjects with atypical choroid plexus papilloma and choroid plexus carcinoma prior to receiving second-look surgery. Angiography occurs when a catheter is inserted through the subjects vasculature to the major vessels that supply cerebral circulation. Subjects on this trial will undergo a a cerebral angiogram to determine the ideal arteries to use for drug infusion. Once identified, chemotherapy will be delivered through the catheter directly to the site of tumor."
