            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nParathyroid glands in the neck make a hormone that keeps blood calcium levels stable. Sometimes these glands are damaged or removed during neck surgery. This can lead to a condition called postsurgical hypoparathyroidism (PSH). People with PSH have low levels of calcium in their blood. Calcium and vitamin D pills can help them keep their blood calcium levels steady. But this can increase calcium in the urine and result in kidney problems. New treatments for PSH are needed.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a drug (encaleret) in people with PSH.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 or older who have PSH.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be in the study for 6 months. They will have a screening visit and a treatment visit.\n\nScreening will take up to 2 days. Participants will have a physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests and tests of their heart function. They will have an ultrasound of their kidneys; they will lie on a table for 15 to 30 minutes while a wand is moved over their back.\n\nTreatment will require participants to stay in the clinic for 7 days and 6 nights. They will take the study drug (encaleret) by mouth twice a day for 5 days. They will have a small, flexible tube inserted into a vein; this will remain in place during the visit. Blood samples will be taken through the tube 4 to 9 times each day. Participants urine will be collected.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up blood tests 1 week after leaving the clinic. They will have 3 follow-up phone calls.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis will be a single-site, proof-of-principle, open-label study to explore the PTH-independent effects of encaleret on calcium homeostasis in participants with low or undetectable PTH levels as a result of neck surgery (PSH).\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n-Evaluate the PTH-independent effects of encaleret on renal calcium handling in participants with PSH.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n-Evaluate the ability of encaleret to normalize blood calcium while maintaining a normal urinary calcium in participants with PSH.\n\nTertiary/Exploratory Objectives:\n\n* Evaluate the ability of encaleret to increase serum iPTH levels in participants with PSH.\n* Evaluate the effect of encaleret on 1-alpha hydroxylase action by measuring 1,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D levels.\n* Explore the dynamic effect of encaleret on blood and urinary calcium, iPTH, cAMP, 1,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D, and urinary citrate.\n* Evaluate the effect of encaleret on bone turnover in participants with PSH.\n* Evaluate the effect of encaleret on phosphate, magnesium, and FGF23 levels.\n* Explore the effects of encaleret on 24-hour urine markers that impact stone formation\n* Examine the PK of encaleret in participants with PSH and explore PK-PD interactions.\n* Explore the effect of encaleret on bone and mineral homeostasis in the following sub-groups, as defined:\n\n  * Permanent hypoparathyroidism (Cohort 1)\n  * Recent hypoparathyroidism (Cohort 2)\n  * \"PTH-Clamp\" cohort\n  * \"Aparathyroid\" cohort\n  * Hyperthyroid cohort\n  * Normothyroid cohort\n  * Thyroid cancer cohort\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\n-Percent change in Fractional Excretion of Calcium (FECa) from baseline (Day -1) to the final day of treatment (Day 6 or the last measurement while on encaleret). FECa calculated using fasting blood levels and spot urine collection.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n-Proportion of participants who achieve a concomitant normal or elevated fasting blood calcium (albumin-corrected calcium\\>8.5 mg/dL) and a normal 24-hour urinary calcium level (\\<250 mg/24 hours for women, \\<300 mg/24 hours for men) on encaleret at any point between day 1 and day 5.\n\nTertiary/Exploratory Endpoints:\n\n* Percent change in Fractional Excretion of Calcium (FECa) from baseline (Screening visit) to the final day of treatment (Day 6 or the last measurement while on encaleret). FECa calculated using fasting blood levels and spot urine collection.\n* Change in blood iPTH comparing average baseline iPTH to average peak iPTH on encaleret. The average baseline iPTH will include all baseline iPTH levels from the screening visit, Day -1, and pre-dose on Day 1. The average peak iPTH will average the peak iPTH levels on every day the patient is on encaleret (days 1 to 5). An increase in iPTH will be considered clinically significant if there is an increase both by 50% AND by more than 10 pg/dL.\n* Change in 1,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D on encaleret comparing the maximal level prior to receiving calcitriol (On Days 3- 5) to baseline (Average of Day 1 Pre-dose levels). Increase will be considered significant if there is an increase of more than 50%. Participants who receive calcitriol prior to Day 3 will be excluded.\n\nPharmacodynamic endpoints measured over 5 days of encaleret therapy:\n\n* Blood iPTH - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Albumin-corrected blood calcium - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Ionized Calcium - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Urinary calcium clearance (fractional excretion and 24-hour total excretion) - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Serum levels of 1,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Blood intact FGF23 (iFGF23) and C- terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Urine cAMP and citrate - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Blood bone resorption marker, collagen crosslinked C-telopeptide (CTx) - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n* Blood bone formation marker, blood procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP) - Absolute levels and change from baseline\n\n  * PK parameters such as maximum plasma concentration Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2)\n  * Change in components of urine including: supersaturation, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphorus, sulfate, citrate excretion, oxalate, pH, uric acid, creatinine, osmolality, ammonium, urea nitrogen, protein catabolic rate"

Participants with hemoglobin (Hgb) lower than the lower limit of normal.\n\n   a.
