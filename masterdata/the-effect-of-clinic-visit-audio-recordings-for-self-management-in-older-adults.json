The specific aims are: Aim 1 Conduct a three-site trial in primary care where older patients with multimorbidity including diabetes (n=336) will be randomized to receive an audio recording as well as AVS (AUDIO) versus AVS alone (UC) for all scheduled clinic visits over 12 months; patients will be assessed at baseline, 1 week, 6 months and 12 months. Applicants hypothesize (Main Effect) that: compared to those receiving UC, patients randomized to also receive audio recordings (AUDIO) of clinic visits will report a greater self-management ability (Primary Outcome), with improved quality of life, medication adherence, and satisfaction (Secondary Outcomes) at 12 months."
