Primary study endpoint will be 3 months.\n\nR00 Aim 2 (Exploratory) Explore potential neural mechanisms of CM-PST effects, by fMRI scanning \\& analyses of core regions of the brain circuits regulating positive affect (ventral striatum), negative affect (amygdala), and cognitive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and connectivity between these core regions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design Formative (K99 Phase), we will test feasibility \\& acceptability of integrated CM-PST. To test CM-PST, we will recruit/enroll 20 participants in a single-arm pre/post study. Participants who meet eligibility will be invited to our clinical lab at UIC for informed consent and baseline measures. Consenting participants will receive CM-PST intervention via videoconferences such as zoom, in 8 CM-PST individual sessions, every week for sessions 1-4 and every other week for sessions 5-8, over 12 weeks. Participants will complete the Client Satisfaction Scale survey after each session and 3 mo. post-intervention, to quantify their overall experiences with this new CM-PST.\n\nPreliminary efficacy trial (R00 Phase). This will be a 2-arm Randomized control trial in young adults aged 18-24 yr who meet AUD criteria. Prospective participants who respond to our advertisements will be screened by phone for eligibility and to determine their AUD diagnostic status and severity (mild, moderate, severe). Participants who meet eligibility will be invited to our UIC clinical lab for informed consent, baseline self-report measures, urine alcohol screening, and baseline fMRI, and then randomized to either CM-PST (42 participants) or CM-only (42 participants) control group. All participants will complete follow-up assessments at 3 \\& 6 months with blinded outcome assessors."
