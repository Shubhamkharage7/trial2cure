In this study, we seek to improve the efficacy of VCD by adding isatuximab in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) irrespective of renal function.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine if the addition of isatuximab to VCD will increase the proportion of subjects achieving very good partial response (VGPR), as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and by the time of completion of post-ASCT consolidation treatment."

Evidence of organ damage or myeloma-defining events (MDE) that can be attributed to the underlying proliferative plasma cell disorder (at least one of the following):\n\n      \u2022 Hypercalcemia: serum calcium \\>1 mg/dL higher than the upper limit of normal (ULN) or \\>11 mg/Dl.\n\n      OR\n\n      \u2022 Anemia: hemoglobin value of \\>2.0 g/dL below the lower limit of normal, or a hemoglobin value \\<10.0 g/dL.\n\n      OR\n      * Bone marrow plasma cells of \\>60%.

Measurable disease as defined (at least one of the following):\n\n      * Serum M-protein level \u22650.5 g/dL; OR\n      * Urine M-protein level \u2265200 mg/24 hours; OR\n      * Light chain multiple myeloma without measurable disease in the urine: serum immunoglobulin (Ig) free light chains (FLC) \u226510 mg/dL and abnormal serum Ig kappa/lambda FLC ratio.\n6.

A woman is considered of childbearing potential, i.e., fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. The following highly effective methods of contraception are accepted:\n\n      * Established use of oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.\n      * Established use of oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.\n      * Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system.\n      * Barrier methods of contraception: male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double-barrier methods). The use of double-barrier methods should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.\n      * Male sterilization (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the patient and that the sterilized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success).\n      * Sexual abstinence.\n      * Female subjects must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s).\n8. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who:\n\n   1. Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period from the time of signing the informed consent through and through four months after the last dose of study drug(s) (female and male condoms should not be used together), or\n   2. Agree to practice true abstinence during the entire study treatment period from the time of signing the informed consent through 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug(s), when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence \\[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner\\] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. For renal impaired Cohort A subjects, any subject who requires immediate treatment for management of renal failure (including, but not limited to, dialysis).\n2. Diagnosed or treated for malignancy other than multiple myeloma, except:\n\n   * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for \u22653 years before enrollment.\n   * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease.\n   * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ (e.g., cervical, breast) with no evidence of disease.\n3.

Any of the following laboratory test results at the time of enrollment:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count \\<1.0 \u00d7 109/L; no granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment in the past seven days are allowed.\n   * Hemoglobin level \u22647.5 g/dL (\u22645 mmol/L); blood transfusions to maintain hemoglobin \\>7.5 g/dL are acceptable.\n   * Platelet count \\<75 \u00d7 109/L for subjects in whom \\<50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells; otherwise platelet count \\<50 \u00d7 109/L; no platelet transfusions in the past seven days are allowed.\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level \u22652.5 \u00d7 ULN\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level \u22652.5 \u00d7 ULN\n   * Total bilirubin level \u22651.5 \u00d7 ULN, (except for Gilbert Syndrome: direct bilirubin \u22652 \u00d7 ULN)\n8. Known allergies, hypersensitivity (if not amenable to premedication with steroids, or H2 blockers), or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human proteins, isatuximab or its excipients or known sensitivity to mammalian-derived products.\n9. Plasma cell leukemia (\\>2.0 \u00d7 10\\^9/L circulating plasma cells by standard differential), Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and/or skin changes), or light-chain amyloidosis.\n10. Known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol (e.g., because of alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder) or the subject has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the subject (e.g., compromise their well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.\n11. Pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s).\n12. Plans to father a child starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s).\n13. Had major surgery within two weeks before Cycle 1, Day 1, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned during the time the subject is expected to participate in the study or within two weeks after the last dose of study drug administration. Note: Subjects with planned surgical procedures to be conducted under local anesthesia are not excluded. Kyphoplasty is not considered a major surgery.\n14. Patients with pre-existing uncontrolled pulmonary disease will be excluded; uncontrolled refers to patients having had at least one hospitalization due to pulmonary disease (for example, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) within the six months prior to enrollment in the study; patients with previous history of pneumonitis will be excluded.",
