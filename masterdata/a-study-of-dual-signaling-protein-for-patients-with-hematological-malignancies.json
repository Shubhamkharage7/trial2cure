            "detailedDescription": "Part A is a dose escalation study in up to 4 cohorts of patients designed to test the safety and efficacy of DSP107 administered alone and in combination with AZA. The DSP107 starting dose level in Part A will be 0.3 mg/kg based on aggregate safety, PK and PD data from study DSP107_001, an ongoing study exploring the safety of escalating DSP107 doses in patients with advanced solid tumors. There will be a single DLT evaluation period, lasting 28 days, to determine the safety of DSP107 in combination with AZA. The safety, efficacy and PK data will be used to establish a recommended Phase II dose for potential future expansion cohorts and a starting dose for Part B.\n\nPart B is a dose escalation study in 2 cohorts of patients that will test the safety and efficacy of DSP107 in combination with AZA and VEN. The starting dose for Part B will be at least one dose level lower than the DSP107 dose selected in Part A as being safe and effective in combination with AZA. Once a safe, effective dose has been established in Part B, a recommended phase 2 dose for patients with newly diagnosed AML will be agreed with the FDA at an End-of-Phase 1 meeting."
