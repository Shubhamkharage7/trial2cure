It helps increase the microcirculation.\n\nThe 360-degree rotation helps in spreading the saline evenly, which is expelled from two ultra-fine jet streams. This micro massaging helps in faster release of nutrients from the skin. The jet stream is smaller than the average pore size measuring 50- 70 microns each, enabling the jet stream to deep clean each pore.",
