Two groups will be recruited: providers (physicians and advanced practice providers including nurse practitioners), and patients. Primary care providers of those prescribed eligible anticholinergic medications will be recruited for participation in the study, and their patients who also meet eligible criteria will be subsequently approached and recruited. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: the deprescribing intervention group or usual care; the intervention group will receive a pharmacist-based deprescribing intervention, while the usual care group will receive care as usually provided by their primary and/or specialty care providers. The intervention and follow-up data collection will occur over 24 months in order to test the long-term impact of the intervention on the planned clinical outcomes. Study outcomes include cognition (primary) and safety (secondary) through validated self-reported scales."
