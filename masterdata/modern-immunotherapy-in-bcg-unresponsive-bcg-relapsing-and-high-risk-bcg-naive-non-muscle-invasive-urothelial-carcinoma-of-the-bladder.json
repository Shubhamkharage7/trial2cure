If DLT criteria outlined in the protocol are exceeded with durvalumab monotherapy (cohort 1), the study will close. Provided the safety of durvalumab monotherapy is established, enrollment to combination regimen cohorts will proceed. Cohorts will simultaneously enroll in parallel to each other with patients assigned to cohorts based on patient slot availability and study site choice of radiation arm participation. Patient assignment to future phase 1 arms would proceed similarly.\n\nWithin BCG-containing cohorts, treatment will begin at full-dose BCG. If DLT criteria outlined in Section 5.1.4 are exceeded with full-dose BCG, a one level dose reduction of BCG will be implemented. If DLT criteria outlined in Section 5.1.4 are exceeded with reduced-dose BCG, the BCG-containing cohort will not proceed to Phase 2 of the study. Similarly, if DLT criteria outlined in Section 5.1.4 are exceeded within non-BCG containing cohorts, the non-BCG containing cohort will not proceed to phase 2 of the study. Due to the prolonged half-life of antibody therapies, no dose adjustments are planned for durvalumab in any of the cohorts."

It is not anticipated that all three possible phase 2 expansion cohort populations will be pursued for every regimen entering phase 2 expansion.

High-risk BCG-naive NMIBC is defined as high-risk NMIBC in a patient that has never received intravesical BCG therapy.

Similarly, patients treated with intravesical gemcitabine induction and/or maintenance are eligible. While we typically do not see patients treated with intravesical docetaxel (or other taxanes) monotherapy, if such a patient were identified and screened, they would be eligible. Patients who have received treatment with separate courses of intravesical gemcitabine monotherapy and intravesical docetaxel (or other taxanes) monotherapy are not eligible, unless such therapies occurred more than 24 months ago.\n\nExclusion Criteria (Phase 1 Only) In Phase 1 of the study, there are no additional exclusion criteria beyond those described of all patients above.\n\nExclusion Criteria (Phase 2 Only) In addition to the exclusion criteria described of all patients above, the following exclusion criteria apply to patients enrolling to Phase 2 of the study.\n\n\u2022 Subjects with concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis) high-grade urothelial carcinoma.
