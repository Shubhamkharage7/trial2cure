            "briefSummary": "Work-related musculoskeletal pain and injury is a growing concern in surgery. Vaginal surgery has unique ergonomic risks, but no studies have addressed the potential for an exercise regimen to reduce physical strain by vaginal surgeons",
            "detailedDescription": "Surgical ergonomics is a burgeoning field, spurred by the recognition of the high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal pain and injury in practicing surgeons including obstetrician/gynecologists (Yurteri-Kaplan 2023 Obstet Gynecol). Surgery is often a demanding physical task, and the muscles and joints that are stressed vary by the surgical approach. Vaginal surgery has unique ergonomic challenges, particularly for assistants who may need to laterally bend their torsos to visualize the surgical field while still holding retractors. This is often a compromising physical position for the back, the shoulders, and sometimes the neck which increases the risk of acute or chronic musculoskeletal injury (Meltzer 2020 JAMA Surg). The risk of injury can be thought of as a discrepancy between the demands of the task and the individual's physical capabilities (Williams 2017 Occup Med (Lond)). Surgeons' injury risk may be decreased if their physical capabilities can be improved through exercise. Most existing publications on surgical ergonomics have focused on raising awareness and on environmental changes such as optimizing surgeon posture during the case or introducing micro-breaks and stretching (Meltzer 2020 JAMA Surg, Allespach 2020 J Surg Educ, Dairywala 2022 Semin Thoracic Surg, Winters 2020 Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open). Few publications have assessed a structured exercise program with the goal of decreasing surgeon pain or fatigue during and after surgery (Giagio 2019 Ann Surg, Kopkash 2021 Ann Surg Oncol). To our knowledge, no studies have addressed this in vaginal surgery."

These workouts are modified from the core regimen recommended by Steve House and Scott Johnston in their book Training for the New Alpinism: A Manual for the Climber as Athlete (House 2014). Each exercise is done until fatigue: when the individual is no longer able to complete the exercise with good form. The participant then rests for approximately thirty to sixty seconds before beginning the next exercise. Passive stretching can be performed during the rest periods. The workout is complete at twenty minutes. Those individuals who complete all eight exercises in less than twenty minutes begin again with the first exercise (bicycles) and continue until reaching twenty minutes. The workout is thus adaptive-seamlessly increasing in repetitions as an individual's strength and endurance increase.",
