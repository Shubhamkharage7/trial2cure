            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of selpercatinib given before surgery in treating patients with thyroid cancer whose tumors have RET alterations (changes in the genetic material \\[deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\\]). Selpercatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving selpercatinib before surgery may help shrink the tumors and help control the disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib in medullary thyroid cancer by objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST (standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\]).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib in medullary thyroid cancer by ORR per modified neck RECIST.\n\nII. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib in medullary thyroid cancer per surgical margin status, which is categorized as R0, R1, and R2 surgical resection.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety profile of neoadjuvant selpercatinib.\n\nIV. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib on progression-free survival (PFS), including overall PFS and locoregional PFS.\n\nV. To measure changes in expected and actual surgical morbidity/complexity as well as evaluate changes of R0/R1 resection rates in pre-specified extrathyroidal anatomic target interfaces before and after selpercatinib treatment.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. In patients with differentiated thyroid cancer \\[DTC\\] and anaplastic thyroid cancer \\[ATC\\] only, to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib by ORR per RECIST (standard RECIST and modified neck RECIST), surgical margin status (R0/R1 versus \\[vs.\\] R2), safety profile, surgical morbidity/complexity, PFS and overall survival (overall survival \\[OS\\], ATC only).\n\nII. To define and measure changes of patient-reported outcomes and quality of life as measured by MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and European Quality of Life Five Dimension (EQ-5D) in patients with RET-altered thyroid cancer who receive selpercatinib treatment.\n\nIII. To explore translational endpoints in selpercatinib neoadjuvant therapy with biopsies/tissue collection before selpercatinib treatment and during surgery.\n\nIV. To explore peripheral and tissue measures associated with selpercatinib mechanisms of resistance in patients who experience disease progression after selpercatinib treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive selpercatinb orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care surgery.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for disease progression status every 3-4 months for the first 2 years. ATC patients continue follow-up every 6 months for year 3 and 4, and once in year 5."

Diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma may include consistent with or suggestive of terminology associated with: anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, squamous carcinoma; carcinoma with spindled, giant cell, or epithelial features; poorly differentiated carcinoma with pleomorphism, extensive necrosis with tumor cells present\n* Having an activating RET gene alteration (fusion or mutation). The RET alteration result should be generated from a laboratory with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA), ISO/EIC, College of American Pathologists (CAP), or other similar certification that clearly denotes the presence of a RET alteration in tumor, or institutional-approved cell free DNA blood test for RET alteration\n* Prior multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) with anti-RET activity are allowed. The specific agent(s), duration of treatment, clinical benefit, and reason for discontinuation (e.g., progressive disease \\[PD\\], drug toxicity, or intolerance) should be documented for all kinase inhibitors the patient has been exposed to\n* At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1\n* Surgical morbidity/complexity score of 1 to 4 (moderate, severe, very severe, or unresectable)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 (age \\>= 16 years) or Lansky Performance Score (LPS) \\>= 40% (age \\< 16 years) with no sudden deterioration 2 weeks prior to study registration\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1500/uL\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9 g/dL (5.58 mmol/L)\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/uL\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) (Except participants with a documented history of Gilbert syndrome who must have a total bilirubin \\< 3 X ULN)\n* Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)/Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) \\< 2.5 X ULN OR \\< 5 X ULN if the liver has tumor involvement\n* Normal serum potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels (may be receiving supplements).
