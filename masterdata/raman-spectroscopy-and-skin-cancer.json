The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n-Can Raman Spectroscopy help figure out how far a tumor spreads?\n\nThis study will take measurements using laser light from an experimental, handheld probe by lightly touching the skin.",
            "detailedDescription": "Radiation therapy is an alternative to surgery for localized tumors with excellent tumor control and cosmetic outcome. Raman Spectroscopy has potential to be a useful non-invasive, non-destructive, real-time, in-vivo tool for differentiation of cancerous vs. non-cancerous tissues. With this knowledge and future studies, this will ultimately guide skin brachytherapy more accurately and avoid unnecessary radiation to cosmetically and functionally important tissues including eyelid, nose, lips or skin folds.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of Raman Spectroscopy to identify microscopic infiltration extent of skin cancer beyond grossly visible tumor, using artificial intelligence methods of supervised and un-supervised machine learning algorithms, including pattern recognition, convolutional neural networks, k-means clustering and principal component analysis."
