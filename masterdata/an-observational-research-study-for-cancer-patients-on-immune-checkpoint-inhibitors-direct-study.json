Collecting samples of blood, saliva, stool, and health and treatment information from racially diverse patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment over time may help doctors better understand healthcare disparities among all cancer patients.",

To compare incidence of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2-5 immune-related adverse reactions (irAEs) between African American (AA) and European American (EA) patients within the first year of starting immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare objective response rate (ORR) to ICI treatment between AA and EA patients within the first year of starting ICI treatment.\n\nII. To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Preference (Patient Reported Outcomes \\[PRO\\] Pr) summary score and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Immune Checkpoint Modulator (FACT-ICM) between AA and EA patients within 1 year of starting ICI treatment.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare AA and EA patients on severity (i.e., CTCAE grade) and timing of irAEs within 1 year of starting ICI treatment.\n\nII. To assess disease, treatment, individual, and behavioral factors as predictors of grade 2-5 irAEs, and as potential causes of racial differences in irAEs, within 1 year of starting ICI treatment.\n\nIII. To compare AA and EA patients on long-term outcomes (e.g., progression-free survival \\[PFS\\], overall survival \\[OS\\], and HRQOL beyond the first year) at the end of the study period.\n\nIV. To assess the impact of irAEs and disease, treatment, behavioral, and individual factors on ICI outcomes (ORR, HRQOL, PFS, OS), and as potential causes of racial differences in outcomes, at the end of the study period.\n\nV. To compare ICI treatment patterns (e.g., delay and discontinuation of ICI treatment) between AA and EA patients within 1 year of starting ICI treatment.\n\nVI. To assess irAEs, treatment, disease, and individual factors, including healthcare barriers, as possible reasons for suboptimal treatment patterns, and as potential causes of racial differences, within 1 year of starting ICI treatment.\n\nOutline:\n\nPatients will complete questionnaires and undergo collection of blood, saliva, and stool (optional) samples before the 1st and 2nd infusion of immunotherapy. Blood samples will be collected 6 months after 1st infusion of immunotherapy, and then every year after 1st infusion of immunotherapy."
