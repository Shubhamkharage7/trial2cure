Over 39 months, the trial will enroll 200 caregivers of community-dwelling patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD). Caregivers will be randomized to use the Brain CareNotes app or an attention control education-only app for 12 months, with usage reminders.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a hybrid efficacy-effectiveness RCT to evaluate the effect of Brain CareNotes on unpaid caregiver burden and patient BPSD. Over 39 months, the trial will enroll 200 caregivers. Participants will be randomized to use the Brain CareNotes app or an attention control education-only app (Dementia Guide Expert) for 12 months.\n\nThe primary objective is to test the effect of Brain CareNotes on a) caregiver burden and b) patient BPSD at 12 months. The investigators hypothesize that caregiver burden and patient BPSD will be lower among those participants randomized to the Brain CareNotes intervention compared to those randomized to the education-only attention control app at 12 months. The primary, powered outcomes are calculated using the caregiver-reported Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); the total NPI score measures patient BSPD and the caregiver distress sub-score measures caregiver burden. The investigators will obtain NPI responses from caregivers at baseline, six, and 12 months.\n\nThe secondary objective is to test the effect of Brain CareNotes on a) caregiver depressive symptoms and b) patient and caregiver acute care utilization at 12 months. The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to the Brain CareNotes intervention will have lower caregiver depressive symptoms and decreased acute care utilization compared to those randomized to the control app. For caregiver depressive symptoms, investigators will use the researcher-administered Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at baseline, six, and 12 months. Acute care utilization data will be obtained from self-reports or Indiana's statewide Health Information Exchange (HIE), known as the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), to identify both caregivers' and patients' hospital and ER visits that occurred within 12 months of enrollment."
