YARs who consent to participate will be randomized to either a 3-session peer coach-led telephone counseling intervention or usual care navigation to peer support interventions provided by community organizations that support the hereditary cancer community. Study aims are to 1) Assess intervention effects on distress and decision making outcomes, including uptake of counseling for untested YARs, 2) Identify YARs most likely to engage with and benefit from the intervention, 3) Understand intervention mechanisms. Participants will complete interviews at baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months."
