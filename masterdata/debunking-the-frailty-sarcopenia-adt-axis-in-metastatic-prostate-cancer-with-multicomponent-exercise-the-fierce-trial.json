            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a pilot, randomized control study, which is the first-time investigators are examining this intervention in this setting.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of two study groups: Exercise Group versus Attention Control Group. Randomization means a participant is placed into a group by chance.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, including extensive evaluations of fitness, physical health and strength, blood tests, muscle biopsy, surveys, and follow-up visits.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last about 16 weeks.\n\nIt is expected that about 80 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe Prostate Cancer Foundation is providing funding for this research study."

This study is exclusively targeting androgen deprivation therapy-related effects.\n* Have unstable bone lesions. In general patients with severely symptomatic/unstable bone lesions due to bone metastases are at a higher risk of fractures.\n* Complete 2 or more structured resistance exercise sessions per week over the last 4 months and participate in more than 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise per week over the last month. Excess additional exercise is a confounding factor in assessing the effect of the current exercise program.\n* Unstable comorbidities that prevent participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. Patients with unstable comorbidities likely require supervised exercise for safety, and part of this study involves unsupervised exercise; therefore, for safety reasons, these persons are excluded.\n* Patients receiving treatment for other active malignancies (except basal cell carcinoma). This study is exclusively targeting androgen deprivation therapy-related effects.\n* Subjects who in the opinion of the investigators may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study.",
