            "detailedDescription": "In Part 1, enrolled subjects will receive IV RNK05047 once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks in a 4-week cycle (no treatment in the fourth week). The dose-escalation phase will follow a standard 3+3 design, with 3 subjects enrolled into the first dosing cohort to receive RNK05047 at the starting dose of 0.75 mg/kg.\n\nIn Part 2, once RP2D has been established, additional subjects (3 to 5 cohorts of approximately 15 subjects per cohort) will be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase of the study. Tumor types for these cohorts will be determined based on data from the dose-escalation phase of the study and emerging results from preclinical studies or other scientific data. These dose expansion cohorts in all groups may be done concurrently."
