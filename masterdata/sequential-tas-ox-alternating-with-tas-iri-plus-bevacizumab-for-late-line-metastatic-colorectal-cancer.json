Bevacizumab should be given unless there are specific contraindications per the treating investigator, which should be stated. If UPC is \\>1.0 (as above) hold bevacizumab until proteinuria resolves and then start bevacizumab.\n* Symptomatic CNS metastases requiring treatment.\n* Other active malignancy within the last three years (except for non-melanoma skin cancer or a non-invasive/in situ cancer).\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding.\n* Current therapy with other investigational agents.\n* Active infection with body temperature \\> 38\u00b0C due to infection.\n* Major surgery within prior four weeks (the surgical incision should be fully healed prior to drug administration).\n* Any anticancer therapy within prior two weeks of first dose of study drug.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to TAS-102.\n* Current therapy with other investigational agents or participation in another clinical study or any investigational agent received within prior four weeks.\n* Grade 3 or higher hypersensitivity reaction to oxaliplatin or irinotecan, or grade 1-2 hypersensitivity reaction to oxaliplatin not controlled with pre-medication.\n* Has unresolved toxicity of greater than or equal to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse (CTCAE) Grade 2 attributed to any prior therapies (excluding anemia, alopecia, skin pigmentation, and platinum-induced neurotoxicity).",
