ADT therapy is defined as either a GnRH agonist or antagonist.\n* Participants receiving combination treatment with ADT and chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel, carboplatin), radioligand therapy (radium-223, 177PSMA-lutetium-617), or treatment on a clinical trial are not eligible due to potential for more intensive symptom management that may be required for optimal support of their cancer-directed treatment.\n* Participants actively included in therapeutic clinical trials are not eligible due to their greater time constraints.",
