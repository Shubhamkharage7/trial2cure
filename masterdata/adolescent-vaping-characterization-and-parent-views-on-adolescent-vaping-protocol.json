            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe use of electronic cigarettes (vaping) has increased among adolescents over the past decade. Vaping raises many health concerns. People who vape inhale toxic chemicals. Vaping is also linked with mental health issues, such as depression and suicide risk. In one survey, 85% of young adults reported that they used both vaping and tobacco products; the primary reason they cited for using these products was stress.\n\nObjective:\n\nThis natural history study will survey adolescents and their parents about their attitudes toward vaping.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 13 to 17, including those who vape; those who once vaped; and those who have never vaped. Parents of people aged 13 to 17 who are known or suspected of vaping are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will take a survey. They will use their own smartphone, computer, or tablet to answer questions. The survey will take about 20 minutes. Their answers will be anonymous.\n\nTeenage participants will answer questions on different topics:\n\nVaping habits, such as when and how they vape.\n\nDrug use, including nicotine, cannabis, and alcohol.\n\nMood issues, such as depression, anxiety, and stress.\n\nSocial influences on vaping, including perceived attitudes of parents and peers.\n\nOther leisure habits, including online gaming and use of social media.\n\nParents will answer similar questions.\n\nA phone number and links will be given to participants who need help for suicidal thoughts. Other links will be given to those who want help with parenting resources or aids to quit vaping.\n\nParticipants may be invited to take part in an 8-week course on mindfulness-based stress reduction.\n\nParticipants who finish the survey will receive $10.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description: This protocol will explore characteristics of adolescents who vape and the attitudes of adolescents and parents of adolescents who vape towards adolescent vaping, focusing on the Baltimore area. Hypotheses: (Adolescent) Currently vaping adolescents will not view vaping as a problem for which they seek help and will have more mental health symptoms than non-vaping adolescents, while non-vaping adolescents will view vaping more negatively with formerly vaping adolescents scoring between the currently vaping and non-vaping adolescent groups. (Parent) Parents who vape will be more likely to approve of their adolescent s vaping than non-vaping parents.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To characterize adolescent vaping patterns, overall drug use, perceived stress, and awareness of mindfulness meditation.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To characterize the mental health symptoms of currently vaping, formerly vaping and non-vaping adolescents, and to characterize parent attitudes towards their adolescent s vaping.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: An adequate description of adolescent vapers habits and attitudes towards their vaping.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: An adequate comparison of adolescent vapers, former vapers and non-vapers and of parental attitudes towards adolescent vapers."

While we are including adolescents who do not vape in addition to those who do vape, we are only including parents of adolescents who do (or are suspected to) vape because it is this population that is most directly relevant to the upcoming MBSR study, and it is the attitudes of these parents that have most direct practical significance on adolescent vaping. All participants must be willing to complete the survey to the end.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nNon-English speakers cannot participate in this study. Justification: The questionnaires from which the survey is constructed are not all validated in languages other than English. We do not have the resources to translate the consent and surveys.\n\nThose who cannot demonstrate understanding of the purpose of the survey by answering questions after a brief explanation will be excluded.
