            "briefSummary": "The goal of this Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial is to test the Standardized Checklist for Optimizing Procedural Ergonomics in Endoscopy (SCOPE-E) bundle-a multicomponent intervention comprised of a pre-procedure ergonomic timeout checklist and evidence-based implementation strategies-as a strategy to mitigate the risk of Endoscopy-related injuries (ERI) during colonoscopy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Endoscopy-related injuries (ERI) occur frequently, emphasizing the crucial need to integrate ergonomic principles into endoscopic practice to mitigate risks and prioritize the health and well-being of endoscopists. Checklists are a proven strategy in healthcare behavior modification; however, the efficacy of a pre-procedure ergonomic timeout checklist remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, the aim is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of the Standardized Checklist for Optimizing Procedural Ergonomics in Endoscopy (SCOPE-E) bundle-a multicomponent intervention comprised of a pre-procedure ergonomic timeout checklist and evidence-based implementation strategies-as a strategy to mitigate the risk of ERI during colonoscopy.\n\nConducted will be a Hybrid Type 2 cluster randomized controlled trial across 10 endoscopy units in North America with 100 participants. Units will be randomized to the SCOPE-E bundle or usual practice. Effectiveness will be measured by comparing Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) scores before and 3 months after implementation between intervention and control groups. Simultaneously, implementation outcomes will be assessed to understand the practicality of this ergonomic intervention and inform widescale adoption. If demonstrated to be effective, the SCOPE-E Bundle is a feasible and cost-effective intervention that holds significant promise for improving ergonomics globally."
