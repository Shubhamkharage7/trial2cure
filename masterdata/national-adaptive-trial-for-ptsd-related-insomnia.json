            "briefSummary": "Many Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have trouble sleeping or have frequent nightmares. So far, no medication has been approved for treatment of insomnia in PTSD. The purpose of this research study is to find out if taking medications called trazodone or eszopiclone can help decrease symptoms of insomnia in patients with PTSD. PTSD is a form of intense anxiety which sometimes results from severe trauma. Symptoms may include nightmares, flashbacks, troublesome memories, difficulty sleeping, poor concentration, irritability, anger, and emotional withdrawal. Insomnia is a disorder that can make it hard to fall sleep, stay asleep or cause a person to wake up too early and not be able to fall back to sleep.",
            "detailedDescription": "VA Cooperative Studies Program #2016 is a double-blind three-arm adaptive clinical trial to compare the efficacy of trazodone hydrochloride and eszopiclone to placebo, as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of insomnia symptoms among Veterans with military related PTSD, as measured by statistically significant difference in change from baseline in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total score at Week 12.\n\nParticipants will be male and female Veterans with PTSD and moderate levels of insomnia as measured on the ISI. Veterans who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized within each site to receive trazodone hydrochloride, eszopiclone or placebo. Permuted blocks randomization will be used within each participating site. A mid-point interim analysis will be conducted wherein active treatment arms meeting early futility stopping criteria may be dropped. If all active treatment arms are dropped at the interim analysis, the study will be stopped at that time. Otherwise, the study will continue, and the remaining sample size will be allocated to the remaining study arms with equal randomization probabilities. Study drug dose will ideally be increased using a flexible dose titration schedule over the initial 3-week period, and the maximally tolerated dose will be continued until the week 12 assessment.\n\nThe Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is the primary outcome measure for this study. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-V (CAPS-5) will be the key secondary outcome measuring change in PTSD symptoms. Other secondary outcomes that measure PTSD and sleep include the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index Scale-Addendum for PTSD (PSQI-A). Other secondary outcomes include brief questionnaire secondary measures of comorbid depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (TSQM-9), smoking and alcohol consumption (Timeline Follow-Back, or TLFB), clinical global change (CGI-S), resource utilization (Service Utilization and Resources Form, or SURF). Safety measures include: Suicide Screening Questionnaire, review of Adverse events, and measuring anger and aggression (Dimension of Anger Reaction-5, or DAR-5).\n\nThis study is designed to serve as a well-powered \"screen\" for efficacious medications for the treatment of PTSD-related insomnia from among the medications already widely prescribed for this purpose within VA. Thus, this study is powered to detect differences between trazodone and eszopiclone versus placebo. The 3-arm design will require a sample size of 774 in the three arms (trazodone, eszopiclone and placebo), based on a drop out rate of 10%, to provide 85% probability to establish efficacy of the two active medications (trazodone and eszopiclone) when both have an effect size of 0.35 as compared to placebo.\n\nVA bears a unique responsibility for addressing the limited efficacy of current evidence-based pharmacotherapy practices for PTSD. Since 2001, there have been only two FDA-approved medications for PTSD, both serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants (SRIs), and SRIs have limited efficacy for military-related PTSD. This \"efficacy gap\" results in widespread polypharmacy for PTSD in VA, such that Veterans with antidepressant-resistant symptoms are treated, on average, with more than three psychotropic medications that present risks without clear benefit. In particular, SRI-resistant insomnia in military-related PTSD is a significant problem for VA, with 88% of these patients reporting clinically significant sleep impairment. In PTSD, sleep disturbances contribute importantly to impairments in quality of life, reduced social and vocational function, suicide risk, and poorer health. Effective treatment of persisting insomnia in PTSD is a sufficiently serious unmet need that the 2017 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, called for \"studies of non-benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotics.\" The purpose of the study is address this gap through testing the efficacy of three non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in comparison to placebo, representing the three medications or medication classes that are most commonly prescribed to Veterans with PTSD on an off-label basis and have yet to be tested in a definitive clinical trial. A novel aspect of this study is its implementation of an adaptive design in which arms would be dropped for evidence of futility based on pre-specified criteria at a designated interim analysis, intended to increase the efficiency of the trial and thereby improve the feasibility of its ambitious aim. The VA Cooperative Studies Program is uniquely suited to conduct this study."
