Subjects will undergo instillation of AeriSeal Foam in the target lobe and subsequent assessment of CV status using Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System. Subjects with CV- status will then undergo placement of Zephyr Valve in the target lobe for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) and be followed for 24 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm, pivotal trial with a 24-month follow-up to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the AeriSeal System to block CV. The study plans to enroll up to 200 subjects at up to 30 clinical centers in US and OUS. Study subjects will be patients with severe, heterogeneous emphysema and collateral ventilation in the lobe targeted who are candidates for BLVR. Subjects meeting initial eligibility will undergo a bronchoscopy procedure under general anesthesia during which the presence of CV will be confirmed using Chartis. All enrolled subjects meeting final eligibility will undergo the AeriSeal procedure. Conversion of collateral ventilation status from CV+ to CV- in the target lobe will be evaluated by Chartis at Day 45 post-AeriSeal treatment (primary effectiveness endpoint). All subjects not converted from CV+ to CV- status will undergo a repeat of the AeriSeal procedure, provided that the total volume from both the initial and the repeat treatments does not exceed 40 mL in up to 3 segments. All subjects converted from CV+ to CV- status after either the index or repeat AeriSeal procedure will undergo BLVR with Zephyr Valve per standard of care in accordance with the approved instructions for use and will be followed through Month 24 (end of study). All CV+ subjects who remain CV+ after the repeat procedure or do not undergo the repeat AeriSeal procedure will be followed through Month 24 (end of study)."
