            "briefSummary": "Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Life story work, which uses written and oral life histories to elicit conversation and memories, is an effective intervention for individuals with dementia; however, because of the time-consuming nature of generating useful life story materials, has not been widely implemented in nursing homes and other care environments. LifeBio Inc. will develop an easy-to-use reminiscence therapy platform - LifeBio MemoryTM - with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers.",
            "detailedDescription": "This project offers the unique and timely opportunity to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of LifeBio Memory's effectiveness as a solution for improving quality of life and quality of care for older adults in long-term care settings, as well as relationships with staff caregivers. This project will implement the the newly developed LifeBio Memory platform and train caregivers in X sites across the state of Ohio, with X residents and X staff participating in a feasibility trial. The program will be evaluated using three waves of data collection from staff during training and throughout implementation, as well as pre-post resident data to evaluate the effectiveness of the new intervention.\n\nThe LifeBio Memory platform addresses the need for an intuitive, artificial intelligence-driven solution to the traditionally labor-intensive process of collecting, sharing, and celebrating the life stories of older adults, as well as the development of tools for staff caregivers to enhance person-centered care practices and care-planning. It has great potential for improving psychosocial outcomes for participants, enhancing relationships between care staff and residents, and a cost-effective way to identify ways in which life stories can be used to provide a foundation for preference-based, personalized care.\n\nResidents will be interviewed at baseline, then again at follow-up (4 weeks later), staff members being trained to utilize the LifeBio Memory application and provide feedback on the materials, as well as completed a survey at baseline, again at follow-up"
