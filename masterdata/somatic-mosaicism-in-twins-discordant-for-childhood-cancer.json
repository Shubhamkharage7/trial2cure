To conduct a descriptive study of same sex twins (MZ and DZ) discordant for childhood CNS tumors identified through the Children's Oncology Group Project:EveryChild registry.\n\nII. To compare the prevalence of somatic mosaicism in classic cancer-associated genes in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for childhood brain tumors. In our pilot study, we will sequence blood and saliva DNA samples from 25 MZ twin pairs using a panel of 94 known cancer associated genes.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the profile of mutations detected in DNA extracted from pre- and post-treatment blood samples from a subset of CNS tumor patients. The purpose of this aim is to ensure that differences in somatic mosaicism detected in twin pairs are not caused by cancer therapy.\n\nOutline:\n\nTwins with CNS tumors will undergo blood and saliva DNA samples with the goal is to learn more about genetic differences that may lead to CNS tumor development."
