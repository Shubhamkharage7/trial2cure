Subject with Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\> 3 X upper limit normal range during screening, except for subjects undergoing liver resection surgery or with a diagnosis of liver metastases where there is no upper limit normal for these analytes due to the nature of their disease\n14.

Subject has an operative bleeding site which the surgeon is unable or unwilling to control with a hemostatic agent\n16.
