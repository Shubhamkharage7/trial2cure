            "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-center, randomized, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant enoblituzumab given prior to radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. Patients will be recruited from the outpatient Urology clinics and Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer (\"Precision Medicine\") Clinics at four participating institutions including: Harvard/Dana-Farber Cancer Centers, Northwestern Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic, and the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center. Eligible patients will undergo a pre-treatment prostate biopsy and conventional imaging (CT and bone scan) as well as PSMA-PET and optional prostate MRI as per institutional preferences. Patients who have N0 M0 disease by conventional imaging (N1 by PSMA allowed with up to 3 LNs each \u22641 cm) will be trial eligible as long as concurrent hormonal or radiation therapy is not given. Patients will then be randomized to enoblituzumab for a total of 12 weeks beginning 84 days prior to radical prostatectomy or SOC arms. Fourteen days after the last treatment, prostate glands will be harvested at radical prostatectomy, and prostate tissue will be examined for pathologic response and secondary pharmacodynamic/immunologic endpoints as described herein. Pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment biomarkers of response and resistance will be collected including: plasma, PBMC. Repeat PSMA scan will be obtained prior to radical prostatectomy. Follow-up evaluation for adverse events will occur 30 and 90 days after surgery. Patients will then be followed by the patient's urologists/oncologists according to standard institutional practices but will require PSA evaluations every 3 (\u00b11) months during year 1 and every 6 (\u00b12) months during years 2-3."

N1 by PSMA allowed with up to 3 LNs each \u22641 cm. If there is no frank bone disease, but PSMA scan and CT scan are in discordance, then investigators will discuss.\n* Initial prostate biopsy, obtained within 3 months of enrollment, is available for central pathologic review, and is confirmed to show at least 3 positive cores (at least 1 core with at least 50% disease involvement with \u22654+3=7 disease) and a Gleason sum of \u22658 (or 4+3=7 with at least 1 additional high-risk feature such as PSA\\>20 or cT3)\n* Radical prostatectomy has been scheduled\n* Age \u226518 years\n* ECOG performance status 0-1, or Karnofsky score \u2265 70% (see Appendix A)\n* Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function:\n\n  * WBC \\>3,000 cells/mm3\n  * ANC \\>1,500 cells/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin \\>9.0 g/dL\n  * Platelet count \\>100,000 cells/mm3\n  * Serum creatinine \\<1.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Serum bilirubin \\<1.5 \u00d7 ULN\n  * ALT \\<3 \u00d7 ULN\n  * AST \\<3 \u00d7 ULN\n  * Alkaline phosphatase \\<3 \u00d7 ULN\n* The etiology of abnormal bilirubin and transaminase levels should be evaluated prior to study entry.\n* Willingness to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the release of personal health information, and the ability to comply with the study requirements (note: HIPAA authorization will be included in the informed consent)\n* Willingness to use barrier contraception from the time of first dose of Enoblituzumab (MGA271) until the time of prostatectomy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nTo be eligible for this study, patients should not meet any of the following criteria:\n\n* Presence of known lymph node involvement on CT (N1 by PSMA allowed with up to 3 LNs each \u22641 cm) or distant metastases by CT and NM bone scan\n* Other histologic types of prostate cancers such as ductal, sarcomatous, lymphoma, small cell, and neuroendocrine tumors\n* Prior radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or chemotherapy for prostate cancer\n* Prior immunotherapy/vaccine therapy for prostate cancer\n* Prior use of experimental agents for prostate cancer\n* Concomitant treatment with other hormonal therapy or 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors\n* Current use of systemic corticosteroids or use of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks of enrollment (inhaled corticosteroids for asthma or COPD are permitted as are other non-systemic steroids such as topical corticosteroids)\n* History or presence of autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression (including but not limited to: inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, and sarcoidosis)\n* History of malignancy within the last 3 years, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers and superficial bladder cancer\n* Uncontrolled major active infectious, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, or psychiatric illnesses that would make the patient a poor study candidate\n* Known prior or current history of HIV and/or hepatitis B/C, with the exception of patients who have been successfully treated for hepatitis B/C (i.e. documented confirmation of cure at least 6 months after initial treatment).",
