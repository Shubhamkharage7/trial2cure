            "briefSummary": "With this study the investigators want to understand the physiological differences for people developing pre-diabetes and diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that different individuals go through different paths in the development of the disease. By understanding the personal mechanism for developing disease, the investigators will find a personalized approach to prevent that development. The investigators are also hoping to be able to find a biomarker that will pinpoint to the particular defect and thus, diagnose the problem at an earlier stage and have the information to give personalized diet recommendations to prevent the development of diabetes more effectively.",
            "detailedDescription": "At present, individuals with prediabetes or diabetes are grouped together as a single entity, but almost certainly they represent a mix of different gene-environment interactions that lead to one of four dominant physiologic mechanisms underlying their dysglycemia. 1- liver insulin resistance, 2- muscle insulin resistance, 3- impaired insulin secretion, 4- impaired incretin hormone secretion. Gaps that we are addressing here are extremely important - first, we will define a composite biomarker to identify different subphenotypes of prediabetes based on the four known physiologic mechanisms that contribute differentially in each individual to glucose elevations, which we hypothesize will also be reflected in their \"glucotype\". Importantly, because both continuous glucose monitor and administration of standardized meal testing and metabolic tests are not practical in the clinic, the development of a composite biomarker comprised of select multi-omics measures and clinical variables will enable clinicians and possibly patients (without clinician) to easily identify the specific diet that will yield optimal health results."
