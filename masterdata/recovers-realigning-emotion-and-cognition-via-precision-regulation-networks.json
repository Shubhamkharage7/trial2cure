            "briefSummary": "In this research study, the investigators are using examining how brain activity (electrical and blood flow) changes during tests of emotional processing and attention and memory in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Investigators are also using non-invasive brain stimulation to probe different parts of the brain and measuring brain activity (electrical and blood flow). This study includes healthy participants and researchers hope this will help us develop improved brain-based treatments for emotional difficulties like depression.",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators hypothesize that targeted neuroplastic changes induced by individually-tailored rTMS will substantially reduce clinical symptoms underlying depression, anxiety and suicidality, and in general, revolutionize non-invasive treatments of mental health disorders. Investigators hypothesize that functional coupling in cognitive flexibility (CF) and emotion regulation (ER) networks is indexed by the phase of the brain's alpha oscillations. Using a novel integrated instrument that enables simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), investigators propose to identify individualized stimulation parameters that reflect the strongest coupling of the CF/ER networks. The neuromechanistic model further posits that by applying repetitive TMS (rTMS) with these individualized parameters, one can induce entrainment in brain networks that drive neuroplastic changes in CF and ER. This initial Phase I Task 3 sub-study is a proof-of-principle study in healthy control participants."
