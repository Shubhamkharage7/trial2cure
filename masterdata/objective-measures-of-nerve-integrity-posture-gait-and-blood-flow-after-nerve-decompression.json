To obtain objective data during surgery of the treated nerves' via electrical signals and muscle power when stimulated. Also, to monitor muscle strength, balance/gait and blood flow in the lower extremity before and after surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nerve decompression (ND)as treatment for the foot complications of diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is a controversial topic although many patients find it provides gratifying relief of pain and numbness. Neural electrical monitoring has been used intra-operatively to diagnosis nerve abnormality, monitoring for ongoing normal nerve function and confirm nerve integrity for spine surgeries and thyroid surgeries with success. Presently there is not objective data to indicate the the use of neural electrical monitoring is reliable or effective. The goal of this study is to measure objectively and quantifiable clinical surgical outcomes of nerve decompression surgery in diabetic neuropathy patients. The study is designed to measure changes in nerve function, gait, balance and blood flow in the lower limb."
