            "detailedDescription": "This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase I/II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azenosertib in combination with carboplatin and pembrolizumab in participants with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) Azenosertib is a medication that targets WEE1, an important protein in tumor growth.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved azenosertib as a treatment for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nThe FDA has approved carboplatin as a treatment option for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and it is considered standard of care for breast cancer.\n\nThe FDA has approved pembrolizumab for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but it is currently approved only for PD-L1 positive cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, blood tests, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, electrocardiograms (EKGs), and tumor biopsies in Phase 2.\n\nIt is expected that about 12-18 people will take part in the phase 1 portion and 60 people for the phase 2 portion of this research study.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals is funding this research study and providing Azenosertib. Merck is supporting this research study by providing pembrolizumab."
