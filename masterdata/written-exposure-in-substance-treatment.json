All participants meet criteria for PTSD and are in a short term residential SUD treatment program (target residential treatment duration = 28 days) regardless of the research. The main questions the study aims to answer are: 1) Is the delivery of WET feasible in short term residential SUD treatment for individuals with severe SUD; 2) Do participants in the TAU+WET condition have greater reductions in PTSD symptoms pre/post treatment compared to participants in TAU alone?"
