            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells in up to 4 cohorts. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy will not be utilized as part of the planned dosing strategy.\n\n\u2022 Cohort 1 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 via intravenous infusion.\n\n* Enrollment into Cohort 1 will be paused after the 3rd subject is infused to allow for a formal DLT assessment (performed by the Clinical PI and Medical Director) and DSMB review. If 1 DLT/3 subjects occurs in Cohort 1, the Sponsor (with guidance from the DSMB), will determine whether the study will enroll an additional 3 subjects at this dose level to further establish safety via intravenous infusion, or advance to Cohorts 2 and 3 to explore local delivery of huCART-meso cells at the same dose level. If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects occurs at any time, the study may advance to Cohorts 2 and 3.\n* If 2 DLTs occur at this dose level at any time, enrollment in Cohort 1 will be stopped and the dose will be de-escalated by 10-fold to 1-3x10\\^6 cells/m\\^2 (Cohort -1).\n* The infusions in Cohort 1 will be staggered by at least 28 days to allow for the assessment of DLTs for cohort progression, expansion, or dose de-escalation.\n\nIn the event that 2 DLTs occur among subjects enrolled in Cohort 1, then enrollment in Cohort 1 will be stopped and the dose will be de-escalated by 10-fold to 1-3x10\\^6 cells/m\\^2. This de-escalated cohort will be designated Cohort -1.\n\n\u2022 Cohort -1 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^6 cells/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0. Up to 6 subjects will be infused in Cohort -1 if \u2264 1 DLT occurs.\n\nIf 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects occurs in Cohort 1, the study will advance to allow for additional cohorts to be explored.\n\n* Cohorts 2 and 3. Enrollment into these additional cohorts may occur in parallel, however infusions will be staggered as follows to allow for monitoring/assessment of toxicities:\n* Cohorts 2 and 3: As of Protocol Amendment V7, Infusion #1/Day 0 for the next 6 subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 must be staggered by at least 28 days; This includes a minimum of 3 evaluable subjects in Cohort 2 and 3 evaluable subjects in Cohort 3. A DLT assessment will be performed after the 3rd evaluable subject in each cohort reaches the Day 21 safety follow-up visit. If no DLTs are identified in the 1st three evaluable subjects in both Cohorts 2 + 3, subsequent infusions of new subjects within either cohort may occur in parallel; however, no more than two new subjects may be infused within a 14-day period, irrespective of cohort assignment. If both cohorts have not yet infused 3 evaluable subjects without a DLT, all infusions will continue to be staggered by 28 days until this provision is met.\n* Cohort 4: Infusion #1/Day 0 for the first 3 subjects in Cohort 4 must be staggered by at least 28 days. A DLT assessment will be performed after the 3rd evaluable subject in this cohort reaches the Day 21 safety follow-up visit. If no DLTs are identified in the 1st three evaluable subjects, subsequent infusions of new subjects may occur in parallel, however no more than two new subjects may be infused within a 14-day period. If 1 DLT is identified in the 1st three evaluable subjects, Infusion #1 for all subsequent subjects will continue to be staggered by at least 28 days and DLT assessments will be performed after each evaluable subject reaches the Day 21 safety follow-up visit.\n\n  * Cohort 2 Participants (N = Up to 6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 via intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. The initial i.p. infusion may be followed by up to two additional infusions of huCART-meso cells via intravenous (IV) administration at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart. The subject must meet eligibility to receive additional infusions.\n\n\\*\\*Cohort 2 is prematurely closed. This closure is the result of feasibility concerns specific to the clinical/disease status of these patients at this stage of their treatment.\\*\\*\n\n\u2022 Cohort 3 Participants (N = Up to 6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 via intrahepatic delivery (Hepatic Arterial Infusion). The initial intrahepatic infusion may be followed by up to two additional infusions of huCART-meso cells via intravenous (IV) administration at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart. The subject must meet eligibility to receive additional infusions.\n\n\\*\\*Cohort 3 is prematurely closed. This closure is the result of feasibility concerns specific to the clinical/disease status of these patients at this stage of their treatment.\\*\\*\n\n\u2022 Cohort 4 Participants (N = Up to 6): will allow for the administration of lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells during 1st line standard of care chemotherapy. A single dose of 1-3x10\\^7/m\\^2 huCART-meso cells will be administered on day 0 via intrahepatic delivery (Hepatic Arterial Infusion), following a 1 week washout after standard of care chemotherapy. This initial intrahepatic infusion may be followed by up to two additional infusions of huCART-meso cells via intravenous (IV) administration at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart. The subject must meet all eligibility to receive additional infusions. Additional doses of standard of care chemotherapy may also be administered between huCART-meso infusions at the physician-investigator's discretion, as long as the required washout windows are appropriately adhered to. huCART-meso infusions may also be discontinued at any time in favor of resuming standard of care chemotherapy at the physician-investigator's discretion.\n\nAdverse events will be collected and evaluated during the protocol specified adverse event reporting period. Subjects will be continually evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). In the event of 2 DLTs in a specific cohort, additional enrollment and treatment activity will be paused to allow for further investigation."
