            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests a multilevel intervention at the clinic, provider and patient levels, to improve colonoscopy surveillance in patients with high risk colon polyps. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and deadly disease that is largely preventable through the detection and removal of colorectal polyps. One million Americans are diagnosed with high risk polyps of the colon or rectum annually and are at increased risk for CRC; however, uptake of recommended repeat colonoscopy in 3 years to reduce CRC risk is low in this group. This multilevel intervention may work to improve timely colonoscopy screening for patients with high risk colon polyps.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To increase completion of surveillance colonoscopy within 3.5 years of high risk neoplasia (HRN) diagnosis.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nAIM 1: Participants complete an interview over 20-30 minutes.\n\nAIM 2: Primary care clinics are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Clinics have the automatic addition of HRN to the medical problem list and indication of surveillance interval is added to the health maintenance portion of the electronic health records. Clinics also call patients to schedule their colonoscopy. Providers receive reminders and pending orders for the colonoscopy in the electronic health record. Patients receive a reminder 6 months in advance via their patient portal and mail to schedule a colonoscopy, and also receive a phone call from the patient communication center.\n\nARM II: Patients receive care according to the clinics' usual care practices."
