During each visit, participants will self-collect capillary blood samples. Additionally, a healthcare provide will obtain capillary and venous serum samples. All capillary samples will be collected from the upper arm using the Tasso+ device paired with a commercially-available serum separator gel microtainer. The samples will be shipped to a clinical laboratory and tested for various analytes. Expected analyte values for each participant will be based on their venous sample results which will be compared to Tasso sample results"
