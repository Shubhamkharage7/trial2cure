            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of volitinib in treating patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors that have come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Volitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend a phase II dose of volitinib (savolitinib) administered orally daily in children with refractory, progressive or recurrent primary CNS tumors.\n\nII. To define and describe the toxicities of savolitinib in children with refractory, progressive, or recurrent primary CNS tumors.\n\nIII. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of savolitinib in children with refractory, progressive, or recurrent primary CNS tumors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of savolitinib within the confines of a phase I study.\n\nII. To perform a genomic analysis within the confines of a phase I study to investigate correlation between response to treatment (as measured by objective response or progression free survival \\[PFS\\]) and the presence of specific genomic alterations (e.g., MET or HGF amplification, MET mutations, or MET fusion) and/or specific subgroups of disease.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of volitinib followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients receive volitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 39 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection X-ray imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans throughout study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically for up to 2 years."

Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there are unknown but potential risks to an unborn baby from savolitinib. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with savolitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with savolitinib\n* Patients with a known serious active infection including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis\n* Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results\n* Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., a blood pressure \\[BP\\] \\> 95th percentile for age, height, and gender, patients with values above these levels must have their blood pressure controlled with medication prior to starting study drug)\n\n  * The normal blood pressure by height, age, and gender can be assessed by using the NIH Guidelines on the PBTC Member's website (Protocols- Generic Forms and Templates- Normal Blood Pressure by Height and Age).\n* Patients with any of the following cardiac diseases\n\n  * Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association \\>= grade 2)\n  * Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc Bazett) \\> 450 msec on screening obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (EKGs) or\n  * Factors that may increase the risk of QTc prolongation such as chronic hypokalemia not correctable with supplements, congenital or familial long QT syndrome, or\n  * Family history of unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first-degree relatives or\n  * Any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes. These drugs must have been discontinued prior to the start of administration of study treatment in accordance with guidance\n  * Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting EKG, e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block, second degree heart block, PR interval \\> 250 msec.\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen for this trial\n* Concurrent Therapy\n\n  * Patients who are receiving any other anticancer or investigational drug therapy\n  * Patients receiving strong inducers of CYP3A4, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index within 2 weeks of the first dose of savolitinib (3 weeks for St John's Wort). Strong inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP3A4 substrates which have a narrow therapeutic range or CYP3A4 sensitive substrates should not be used during the trial or used with caution. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. Patient drug information handout and wallet card should be provided to patients\n  * Prior or current treatment with a MET inhibitor (e.g., foretinib, crizotinib, cabozantinib, or onartuzumab)\n* Patient is currently receiving any of the following herbal preparations or medications and cannot be discontinued 1 week (7 days) prior to enrollment (3 weeks for St. John's wort). These herbal medications include, but are not limited to: cannabis products, St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng\n* Patient has undergone major surgical procedure =\\< 28 days prior to beginning study drug or a minor surgical procedure =\\< 7 days prior to beginning study drug. No waiting is required following port-a-cath placement\n* Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for required follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to therapy or to adhere to drug administration plan, other study procedures, and study restrictions\n* Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition\n* Prisoners will be excluded from this study",
