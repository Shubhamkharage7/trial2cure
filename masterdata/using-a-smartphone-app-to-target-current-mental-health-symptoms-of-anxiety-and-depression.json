The study will utilize a smartphone application called Mood Triggers, designed to provide personalized feedback on individuals' maintenance factors (i.e., \"triggers\") of their anxiety and depressive symptoms. Mood Triggers delivers ultra-brief interventions (less than 2 minutes long) where participants view videos introducing important skills to treat their anxiety and depression. The study targets middle-aged adults (40-64 years old) who meet current criteria for moderate to severe anxiety and/or depressive disorders. It will enroll an anticipated 100 participants in a single-group, open-label design, with the intervention lasting up to 12 weeks. The primary outcomes include changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-Q-IV Scale, respectively, as well as changes in cancer risk assessed by the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Cancer Prevention Score."
