Prospective participants will be considered for the study if neurologic status suggests the need for continued treatment, and behavioral characteristics are clinically significant. All participants will receive active treatment, involving flexible dose titration of Epidiolex\u00ae and will be monitored for a period of four months. The study will be monitored and overseen by the Johns Hopkins Hospital Institutional Review Board."
