            "detailedDescription": "This multi-site, Phase 1/2 clinical trial is an open-label study to identify the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of a repeated dose regimen of NEO212 for the treatment of patients with radiographically-confirmed progression of Astrocytoma IDH-mutant, Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype, and the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a repeated dose regimen of NEO212 when given with select SOC for the treatment of solid tumor patients with radiographically confirmed uncontrolled brain metastasis. The study will have three phases, Phase 1, Phase 2a and Phase 2b.\n\nPhase 1 is a standard cohort dose escalation 3+3 design with a modified Fibonacci dose escalation used to determine the maximum tolerated dose to select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Phase 2a and Phase 2b. The initial dose of NEO212 will be 170mg and the dose will increase in successive cohorts (220, 400, 610, 810, and 1,000mg) until a MTD is reached and a RP2D is selected. There will be up to 42 patients enrolled in Phase 1. In the event two DLTs are experienced in any cohort, a dose de-escalation cohort will be followed (with half of the dose increase from the previous cohort) to determine the MTD/RP2D.\n\nPhase 2a is a safety run-in study with a standard 3+3 design used to confirm the safety of the MTD/RP2D of NEO212 when given in combination with select SOC regimens for patients with uncontrolled brain metastasis. There will be up to 12 patients enrolled into each combination regimen to confirm safety. One dose below the NEO212 MTD/RP2D Cohort Dose will be administered as a starting dose to establish safety (3+3), before moving to Phase 2b with the MTD/RP2D (3+3). In the event that two DLTs are experienced for patient receiving the MTD/RP2D in combination with SOC, the dose de-escalation cohort will be expanded to determine the MTD for a newly established Phase 2b Treatment Group.\n\nPhase 2b is a dose expansion study to assess efficacy of NEO212, at the MTD/RP2D in patients with Astrocytoma IDH-mutant, Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype as a single Treatment Group. A second Treatment Group to study the MTD/RP2D of NEO212 in combination with select SOC regimens in patients with solid tumors and uncontrolled brain metastasis established in Phase 2a will be evaluated. Phase 2b will be initiated for patients with Astrocytoma IDH-mutant or Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype alongside Phase 2a. There will be up to 28 patients enrolled to have 27 evaluable patients enrolled in each Phase 2b Treatment Group.\n\nFor all phases of the study, NEO212 will be self-administered daily for days 1-5 of a 28-day treatment cycle."
