            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an oral, nutrient intervention containing the bioactive components of fish oil to promote healing of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLUs) by reducing the chronic inflammation at wound sites that prevents healing progression. If this systemic, nutrient intervention is found to alter the microenvironment of CVLUs, the science of wound healing and care of patients with CVLUs will be vastly improved.",
            "detailedDescription": "The pathogenesis of CVLU involves high numbers of activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) that are associated with persistent inflammation in the wound bed. The proposed research is to test the efficacy of an oral, nutrient intervention containing the bioactive components of fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA + docosahexaenoic acid - DHA) to assuage PMN activity and promote healing. The study plans to include 248 successive eligible adults \u2265 55 years of age with CVLUs who continue to receive standard care at two university out-patient wound clinics. Participants will be randomized to 2 groups: 12 weeks of daily oral therapy with EPA+DHA (1.87 g/d of EPA + 1.0 g/d of DHA) or daily oral therapy with placebo. At 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks, across the 2 groups, three specific aims will be pursued:\n\nAim 1. Compare levels of EPA+DHA-derived lipid mediators, and inflammatory cytokines in blood and CVLU fluid.\n\nSubaim 1a. Compare inflammatory cytokine gene expression by PMNs in blood (neutrophils and monocytes).\n\nAim 2. Compare PMN activation (blood, CVLU fluid), and PMN-derived protease levels (CVLU fluid).\n\nAim 3. Compare reduction in wound area, controlling for key factors known to affect healing, and determine relationships with lipid mediators, cytokines and PMN activation.\n\nSubaim 3a. Compare frequency of CVLU recurrence and levels of study variables in blood between 2 subgroups within the EPA+DHA group with healed CVLUs (after 3 additional months of EPA+DHA therapy versus placebo therapy beyond Week 12 time point).\n\nSubaim 3b. Compare the symptom of pain at all time points and quality of life at first and last study visits across the 2 groups and 2 subgroups."
