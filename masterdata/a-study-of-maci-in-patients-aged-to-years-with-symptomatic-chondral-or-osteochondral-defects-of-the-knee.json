            "detailedDescription": "This is a 2-year prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group clinical trial; a total of 45 patients, ages 10 to 17 years, will be randomized to receive a 1-time treatment with MACI or microfracture (2:1, 30 MACI:15 microfracture).\n\nAfter meeting screening criteria at the initial visit, all patients will have a screening arthroscopy to further assess study eligibility. During the screening arthroscopy, patients will be further evaluated against entry criteria. Cartilage lesion size will be measured prior to any cartilage repair procedure and randomization. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria and are considered suitable for treatment in the study will have a cartilage biopsy taken prior to randomization to study treatment. Eligible patients will be randomized during the screening arthroscopy procedure to receive either MACI or microfracture treatment. Patients randomized to microfracture will undergo the procedure during the screening arthroscopy.\n\nAll biopsied tissue will be sent to the Vericel manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the sample will be processed to isolate the autologous chondrocytes. Cells from patients randomized to the MACI group will be used in the preparation of the MACI implant; cells from patients randomized to the microfracture group will be cryopreserved.\n\nPatients randomized to treatment with MACI will return within 12 weeks of the screening arthroscopy to undergo the chondrocyte implantation procedure via arthrotomy. Patients are to follow a recommended postoperative rehabilitation program and compliance with the rehabilitation schedule will be monitored.\n\nPatients will be followed post-study treatment for 2 years (104 Weeks)."
