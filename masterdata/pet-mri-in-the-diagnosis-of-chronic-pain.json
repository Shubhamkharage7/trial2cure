            "briefSummary": "Several studies have implicated involvement of sigma-1 receptors (SR1s) in the generation of chronic pain, while others are investigating anti SR1 drugs for treatment of chronic pain. Using \\[18F\\]-FTC-146 and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), the investigators hope to identify the source of pain generation in patients with chronic pain. The purpose of this study is to compare the uptake of \\[18F\\]FTC-146 in healthy volunteers to that of individuals suffering from chronic pain.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic pain is a significant, widespread problem affecting every fifth person worldwide. Reported in 2011 by the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects 116 million American adults - more than the total number of individuals affected by heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined. An estimated $635 billion each year is spent in the medical management of chronic pain and lost productivity. Better clinical methods to diagnose and localize pain are needed.\n\nThe investigators have developed a S1R-specific radiotracer, \\[18F\\]FTC-146. Using imaging approaches to assess the location of S1R in pain may provide a tool to diagnose pain generators, monitor treatment response, and aid in the selection of patients for treatment.\n\nThe goal is to use \\[18F\\]FTC-146 to image S1R expression in healthy volunteers and to compare the images to those individuals suffering from pain conditions in the following categories: (1) nociceptive pain (pain that results from tissue injury or inflammation), (2) neuropathic pain (pain that results from direct injury, disruption, impingement/compression or malfunction of the peripheral and/or central nervous system), and (3) mixed pain (pain that appears to have both nociceptive and neuropathic)."
