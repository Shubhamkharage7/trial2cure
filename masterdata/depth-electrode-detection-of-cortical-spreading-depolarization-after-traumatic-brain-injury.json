This will allow electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings. An ECoG will be reviewed by a study Neurosurgeon to understand the association between cortical spreading depression and pathological findings on imaging. The recordings help create a novel algorithm in order to detect CSD's. This may ultimately provide significant benefit to society through the diagnosis and treatment of secondary injury associated with traumatic brain injury."

After EVD and depth electrode placement, continuous recording of ECoG activity as well as relevant physiological parameters will be performed for the duration of clinically indicated invasive neuromonitoring in accordance with the standard of care for TBI patients.
