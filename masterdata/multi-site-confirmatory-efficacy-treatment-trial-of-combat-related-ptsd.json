The study will also examine change in depression, psychosocial functioning, and neurophysiological (i.e., electroencephalography and magnetic resonance images) measures.",
            "detailedDescription": "Using three treatment arms, the study will examine Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptom reduction when (1) 1 Hz (hertz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) is administered prior to each of 12 Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) sessions compared to when (2) sham rTMS is administered to the rDLPFC is administered prior to each of 12 CPT sessions and to when (3) 1 Hz rTMS is delivered to rDLPFC alone over 12 sessions.\n\nVeterans with combat-related PTSD will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms. Primary outcome PTSD symptom severity measures, secondary neuropsychological, electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measures, and prescreening assessments for study contraindicators will be collected prior to being assigned to a treatment arm (i.e., baseline).\n\nPrimary outcome PTSD symptom severity measures and secondary neuropsychological outcome measures will be collected twice within the span of the treatment sessions (i.e., sessions 5 and 9) and at three times following treatment competition (i.e., 1-month, 6-months, and 12-months). EEG also will be collected at the 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month assessments, and MRI will be collected at the 6-month and 12-month assessments."
