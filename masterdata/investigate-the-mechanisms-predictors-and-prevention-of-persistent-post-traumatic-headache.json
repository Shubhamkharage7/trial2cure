This data will be utilized to characterize post-traumatic headache and build univariate and multivariate predictive models for post-traumatic headache persistence and for the response to post-traumatic headache treatment. Some participants might be eligible to participate in the clinical trial portion of this study.The clinical trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled investigation of erenumab for the treatment of post-traumatic headache. Participants will be randomized when PTH has been present for 35-56 days. The clinical trial component of this Focused Program is described in more detail in a separate clinicaltrials.gov record.\n\nFollow-up questionnaires, headache diary data, pain threshold results, and brain imaging data will be collected longitudinally during the trial to assess for changes over time and associations of such changes with post-traumatic headache treatment outcomes."
