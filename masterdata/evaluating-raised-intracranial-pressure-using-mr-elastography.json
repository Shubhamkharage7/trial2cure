Investigators will evaluate for a correlation between brain stiffness and opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Investigators will also evaluate for changes in brain stiffness after interventions that are aimed at lowering intracranial pressure, including lumbar punctures, medications, and surgical interventions, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Lastly, investigators will compare MR elastography measurements to other forms of noninvasive methods of detecting raised intracranial pressure, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and indirect signs of raised intracranial pressure on MRI."
