The intervention period will be on days 16-33 during which participants will consume study provided high-arabinose foods. The follow-up period will be on days 34-49 during which participants will no longer eat the study foods and will refrain from consuming specific foods. The total duration of the study will be approximately 7 weeks. Stool samples will be collected on 3 occasions and participants will be asked to complete questionnaires, daily stool logs, dietary intake reports, and 24-hour dietary recalls throughout the course of the study."
