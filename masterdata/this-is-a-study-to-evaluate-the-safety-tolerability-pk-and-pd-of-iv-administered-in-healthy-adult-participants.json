This study will evaluate safety and tolerability and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of ABL301, following IV single ascending dose (Part 1 - SAD), and multiple ascending dose (Part 2 - MAD) administrations, in healthy adult participants.\n\nIn Part 1 SAD, seven single doses are planned to be administered in an ascending manner: DL1, DL2, DL3, DL4, DL5, DL6 and DL7. Each dose level will comprise 8 participants randomly assigned in an overall 6:2 ratio (ABL301:Placebo), including 1:1 ratio for the first 2 sentinel participants and 5:1 ratio for the remaining participants, to receive a single dose of study drug or placebo, respectively.\n\nIn Part 2 MAD, three multiples doses are planned to be administered in an ascending manner: DL1, DL2 and DL3. Each dose level will comprise 10 participants randomly assigned in an overall 8:2 ratio (ABL301:Placebo)"
