            "briefSummary": "This research study is studying a drug called GDC-0084 as a possible treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.\n\nThe drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* GDC-0084\n* Trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae)",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved GDC-0084 as a treatment for any disease.\n\nTrastuzumab is a targeted therapy approved by the FDA to be used alone or in combination with a chemotherapy drug to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\nGDC-0084 has been shown to stop the activity of a protein called PI3-kinase. This action blocks a pathway in the body that cancer cells commonly use to grow and divide.\n\nTrastuzumab is called a \"targeted therapy\" because it works by attaching itself to specific receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When targeted therapies attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the immune system. This process allows trastuzumab to help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking to see how your cancer responds to the combination of GDC-0084 and Trastuzumab."

CSF sampling is not required in the absence of suggestive symptoms to exclude leptomeningeal involvement\\].\n* Patients with known contraindication to MRI (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme obesity, hypersensitivity, etc.). However, head CT with contrast may be used in place of MRI at baseline and throughout the trial if MRI is contraindicated and a participant's brain metastases are clearly measurable by head CT.\n* Chemotherapy or targeted therapy within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy. No washout is required for trastuzumab.\n* Has received prior therapy with a PI3K or mTOR inhibitor.\n* No washout is required for endocrine therapy. If a patient has been on ovarian suppression for at least 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, continuation of ovarian suppression is permitted on protocol. Starting a new endocrine therapy during protocol therapy is not permitted.\n* Current use or history of receiving a non-approved, investigational treatment within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy.\n* Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic composition to GDC-0084 or any constituent of the product.\n* The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association Class III or IV, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), gastric or duodenal ulceration diagnosed within the previous 6 months, chronic liver or renal disease, or severe malnutrition. If a participant has controlled DM but is unable to monitor blood sugars at home, they will be excluded from the trial.\n* The subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* No active, second potentially life-threatening cancer.\n* Has had major surgery within 21 days before initiation of protocol therapy.\n* Active infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of protocol therapy initiation.\n* Symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest.\n* Known intolerance to trastuzumab.\n* QT interval time of \u2265 470 msec.\n* Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Should a participant be taking one of these agents and is able to discontinue the therapy or switch to a different agent, no washout will be required prior to starting study medication. Please see Appendix M for the list of medications. Corticosteroids, which are weak CYP3A4 inducers are allowed. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product",
