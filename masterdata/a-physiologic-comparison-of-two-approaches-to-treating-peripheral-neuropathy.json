            "briefSummary": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common and costly microvascular complications of diabetes impacting more than 50% of patients and costing more than 10.1 billion dollars annually. Intraneural Facilitation Therapy (INF\u00ae Therapy) is a non-invasive technique that has shown to improve balance and pain in patients with Type 2 Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (T2DPN); however, the underlying physiological mechanisms need further understanding. The purpose of this study is to investigate the physiological mechanisms behind two approaches to treating T2DPN, INF\u00ae Therapy and standard physical therapy. Eligible subjects presenting with diabetic neuropathy symptoms will be recruited and referred to the Loma Linda University Health's Neuropathic Therapy Center. Forty patients will be evenly randomized into two groups: an INF\u00ae Therapy Treatment group and standard physical therapy treatment group. Subjects will participate in 11 study visits over a period of 6 weeks. Non-invasive assessments will measure neuropathy pain, heart rate variability, neuropathy severity, blood oxygen levels, and blood flow under the skin. Lab draws will measure inflammation levels in the blood and how well blood sugar levels have been maintained over a period of about 3 months. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA will be used to analyze data and answer the research questions. The findings of this study will provide a better understanding of how INF\u00ae Therapy and standard physical therapy work, subsequently improving non-invasive treatment methods for T2DPN patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study participants will be assessed on the first, second, fifth, tenth and eleventh sessions.\n\nDuring the participants first and eleventh sessions participants will complete the Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS), the Lower Extremity Neuropathy Scale (LENS), a vascular analysis of the Neurovascular Index (NVI) using a Philips Affinity 50 Ultrasound, and Neuropad\u00ae testing. The first session will also include completion of the Background Information form. Patients will be asked to wear loose fitting clothing and to arrive 15 minutes early to complete the informed consent documents on the first session.\n\nWelltory App measurements to assess heart rate variability will be taken in the morning and evening the day before, the day of, and the day after each treatment session.\n\nOn the second session the patient will have:\n\n* Electrocardiogram testing (ECG) for assessment of heart rate variability (HRV) using PowerLab+LabChart and BioAmp (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO).\n* Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measurement using a Foresight Elite monitor (Edwards LifeSciences, Irvine, CA)\n* Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurement using a skin surface Laser Doppler add-on for Chart/Powerlab (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO).\n* Welltory App measurements will be taken before and after treatment to assess for heart rate variability (HRV).\n* A blood draw will be completed by a licensed lab technician to measure blood cytokine and HbA1C levels. A total of 1 1/3 teaspoons of blood will collected at this time point. The blood draw will be performed prior to treatment.\n* The patient will then receive a 60 minute INF\u00ae Therapy or standard physical therapy session.\n* The aforementioned tests will then be repeated including ECG, NIRS, and LDF to measure post treatment values.\n\nDuring the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth sessions, the patient will have a 60 minute INF\u00ae Therapy or standard physical therapy session. Welltory App measurements will be taken before and after treatment to assess for heart rate variability (HRV).\n\nOn the fifth session the patient will have a 60 minute INF\u00ae Therapy or standard physical therapy session. Welltory App measurements will be taken before and after treatment to assess for heart rate variability (HRV). Followed by:\n\n\u2022 A blood draw by a licensed lab technician to measure blood cytokine levels. A total of 1 \u00bc teaspoons will be collected at this time point.\n\nOn the tenth session the patient will have a 60 minute INF\u00ae Therapy or standard physical therapy session. Welltory App measurements will be taken before and after treatment to assess for heart rate variability (HRV). Followed by:\n\n* Electrocardiogram testing (ECG) for assessment of heart rate variability (HRV) using PowerLab+LabChart and BioAmp (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO).\n* Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) using a Foresight Elite monitor (Edwards LifeSciences, Irvine, CA)\n* Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurement using a skin surface Laser Doppler add-on for Chart/PowerLab (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO).\n* A blood draw will be completed by licensed lab technician to measure blood cytokine levels and HbA1C.

The first is the facilitation hold, which is thought to pressurize the nervous system and bias circulation from the artery into the epineurium. This hold stretches the nerve further than the artery, increasing the amount of elastin in the artery and enlarging the opening of the arterial junction increasing blood into the epineurium. The secondary hold then increases epineurial blood into the transperineurial vessels increasing pressure into the endoneurial capillaries of the site being treated. The third hold, known as the sub hold, encourages blood flow through ischemic endoneurial capillaries that have increased resistance/pressure through the application of Bernoulli's principle. The series of stretches will be repeated on the affected side for the treatment duration.",
