There is also a third group that are eligible patients not enrolled in the trial (patients will only be interviewed and will not receive any active treatment) and will not be included in the enrollment numbers or outcome measures."

If a patient meets any of the second-stage treatment failure criteria (per protocol) on day 6 through day 10, the patient will be considered to have failed second-stage therapy and will be referred for colectomy. If a patient does not meet criteria for second-stage treatment failure or criteria for safe discharge (see the protocol) the patient will be permitted to continue second-stage treatment for a maximum of 7 days (day 10 of intervention).
