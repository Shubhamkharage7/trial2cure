The purpose of the phase Ib portion of the study is to evaluate the safety, identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of N-803 and determine the Recommended Dose (RD) level of N-803 in combination with BCG for the phase IIb expansion.\n\nIn the phase IIb expansion, patients will be randomized to receive either intravesical N-803 in combination with BCG or BCG alone. Patients will be enrolled into one of two study cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B). These will be two independent study cohorts, evaluated separately for treatment efficacy."

Severe/unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.\n6. History or evidence of uncontrollable CNS disease.\n7. Known HIV-positive.\n8. Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. All prior infections must have resolved following optimal therapy.\n9. Concurrent febrile illness, active urinary tract infection, active tuberculosis, a history of hypotension or anaphylactic reactions.\n10. Ongoing chronic systemic steroid therapy required (\\>10 mg oral prednisone daily or equivalent).\n11. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must adhere to using a medically acceptable method of birth control prior to screening and agree to continue its use during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or be surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation). Women of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who is NOT permanently sterile or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. Males must agree to use barrier methods of birth control while on study and for 90 days post last dose of study drug.\n12. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n13. Other illness that in the opinion of the investigator would exclude the patient from participating in this study.",
