            "briefSummary": "Leveraging veterans' intimate relationships during treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has the potential to concurrently improve PTSD symptoms and relationship quality. Brief Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (bCBCT) is a manualized treatment designed to simultaneously improve PTSD and relationship functioning for couples in which one partner has PTSD. Although efficacious in improving PTSD, the effects of CBCT on relationship satisfaction are small, especially among Veterans. Pharmacological augmentation of bCBCT with intranasal oxytocin, a neurohormone that influences mechanisms of trauma recovery and social behavior, may help improve the efficacy of bCBCT. The purpose of this randomized placebo-controlled trial is to compare the clinical and functional outcomes of bCBCT augmented with intranasal oxytocin (bCBCT + OT) versus bCBCT plus placebo (bCBCT + PL). The investigators will also explore potential mechanisms of action: communication, empathy, and trust.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Brief Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (bCBCT) paired with intranasal oxytocin (OT) versus placebo on PTSD symptoms, intimate relationship satisfaction and psychosocial functioning in a sample of veterans with PTSD (across all measures) and their intimate partners (relationship satisfaction only). The study will also explore the impact of intranasal oxytocin on potential mechanisms of action (i.e., communication skills, empathy, and trust).\n\nbCBCT is a modified PTSD-specific cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy attended by the couple that uses close relationships as the vehicle for recovery. Across eight 75-minute sessions, this manualized therapy addresses the patient's PTSD and relationship functioning simultaneously via its focus on PTSD psychoeducation within relationship contexts, communication skills, behavioral approach exercises, and cognitive interventions.\n\nOxytocin is a 9-amino-acid nonapeptide hormone produced by the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus that regulates human emotions, social cognition, and social behaviors. Oxytocin is released to several brain areas, including the amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, insula, and striatum, and effects are mediated by oxytocin receptors found in these regions.\n\nIntranasal administration of oxytocin may offer understanding of the causal effects of oxytocin on human behavior. Intranasal oxytocin is safe and easy to administer, with a short half-life that makes it highly suitable for adding to behavioral interventions. Intranasal oxytocin is best known for its widespread effects on affiliative processes and behaviors. For example, intranasal oxytocin increases trust, empathy, generosity, positive communication, and emotional disclosure. Oxytocin also improves social cognition, including emotion recognition and empathic accuracy. The combination of intranasal oxytocin with provision of social support suppresses cortisol release and subjective responses to social stress.\n\nIntranasal oxytocin can be conceptualized as a \"psychotherapy process catalyst\", in that oxytocin could enhance patients' openness to intervention, attention to others' communication, and willingness and ability to develop therapeutic alliance. A recent systematic review of 14 studies of the effects of intranasal oxytocin on PTSD symptoms concluded that there is tentative evidence for the clinical utility of intranasal oxytocin for PTSD, although more studies with chronic administration among clinical samples are needed.\n\nThe investigators will employ a double blind, placebo-controlled RCT design in which Veterans will receive a dose of oxytocin or placebo before each bCBCT session and complete mid-treatment, post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up assessments. Based on the findings from past bCBCT trial and the investigators' recent bCBCT + OT pilot study, the investigators anticipate about 1/3 of the sample will be dual Veterans or the identified Veteran is female. The investigators project an approximate 20-25% attrition rate, resulting in approximately 100 couples completing treatment. Consistent with past trials, to enhance retention, the investigators will ask couples to provide contact information for collateral informants who can reach them if the investigators are unable to do so via their primary contact information. Study personnel will routinely remind couples of appointments via telephone and/or letters and the team will meet weekly to review and problem-solve retention strategies. These are all established procedures implemented from successful prior trials. If successful, the study will advance knowledge of strategies for improving Veterans' quality of life by improving their intimate relationships along with PTSD symptoms."
