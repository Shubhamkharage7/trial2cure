            "detailedDescription": "A 12-week pilot intervention study introducing a high-intensity functional training program to 100 cancer survivors and evaluate the effects of this program on patient quality of life, functional capacity, and body composition. Response rates will be determined using various recruitment methods and estimate differences in response rates by patient characteristics including race, gender and age. Barriers to participation in the program in contacted patients who do not enroll as well as patients who enroll and do not complete the program will be described, as will participant satisfaction with enrolled participants who complete the program. The goal of this pilot study is to help refine the recruitment and program methods for a larger intervention study to test the superiority of a high-intensity interval functional training program compared with current American Cancer Society guidelines in improving functional capacity, body composition and patient reported quality of life.\n\nSurveys will be completed by each participant weekly and physical assessments will be completed monthly."
