Patients must not have received prior anticancer therapy or radiation therapy within the 3 weeks and must not have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment on protocol. Palliative radiation therapy is allowed. For small molecules (MW \\< 0.9 kDA), the washout period is 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whatever comes first.\n2. Active brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with treated brain metastasis must have stable disease, evidenced by MRI brain imaging for at least 4 weeks, and the patient must have been off steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n3. Previous episodes of \u2265 Grade 3 (G3) immune-related toxicity that includes G3 colitis, G3 pneumonitis, G3 skin rash, G3 increase in liver enzymes (with the exception of symptoms that in the opinion of the investigator will not compromise the patients' safety on the trial. Patients with stable endocrinological AEs (e.g., hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, or diabetes mellitus) are allowed.\n4. Persistent toxicity of NCI CTCAE version 5 Grade \\> 1 severity that is related to prior therapy.\n\n   Note: Sensory neuropathy, hypothyroidism or alopecia of Grade \u2264 2 are acceptable.

Concurrent administration of medications or foods that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome p450 3A (CYP3A) within 2 weeks before study intervention. Alintegimod may increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates; consider a dose reduction of such substrates and monitor for signs of toxicities of co-administered sensitive CYP3A substrates (see listing of strong inhibitors and inducer drugs in FDA tables). An alternative is to replace such agents with drugs that are not CYP3A4 metabolized if at all feasible.\n6. The patient has cardiac conditions as follows:\n\n   * a) myocarditis;\n   * b) uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure \\> 160/100) despite optimal therapy;\n   * c) uncontrolled angina; ventricular arrhythmias; congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II or above);\n   * d) prior or current cardiomyopathy;\n   * e) uncontrolled atrial fibrillation with heart rate \\> 100 beats per minute (bpm); unstable ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to starting treatment or angina requiring use of nitrates more than once weekly);\n   * f) concomitant medication with drugs known to cause Torsades de Pointes;87\n   * g) QT interval correction for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \u2265 470 ms (average from 3 QTcF values on the triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram \\[ECG\\]) at screening.\n7. Known history of a positive test for HIV, or positive test for hepatitis B (positive for HBsAg) or hepatitis C (HCV RNA).\n8. Concurrent malignancies are permitted if they were previously treated, and all treatment of that malignancy was completed at least 2 years before enrollment and no evidence of disease exists, or with agreement from the Principal Investigator (PI), patients who have a concurrent malignancy that is clinically stable and does not require tumor-directed treatment are eligible to participate if the risk of the prior malignancy interfering with either safety or efficacy endpoints is very low, or with agreement from the PI, other malignancies may be permitted if the risk of the prior malignancy interfering with either safety or efficacy end points is very low. Adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ is allowed.\n9. Men receiving the investigational drug and are sexually active with women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must use contraception during treatment and for 5 half-lives after the last dose of the investigational drug or Women, not otherwise meeting other exclusion criteria, who are WOCBP must be on contraception for a minimum duration of 3 months prior to treatment and continue contraception during treatment and for 5 half-lives after the last dose of the investigational drug.\n10. The patient has concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease that could compromise participation in the study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, severe infection requiring active treatment, severe malnutrition, chronic severe liver or renal disease).\n11. Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, current or within 14 days of administration of Alintegimod with the following exceptions:\n\n    * a) Topical, intranasal, inhaled, ocular, intra-articular corticosteroids;\n    * b) Physiological doses of replacement corticosteroids (e.g., for adrenal insufficiency) are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.\n12.

Serious autoimmune disease at the discretion of the treating Investigator: patients with a history of active serious inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus or autoimmune vasculitis (e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis) are excluded from participation in this study\n15. Active or history of pneumonitis (drug-induced), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), or lung disease that may interfere with assessment of pneumonitis. History of radiation pneumonitis in a previous radiation field is permitted.\n16. Previous participation in a study of any investigational agent within 21 days of enrollment or within 5 half-lives of the study treatment, whichever is the least.\n17. Use of mechanical ventilation or having a resting O2 saturation \\< 90% (on room air) by pulse-oximetry, require renal dialysis, require vasopressors, and/or severe hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.\n18. Proven or suspected ongoing systemic infection requiring IV antibiotics.\n19. Women who are pregnant or lactating.\n\n    Note: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a \"negative\" serum pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment. Non-childbearing potential is defined as 1 of the following:\n    * i. Postmenopausal with \\> 1 year since last menses and:\n    * 1. If \\< 65 years old, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) \\> 40 mIU/mL.\n    * 2. If \u2265 65 years old and not on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), FSH \\> 30 mIU/mL.\n    * 3.

Written medical documentation of being sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy, double oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) with the procedure performed \u2265 6 months prior to dosing study drug(s).\n\n    Note: Tubal ligation is not considered a form of permanent sterilization.\n20. Psychiatric illness/social circumstances that would limit compliance with study requirements and substantially increase the risk of adverse events or have compromised ability to provide written informed consent.\n21. Patients who have had allogeneic tissue or solid organ transplantation. Prior T cell therapy is allowed\n22. Use of biotin (i.e., Vitamin B7) or supplements containing biotin higher than the daily adequate intake of 30 \u00b5g (NIH-ODS 2022; Section 5.9.2.1).88 Note: Patients who switch from a high dose to a dose of \u226430 \u00b5g/day are eligible for study entry.\n23.
