This tailored prospective study seeks to fulfill a significant gap in the understanding of the characteristics, implications, and treatment options for postoperative olfactory and gustatory impairment following endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery."

In discrimination testing, the participant is evaluated on their ability to discern the unique scent among three scented sticks. In identification testing, the patient names the smells using a multiple choice form which offers four definitions for every Sniffin' stick, only one of which is correct.",
