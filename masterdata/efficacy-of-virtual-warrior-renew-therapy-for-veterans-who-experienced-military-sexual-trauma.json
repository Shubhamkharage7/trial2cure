By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn if two different groups: Warrior Renew and Health \\& Wellness are effective in reducing mental health symptoms in Veterans who have experienced MST and if either is more effective than the other. Participation in this research will last about 16 weeks.",

Military sexual trauma or MST is defined as any experience of sexual assault or sexual harassment experienced during military service. Survivors of MST may develop mental health symptoms. Group treatment for survivors of MST may be helpful. This study will compare two different group treatments: 1) Warrior Renew; and 2) Health \\& Wellness.\n\nBy doing this study, the investigators hope to learn: 1) if one or both of the group treatments are safe and effective in reducing mental health symptoms in Veterans who have experienced MST; and 2) if there are differences based on gender that should be addressed differently in developing treatments for survivors of MST."
