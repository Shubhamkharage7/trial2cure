            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well lifileucel, with reduce dose fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for lymphodepletion and interleukin-2, work for treating patients with melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic).Lifileucel is made up of specialized immune cells called lymphocytes or T cells that are taken from a patient's tumor, grown in a manufacturing facility and infused back into the preconditioned patient to attack the tumor. Giving Lifileucel with a reduced dose of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for lymphodepletion and interleukin -2 is being studied in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. The percentage of total TIL clones as measured by the T-cell receptor (TCR) population shared between the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) product and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy parameters of lifileucel (LN-144) in combination with a reduced dose lymphodepletion in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma by assessing objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).\n\nII. To characterize the safety profile of lifileucel (LN-144) in combination with a reduced dose lymphodepletion regimen in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Blood and tumor samples will be banked for future correlative analyses, including flow cytometry, next generation sequencing, immunogenomics and RNA sequencing to characterize the immunome and microenvironment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo tumor resection surgery. After the lifileucel is manufactured (approximately 4 weeks later), patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and fludarabine IV on days -4 to -1. Patients then receive lifileucel IV on day 0. Patients also receive up to 6 doses of intraleukin-2 IV.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 28, 42, 84, 126, 180, 365, month 18, and month 24."
