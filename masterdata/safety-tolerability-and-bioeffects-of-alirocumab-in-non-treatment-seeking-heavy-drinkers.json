            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nDrinking alcohol can lead to swelling and injury in the liver. Long-term heavy drinking may lead to liver disease. Researchers want to study the relationship between a drug called alirocumab, alcohol use, and liver functioning/swelling.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the effects of alirocumab in people who drink alcohol.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy adults ages 21 to 65 who regularly consume an average of 20 or more drinks per week.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened under protocol 14-AA-0181.\n\nParticipants will get alirocumab or a placebo as an injection under the skin.\n\nParticipants will give blood and urine samples. They will have physical exams.\n\nParticipants will have FibroScans . It measures liver and spleen stiffness. Participants will lie on a table. They will expose the lower right and left side of their chest. The machine will send a small vibration to the liver.\n\nParticipants may have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the liver. The MRI scanner is shaped like a cylinder. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner. A device called a coil will be placed over their liver.\n\nParticipants will have a Doppler scan and ultrasound. These tests measure blood flow in the body.\n\nParticipants will have an electrocardiogram. It measures heart function.\n\nParticipants will fill out surveys about how they are feeling, their alcohol consumption, and other behaviors. They will complete cognitive tasks on a computer.\n\nParticipants will meet with a clinician. They will discuss the participant s assessment results, patterns of drinking, and possibly stopping or cutting down on drinking.\n\nParticipation will last for 8 weeks. Participants will have 9 study visits.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThe PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab has been recently shown to attenuate alcohol-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, hepatocellular injury and hepatic inflammation in a rat model of chronic alcohol exposure. Given the unmet clinical need for novel treatment options for alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), we are proposing to conduct a safety and tolerability study of alirocumab in this new target population.\n\nWe hypothesize that alirocumab will be well tolerated and safe in this new target population and alirocumab will attenuate alcohol-induced liver damage and inflammatory biomarkers.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of alirocumab in subjects who are heavy drinkers.\n\nSecondary/Exploratory Objectives: Secondary/exploratory objectives are to assess various biomarkers related to alcohol-induced liver damage and inflammation.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: The primary endpoint in the study is to assess the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events in non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers treated with alirocumab or placebo. \\[Time Frame: baseline to week 8\\]\n\nSecondary/exploratory Endpoints: The secondary endpoint is to explore effects of alirocumab on various biomarkers using change from baseline."
