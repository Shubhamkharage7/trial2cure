This study aims to clarify how speech may be affected by Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParticipants will complete speech collection sessions and a survey at home using an iPad. Participants can expect to be in the study for 3 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Digital technology, including recorded speech, has the capability of providing a wealth of information about early changes to cognition and communication associated with developing Alzheimer's disease pathology, with the potential for highly accessible, yet low-burden measurement. In this project, researchers will recruit a subset of participants from two longitudinal, observational cohort studies enriched for individuals at risk for or living with Alzheimer's disease to record their speech at home with a mobile device, longitudinally. Our interdisciplinary team will then validate digital markers across all stages of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), including the prodromal phase, and can enhance sensitivity and specificity of speech metrics while contributing valuable information about remote, noninvasive, and accessible assessment and disease monitoring."
