            "detailedDescription": "The investigators aim to promote brain health by reducing lifestyle risk factors for dementia in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). This study is a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) comparing two virtual lifestyle programs, My Healthy Brain 1 and My Healthy Brain 2. Eligible older adults include: age \u2265 60, self-reported worry about changes in memory or thinking, and risk factors for dementia (determined by the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia score \u2265 6). Participants will be randomized to one of two groups (My Healthy Brain 1 or My Healthy Brain 2) and will complete 8 weekly 90-minute sessions via Zoom delivered by a clinical psychologist. Each session will focus on a different topic relevant to brain health (e.g. physical activity, sleep, etc.). The primary aim of the study is to determine the credibility, expectancy, feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, and satisfaction of the programs. The investigators will also explore improvements in cognition, lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sleep, nutrition, alcohol and tobacco use, social functioning), depression, anxiety, and mindfulness assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 month follow-up. All participants will wear a watch to monitor changes in lifestyle during the program."
