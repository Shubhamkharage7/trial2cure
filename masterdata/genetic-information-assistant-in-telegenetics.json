The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 Does receiving pre-genetic test education with a chat bot or genetic counselor affect if the participant decides to get genetic testing?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* have a pre-test genetic counselling session with a genetic counselor or the GIA chatbot\n* answer questions about their cancer genetic knowledge and how they are doing\n* provide a saliva sample for genetic testing to test for cancer gene mutations\n* have their genetic testing results provided to them.\n* have the option to share their genetic testing results with family members\n\nResearchers will compare how many participants who had pre-genetic counseling with the chatbot received genetic testing to how many participants who had pre-genetic counseling with a genetic counselor received genetic testing.",
            "detailedDescription": "High risk patients will be randomized to standard of care telegenetics with a UVA Genetic Counselor (GC) for pre-test counseling or to the novel interventional arm of pre-test counseling via Genetic Information Assistant (GIA). Participants in the study will receive their link for a telegenetics appointment or GIA link based on randomization and patients will complete pre-test genetic counseling via their assigned treatment arm. Participants will not be masked to their trial arm assignment. In the telegenetics arm, patients will be offered a video visit scheduled through Epic zoom or a phone visit in our cancer genetics clinic per standard of care. Patients randomized to the GIA arm will receive a personalized link based on their family history. At the completion of counseling, participants will be offered genetic testing. If they agree, they will be mailed a saliva kit via Invitae Genetics for panel based genetic testing via The Invitae Common Hereditary Cancers panel to analyze 47 genes associated with cancers of the breast, ovary, uterus, and gastrointestinal system, which includes the stomach, colon, rectum, small bowel, and pancreas."
