OUDTP patients are a population with exceptionally high combustible cigarettes smoking burden and yet limited success in achieving meaningful clinical outcomes in tobacco treatment. If effective, electronic cigarettes would provide an additional tool for tobacco harm reduction among this difficult-to-treat vulnerable population."
