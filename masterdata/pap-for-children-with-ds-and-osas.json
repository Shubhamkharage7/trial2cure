It is being hypothesized that, irrespective of study arm, increased PAP adherence will be associated with better quality of life, neurobehavioral, and healthcare utilization outcomes.\n\nEvaluate the effect of PAP adherence in children with DS and OSAS on patient-centered outcomes and family-relevant outcomes identified during the R61 phase of this research. It is being hypothesized that irrespective of study arm, increased PAP adherence will be associated with better patient-centered outcomes, and family-relevant outcomes identified during the first year of this research.\n\nDetermine the efficacy of INT vs. CON in promoting PAP adherence. It is being hypothesized that that children receiving INT will show significantly increased objectively-measured PAP adherence at 6 months compared with those receiving CON (Aim 4A). As a secondary aim (4B), it will be evaluated whether the improved adherence is maintained over 12 months. It is being hypothesized that participants initially randomized to the INT arm will have better adherence at 12 months compared to those in the CON arm.\n\nUse mixed methods during the randomized controlled trial to identify family perceptions, such as empowerment and self-efficacy, regarding PAP use in youth with OSAS and DS. It is being hypothesized that INT-PAP will be associated with more positive perceptions compared to CON."
