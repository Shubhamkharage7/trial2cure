            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates a golf recreational exercise program for enhancing survivorship in underrepresented prostate cancer survivors. Golf is a multimodal recreational activity that requires participants to utilize all muscle groups to perform the golf swing, walk over hilly and uneven terrain, maintain balance during putting and squat-like tasks. Physical activity and exercise are beneficial to physical function, cognitive function, psychosocial health, and overall quality of life during prostate cancer survivorship. These aspects of health are impacted by prostate cancer treatment, especially androgen deprivation therapy. Additionally, supervised, group-based activity programs facilitate participation in physical activity. Researchers want to examine the changes in functional abilities, psychosocial health, and quality of life following participation in in a golf program designed for prostate cancer survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To recruit, screen, and enroll prostate cancer survivors. II. To examine the safety, feasibility, and adherence, of the 10-week (wk) GREENS program.\n\nIII. To analyze the pre-post intervention data and examine the effects (assessed by Hedges g) of the program on:\n\nIIIa. Physical capacity; IIIb. Psychosocial wellness; IIIc. Health, and; IIId. Cognition.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients participate in the golf training program composed of group sessions over 1-2 hours with a Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA) professional two times per week for ten weeks. Training consists of complimentary/warm up exercises integrated with pelvic floor muscle training, golf instruction, golf practice, and golf play on a Par 3 public golf course. Patients also wear an activity tracker and undergo blood sample collection on the study.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 6 months."

These assessments will provide information unique to prostate cancer survivors and be used directly to improve the protocol and intervention design for future studies in this population. The facilitators and barriers will also be compared to established ones reported by Sattar et al. to qualitatively assess whether they are similar with our diverse cohort of minority participants located in Los Angeles, California.",
