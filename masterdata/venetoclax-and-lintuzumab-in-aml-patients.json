            "detailedDescription": "The study is a multicenter, open label Phase I and Phase II trial combining lintuzumab-Ac225 with venetoclax in patients who have relapsed or refractory AML.\n\nThe Phase I portion is a dose-finding study which will enroll at least three patients at each dose level. Patients in a dose level will be observed for a minimum of 4 weeks before dose escalation occurs. There is no dose escalation for any individual patient.\n\nThe Phase II portion of the study will enroll patients at the MTD dose level of lintuzumab-Ac225 as determined in the Phase I portion of the study. The goal of the Phase II portion will be to further characterize the safety and efficacy of the MTD dose of lintuzumab-Ac225."
