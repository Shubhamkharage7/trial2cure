After obtaining consent, the patient will have pre-vaccine baseline Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) anti-gE antibody testing performed by the Weinberg lab and then will be given first dose of vaccine. Participants will be brought back 30-60 days post-vaccine for follow up testing and second dose of vaccine. Participants will then be brought in for follow-up testing at 1-2 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months after receiving 2nd dose of vaccine. Testing for both antibody and cellular immunity to VZV will be performed throughout the study. Telephone, electronic and in-person follow up will be conducted to assess for any clinical signs of VZV reactivation, any vaccine-related side effects or any signs of acute rejection."
