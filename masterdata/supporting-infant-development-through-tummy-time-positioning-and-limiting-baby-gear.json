            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to examine the impact of an educational intervention on infant motor skill development. The main question it aims to answer is: Question 1) Does exposure to an educational intervention on infant development positively impact infant motor skill development? Researchers will compare the intervention group to the treatment as usual group see if there are differences in infant motor skill development.\n\nThe purpose of the proposed study is to determine if tummy time, play positions, screen time, and use of baby gear impacts early motor skill development in children. This is a Pilot study. A Pilot study is a small study that is carried out to collect information that will help in the planning of a larger study with the same topic.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the impact of an educational intervention on infant motor skill development. A variety of factors influence infant development, including the home environment, maternal education, child rearing practices, caregiver handling, sleep position, baby gear use, and positioning during play. In recent years there have been changes in how babies are positioned when awake. For example, after the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supine sleep recommendation in 1992, some parents reported not placing their infants on the stomach for play (tummy time) while awake due to a fear of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Research suggests that babies who are not exposed to enough tummy time are at risk for delays in the development of their motor skills.\n\nDevices for infant positioning such as swings, bouncy seats, and carriers have also grown in popularity in recent years. More time in containers limits infant mobility and opportunities for exploration and less time in other positions for play. Many parents are not aware that varying how they handle and position their babies can positively influence development, while others have misconceptions about positioning and baby gear use.\n\nAdditional research is needed that examines the impact of avoiding screen time, limiting the use of baby gear, regularly implementing tummy time, and varying an infant's position during play. It is also important that parents are aware of the need to initiate tummy time in the first days of life to increase infant tolerance of the position. The following items will constitute as 'baby gear' and will be utilized to determine if their use impacts early motor skill development in children: infant carrier, swing, bouncy seat, or a stationary activity center. The purpose of the proposed study is to determine if an educational intervention on tummy time, play positions, screen time, and use of baby gear impacts early motor skill development in children."
