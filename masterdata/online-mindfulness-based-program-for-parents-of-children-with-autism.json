            "briefSummary": "The goal of the project is to investigate the effects of online 8-week MBSR intervention on diverse parents to support their children with ASD. The investigators will conduct a randomized waitlist-controlled trial with a sample size 22 parents. This study utilizes psychological, behavioral and psychophysiological measures with parents of children with ASD ages 6-12. The first aim is to determine if parents of children with autism from diverse populations are willing participate in and complete an online MBSR program and if online delivery is as effective as in-person program. The battery of parental-report psychological assessments to measure resilience, parental sleep and stress as well as children's behaviors will be administered before and after the treatment. The second aim is to investigate the effects of a virtual MBSR intervention on cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous activity measured by continuous EDA and EKG. Participants will participate in a validated laboratory stress protocol consisting of mental arithmetic and speech tasks before and after the MBSR intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "After the participants eligibility are confirmed, their signatures will be obtained on the consent form. Three data collection phases are included in this protocol: baseline, post 3 months and post 6 months. All tests are identical in which phase. Each test includes a survey packet and the lab experiment. The surveys packet includes: the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, Parenting Stress Index - 4th edition Short Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Adult Sensory Processing Scale, Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, and WHO Quality of Life-BREF. For the lab experiment, EKG and EDA data will be collected through lab protocol, which include a 5-min baseline recording followed by Trier Social Stress Test (speaking, math test) and then another 5-min rest period. After that, a pre-recorded 15-min mindfulness practice will be played for the participants to practice. After completing the baseline test, participants will be randomly grouped into the MBSR group or the waitlist controlled group. The online MBSR program is a 8-week group-based, intervention, which will be delivered by a UMASS trained MBSR instructor."
