            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to test an intervention to prevent high blood pressure among rural, Black adults living in Alabama. Black adults in this region have one of the highest rates of high blood pressure in the US. Eating fruits and vegetables and exercising daily lowers the chance of getting high blood pressure. Many problems get in the way of eating a healthy diet and exercising like a lack of grocery stores with fresh foods, few gyms, little money, lack of transportation, and limited support for keeping healthy habits. One place where many Black adults in rural Alabama meet weekly and feel supported is their church. The investigators will connect with 30 churches in rural Alabama. The investigators plan to hold health fairs to find 12 Black adults from each church with blood pressure that is higher than normal but not high enough to need blood pressure lowering medications. The investigators will randomly select 15 churches to get group health education and tablets to access online cooking shows and exercise classes. Adults in the other 15 churches will get support from a health coach over the telephone to help set and meet diet and physical activity goals as well as the group health education and tablets to access online cooking shows and exercise classes. In this study, the investigators will ask church members to sign up to be a health coach. These 15 churches will also get money to help bring healthy foods and/or physical activity opportunities to their communities. The investigative team will train 2 to 3 of their church members to learn how to coach others to eat more healthy food and be more physically active. This study answers two questions. 1) Will this intervention designed to reduce barriers to a healthy lifestyle lower blood pressure among rural, Black adults? 2) Can churches and participants complete the whole two-year study, and can the intervention be used in other communities in a cost-effective way to improve blood pressure? This project will add to the health equity mission of the American Heart Association by finding out if an intervention using health coaches lowers blood pressure among rural Black adults."
