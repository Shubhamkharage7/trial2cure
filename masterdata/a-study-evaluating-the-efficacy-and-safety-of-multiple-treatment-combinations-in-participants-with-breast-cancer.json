            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study in participants with breast cancer. Cohort 1 will focus on participants with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who had disease progression during or following treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i; e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) in the first- or second-line setting. Cohort 2 will focus on inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, ER-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer with previous progression to standard-of-care anti-HER2 therapies, of which one was a trastuzumab-and-taxane-based systemic therapy (including in the early setting if recurrence occurred within 6 months of finishing adjuvant therapy) and one was a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab-deruxtecan) or a HER2-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; e.g., tucatinib, lapatinib, pyrotinib or neratinib). The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, or modify the patient population. During Stage 1, participants in each cohort will be randomly assigned to treatment arms. Participants in the control or experimental arms who experience unacceptable toxicity, disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator during Stage 1 will be given the option of receiving a different treatment combination during Stage 2, provided they meet eligibility criteria and a treatment arm is open for enrollment. No Stage 2 treatment is currently available."
