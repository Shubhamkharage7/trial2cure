Additionally, to better understand predictors of response to ART, and cognitive processes that occur among grieving individuals following ART.",
            "detailedDescription": "Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) is an evidence-based treatment for post-traumatic distress in civilians and veterans that may be useful in alleviating maladaptive grief prior to bereavement and could prevent prolonged grief disorder following bereavement. Researchers are proposing to test the efficacy of ART, a low-risk, brief therapy with a strong theoretical rationale for treatment success in maladaptive grief and supported by the promising results of a recently completed preliminary trial. Additional aims of the study are to examine changes in cognitive appraisal and integration of loss following ART using a mixed methods approach and to evaluate personal, social, and psychological factors predictors of response.\n\nDuring the proposed double blinded, randomized, controlled two arm clinical trial, older adult family caregivers will receive either ART or an educational program that is matched for time and attention. Each participant will receive four sessions of either the ART intervention or the control intervention. Data collection will occur at screening/enrollment (T1), at the end of the 4-session intervention period (T2) and at 6-months (T3) and 13-months post bereavement (T4). A subgroup of 20 participants randomly assigned to ART will participate in semi-structured interviews to enhance understanding of cognitive appraisal and integration of loss.\n\nThis trial will provide critical information on the efficacy of the ART intervention as a potential first-line treatment option for pre-loss grief and preventative option for prolonged grief disorder, and contribute new information about characteristics of individuals most likely to benefit from ART."
