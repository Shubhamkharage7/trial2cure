Those who are consented will be randomized into one of three groups. One group will receive islet transplantation alone, a placebo. The other two groups will receive islets plus autologous bone marrow-MSCs at two different doses (20x10\\^6/patient, or 50x10\\^6/patient). The TP-IAT procedure will remain as routinely performed. Patients will be followed for12 months post-transplantation, having 3 follow-up visits scheduled on days 90, 180, and 365 after the transplant. The primary endpoint will be a change in islet function from baseline to 12 months post-transplantation as measured by the C-peptide area under the curve following a mixed meal tolerance test. Potential effects of MSCs on glycemic control, pain relief, quality of life, and adverse events will be evaluated at each follow-up visit."
