            "briefSummary": "Diabetes prevalence is increasing among people living with HIV (PLWH), yet blood glucose control is less successful in this population who are also often food insecure. Food assistance programs often provide nutrient-poor foods. This proposal asses the feasibility of monitoring diabetes-related health outcomes among food insecure PLWH who are receiving food boxes higher in dietary protein and fiber and lower in simple carbohydrates.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this investigation is to develop and assess a study protocol to evaluate the impact of food assistance on diabetes-related health outcomes in food insecure people living with HIV (PLWH). Compared to the general population, PLWH have increased risk for type 2 diabetes and worse glycemic control when using similar pharmaceutical treatments. Interventions to improve diet quality could thus have a clinically meaningful impact on diabetes treatment in this population. However, many PLWH are food insecure and rely on food assistance to meet basic nutrition needs. This proposal will determine the feasibility of a protocol to evaluate diabetes-related health outcomes in food insecure PLWH and diabetes who receive high protein, high dietary fiber food boxes from Birmingham AIDS Outreach. The study will consist of retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data and stored specimens, and prospective cross-sectional analysis of food security and diet quality in PLWH who do versus those who do not receive the food boxes.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, and collecting dietary intake data from people living with HIV who are food insecure.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To compare changes over twelve months in glycemic control, food security, and diet quality in B-FED participants compared to non-participating 1917 clinic patients.\n\nThis proposal aligns with the UAB Diabetes Research Center's goal to facilitate development of new methods to treat diabetes and its complications. The investigators will determine the effect size for scale-up of larger, longer-term assessment through an NIDDK-R18 grant to evaluate the real-world impact of B-FED on glycemic control and food security."
