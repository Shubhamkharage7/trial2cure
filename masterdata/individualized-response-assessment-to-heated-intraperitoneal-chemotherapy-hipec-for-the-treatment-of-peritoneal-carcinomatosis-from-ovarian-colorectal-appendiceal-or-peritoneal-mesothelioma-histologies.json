            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nCytoreductive surgery (CRS) removes tumors in the abdomen. HIPEC is heated chemotherapy that washes the abdomen. CRS and HIPEC may help people with peritoneal carcinomatosis. These are tumors that have spread to the lining of the abdomen from other cancers. Researchers think they can improve results of CRS and HIPEC by choosing the chemotherapy drugs used in HIPEC.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if HIPEC after CRS can be improved, by testing different chemotherapy drugs, using a model called the SMART (Sample Microenvironment of Resected Metastatic Tumor) System.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older who have peritoneal carcinomatosis that cannot be fully removed safely with surgery.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nComputed tomography (CAT) scan\n\nOther imaging scans, as needed\n\nElectrocardiogram (EKG)\n\nTumor biopsy, if needed\n\nLaparoscopy. Small cuts will be made in the abdomen. A tube with a light and a camera will be used to see their organs.\n\nSome screening tests will be repeated in the study.\n\nParticipants will enroll in NIH protocol #13C0176. This allows their tumor samples to be used in future research.\n\nParticipants will have CRS. As many of their visible tumors will be removed as possible. They will also have HIPEC. Two thin tubes will be put in their abdomen. They will get chemotherapy through one tube. It will be drained out through the other tube. They will be in the hospital for 7-21 days after surgery.\n\nParticipants will give tumor, blood, and fluid samples for research. They will complete surveys about their health and quality of life.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up visits over 5 years....",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nPeritoneal carcinomatosis is uniformly fatal if untreated; improved outcomes are seen with aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).\n\nThe selection of chemotherapeutic agent for HIPEC is largely based on primary tumor histology and provider preference as opposed to knowledge of the potential efficacy of a specific agent for an individual patient.\n\nHIPEC is intended to target small or microscopic residual disease following complete cytoreduction; however, the actual efficacy and additional benefit of HIPEC is in question.\n\nThe SMART System provides an ideal platform upon which to perfuse small peritoneal tumor tissue implants and simulate HIPEC treatment ex vivo.\n\nTissue response to simulated ex vivo HIPEC treatment in the SMART System could inform chemotherapeutic agent selection for subsequent cytoreduction and intra-operative in vivo HIPEC treatments.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo determine the correlation between ex vivo simulated HIPEC in the SMART System and in vivo HIPEC with respect to two measures of response to treatment: percent necrosis and Ki-67\n\nEligibility:\n\nHistologically confirmed peritoneal carcinomatosis from appendiceal, colorectal, ovarian, or peritoneal mesothelioma histologies\n\nAbsence of extra-abdominal metastatic disease\n\nParticipant deemed able to undergo complete cytoreduction\n\nAge \\>= 18 years of age\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is a Phase I study of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), with randomization to one of two accepted HIPEC treatment regimens as determined by primary histology.\n\nAt the time of cytoreduction, representative peritoneal tumor biopsies will be obtained before and after intra-operative in vivo HIPEC treatment.\n\nTumor nodules harvested before intra-operative HIPEC will be placed in the SMART System, exposed to simulated ex vivo HIPEC treatment, and then perfused, with subsequent assessment of percent necrosis and Ki-67.\n\nTumor nodules harvested immediately after intra-operative HIPEC will be placed in the SMART System and perfused, with subsequent assessment of percent necrosis and Ki-67.\n\nThe correlation of percent necrosis and Ki-67 assessment following simulated ex vivo HIPEC and intra-operative in vivo HIPEC will be determined."
