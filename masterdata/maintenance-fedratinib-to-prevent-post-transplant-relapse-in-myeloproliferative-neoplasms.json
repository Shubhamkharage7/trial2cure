Either commit to true abstinence\\* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use and be able to comply with highly effective contraception\\*\\* without interruption, -14 days prior to starting investigational product, during the study treatment (including dose interruptions), and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment.\n\nNote: A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\n\n* Male participants must:\n\nPractice true abstinence\\* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 30 days following investigational product discontinuation, or longer if required for each compound and/or by local regulations, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.\n\n\\* True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

However, if a patient is started on a strong CYP3A4 inducer while on fedratinib, the dose must be adjusted as described in the drug-drug interaction section below.\n* Thiamine levels below the normal range, per institutional standard, may enroll but must be corrected to the normal range before initiating treatment with fedratinib (See section 6.5.1). Normalized thiamine level must be confirmed within 10 days of starting fedratinib therapy.\n* On any chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drug therapy (e.g., thalidomide, interferon-alpha), Anagrelide, or concurrent JAK2 inhibitor.
