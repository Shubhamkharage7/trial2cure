The system will be evaluated along with the tests' usability on samples of healthy controls and neurologically impaired patient participants. These new tests will be assessed with regard to reliability and validity. Reliability will be addressed through investigation of internal consistency of the test items. Validity will be evaluated relative to traditional paper-and-pencil tests and differentiation between patient and healthy participants.Each participant will complete both the computerized and paper and pencil-based tests. The results will be analyzed to see how performances on the two test types compare. The overall aim of this project is to determine if these new computerized tasks are an improvement over standard paper and pencil-based neuropsychological measures."
