            "briefSummary": "The investigator's long-term goal is to mitigate pregnancy-related mortality (PRM) risk by systematically delivering integrated clinical and supportive care that is effective, equitable, and scalable. The investigator's central hypothesis is that the Multi-modal Maternal Infant Perinatal Outpatient Delivery System (MOMI PODS) will mitigate postpartum (PP) risk and reduce disparities in PP risk by improving biopsychosocial profiles and facilitating access to evidence-based clinical and supportive care. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a hybrid type 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MOMI PODS versus enhanced usual care (EUC, which we will term MOMI CARE) among a total sample of 384 mother-infant dyads (192/group) following pregnancy affected by a cardiometabolic and/or mental health condition. The investigators will enroll participants on PP day 1 and collect data at baseline and 6 months and 1 year PP. The investigators will collect implementation and service data across sites.",
            "detailedDescription": "Using this data, the investigators will address the following Specific Aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of MOMI PODS versus EUC in mitigating cardiometabolic and mental health risk across the PP year. Hypotheses: MOMI PODS (vs. EUC) recipients will show better cardiometabolic and mental health (Primary Outcomes: higher Life's Essential 8 scores, fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms, Secondary Outcomes: fewer emergency visits and hospital readmissions).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To identify the biopsychosocial mechanisms through which MOMI PODS affects PP cardiometabolic and mental health at the individual patient level. Hypotheses: MOMI PODS (vs. EUC) recipients will report better patient-provider relationships and less psychosocial stress and show better stress-responsive endocrine and immune profiles, which will be critical drivers of cardiometabolic and mental health.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To determine if MOMI PODS reduces socioeconomic (SES), racial, and ethnic disparities in evidence-based PP care delivery and identify strategies to improve implementation and service outcomes. Hypotheses: MOMI PODS (vs. EUC) recipients will receive clinical and supportive care that is more adherent to evidence-based guidelines, which will reduce SES, racial, and ethnic disparities in evidence-based care. Objective: Identify strategies to improve implementation and service outcomes by evaluating fidelity, timeliness, and equity of clinical and supportive care across MOMI PODS sites."

We expect remnant biospecimens to be minimal after study execution and will therefore not submit biospecimens. Also of note, obstetric complications, postnatal complications, severe maternal morbidity (SMM), and pregnancy-related mortality (PRM) are rare occurrences. Details surrounding this information are publicly available in birth and death certificates and could be aligned with other information to identify a research participant. Thus, to protect participant privacy, we do not plan to share raw data but will produce collapsed variables for data sharing.",
