            "briefSummary": "This is an observational - data and specimen collection study. There have been increasing reports of vaping-induced lung injury, including severe lung injury and rare cases of death. The mechanism by which vaping contributes to lung injury in susceptible persons is unknown, as is impact on chronic lung disease. The investigators aim to identify individuals with chronic electronic nicotine delivery device (ENDD) exposure and matched controls within our ongoing cohort of HIV+ and HIV-uninfected individuals, collect PFT data, bank respiratory and stool samples and collect clinical data for studies of clinical risk, inflammation, biomarkers, and the microbiome in the identification and modification of risk of progression to lung injury or chronic pulmonary disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be consented and undergo collection of data and specimens as listed below.\n\n* Vaping use will be determined by history.\n* No administration, dispensing or use of any vape product will take place as part of the study.\n\nExperimental procedures:\n\nRespiratory questionnaires and data review:\n\nDetailed data regarding smoking history, illicit drug use, ART and other medications, and medical history are obtained using standardized questionnaires and medical record review. The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea scale (MMRC), the St. George's Questionnaire(SGQT), Pulmonary questionnaire (PQ) and a Vaping questionnaire will be administered. These are paper and pencil questionnaires that inquire about respiratory symptoms, quality of life, and other lung related issues. Laboratory data including CD4 cell counts and HIV viral levels are obtained from the medical record.\n\nBlood Sample collection:\n\nThe subject will be asked to provide a blood sample by venipuncture of approximately 110mls (7.4 tablespoon) at this study visit. The purpose of this collection is to have blood processed for serum, plasma, and PBMCS, and a portion stored for RNA to be used for future use. A hemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin will be done in order to calculate the DLCO. A CBC will be done to determine overall health and possible infections.\n\nSaliva Collection: Participants will be asked to produce saliva and spit it into a sterile conical.\n\nStool collection: The investigator will ask participants to provide a stool sample. The subject will be instructed on how to collect a stool specimen at home. The investigator will give the subject instructions and a kit that will provide all the supplies needed to collect the stool and return it via mail at their convenience.\n\nLung function testing (PFT):\n\nIf a PFT was completed for a research study in the past month, that data will be used instead of repeating the test. The routine lung function endpoints of FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75% will be measured with the flow-volume loop recorder on a NDD Easy One Pro testing system before and after bronchodilator administration. The system is calibrated for body temperature and pressure of saturated gas and volumes, per American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards . DLco will be measured using the automated single-breath procedure of the integrated testing system, which conforms with ATS standards. All testing will be reviewed by a physician associated with this study. If any concerns or abnormal results are discovered during this testing, a member of the research team will notify the subject or the subject's primary care physician, who will assess the need to provide additional evaluation.\n\nPregnancy Test: A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all women of child bearing potential. Men, and women who are post menopausal for at least 1 year or have been surgically made sterile will not have a pregnancy test.\n\nCollection of the vape product used by the subject. Declining participation in this collection does not mean the subject can't participate in the study.\n\nThe product will be sent to the investigators research labs for potential chemical analysis."
