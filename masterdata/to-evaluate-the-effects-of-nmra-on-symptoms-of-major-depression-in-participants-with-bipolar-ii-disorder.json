The scale will be completed by the participant and reviewed by site personnel qualified to oversee completeness. Each of the 14 items has a set of 4 responses, 2 of which endorse agreement (Definitely Agree, Agree) and 2 of which endorse disagreement (Disagree, Strongly Disagree). A total score can be derived by summing the response items; where those answered with \"strongly agree\" will be coded as a 1, while a \"strongly disagree\" response will be coded as 4. Therefore, scores on the SHAPS can range from 14 to 56, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of anhedonia.",
