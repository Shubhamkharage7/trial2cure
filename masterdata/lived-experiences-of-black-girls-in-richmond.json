Research or reports about the state of the girls are growing more common across the country in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Most of these studies generate deficit narratives focusing on these groups' problems, needs, and deficiencies. Fewer studies focus solely on the experience of Black girls specifically. This study proposes a new approach and explores the quality of life of Black girls using an asset-based approach that thinks differently about the subject of these studies and how to address their needs appropriately."
