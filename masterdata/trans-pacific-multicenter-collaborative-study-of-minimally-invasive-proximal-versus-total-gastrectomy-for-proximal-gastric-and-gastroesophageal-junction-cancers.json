We hypothesize that MIPG is associated with better postoperative appetite levels compared to MITG, which would result in improved nutritional status and maintained body weight after surgery.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* Assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and nutrition measures. We will use the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Gastrointestinal Cancer Module (MDASI-GI) questionnaire with additional three experimental question items (\"PRO questionnaire\") to collect preoperative and postoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of QoL and check fasting ghrelin levels to correlate them with reported appetite levels. We will also retrospectively investigate factors associated with improved QoL after surgery, safety of MIPG and MITG, and oncological outcomes after MIPG and MITG."
