Each Veteran participant will be randomized to receive three different concentrations, which will be injected one week apart each.",
            "detailedDescription": "Military Servicemembers are at elevated risk for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its consequences, including post-traumatic headache (PTH). The most common phenotype of PTH is migraine, for which there are numerous potential treatments, though these have limitations, including poor efficacy, drug-drug interactions, and intolerable side effects. Therefore, the consideration of other methods to manage PTH in Servicemembers and Veterans is warranted.\n\nAnesthetic greater occipital nerve (GON) blockade is a simple, inexpensive, and safe procedure that has demonstrable headache pain suppressing effects in a variety of headache disorders. This intervention is frequently done to provide immediate relief, followed by a period of reduced headache burden.\n\nThe acute burning that occurs during injection and then the numbing over the scalp that occurs shortly after anesthetic GON blockade make controlled investigations against placebo difficult to interpret. In sub-study 1 of this project, different concentrations of bupivacaine (0.0%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%) will be examined in order to identify a suitable control dose to later compare to the full dose of 0.5%. Acute and subacute sensations from bupivacaine GON blockade will be measured and the lowest concentration that resembles the sensations elicited by full dose (0.5%) will be used in a subsequent efficacy trial (sub-study 2)."
