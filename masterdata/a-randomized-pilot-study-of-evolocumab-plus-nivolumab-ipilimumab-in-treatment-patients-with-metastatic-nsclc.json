Evolucumab is being combined with nivolumab and ipilimumab to see if it will improve the anti-tumor capabilities of the immunotherapy. Adding evolocumab to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has not been tested in people before and is considered investigational."

Eligible if metastases have been locally treated 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1, are clinically controlled, and asymptomatic off high dose steroids on cycle 1 day 1(\\< 2 mg decadron or 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent allowed). Untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases allowed if subject does not require corticosteroids or anticonvulsant therapy.\n\n  10) Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n\n  11) Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures. 12) Active infection requiring antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral agents, that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy.\n\n  13) Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n\n  14) Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) 15) Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency etc) is not considered a form of system treatment. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis \\[scleroderma\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis \\[eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis\\]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis).\n\n  16) Subjects with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity 17) Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n\n  18) Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n\n  19) Major surgery (other than definitive lung cancer surgery) within two weeks of study or other serious concomitant disorders that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safety of the patient of compromise the patient's ability to complete the study.\n\n  20) Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to 30 days before or after any dose of nivolumab). Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. COVID19 vaccines will be allowed on protocol.\n\n  21) Myocardial infarction having occurred less than 6 months before inclusion, any known uncontrolled arrhythmia, symptomatic angina pectoris, active ischemia, or cardiac failure not controlled by medications. Patients with CAD recently treated with surgery and/or stent, if stable without symptomatic angina pectoris, active ischemia are eligible.\n\n  22) Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n\n  23) Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness.\n\n  24) Patient takes daily prednisone \\> 10 mg or the equivalent dose of a different steroid.",
