            "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of a breast ultrasound method for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as breast ultrasound, may help find and diagnose breast cancer, and may help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment. The purpose of this research is to test the effectiveness of a new investigational breast ultrasound method to detect an abnormality in the breast, and assess response to breast cancer treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the diagnostic performance of the proposed method in a population of pre-biopsy patients with suspicious breast masses and correlate the proposed method results with pathology as the gold standard.\n\nII. Assess and predict the response to preoperative chemotherapy in breast cancer patients using the proposed method and compare the results to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as control and surgical pathology for pathological complete response (PcR).\n\nIII. Determine the diagnostic performance of the proposed method in identifying metastatic axillary lymph node in patients with suspected or known breast cancer lesions; correlate the results with pathology as the gold standard.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nAIM 1: Participants undergo a breast ultrasound over 15 minutes.\n\nAIM 2: Participants undergo breast ultrasounds over 15 minutes before starting the chemotherapy, 2 months after start of chemotherapy, and after the completion of chemotherapy before surgery. Participants may also undergo breast ultrasounds at 2 weeks after start of chemotherapy and 1 month after start of chemotherapy.\n\nAIM 3: Patients with suspicious breast masses or known breast cancer who are scheduled for axillary lymph node biopsy undergo ultrasound over 15 minutes at the same visit of the breast mass study."
