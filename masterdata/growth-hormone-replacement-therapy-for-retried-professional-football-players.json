            "detailedDescription": "GHD is the most common anterior pituitary abnormality after traumatic brain injury (TBI). It can occur as a result of either direct pituitary or indirect hypothalamic injury. Sports-related repetitive head trauma might induce pituitary dysfunction, and in particular, isolated GHD. Growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) has long been known to have a beneficial effect on body composition and exercise capacity. However, it has recently been shown that GHRT also benefits the brain. The primary objective of the current study is to assess the effect of GH on memory, executive function and attention domains of cognitive function in GHD- professional football players with TBI. The study will also utilize the adult growth hormone deficiency assessment (AGHDA) questionnaire, quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, respectively, to measure the quality of life (QoL), electrical activity and structural changes in the brain that may correspond to cognitive deficits."
