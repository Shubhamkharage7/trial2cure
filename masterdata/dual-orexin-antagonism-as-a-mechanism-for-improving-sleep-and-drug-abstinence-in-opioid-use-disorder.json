This project is designed to test neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying effects of the dual orexin-1/2 receptor antagonist suvorexant on sleep efficiency and opioid abstinence, and whether these outcomes are independent of one another. This will be the first study to investigate whether suvorexant improves outpatient opioid abstinence and sleep efficiency; and whether improving sleep mediates the improved opioid abstinence outcome. 120 participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) will complete this intent-to-treat study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design. Using a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial design, we will prospectively evaluate whether nightly treatment with the orexin-1/2 receptor antagonist suvorexant (20 mg/day PO), relative to placebo, can increase outpatient opioid abstinence and improve sleep efficiency (sleep time per time-in-bed) as a mediator/moderator among patients with OUD. We include current medication for treating OUD, as well as treatment site, as stratification factors in the group allocation. Using power and sample size calculations, we estimate that 120 participants will suffice to test our hypotheses.\n\nThe study aims to test three co-primary hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 1: Relative to placebo, suvorexant (20 mg/day) will significantly increase percentage opioid abstinence during outpatient weeks 1-13.\n\nHypothesis 2: Relative to placebo, suvorexant will improve sleep efficiency.\n\nHypothesis 3: Higher inpatient sleep efficiency will be associated with increased outpatient opioid abstinence (independent of experimental group assignment)."
