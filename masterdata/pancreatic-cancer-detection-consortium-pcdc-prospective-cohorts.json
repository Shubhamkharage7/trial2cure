To develop a cohort (biobank of biospecimens and data) of subjects without pancreatic cancer who are at highrisk for pancreatic cancer due to: a strong family history, a mutation in a known pancreatic cancer predisposition gene, or fukuoka worrisome or high-risk pancreatic cysts.\n\nII. To follow the cohort subjects longitudinally and collect biospecimens and follow-up data and record medical outcomes.\n\nIII. To make biospecimen available to PCDC-approved projects to validate potential biomarkers for performance using nested case-control prospective designs.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nParticipants undergo blood sample collection, complete questionnaires, have their medical records reviewed and undergo pancreatic cyst fluid collection during standard of care endoscopic ultrasounds fine needle aspiration."
