            "briefSummary": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), often referred to as Lou Gehrig's Disease, is a progressive, terminal condition of muscle weakness that is associated with degeneration of neurons in the spinal cord and brain. This devastating disorder afflicts people in the prime of their lives. At the present time, there are no cures for this disorder, and current treatments are marginal at best. Despite years of intensive research, a fundamental understanding of this disease is still lacking. There is a need to identify both reliable markers of disease progression and effective treatments. The goal of this research is to bring a greater understanding of ALS patients closer to the research studies that can lead to new hypotheses and approaches.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients will be approached during in-person or phone/online appointments and asked their consent to enter information and results from their physical examinations, electrodiagnostic testing, and other testing done as a standard of care and into a database to monitor disease progression and use them for research purposes. Also, the patients will be asked for consent to undergo a MRI scan.\n\nIn a second informed consent form, patients will be enrolled to perform a rapid postmortem autopsy and have the tissue banked for research purposes. It is important to keep the consents separate because some patients may not consent to this postmortem study, but would consent to the premortem studies.\n\nThe information gained from the premortem studies will be used during the postmortem examination to select tissue for further processing. Tissue from different regions, including brain, spinal cord, nerve and muscle will be processed in parallel for cellular and molecular analyses that include histology, immunostaining, in situ hybridization, protein, RNA, and small molecule analyses."

These will be compared to histologic and genomic changes in rapid postmortem tissues in the same areas. High resolution T1-weighted imaging is preferred for anatomical structure morphometry. The hypothesis is that spinal cord cross-sectional area decreases over time may be a sensitive MRI parameter to detect progression and respiratory distress. The aim is to develop a highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive measure of ALS progression in the spinal cord using a multi-parametric measurement scheme. Image sequences will be attained and a combinatorial statistical analysis performed to find the best biomarker of progression that could differ regardless of upper motor neuron involvement.",
