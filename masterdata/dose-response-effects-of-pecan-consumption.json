            "briefSummary": "The bioactive compounds contained in tree nuts have been shown to beneficially affect cardiometabolic health outcomes. Pecans contain more total phenols, sterols, and flavonoids than any other tree nut. They also are a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), fiber, vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc. These bioactive components in pecans are likely the reason for the previously documented improvements in cardiometabolic health.\n\nThe specific aims of this study are to:\n\n* Examine the effect of pecan consumption at doses of 6%, 13%, and 20% of total energy needs on fasting and postprandial blood lipids.\n* Examine the effect of pecan consumption at doses of 6%, 13%, and 20% of total energy needs on plasma markers associated with overall health.\n* Examine the effect of pecan consumption at doses of 6%, 13%, and 20% of total energy needs on subjective and physiologic postprandial measures of hunger and satiety.\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* Consume pecans daily for 28 days or maintain their current habitual diet.\n* Attend three short weekly visits for fasting blood craws, body measurements, and collect their next week's supply of study materials.\n* Attend two longer (5 h) testing visits which include consuming a standard breakfast meal and having their blood drawn periodically before and after breakfast.\n\nResearchers will compare pecan LOW, pecan MID, pecan HIGH, and the Control group to examine the physiologic effects of incorporating various dosages of pecans into one's diet.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cardiovascular disease risk factors, including higher BMIs and poor cholesterol profiles, are on the rise and contribute to the United States' growing disease burden. Research investigating the relationship between pecan nut consumption and cardiometabolic outcomes has shown that pecan nut consumption can significantly benefit fasting and postprandial blood lipids, reduce CVD risk factors, promote weight maintenance, improve subjective and psychological markers of physiological appetite, increase total antioxidant capacity, and increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the current literature on pecan consumption and health outcomes only encompasses physiological benefits coming from a dosage of \\~45g/day and above, which is above the current dietary guidelines. This study will be the first dose-response study examining the minimalist effective dose and determining the most effective dosage of pecan consumption on metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes. If lower doses of pecans in the diet are found to improve fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism and markers of chronic disease risk, these study findings could lead to improvements in health.\n\nThis prospective clinical study is a single-blinded, randomized control trial in adults at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (poor cholesterol profiles or overweight/obesity). There are four diet interventions: pecan LOW (6% energy from pecans), pecan MID (13% energy from pecans), pecan HIGH (20% energy from pecans), and CON (instructed to maintain their current habitual diet and abstain from any tree nut/peanut consumption for the duration of the intervention). This study protocol consists of a 28-day diet intervention that will involve substituting pecans for commonly consumed snack or meal items every day for the entire 28-day intervention or maintaining a current/usual diet.\n\nThere are a total of six testing visits: a screening visit (V0), a pre-intervention visit (V1), short weekly visits (end of weeks 1, 2, and 3; V2-V4), and a post-intervention visit (V5).\n\nAt screening (V0), qualification is confirmed based on anthropometrics and fasting blood draw, which is analyzed for a cholesterol panel and blood glucose. Additionally, energy requirements are estimated at this visit for use in the diet intervention.\n\nAt V1, participants will have anthropometrics measured, including body composition, by DEXA. Next, a certified phlebotomist places an IV catheter and takes the fasting blood sample. Then the participant consumes a high-saturated-fat meal challenge, delivering 17% of their estimated energy needs (from V0). Then the participant has blood drawn 7 times using the IV catheter over the next 4 hours.\n\nThe 28-day diet intervention will consist of research personnel providing pecans that deliver 6%, 13%, or 20% of the participant's daily energy needs (determined at V0). Participants placed in one of the three pecan diets will receive counseling at the baseline (V1) and weekly intervention visits (V2-V4) on substituting pecans for isocaloric foods from their habitual diet. Individuals randomized in the control group will be instructed to follow their habitual diet and will not be provided with any food items.\n\nParticipants return weekly (V2, V3, V4) to return study materials and collect food for the next week (if applicable). At these weekly visits, participants also have a fasting blood draw, and researchers will collect the participant's body measurements.\n\nAt the end of the 28-day dietary intervention, participants return for V5, where all procedures from V1 are repeated.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that diets including the daily consumption of pecans will benefit health outcomes and lower cardiometabolic risk factors."
