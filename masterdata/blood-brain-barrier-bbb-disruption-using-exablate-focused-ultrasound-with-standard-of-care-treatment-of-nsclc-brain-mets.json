            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, two-arm, controlled, pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted blood brain barrier disruption using Exablate Model 4000 Type 2 for the treatment of NSCLC brain metastases in subjects who are undergoing planned pembrolizumab monotherapy for their primary disease. The study will be conducted at up to 20 centers in the US. The immunotherapy regimen (every 3 weeks for 6 cycles) of pembrolizumab is per the FDA approved labeling for pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae) and the subjects prescribed standard of care therapy for their primary NSCLC. The study aims to demonstrate superiority of Exablate BBBD targeted to their brain metastases over the standard of care without Exablate BBBD with respect to the percentage of subjects achieving Objective Response Rate (ORR) by 6 months follow-up."
