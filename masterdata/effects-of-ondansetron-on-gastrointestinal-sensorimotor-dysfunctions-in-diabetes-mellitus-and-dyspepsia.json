If medically safe, these drugs may be discontinued for four half lives prior to study assessments.\n* Treatment with GLP-1 agonists and amlyin which cause vagal blockade and may affect central processing of pain\n* Bleeding or clotting disorders or medications that increase risk of bleeding from mucosal biopsies\n* Positive tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TTG),\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding females\n* Known intolerance or allergy to eggs\n* Poor peripheral venous access, if central venous access is not available\n* Any other condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for the study\n* History of Long QT Syndrome or prolonged QT interval (i.e., corrected QT interval \\> 480 ms)\n* Current symptoms of a functional gastrointestinal disorder assessed by questionnaire\n* Severe vomiting that would preclude tube placement or participation in the study\n* Structural cause for symptoms by endoscopy within the past 12 months\n* Patients with gastric pacemakers",
