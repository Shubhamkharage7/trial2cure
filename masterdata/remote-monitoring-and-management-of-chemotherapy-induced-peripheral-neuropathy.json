            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective randomized trial designed to investigate a new care model for patients who suffer from nerve damage from chemotherapy called chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). All participants in the study will report their CIPN symptoms daily using a website, app or phone for 12 weeks. In one group the data will be collected and participants will be encouraged to reach out to their treating doctors for uncontrolled symptoms. These participants' doctors can prescribe any treatment they feel is appropriate. In the second group, if the symptoms meet the criteria for eligibility they will receive a phone call from a nurse practitioner either the same day or next day, depending on the time symptoms were logged. That nurse practitioner will determine the correct CIPN treatment using an algorithm and prescribe it. The study will track the severity of symptoms over time as well as looking at the impact on treatments for CIPN (medications and referrals).",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective single blinded (outcome assessor) randomized controlled trial of a CIPN care model that pairs a personalized suite of remote symptom monitoring technologies with triggered real time responses from a nurse practitioner (NP) equipped to enact algorithmic guideline based CIPN treatment in response to poorly controlled symptoms. The study will enroll adult cancer patients who have, within the last 540 days, completed a course of a taxane, platinum, or vinca alkaloid-based agent, bortezomib, thalidomide, lenalidomide, ixazomib or brentuximab vedotin, or have been receiving ongoing maintenance therapy with bortezomib, thalidomide, lenalidomide or ixazomib for \\>90 days, and have been diagnosed with CIPN. Participants will log neuropathy symptoms daily for a one week run-in period using a remote symptom monitoring technology described below. Participants who meet the criteria to proceed in the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Usual Care (UC) or Symptom Care at Home with Nurse Practitioner follow up (SCH-NP). Those not meeting eligibility criteria will be excluded but can be rescreened 6 weeks later. Both groups will log symptoms daily and receive either UC or SCH-NP care for the 12 week study period.\n\nThe UC group will report daily neuropathy symptoms via the web, app or automated phone system and will receive usual care for CIPN symptoms from their existing treatment team. The SCH-NP group will report symptoms similarly but concerning symptoms will trigger a call back from a nurse practitioner who can provide treatment based on standardized algorithmic CIPN guidelines.\n\nIn person study visits will take place at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after randomization. CIPN specific QoL and disability measures, validated CIPN sign scales and detailed information on opioids, neuropathic pain medications and other CIPN treatments will be collected at each visit."
