            "detailedDescription": "Oxygen delivery is one of the primary factors in wound healing. Micro/nanobubbles (MNBs) can be used to increase the oxygen dissolved in solution and increase oxygen delivery to a wound. The purpose of this research study is to determine if MNBs applied to a wound improve wound healing.\n\nAfter being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients will need to provide written informed consent before being included in the study. The characteristics of the wound will be assessed and measurements will be taken before and after treatment. Depending on the patient's wound type, the patient will be treated with MNBs in saline gauze which will be applied to the wound daily (for acute wounds), or MNBs in negative pressure wound therapy with instillation (NPWTi) (for chronic wounds) which will be applied to the wound continuously throughout the day with the wound evaluated and sponge replaced every 3-5 days. This is consistent with the current standard of wound care with gauze or NPWTi. Tissue oxygenation using infrared technology and wound healing will be measured and results collected for analysis.\n\nParticipation will last approximately 2-4 weeks or the duration of the inpatient admission. If discharge from the hospital is earlier than 2 weeks, the treatment will be discontinued and results will be submitted for analysis."
