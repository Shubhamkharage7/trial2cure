            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well sacituzumab govitecan works in treating patients with cholangiocarcinoma that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced), that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called hRS7, linked to a toxic agent, called SN-38. HRS7 is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as TROP2 receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine anti-tumor activity by overall response rate (ORR).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine treatment safety based on toxicities participants who have received at least one dose of sacituzumab govitecan.\n\nII. To determine anti-tumor activity by progression free survival (PFS). III. To determine anti-tumor activity by disease control rate (DCR). IV. To determine overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if treatment will result in reduction of the circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a measure of therapeutic response.\n\nII. To determine relationship between tumor mutational profile (already performed as standard of care next generation sequencing \\[NGS\\] based test) to response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive sacituzumab govitecan intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and every 3 months for up to 24 months."

Patients with treated CNS metastases are permitted on study if all the following are true:\n\n  * CNS metastases have been clinically stable for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and baseline scans show no evidence of new or enlarged metastasis.\n  * If requiring steroid treatment for CNS metastases, the patient is on a stable dose \\<10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for at least 2 weeks.\n  * Patient does not have leptomeningeal disease\n* Met any of the following criteria for cardiac disease:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris within 6 months of enrollment.\n  * History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), high-grade atrioventricular block, or other cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic medications (except for atrial fibrillation that is well controlled with antiarrhythmic medication); history of QT interval prolongation.\n  * New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or greater congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction of \\< 40%\n* Prior treatment with topoisomerase 1 inhibitors\n* Have an active concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years of study enrollment. Note: patients with a history of malignancy that have been completely treated, with no evidence of active cancer for 3 years prior to enrollment, or patients with surgically cured tumors with low risk of recurrence (e.g., nonmelanoma skin cancer, histologically confirmed complete excision of carcinoma in situ, or similar such as adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma, non-melanomatous skin cancer, or curatively resected cervical cancer) are allowed to enroll\n* Have active chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) or gastrointestinal (GI) perforation within 6 months of enrollment\n* Currently receiving systemic antimicrobial treatment for active infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal) at the time of first dose of sacituzumab govitecan. Routine antimicrobial prophylaxis is permitted\n* Have known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or 2 (or positive HIV-1/2 antibody, if done at screening) with detectable viral load\n* Have active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). In patients with a history of HBV or HCV, patients with detectable viral loads will be excluded.\n\n  * Patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Patients who test positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) will require HBV DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for confirmation of active disease.\n  * Patients who test positive for HCV antibody. Patients who test positive for HCV antibody will require HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) by quantitative PCR for confirmation of active disease. Patients with a known history of HCV or a positive HCV antibody test will not require a HCV antibody at screening and will only require HCV RNA by quantitative PCR for confirmation of active disease\n* Patients with active tuberculosis based on medical history\n* Documented history of a cerebral vascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms (including congestive heart failure) consistent with NYHA Class III-IV within 6 months prior to the first dose of sacituzumab govitecan\n* Radiotherapy or major surgery within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.\n\n  * Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist \\[registered trademark\\]) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed",
