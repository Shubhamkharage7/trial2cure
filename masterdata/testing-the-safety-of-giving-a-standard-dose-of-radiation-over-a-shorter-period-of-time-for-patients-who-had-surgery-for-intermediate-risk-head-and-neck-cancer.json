To determine if a hypofractionated postoperative radiotherapy (H-PORT) schedule for patients with intermediate-risk head and neck cancer (squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, or larynx) who have undergone surgery is safe and feasible for further evaluation in a phase II clinical trial.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess H-PORT treatment-related and unrelated adverse events during treatment and within one year after treatment completion.\n\nII. To assess H-PORT tolerability and compliance, as measured by treatment interruptions and discontinuations, and to assess the reasons for those modifications.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo surgery per standard of care followed by hypofractionated radiotherapy. Patients receive 50 Gy over 4 weeks (i.e., 2.5 Gy per day x 20 fractions). Radiation therapy should start after there is adequate healing and no evidence of gross residual/recurrent cancer.\n\nPatients are followed up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post H-PORT therapy."
