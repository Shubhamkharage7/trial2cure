To develop and evaluate quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI analysis techniques that minimize patient- and scanner-specific variabilities in the calculation of quantitative parameters.\n\nII. To develop and evaluate diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) methods that reduce prostate geometric distortion due to patient- and scanner-specific susceptibility and eddy current effects.\n\nIII. To develop and evaluate multi-class deep learning models that systematically integrate quantitative multi-parametric (mp)-MRI features for accurate detection and classification of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nRETROSPECTIVE: Patients' medical records are reviewed.\n\nPROSPECTIVE: Patients undergo additional 3 Tesla (T) MRI imaging over 30 minutes before, during, or after their standard of care 3T MRI for a total of 1.5 hours."

Pairwise dissimilarities between distributions will be estimated by computing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, defined as the maximum difference between the empirical distribution functions over the range of the parameter, using 200 cases for each of three MRI scanners. The mean of these pairwise dissimilarities between scanners will be computed to quantify the overall discrepancy of each DCE-MRI model. Construction of a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the mean discrepancies using the nonparametric bootstrap will be done to compare this mean discrepancy between DCE-MRI models. 10,000 bootstrap samples will be generated by sampling patients with replacement, stratifying by the scanner. Will conclude that the proposed DCE-MRI model has a reduced inter-scanner variability if the 95% confidence interval is entirely less than zero.",
