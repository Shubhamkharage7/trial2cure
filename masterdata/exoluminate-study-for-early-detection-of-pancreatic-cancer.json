            "briefSummary": "ExoLuminate is a nationally-enrolling registry study designed for earlier detection of cancer in patients at elevated risk or clinically-suspicious for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n\nThose with elevated risk for PDAC can include individuals with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, family history of pancreatic cancer, germline mutations in genes known to be associated with cancer, and a personal or family history of pancreatitis.\n\nThe goal of the study is to compare the performance of ExoVerita\u2122 assay in early detection of PDAC to current standard-of-care methods of surveillance.",
            "detailedDescription": "Biological Dynamics, Inc. has developed a non-invasive blood test (\"liquid biopsy\") that can identify early-stage disease with high sensitivity and specificity. The proprietary ExoVerita\u2122 assay uses alternating current electric (ACE) field to isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs) for differentiated multiomics applications and includes an optimized machine learning algorithm to identify a panel of EV-bound protein biomarkers in patient's plasma in order to detect PDAC at earlier stages.\n\nExoLuminate is a prospective, multi-center, observational registry study designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of the performance of the ExoVerita\u2122 assay in detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in high-risk or clinically-suspicious populations in comparison to standard-of-care methods.\n\nThe study is planned to recruit a minimum of 1000 U.S. adults over 3-years (with a 2-year follow-up for data collection).\n\nEligible subjects will be evaluated using the ExoVerita\u2122 assay through blood donation(s) at specified time intervals. Overall, this study poses minimal risk to subject."
