            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effects of durvalumab and lurbinectedin in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (refractory). Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Lurbinectedin is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in the body. Giving durvalumab and lurbinectedin may help kill more tumor cells and help patients live longer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate whether the combination of durvalumab with lurbinectedin can increase the 6-month progression-free survival in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer who have progressed after initial combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. (Group A and B)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe the safety and adverse event profile of each treatment group in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer who have progressed after initial combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n\nII. To assess in a preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of this approach by assessing overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rate for each treatment group.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Blood and tissue will be banked for future studies.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and lurbinectedin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients without disease progression are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks until disease progression, and then every 3 months thereafter for up to 5 years from enrollment. After completion of study treatment, patients with disease progression are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years from enrollment."
