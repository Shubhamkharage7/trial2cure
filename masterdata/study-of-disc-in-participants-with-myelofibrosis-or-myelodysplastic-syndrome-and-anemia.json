For Phase 2a: In addition to the criteria above, DIPSS score of 1 to 2 (intermediate-1 risk) may also be included.\n3. Washout of at least 28 days prior to Screening of the following treatments: androgens, erythropoietin, cladribine, immunomodulators (lenalidomide, thalidomide), interferon alpha-2a or any other MF-directed therapy. Systemic corticosteroids are permitted for non-hematological conditions if stable or decreasing dose for \u2265 28 days prior to Screening and receiving an equivalent to \u2264 10 mg prednisone for the 28 days immediately prior to Screening.\n4. Anemia: For Phase 1b: Hemoglobin (Hgb) \\< 10 g/dL on \u2265 3 assessments over 84 days prior to Screening, without RBC transfusion, or Hgb \\< 10 g/dL and receiving RBC transfusions periodically but not meeting criteria for TD participant as defined for the TD cohort. The baseline Hgb value for these participants is the lowest Hgb level during the 84 days prior to Screening, or RBC transfusion dependence, defined as an RBC transfusion frequency of \u2265 6 units packed RBCs (PRBC) over the 84 days immediately prior to Screening. There must not be any consecutive 42-day period without an RBC transfusion in the 84-day period, and the last transfusion must be within 28 days prior to Screening. For Phase 2a: RBC transfusion dependence, defined as an RBC transfusion frequency of \u2265 6 units PRBC over the 84 days immediately prior to Screening. There must not be any consecutive 42-day period without an RBC transfusion in the 84-day period, and the last transfusion must be within 28 days prior to Screening.\n\n   For Phase 2a: RBC transfusion dependence, defined as an RBC transfusion frequency of \u22656 units PRBC over the 84 days immediately prior to Screening. There must not be any consecutive 42-day period without an RBC transfusion in the 84-day period, and the last transfusion must be within 28 days prior to Screening.\n5. Stable dose of JAK inhibitor (except momelotinib) and/or hydroxyurea, or, if taking any other treatment for MF, stable for at least 28 days prior to Screening. Momelotinib use requires 12 weeks of stable dosing prior to Screening. If subject discontinues JAK inhibitor (including momelotinib) and/or hydroxyurea prior to Screening, a 28-day washout period is required.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score \u2264 2.\n7. Infusion of hematopoietic stem cell transplant not anticipated within 8 months after Screening.\n8. Transferrin saturation \\<75% (local lab acceptable).\n9. Liver iron concentration by MRI \\< 7 mg/g dry weight within 3 months of eligibility confirmation.\n10.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) \\< 3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) at Screening.\n14. Direct bilirubin \\< 2x ULN at Screening. Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed by the Investigator to ineffective erythropoiesis.\n\nInclusion Criteria for Exploratory Cohort of Participants with MDS and Anemia:\n\n1. Age 18 years or older at the time of signing the ICF.\n2. Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) classification of very low, low, or intermediate (ie, lower risk) MDS or MDS/MPN with ringed sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RS-T) as confirmed in the most recent local bone marrow biopsy report according to WHO criteria.\n3. Washout of at least 28 days is required for prior anemia/neutropenia-directed therapies, including:\n\n   1. Androgens\n   2. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents\n   3. Luspatercept or sotatercept (ACE-011)\n   4. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) OR granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF)\n   5. Systemic corticosteroids (except for participants on a stable or decreasing dose for \u226528 days prior to randomization for non-hematological conditions and receiving an equivalent to \u226410 mg prednisone for the 28 days immediately prior to Screening) Screening can begin before the 28-day washout is completed, but the washout period must be completed prior to collection of Screening blood samples.\n4. Anemia:\n\n   1.
