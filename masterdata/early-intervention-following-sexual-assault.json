Participants may also be asked to complete brief daily assessments on their smart phones.",

The intervention will be tested in an open label trial to make final modifications to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the five to six week integrated intervention with standardized repeated measures during a one-month follow-up. Next, a pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 54 recent sexual assault victims to evaluate feasibility and preliminary efficacy in reducing AUD severity and PTSD symptoms. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) will be used to assess alcohol use, craving, and affect during the five-week treatment phase."

Subjects may also meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder, previous history of posttraumatic stress disorder, mood disorder (except bipolar affective disorder, see Exclusion Criteria) or other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder). The inclusion of subjects with affective and other anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of the co-existence of mood and other anxiety disorders among patients with AUD and PTSD (Norman et al., 2018; Zinzow et al., 2012). Subjects may meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for another substance use disorder if AUD is the primary substance of choice.\n* Must consent to complete all treatment and follow-up visits.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Lack of any memory of the sexual assault\n* Subjects meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a history of or current psychotic, bipolar, dissociative identify disorder, or a current eating disorder, as the study protocol may be therapeutically insufficient.\n* Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, as evidence by a score of 10 or more on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA). These subjects will be referred for clinical detoxification and may be re-assessed for study eligibility after medically supervised detoxification has been completed.\n* Individuals considered an immediate suicide risk, with current suicidal ideation and intent.\n* Individuals who attempted suicide in the past month. These individuals will be referred directly for treatment.\n* Individuals on psychotropic medications must be stabilized on it for at least two weeks prior to beginning the study.\n* Any other medical or psychiatric conditions that the investigators believe may compromise the individual's ability to safely participate in the study.",
