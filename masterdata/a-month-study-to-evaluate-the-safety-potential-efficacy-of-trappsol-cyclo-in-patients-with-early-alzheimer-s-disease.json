This study will be conducted in the US. There will be 3 treatment groups: 2 Active doses and 1 group will receive placebo completely by chance. Patients, caregiver, Sponsor, nor study staff will know which treatment is assigned. There are 3 periods in this study: Screening to confirm suitability, Treatment to receive study medication, and Follow-up to check overall health post-participation",

The study will enroll approximately 90 (30 patients/treatment arm) male and female patients aged 50 to 80 years at Screening with characteristic pathophysiologic changes of AD who meet National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria for either AD with MCI or mild AD collectively known as EAD (Stages 3 and 4). Enrolled patients must have evidence of progressive cognitive decline in the last year as determined by serial cognitive test scores, if available, or patient or informant/caregiver/study partner (hereafter called caregiver) report as documented by the Investigator"
