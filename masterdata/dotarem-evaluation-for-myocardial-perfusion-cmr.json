Both contrasts are used in standard of care procedures, and the one administered for each patient will be randomly selected. The length of the MRI study all procedures are the same as the clinically indicated scan.",

Within this overall goal, the following specific aims will be pursued:\n\n* Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the signal intensity enhancement during Dotarem myocardial stress/rest perfusion is relatively constant, providing linear and stable enhancement in the myocardium, and is not inferior compared to gadobutrol (Gadavist).\n* Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the relaxation rate enhancement during Dotarem myocardial rest perfusion is uniform in the myocardium."
