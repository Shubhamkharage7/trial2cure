            "briefSummary": "This trial will evaluate a multilevel intervention (STAR model) that combines mobile health (mHealth) hearing screening tools with telemedicine technology for specialty care access in rural Kentucky schools. An initial version of the model was used in rural Alaska where telemedicine-based specialty referral improved both proportion of children receiving follow-up and time to follow-up. The refined STAR model will utilize an enhanced mHealth screening protocol that includes tympanometry for the detection of middle ear disease. The STAR model will also include a specialty telemedicine referral process in schools for children who refer school screening.",
            "detailedDescription": "Childhood hearing loss has substantial lifelong consequences, including speech-language delay, worse academic performance, and limited vocational opportunities. In rural settings, where access to care is limited, school-based preventative screening programs can help in early identification of childhood hearing loss. The state of Kentucky mandates hearing screening for all schools; however, the effectiveness of these programs is unclear. Further, current school programs do not include a middle ear assessment, which is needed to detect infection-related hearing loss common in children in rural and low-income settings. In children referred from school-based hearing screening programs, loss to follow-up also remains a pervasive issue.\n\nTo address these key issues, the University of Kentucky has partnered with the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences to lead the Appalachian STAR trial. This trial will evaluate a multilevel intervention (STAR model) that combines mobile health (mHealth) hearing screening tools with telemedicine technology for specialty care access in rural Kentucky schools. An initial version of the model was used in rural Alaska where telemedicine-based specialty referral improved both proportion of children receiving follow-up and time to follow-up. The refined STAR model will utilize an enhanced mHealth screening protocol that includes tympanometry for the detection of middle ear disease. The STAR model will also include a specialty telemedicine referral process in schools for children who refer school screening.\n\nThe Appalachian STAR stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial will be conducted in approximately 64 elementary schools located in 14 counties in rural Kentucky. Approximately 3600 students at school entry will be enrolled annually for 4 years, for a total of approximately 14,400 children. Cluster randomization will occur in two sequences at the county level, with 7 counties (clusters) in each sequence. The 4-year trial will include a control condition period, followed by phased roll-out of the intervention. The enhanced mHealth school hearing screening protocol will be implemented first. The following year, specialty telemedicine referral will be added to the enhanced screening protocol. All 14 counties will receive the STAR model by the end of the trial. An implementation evaluation will be conducted to refine the STAR model throughout the trial. If successful, the STAR model could be applied to address hearing loss and other childhood health conditions that affect underserved rural communities across America."
