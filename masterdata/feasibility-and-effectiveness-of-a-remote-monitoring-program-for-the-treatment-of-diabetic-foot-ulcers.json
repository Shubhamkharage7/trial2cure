            "briefSummary": "This research is being done to compare two different methods of wound monitoring for chronic wounds: remote wound monitoring using a smartphone app and in-person wound monitoring in a clinic setting. This will be a pilot non-blinded randomized controlled feasibility trial. The investigators will enroll 120 patients with an active diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) who present to the multidisciplinary diabetic foot clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. Patients will be computer randomized 1:1 to receive wound care monitoring using remote DFU monitoring technology or standard in-person monitoring for 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research is to determine if a smartphone mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, designed to capture wound measurements and analyze wound tissue distribution in real-time, can be a practical patient-centered solution for regular wound management and assessment. The app will be compared to traditional in-person wound monitoring. One of the major limitations of most literature describing remote monitoring technologies is the lack of a control group. By randomizing half of the enrolled patients to remote monitoring via standard of care, the investigators will be able to compare patient and provider satisfaction with remote vs. in-person monitoring, as well as the wound healing outcomes."
