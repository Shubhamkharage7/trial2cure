            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well low-dose radiotherapy works in treating bone pain in patients with multiple myeloma that has spread to the bone. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, protons, or other sources to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Low-dose radiotherapy may be more convenient for patients and their families, may not interfere as much with the timing of chemotherapy, and may have less chance for short term or long-term side effects from the radiation.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether treatment with 2 Gy x 2 to a painful myeloma bone lesion achieves patient-reported pain reduction comparable to current standard of care at 4 weeks.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with 2 Gy x 2 to painful myeloma bone lesions.\n\nII. To quantify analgesia use/reduction following 2 Gy x 2 to a painful myeloma bone lesion. All opioid analgesia use will be converted into morphine equivalent in order to compare across the entire population.\n\nIII. To measure time to pain relief and duration of pain relief with 2 Gy x 2.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To record cytogenetics and International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria at diagnosis and prior to and following radiotherapy (RT).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive low-dose radiation therapy at consecutive business days 1 and 2 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no pain relief may receive additional radiotherapy at 4 weeks following initial radiotherapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 4, and 8 weeks and also at 6 months."
