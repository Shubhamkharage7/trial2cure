            "briefSummary": "This project will develop and test quality measures for and a facilitation model to help addictions treatment clinics increase use of medicines for opioid use disorders, retain clients longer in care, and help more people move into successful recovery. At the end of the project, we will have developed specific training and coaching protocols as well as electronic clinical support tools to guide quality improvement that can be disseminated within New York and the rest of the country.\n\nThe study will test a clinic-level intervention that uses external facilitators to provide guidance to addictions clinics and contain three key components: 1) training on data driven management; 2) training and guidance on patient-centered care and OUD medication; and 3) electronic tools for shared decision making and patient progress monitoring.",
            "detailedDescription": "There will be 4 sources of data examined in this study: 3 at the patient level and 1 at the staff level. The sources of patient data include: 1) State administrative data from all clients receiving treatment at the enrolled clinics (\\~7,950); 2) a subsample (1,200) who will be recruited directly from the clinics to complete patient-reported outcome assessments, and 3) treatment progress data for clients will also be collected.\n\nFor our administrative source of data, a final study population of approximately 7,950 individuals who are receiving treatment in the 30 enrolled outpatient treatment clinics for OUD is anticipated. Clinics will be located in the New York City metropolitan region (including Nassau, Westchester, and Rockland counties) and the Capital Region (including Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Montgomery, Schenectady, and Schoharie counties). Staff at each enrolled clinic will also be interviewed and surveyed."
