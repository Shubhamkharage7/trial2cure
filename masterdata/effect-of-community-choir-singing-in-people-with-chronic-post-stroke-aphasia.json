            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized controled trial is to test the effects of assigning people with chronic post-stroke aphasia to 12 weekly choir sessions, compared to usual care.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\nDoes the assignment to a choir singing program causes a beneficial effect on functional communication and language recovery as well as psychosocial outcomes compared to usual care in the rehabilitation of people with chronic post-stroke aphasia?\n\nParticipants will have:\n\n12 in-person choir-singing sessions (1 session/week, 1,5 h/session, total 18h) conducted by a choir master, and home singing training (3 x 30-minutes-sessions/week, total 18h)",
            "detailedDescription": "Description of study population Additional information: Participants with chronic aphasia due to stroke will be recruited from four participating centers in Canada and the United States.\n\nStudy design Additional information: A parallel group randomized trial design with a secondary crossover extension was chosen for this study to offer the intervention to all participants. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to two study arms (AB/BA, A = 12 weekly choir sessions and home singing training, B = usual care) stratified for aphasia severity (according to the Quick Aphasia Battery overall score), age, time since last stroke and their interest in music (according to the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire). Measures at the \"macro\" level will be collected at Baseline, Completion and 2-months Follow-up time points for each group. At the \"micro\" level (i.e., at choir sessions 2, 6, 10 and 12) data will be collected during as well as pre and post choir-singing.\n\nIntervention Additional information: The repertoire in the comunity choir activity will consist of popular songs in English or French. Half of the songs will be pre-determined and half will be chosen by the choir members from a list, based on a vote during the first week of the intervention. Eligible songs will remain within the range of an octave and include a variety of tempi (but fast tempi will be slowed down if needed to facilitate word production). Depending on the group's abilities, the Choir Director will decide in which keys the songs will be performed, and whether they will be sung in unison or with simple harmonies. Songs in canon will be included in the predetermined repertoire to easily create harmonies. Each session will include (in this order): 15 minutes for vocal warm-up; 25 minutes of work on the song repertoire; 20 minutes for a social break with refreshments.\n\nFor the home training, participants will be instructed to sing at home with a video guide on an online platform. Each home training session will include (in this order): 10 minutes for vocal warm-up; and 20 minutes sing-along using songs of the repertoire. Song lyrics will be displayed on the video.\n\nTo monitor the usual care, each participant (and/or caregiver) will complete a form and/or have a weekly 5-15-minute phone/Zoom call with a research assistant to collect the usual care data including type and time spent in social activities and rehabilitation services, as well as adverse events.\n\nRandomization and concealment For randomization, an online system will be used by a researcher not involved in data collection.\n\nEach participant will be assigned an identification number upon inclusion in the study. After completion of the baseline assessments, the independent researcher will receive the list of participants' IDs with their stratification data (age, time post-stoke, aphasia severity, level of interest in music) to perform the randomization.\n\nBlinding:\n\nOutcomes will be measured by blinded assessors where possible, based on video or audio recordings.\n\nPlanned analyses:\n\nPrimary hypothesis:\n\nParticipants assigned to the choir intervention over 12 weeks will demonstrate a significantly larger improvement in macro-level measures compared to those receiving usual care.\n\nSecondary hypothesis:\n\nParticipants who completed the choir intervention with 80% adherence over 12 weeks will demonstrate a larger improvement in macro-level measures compared to those receiving usual care.\n\nThe gains will be maintained for the participants with 80% adherence.\n\nThere will be immediate changes in micro-level measures after a choir session (Session 6).\n\nThere will be differences in pre-post-session variations of micro-level measures between Session 2, 6 and 10.\n\nThere will be differences in pre-post-session variations between the usual rehearsal (Session 10) and the Concert (Session 12)."
