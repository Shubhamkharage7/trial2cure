            "detailedDescription": "Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common endocrinopathies in women, presents with anovulation in adolescence, and reproductive dysfunction is related to excess weight. After a 4-month observation period of either no medication or metformin treatment, females aged 12-35 years with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome will receive 10 months of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist to induce metabolic changes, weight loss and improve reproductive abnormalities. We will assess the relationship between weight loss and reproductive function, as well as identify if age, hormonal and metabolic measures and such insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion predict the response to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy."
