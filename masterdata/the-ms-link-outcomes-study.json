In this study participants will be followed from the time of consent through the lifetime of the study (currently 3 years), unless the participant chooses to withdraw from the study. Collection of participant's medical history, including MS and treatment history, will be automated through extraction from the participant's electronic medical record (EMR) and other health information systems (for example, radiology). Participants will complete patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and other health-related information digitally. Participating participants will have access to their own data in an ongoing manner via a web-based Participant Portal."
