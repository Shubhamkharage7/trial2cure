The investigators overarching hypothesis is that 3D organoids are ideal to test chemosensitivity in real time, to provide personalized medicine and guidance in the setting of relapsed hematologic malignancy and potentially other cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Optimize the novel 3D organoid technique already used to recreate myeloma tumors in the Regenerative Medicine laboratory.\n\nOptimize cell viability of myeloma organoids to extend available time in culture by screening cell culture media cytokines and 3D extracellular matrix composition (current environment is able to maintain cells alive for up to 5-7 days to allow testing).\n\nEvaluate myeloma tumor markers at different time points of organoid life to confirm accurate tumor representation, identify genetic expression characteristics, unique mutations, and tumor-stroma interaction. This will give information of the tumor characteristics to learn about tumor biology and correlate with responses.\n\nEvaluate chemosensitivity on patient derived 3D organoids. Using myeloma patients marrow aspirate, evaluate live/kill rates of myeloma cells after being exposed to established regimen combinations after 24 and 36 hours of exposure at pre-determined concentrations.\n\nUsing patient samples, evaluate differences in gene expression and cell markers of the myeloma cells that remained alive after chemotherapy exposure to better understand mechanisms of resistance.\n\nValidate the predictive value of the 3D organoid chemobiogram results compared with retrospective data of the donor s responses to the treatment used at that time point. This will compare in vivo/ex vivo responses and facilitate future personalized medicine. Chemobiogram is the report on chemosensitivity from the combinations tested much like an antibiogram."
