By obtaining personal and family history information from individuals who carry a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant and their family members, this study will aim to better define CTNNA1 associated cancer risks and determine whether there is a genotype/phenotype correlation for CTNNA1 loss-of-function variants. This information will be important for the future cancer risk management of individuals who carry a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant."
