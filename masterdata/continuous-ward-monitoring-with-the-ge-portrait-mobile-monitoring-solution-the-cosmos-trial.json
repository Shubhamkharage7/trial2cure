Determine whether unblinded continuous ward monitoring with the GE Portrait Mobile Monitoring Solution and nursing alerts reduces vital sign abnormalities in patients recovering from major noncardiac surgery.\n\nPrimary hypothesis. Unblinded continuous ward monitoring and nurse alerts reduces vital sign abnormalities during the initial 48 postoperative hours after major non-cardiac surgery while patients remain hospitalized.\n\nSecondary Aim. Determine whether continuous ward saturation, ventilation, and pulse rate monitoring reduces a composite of substantive respiratory and cardiovascular interventions.\n\nSecondary hypothesis. Unblinded continuous ward monitoring increases a composite of clinical interventions for desaturation, hypoventilation, tachypnea, tachycardia, and bradycardia within 48 hours after major non-cardiac surgery."
