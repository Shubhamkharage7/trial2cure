            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeople with TRD are often helped by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). But ECT can affect memory and thinking. Researchers want to study a treatment called TEST that uses less electricity.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the safety and feasibility of TEST and assess its antidepressant effects.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 25-64 with major depression that has not been relieved by current treatments.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 5 18 weeks over 2 3 treatment phases. Their medications may be adjusted.\n\nParticipants will be interviewed about their depression, side effects, and other treatments they are receiving. They will complete questionnaires. They will give blood and urine samples. Their brain waves and heart rhythm will be recorded. They will take tests of memory, attention, mental functioning, and thinking.\n\nParticipants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head and brain. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner. Pictures of brain chemicals will also be taken. They may complete tasks during the MRI.\n\nParticipants will receive TEST and/or sham treatments. They may receive optional ECT. An intravenous catheter will be placed in an arm vein to receive general anesthesia. Two electrodes will be placed on the front of their head. An electric current will be passed from the ECT machine through the electrodes. For sham treatments, they will not receive the electric current. Their breathing, heart rate, brain function, blood pressure, and body movements will be measured.\n\nParticipants will have 7 follow-up visits over 6 months. Visits can be done via telehealth.\n\nParticipation will last for up to 42 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is a medical device feasibility study, which per FDA definition, is a study focusing primarily on continuing safety data collection that aims to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness data on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan an appropriate pivotal study. It tests the hypothesis that Transcranial Electric Stimulation Therapy (TEST), an experimental brain stimulation therapy, can have an antidepressant effect in individuals with treatment resistant depression (TRD) safely and without significant adverse cognitive effects. TEST involves bifrontal electrical brain stimulation at a dose below the seizure threshold, applied in the same manner as standard electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), with scalp electrodes, under anesthesia, using a standard ECT device. The effects of TEST will be compared to those of sham TEST (anesthesia alone) in 30 patients with TRD in a randomized, double-blind, parallel trial, followed by a nonrandomized extension during which all participants are eligible for active treatment.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of TEST in 30 adults with treatment resistant major depression (TRD)\n\nSecondary Objectives: To assess the antidepressant effect of TEST.\n\nEndpoints: Primary Endpoints: 1.Treatment adverse effects with an emphasis on adverse cognitive effects, primarily memory impairment. 2.Presence or absence of a seizure in participants receiving TEST (feasibility of consistently not inducing seizures with TEST)\n\nSecondary Endpoint: Treatment-related changes in depressive symptom scale score"

If participants opt in, our overall plan is to share a blood specimen and demographic (excluding PII) and clinical information that is deidentified and not linked to a code to which the sample or data can be traced for identification, with Gen ECT consortium which is part of the PGC. The samples and clinical information would be batched and sent once study data is reviewed and locked. Information to accompany the blood sample includes the following: 1. info about the blood sample-date collected 2. demographic information excluding PII 3. Clinical information and study results including the following: psychiatric and medical diagnoses; psychiatric and medical treatment history; substance use history; family history; reason for ECT, details of the ECT course, e.g., number of treatments, electrode placement, and results of cognitive testing and psychiatric scales.",
