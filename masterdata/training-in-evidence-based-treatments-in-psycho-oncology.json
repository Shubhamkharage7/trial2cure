            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, behavioral intervention study to train psychotherapists to administer individualized evidence-based psychotherapies in a cancer care setting to participants with elevated levels of distress related to their illness and/or treatment. For participants with cancer, common treatment goals include improving health behaviors, reducing psychological symptoms that may exacerbate medical disability, and/or improving functional status.\n\nResearch procedures include screening for eligibility, completion of surveys and questionnaires, and virtual or in-person therapy sessions.\n\nThe intervention will mirror clinical care in psycho-oncology in which the therapist, collaboratively with their supervisor, will choose specific components of the following evidence-based treatments to administer based on the clinical presentation of the patient and referring problem.\n\n* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\n* Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT)\n* Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)\n* Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)\n* Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP)\n* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)\n* CBT for other cancer-related physical symptoms like pain, fatigue, and nausea.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last about 26 weeks.\n\nIt is expected that about 100 people and 15 therapists will take part in this research study.\n\nPatient participants will be those who a) are currently receiving oncology care, including active treatment and/or surveillance, b) report elevated levels of distress (\u2265 3 on the NCCN Distress Thermometer), c) report that their distress or presenting concerns are related to their illness and/or their treatment(s), and d) have a clinical presentation that matches an evidence-based treatment (e.g., CBT-I for insomnia/sleep disturbance) for cancer-related distress per the therapist and the supervising therapist's discretion. The investigators aim to recruit up to 100 patient participants to this study over the course of 5 years. Therapist participants will be fellows or residents in the Mass General's Center for Psychiatric Oncology \\& Behavioral Sciences. The investigators aim to include up to 15 therapist participants over the course of this 5-year study. The study period for therapist participation would be up to 3 years, and would end either at a) 3 years, b) the point at which the therapist obtains licensure and transitions to faculty member, c) the time the therapist leaves MGH."
