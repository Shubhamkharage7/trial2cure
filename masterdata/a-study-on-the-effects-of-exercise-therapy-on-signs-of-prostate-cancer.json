The exercise therapy in this study will be regular home-based walking sessions on a treadmill, and that therapy will be assigned by an exercise physiologist (a medical professional who studies how exercise affects the human body). Some participants in this study will have the assigned exercise therapy, and some participants will participate in their usual exercise routines. Researchers will compare how the assigned exercise therapy and the usual exercise routines affect indicators of prostate cancer in participants. This study will not provide treatment for prostate cancer."
