            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about resilience coaching in adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The main questions it aims to answer are to 1) determine how helpful resilience coaching is for teens with chronic musculoskeletal pain, 2) which participants are best suited for resilience coaching, and 3) barriers and facilitators to implementing resilience coaching as part of routine clinical care. Participants will complete survey measures and participate in the resilience coaching intervention called Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM). Researchers will compare youth in PRISM to those receiving usual care to determine whether PRISM leads to greater improvements in functional disability, psychological distress, and pain intensity than usual care alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to find out if a resilience coaching program called Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) can help youth with chronic musculoskeletal pain better cope with their chronic illness.Researchers will recruit a total of 120 youth with chronic musculoskeletal pain and one of their caregivers (total number of participants = 240). Teens will be randomly assigned to either a control group (usual care) or a treatment group (PRISM + usual care). PRISM consists of 4 study visits with a resilience coach, and one optional coming together session where you parents are invited to join. This will occur over approximately 12 weeks. All participants will complete survey measures at baseline, 3-months and 9 months. Selected participants in PRISM will be invited to participate in interviews to provide feedback on the intervention. At the end of the study, researchers will assess whether participants in PRISM had improved functional disability, psychological distress and pain intensity as compared to the usual care arm."
