Patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled consecutively with verbal informed consent from the time this protocol is approved by the IRB until 1,200 subjects are enrolled. At \\~30 days preoperatively the subjects will have a wearable device (such as a Fitbit) placed on their wrist and will wear the device until \\~180 days post-operatively. This device will wirelessly transmit data regarding activity and sleep quality to a smartphone application for the duration of wear and data will be analyzed by our collaborators at Case Western Reserve University."
