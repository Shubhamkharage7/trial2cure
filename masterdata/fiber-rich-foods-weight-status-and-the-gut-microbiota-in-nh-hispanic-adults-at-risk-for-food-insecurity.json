The study aims to assess food access and intake of fiber-rich foods, characterize fecal microbiota composition, and assess the relationship between the intake of fiber-rich foods and components of the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis. These aims will be accomplished through biospecimen collection including a pre-collected stool sample, a fasting blood sample, and a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT). In addition, participants will answer questionnaires on dietary intake, food insecurity and access, physical activity, eating behavior, and sociodemographic characteristics.",

In a group of 60 participants, the study aims to assess food access and intake of fiber-rich foods, characterize fecal microbiota composition, and assess the relationship between the intake of fiber-rich foods and components of the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.\n\nThe study involves biospecimen collection including a pre-collected stool sample, a fasting blood sample, and a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT). In addition, participants will answer questionnaires on dietary intake, food insecurity and access, physical activity, eating behavior, and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\nPre-collected stool samples will be obtained from participants. Anthropometric measurements will be collected at the time of the study visit including height, weight, and waist and hip circumference. BMI will be calculated. An intra-venous catheter will be inserted by a healthcare professional to first collect a fasting blood sample, and will remain inserted for all following blood samples. Subjects will then undergo a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT), a validated metabolic assessment in which the participant ingests a liquid mixed meal (e.g., Boost or Ensure), and blood samples are subsequently collected 15min, 30min, 60min and 120min after meal ingestion.\n\nIn the intervals between blood sample collections, subjects will complete questionnaires on dietary intake, food insecurity and access, physical activity, eating behavior, and sociodemographic characteristics. The following validated measures will be used to assess these aims:\n\n* USDA Household Food Sufficiency Questionnaire\n* Perceived Nutrition Environment Measurements Survey (NEMS-P)\n* Shortened version of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire\n* Latino Dietary Behaviors Questionnaire (LDBQ)\n* Global Physical Activity Questionnaire\n* Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics\n* NHANES Weight History Questionnaire\n* Medical History Questionnaire"
