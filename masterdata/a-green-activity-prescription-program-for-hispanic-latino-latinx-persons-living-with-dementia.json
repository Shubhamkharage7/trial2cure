For example, dog walking, hiking, outdoor yoga, and gardening are all green activities. The purpose of the program is to help people living with memory challenges participate in nature activities they enjoy. The goal of the program is to help people stay active and improve their health and well-being.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm pre/post feasibility study lasting up to 1 year. Investigators will recruit in n=40 dyads (Hispanic/Latino people living with memory challenges and their study partners n=80 total) and expect n=30 (n=60 total people living with memory challenges and study partners) to complete the 12-week GAP-H and evaluate it for feasibility and acceptability. Anonymous program evaluation surveys will be administered either via paper or RedCap survey to the outdoor activity professionals who participated in the study. Brief recorded phone interviews (5 minutes) will be conducted with the people living with memory challenges and their study partners after the intervention and 15-minute brief calls with the outdoor activity professionals will be used to gather feedback to refine the program. Informal conversations with the occupational therapist(s) delivering the intervention will occur to identify areas for refinement and will be documented with anonymous notes and no identifiable data collected from them. Sustained behavior change will be measured in people living with memory challenges at 4 weeks after the intervention."
