This study is evaluation the open incision breast reduction technique to a liposuction assisted breast reduction. This study will evaluate these two breast reduction techniques in terms of complication rates, functionality, patient satisfaction, and cosmetic outcomes. Participants will be asked to complete the BREAST-Q survey regarding their breast reduction postoperatively."
