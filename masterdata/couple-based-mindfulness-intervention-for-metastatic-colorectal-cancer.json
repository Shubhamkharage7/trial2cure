The intervention is named \"MIND-Together\" (Mindfully Navigating Distress Together). MIND-Together will be the first mindfulness-based intervention designed to reduce mCRC couples' distress by targeting their unique psychosocial needs. The intervention is projected to be a 4-session intervention delivered by a trained therapist to individual couples facing mCRC (i.e., a patient and his/her intimate partner) via video-conference (e.g., Zoom)."

They will also be asked to test playing segments of the audio/video recordings to ensure ease of use. A semi-structured interview format will be used to elicit feedback, including a standard verbal survey assessing ease of reading the material, any difficulties experienced, and suggestions they have for improving the ease of material use.
