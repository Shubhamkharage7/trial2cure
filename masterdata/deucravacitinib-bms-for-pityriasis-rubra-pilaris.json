Note: Patients who have documented anti-HCV treatment for a past HCV infection AND are HCV RNA-negative may be enrolled in the study.\n* Have evidence of HIV infection and/or positive HIV antibodies.\n* Have had household contact with a person with active TB and did not receive appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB.\n* Have evidence of active TB or latent TB.\n* Have evidence of active TB, defined in this study as the following:\n\n  * Positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test (\u2265 5 mm induration between approximately 2 and 3 days after application, regardless of vaccination history), medical history, clinical features, and abnormal chest x-ray at screening;\n  * QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold test or T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test (as available and if compliant with local TB guidelines) may be used instead of the PPD test. Patients are excluded from the study if the test is not negative and there is clinical evidence of active TB. Exception: patients with a history of active TB who have documented evidence of appropriate treatment, have no history of re-exposure since their treatment was completed, have no clinical features of active TB, and have a screening chest x-ray with no evidence of active TB may be enrolled if other entry criteria met. Such patients would not be required to undergo the protocol-specific TB testing for PPD, QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold test, or T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test but must have a chest x-ray at screening (i.e., chest imaging performed within the past 6 months will not be accepted).\n* Have evidence of untreated/inadequately or inappropriately treated latent TB, defined in this study as the following:\n\n  * Positive PPD test, no clinical features consistent with active TB, and a chest x-ray with no evidence of active TB at screening; or\n  * If the PPD test is positive and the patient has no medical history or chest x-ray findings consistent with active TB, the patient may have a QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold test or T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test (as available and if compliant with local TB guidelines). If the test results are not negative, the patient will be considered to have latent TB (for purposes of this study); or\n  * QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold test or T- SPOT\u00ae.TB test (as available and if compliant with local TB guidelines) may be used instead of the PPD test. If the test results are positive, the patient will be considered to have latent TB. If the test is not negative, the test may be repeated once within approximately 2 weeks of the initial value. If the repeat test results are again not negative, the patient will be considered to have latent TB (for purposes of this study).\n* Have been exposed to a live vaccine within 12 weeks of randomization or are expected to need/receive a live vaccine during the course of the study (with the exception of herpes zoster vaccination).\n* Have donated more than a single unit of blood within 4 weeks prior to screening or intend to donate blood during the course of the study.\n* Have a history of intravenous drug abuse, other illicit drug abuse, or chronic alcohol abuse within the 2 years prior to screening or are concurrently using, or expected to use during the study, illicit drugs (including marijuana).",
