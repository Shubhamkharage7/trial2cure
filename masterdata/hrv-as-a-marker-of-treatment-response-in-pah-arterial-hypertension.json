We will screen adult patients newly diagnosed with PAH and placed on targeted pulmonary vasodilator therapy by their treating physician for enrollment.\n\nWe will enroll 35 eligible participants over a two-year period. HRV will be measured using the Polar\u2122 H10 wearable chest actigraphy device in conjunction with analytic software to capture HRV data.\n\nAfter enrollment and completion of the baseline visit, study participants will receive chest actigraphy device to measure their heart rate for a two hour period twice a week during study participation. Follow up research visits will be conducted at one-month, 3-months, and 6-months to sync the actigraphy device and assess any AE's.\n\nIn-between these visits, study staff will communicate with participants at two weeks, two months, 4 months, and 5 months, to identify and address any issues with study actigraphic device, assess any adverse events and maintain regular contact with study participants.\n\nThroughout study participation, subjects will continue routine clinical care at the direction of their treating physician as needed."
