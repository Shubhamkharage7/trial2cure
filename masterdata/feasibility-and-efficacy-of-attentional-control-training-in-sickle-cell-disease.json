EndeavorRx (Akili Interactive Labs: Boston, MA) is an FDA-approved home-based, electronic attentional-control training program designed to treat attention problems in youth. Users access EndeavorRx on a tablet device for 25-30 minutes each day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. The program involves training in a game-like environment that repeatedly challenges attentional-control abilities and adapts to user performance, becoming more difficult over time as performance improves. This pilot study is examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of EndeavorRx in a sample of 20 children with SCD ages 8-16 who are being treated with chronic blood transfusion therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit significantly reduced cognitive functioning compared to peers and siblings without SCD. Cognitive deficits are greatest among those with severe SCD genotypes, persistent anemia, and strokes and these deficits worsen over time. These deficits often manifest as difficulties with executive functioning and attention due to the predominance of cerebral infarcts (\\>90%) that occur in the frontal cortex. Reduced capacity to engage such cognitive skills has significant real-world implications, leading to disruption to academic achievement and attainment, vocational outcomes, and quality of life. EndeavorRx (Akili Interactive Labs: Boston, MA) is an FDA-approved home-based, electronic attentional-control training program designed to treat attention problems in youth. Users access EndeavorRx on a tablet device for 25-30 minutes each day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. The program involves training in a game-like environment that repeatedly challenges attentional-control abilities and adapts to user performance, becoming more difficult over time as performance improves. Data support effects of EndeavorRx on performance-based and parent-reported measures of attention in youth with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Given the similarities in attentional functioning among youth with ADHD and those with SCD, EndeavorRx holds promise as an intervention for patients experiencing SCD-related cognitive deficits. This pilot study is examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of EndeavorRx in a sample of 20 children with SCD ages 8-16 who are being treated with chronic blood transfusion therapy due to an identified high risk of stroke or as a preventive measure to protect against additional stroke events."

Users are subsequently presented with a multitask training session where they complete the perceptual discrimination/attention task and the sensorimotor navigation task simultaneously.
