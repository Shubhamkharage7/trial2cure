The treatment received (surgery and/or chemotherapy) will be the normal standard-of-care treatment for ACC. However, the placement and removal of the microdevice is being tested for the first time in this type of cancer.\n\n* This research study involves drugs that are released by a small implantable microdevice (IMD) as small as the tip of a needle, that is inserted into the tumor and is then removed 3-5 days later during surgery.\n* The microdevice can hold up to 20 drugs in very small concentrations that are able to access the cancer through small pores in the device. When the device is removed along with the cancer at the time of surgery, it will be evaluated to understand which drug(s) may be effective to treat these cancers.\n\nIt is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the microdevice a treatment for any disease.\n\nAACRF, a research foundation, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the research study, the study drugs and study procedures."

If initial fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy shows findings suggestive of ACC or a basaloid neoplasm, the patient is considered eligible.
