Adequate methods of contraception are provided as examples. Other acceptable and effective methods of birth control are also permitted (e.g., abstinence).\n\n* Male patients must agree to not donate sperm while on the study and for at least 5 months after the last dose of study drug. They must agree to use contraception during the intervention period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of isatuximab treatment.\n* Subjects must be able to give informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presence of relapse/progression of malignant disease for which the patient underwent allo-HCT\n* Patients with anemia and/or thrombocytopenia related to transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.\n* Patients with active GVHD requiring therapy may be eligible if the GVHD is responsive to treatment (\\< grade 4 in severity), and after agreement between the sponsor and principal investigator.\n* Organ insufficiency based on above criteria.\n* Pregnancy or unwillingness to agree to birth control as noted above.\n* Known to be HIV+ or to have active hepatitis A, B, or C infection (i.e., with viremia).\n\nOf note:\n\n* Patients can be eligible if anti-HBc seropositive (with or without positive anti-HBs), but HBsAg and HBV DNA are negative.\n* Patients with antiviral therapy for HCV started before initiation of treatment and positive Hep C antibodies are eligible. The antiviral therapy for Hep C should continue throughout the treatment period until seroconversion. Patients with positive anti-Hep C and undetectable Hep C RNA without antitviral therapy for Hep C are eligible.\n\n  * Any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition(s), including infection(s) that, in the Investigator's opinion, would expose the patient to excessive risk or may interfere with compliance or interpretation of the study results.\n  * Hypersensitivity or history of intolerance to steroids, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, sodium stearyl fumarate, histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt), arginine hydrochloride, poloxamer 188, sucrose, prior anti-CD38 moAb such as daratumumab, or any of the other components of study intervention that are not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers or would prohibit further treatment with these agents.\n  * Received any investigational drug within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug prior to initiation of study intervention, whichever is longer. In case of very aggressive disease (e.g., acute leukemia) delay could be shortened after agreement between sponsor and principal investigator, in absence of residual toxicities from previous therapy.\n* Patients on post-HCT maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of relapse (for patients with hematologic malignancies) or GVHD (e.g., FLT3 inhibitors, etc.) may be eligible after agreement between the sponsor and principal investigator.\n\n  * Contraindication to any concomitant medication, including pre-medications or hydration given prior to therapy\n  * Participants who are unable to consent to the study or comply with the study procedures.",
