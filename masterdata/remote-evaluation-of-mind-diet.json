            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if increasing adherence to a Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet pattern improves thinking ability and memory compared to a healthy control diet in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nDoes the MIND diet improve cognitive performance relative to a control diet in persons with MS?\n\nParticipants will:\n\nConsume one meal that follows the MIND diet or a control meal every day for 3 months, complete online surveys and cognitive testing before and after, and keep a record of the food they eat during the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to understand how a healthy diet is related to thinking ability and memory in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study is fully remote consisting of meals being delivered to participant homes using Daily Harvest meal delivery service. Participants will be asked to consume a microwaveable study meal or prepackaged smoothie every day for 12 weeks. The study meals and smoothies will follow either a dietary pattern thought to improve brain health (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay; MIND), or a control diet, and will include foods commonly found in grocery stores. Participants will not know which diet they are assigned to (active or control). Participants will also be asked to follow simple dietary guidance on a healthy diet in addition to the meals provided. Participants will complete a series of online forms or surveys. Additionally, participants will complete an online cognitive battery from Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) at the beginning and end of the study."
