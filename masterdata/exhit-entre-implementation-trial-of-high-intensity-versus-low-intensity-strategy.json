Community hospitals will be randomized 1:1 to implement a low- or high-intensity strategy. Hospitals will be randomized with intervention implementation and oversight assigned to one of 3-4 geographically diverse hub academic medical centers with existing clinical and research expertise in HBOT. The randomization will be stratified by site/hub. Participants will be assessed for \"engagement with MOUD\", measured as the proportion of community hospital OUD discharges engaged with MOUD within 34 days following hospital discharge during months 13-24 of the intervention. Further outcomes will be assessed during the entire 4-year study period."

Be willing to identify a site champion to promote and adopt change that can address OUD in hospitalized patients.\n3. Have hospital personnel who state that their institution is interested in and would be willing to work to implement MOUD prior to hospital discharge.\n4. Commit to having buprenorphine-waivered prescribers willing and able to write prescriptions to bridge discharged patients to post-discharge OUD treatment, or available direct entry into outpatient MOUD with methadone or buprenorphine.\n5. Have hospital staff who express willingness to engage with a site/hub team for training and for data collection.\n6. Be willing to be randomized to low-intensity or high-intensity implementation support.\n7. Provide inpatient general medical care.\n8. Have sufficient numbers of Medicaid OUD discharges (any listed diagnosis; sufficient is defined as at least enough such that when added to the other hospitals in the region there are on average 100 discharges per year). Medicaid data must capture at least 3 discharge diagnoses, outpatient MOUD, and be available within no more than 12 months of discharge.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Have an ACS routinely prescribing MOUD at discharge.\n2. Have an existing, functioning HBOT program or be imminently starting an HBOT initiative, as confirmed by the investigator team.\n3.
