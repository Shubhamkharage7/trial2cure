The main question that our study aims to answer is if patient education can improve the adherence to GDMT in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Participants will receive educations about GDMT benefits in 1,3 and 5 months after discharge from hospital.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized clinical trial assessing the possible benefit of post-discharge education on the extent of guideline directed medical treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Patients that are admitted to medical facilities of the Medstar health, Baltimore will be screened and if consented, they will all get an initial inhouse face to face education, and upon discharge, they will be randomized to the control group and intervention group. The latter will get more educations via phone-call sessions at 1, 3 and 5 months post discharge. The educational sessions will include educating the benefits of GDMT, reviewing the components of GDMT and their possible side effects, performing Medication reconciliation, Inquiries about reasons not getting the medications and encouraging adherence to clinic visits and requesting the treating providers for GDMT optimization. There will be no formal prescription or change of medication during the educational sessions. GDMT use will be assessed in all patients after 6 months according to GDMT score by the Heart Failure Collaboratory."
