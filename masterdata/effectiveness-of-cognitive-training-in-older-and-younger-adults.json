            "detailedDescription": "Participants will first complete two sessions (\\~75 minutes each) where they are asked to view visual stimuli (such as black and white lines, letters, simple shapes like triangles, circles, and squares) presented on a computer or television screen and/or listen to auditory stimuli (such as pure tones) presented via headphone or speakers. They will be asked to make some simple judgments about the stimuli (such as indicating whether the stimulus you observed is the same or different from that on a previous trial), and indicate their judgment decision with a button press on a keyboard, a mouse click, or a movement on a touchpad. They will also be asked to complete a set of questionnaires.\n\nAfter the initial sessions, participants may be asked to complete two sets of 10 sessions (\\~20 minutes) of cognitive tasks either at home or in the lab. Each set of sessions should be completed over a period of no more than 15 days. If asked to do these sessions, instructions will be given regarding the tasks to complete in these training sessions (which will be similar to some of the tasks you complete in the first two sessions, \\~20 minutes) prior to these sessions.\n\nAfter completing the first set of 10 sessions, participants will return to the lab to complete one session (\\~75 minutes) of tasks similar to the first sessions. Participants who were not asked to complete the 20-minute sessions will come back to the lab about two weeks after the first two 75-minute sessions.\n\nAfter this 75-minute session, participants will be asked to come back to the lab after completing the second set of 20-minute sessions, or after about two weeks for those not asked to complete the 20-minute sessions of cognitive tasks.\n\nFinally, after a couple of weeks, participants will come back for two final testing sessions (\\~45 minutes each).\n\nThe total duration of the study will be around 8 hours if not asked to complete the twenty 20-minute sessions, or 15 hours if asked to complete these sessions. The whole experiment runs over the course of 4 to 8 weeks.\n\n\\*To maintain scientific integrity, certain details of this study will not be shared until all data has been collected."
