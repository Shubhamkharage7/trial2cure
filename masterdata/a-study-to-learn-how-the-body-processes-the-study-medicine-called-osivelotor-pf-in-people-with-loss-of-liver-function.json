A number of blood samples will be collected to understand how Osivelotor is changed and removed from the body. Participants will also have to undergo physical examination and other tests. This will help to understand if Osivelotor is safe.\n\nParticipants will take part in the study for a maximum of 112 days. During this time, participants will have to stay onsite for 5 days. There will be 5 study visits at the study clinic."
