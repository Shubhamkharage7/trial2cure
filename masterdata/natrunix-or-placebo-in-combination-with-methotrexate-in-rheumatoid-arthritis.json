All subjects will enter the study on stable MTX dose. Subjects will receive once weekly injection of Natrunix or placebo in addition to MTX for 12 weeks. The study will conclude after 13 weeks.\n\nStudy Duration is 17 weeks (4-week maximum screening + 12-week treatment period = 1-week follow-up.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the ACR 20 response rate in subjects receiving stable dose of MTX and after 12 weeks of treatment with either Natrunix or placebo. The study will also examine what impact the addition of Natrunix or placebo has on the scores of various rheumatological grading scales, including ACR 50, NRS-pain score, and 66/68-joint count, as well as safety. All subjects enrolled in the study will be taking concomitant methotrexate."

Patients must provide at least 7 consecutive days of NRS-pain data in the subjects diary prior to the baseline visit. The NRS pain diary should ideally be completed for the 7 days immediately prior to Visit 1 (when the first dose of test drug is administered). Subjects may record more than 7 days of pain records in the diary for their baseline. At least seven consecutive days of pain diary are necessary to be eligible for enrollment in the study.\n8. Peripheral blood CD19+ cell count recovery to \\>10 cells/uL or \\>1% of total lymphocyte count (Required only for subjects who have received a Rituximab (or anti-CD20 biosimilar) infusion within 12 months prior to enrollment).\n9. Female patients of childbearing potential must consent to undergo a serum pregnancy test at enrollment, and urine pregnancy tests at each visit after screening.

These methods can include but not limited to hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, condoms, diaphragms, etc.\n11. Males participating in this clinical research study should not get a sexual partner pregnant during their participation in this research study as the effect of the study drug on sperm is not known. Male contraception methods can include but are not limited to mechanical methods (e.g., abstinence, non-vaginal intercourse), contemporary methods comprising barrier methods (e.g., spermicide, condom, sponge, diaphragm and cervical cap) and vasectomy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients with ANY of the following will be excluded from the study:\n\n1. History of treatment with Natrunix for any reason.\n2. Any active, chronic, or recurrent infections. (e.g., ongoing bacterial, viral, or fungal infection).\n3. Comorbid severe psychiatric illness and/or complicated social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n4.

Patients must not have received any biological therapy including anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, abatacept, tocilizumab, sarilumab, and biosimilars within 8 weeks prior to randomization.\n6. Treatment with JAK inhibitors within 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to randomization.\n7. Investigational therapy administered within a time interval less than at least 5 half-lives of the investigational agent prior to the first scheduled day of dosing in this study.\n8. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients.\n9. Patients with current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, or a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within a year prior to Day 0.\n10. Uncontrolled heart disease, including NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, uncontrolled blood pressure (defined as \u2265 160/100 mm Hg), or unstable angina.\n11. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, including:\n\n    1. Hemoglobin \\<9.0 g/dL\n    2. White blood cell counts \\< 4000/mm3\n    3. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\<1500/mm3\n    4. Platelet count \\<100,000/mm3\n    5. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \\<500/mm3\n    6. eGFR \\<60 mL/min\n    7. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \\>1.5x lab upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    8. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) \\>1.5x lab upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    9. Bilirubin \\>1.5x lab upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    10. GGT: Natrunix does not put any load on the liver. GGT levels are not assessed to determine potential risk of hepatoxicity. Rather GGT levels are used as an additional screening measure to assess for occult hepatobiliary disease that may be missed with more common liver enzyme assays given the requirement for concurrent treatment with therapeutic methotrexate throughout the study. Small excursions from normal values are acceptable based on Physician/Sponsor judgment.\n12. Major surgery (including joint surgery) within 3 months of baseline.\n13. Patients who have suffered severe trauma or fracture within 4 weeks of baseline.\n14. Evidence of active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection.\n\n    1. Patients positive for HBsAg and/or positive for anti-HBc antibody (regardless of anti-HBs antibody status) are excluded.\n    2. Patients who are positive for Hepatitis C antibody and negative when the Hepatitis C RNA-PCR assay is performed on a subsequent sample will be eligible to participate. Patients who are positive for Hepatitis C antibody and have a positive result for the HCV when the Hepatitis C RNA-PCR assay is performed on the subsequent sample will not be eligible to participate.\n15. Any other concomitant disease, disorder, or condition that could interfere with the interpretation of study endpoints, or the patient's ability to participate in and complete the study., including but not limited to:\n\n    1. Coexisting diseases which are contraindicated for MTX treatment.\n    2. Cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or nervous system disorders that, in the opinion of the principal investigator and/or study medical monitor, make the patient not suitable for enrollment.\n    3. Concurrent autoimmune disease with the exception of Sjogren's syndrome secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.",
