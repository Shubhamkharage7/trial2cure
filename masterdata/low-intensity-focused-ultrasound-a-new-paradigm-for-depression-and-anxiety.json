            "briefSummary": "Objective: Preliminary studies show that low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), a new type of non invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), may be able to reach deep structures of the brain involved with depression and anxiety, that remain inaccessible using current forms of NIBS with precision. In this study, the investigators will test if this technique can be used to change brain activity in areas that are connected to depression and anxiety symptoms. The primary objectives of this study are to test the safety and tolerability of LIFU, evaluate the feasibility of using LIFU to reduce brain activity, and evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous fMRI-LIFU. If the results of this study are positive, what the investigators learn will serve as a strong foundation for the future development of innovative treatments for a variety of psychiatric disorders.\n\nResearch Procedures: 25 patient and 25 healthy veterans will be recruited. Visits will take place at the VA Providence Healthcare System. During some visits, healthy and patient participants may undergo clinical and research neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing, complete questionnaires, and participate in clinical/neurological assessments. Healthy veterans will not receive LIFU and will only attend 2 study visits. Patients are expected to attend up to 8 visits over 6 weeks. However, some may require up to 6 extended follow-ups after visits 5 or 8, in which case they would attend a total of 11 or 14 visits over 6 months. Two patient visits will include the LIFU application, following FDA safety guidelines. Patients will be assigned either to an experiment in which LIFU stimulation will be delivered immediately prior to a task or to an experiment in which stimulation will be delivered during the task. Within each experiment, patients will be assigned to first receive either LIFU stimulation to the study target or anatomical control. Study staff, but not participants will know which location is being targeted in case safety concerns arise. Safety assessments will be conducted at follow-up visits. A clinician will be available during LIFU administration /follow-up visits. Assuming no injury or other concerns are present, patients will then repeat this process again, receiving stimulation targeting other brain area not previously selected."
