            "briefSummary": "Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is associated with increased systemic inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated increased levels of cytokines such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) in patients with heart failure (HF). Increased activity of sympathetic nervous system in ADHF is linked to inflammation. Previous anti-inflammatory drug therapies in HF have demonstrated no significant impact on cardiovascular outcomes. Low-level vagus nerve stimulation (LLVNS) is a non-invasive way to modulate autonomic tone and thereby inflammation. Vagal nerve stimulation is thought to increase the parasympathetic activity and suppress the sympathetic activity. Clinical studies of vagal stimulation in chronic HF have been negative. Recent experimental and clinical data suggest that low level tragus nerve stimulation (LLTNS) may produce the same desired neuromodulator effect compared to LLVNS. It is however unknown if LLTNS in ADHF will directly lead to a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (CRP, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and an increase in the level of anti-inflammatory marker IL-10. heart rate variability may also be abnormal in ADHF. The objective of this proposal is to determine the impact of LLTS on inflammatory cytokines, heart failure biomarkers(Pro BNP) and HRV in patients with ADHF.In addition we will study the impact on dyspnea resolution and change in renal function during hospitalization.\n\nPatients will be randomized to either active or sham stimulation (2 hours daily). Serum collected will (post-admission and discharge day) will be used for cytokine measurement. We will also measure daily ECG to assess HRV and patient assessed dyspnea scale.This investigation will likely establish the first evidence of the effects of LLTS on the suppression of inflammation and improvement in dyspnea, natriuretic peptides, renal function and HRV in patients presenting with ADHF.",
