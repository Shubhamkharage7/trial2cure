            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial investigates the side effects of chemotherapy and cellular immunotherapy in treating children with IL13Ralpha2 positive brain tumors that have come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Cellular immunotherapy (IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells) are brain-tumor specific cells that may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Many patients with brain tumor respond to treatment, but then the tumor starts to grow again. Giving chemotherapy in combination with cellular immunotherapy may kill more tumor cells and improve the outcome of treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility and safety of lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by cellular immunotherapy utilizing IL13Ralpha2-specific hinge-optimized 41BB-co-stimulatory chimeric antigen receptor \\[CAR\\] truncated CD19-expressing autologous T-lymphocytes (IL13\\[EQ\\]BBzeta/CD19t+ Tn/mem cells) administered by intraventricular (ICV) delivery for pediatric participants with IL13Ralpha2+ recurrent/refractory brain tumors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe persistence and expansion of CAR T cells in peripheral blood (PB) and cerebrospinal (CSF).\n\nII. To describe cytokine levels (PB, and CSF) over the study period.\n\nIII. In research participants who receive the full schedule of 4 CAR T cell cycles:\n\nIIIa. To estimate 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate per disease. IIIb. To estimate disease response rates per disease. IIIc. To estimate 1-year overall survival rate per disease. IV. To evaluate the use of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) to evaluate tumor burden.\n\nV. For study participants who undergo an additional biopsy/resection or autopsy:\n\nVa. To evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the CAR T cells with respect to the infusion site. Vb. To evaluate IL13Ralpha2 antigen expression levels on tumor tissue pre and post CAR T cell therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells.\n\nPatients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -5 and -4, and fludarabine IV on days -5 to -2. Patients then receive autologous IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells intraventricularly over 5 minutes once a week (QW) on day 0. Treatment with autologous IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells repeats every 7 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional cycles of IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells as long as they continue to meet eligibility criteria and have doses available for infusion.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up at 30 days, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then yearly for 15 years."
