            "briefSummary": "Family caregivers of persons with dementia often experience chronic stress and insomnia, resulting in decreased mental and physical health. Accessibility of in-person stress reduction therapy is limited due to caregiver time constraints and distance from therapy sites. The goal of this study is to address gaps in the literature regarding smartphone delivery of Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to older adult caregivers. Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT) provides mindfulness and guided imagery tools to reduce stress, promote self and other understanding, and increase feelings of interconnectedness. This study aims to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with MIT (experimental condition) or without MIT (control condition) on caregivers' perceived stress (primary outcome), as well as develop digital phenotypes of participant behaviors that are associated with clinical/psychological outcomes. Hypotheses include the following: at the 8 week timepoint, caregivers receiving MIT+CS-App will exhibit superiority on psychological outcome measures relative to those receiving CS-App alone (perceived stress being the primary outcome), that overall app usage will mediate improvements in perceived stress, and that the beneficial effects of the MIT+CS-App will remain significant at the 24-week follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "According to the World Health Organization, more than 50 million people have Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related disorders (AD/ADRD), with most individuals receiving care from their family members. The stress and burden of caregiving negatively affects caregivers' mental health, with a high proportion reporting elevated levels of depression, insomnia, stress, poorer cognitive outcomes, and anxiety. To promote caregiver wellbeing, previous research has focused on providing skills for behavioral management of the person living with dementia, support and psychoeducational groups to help caregivers learn from each others' experiences, group cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness techniques, or combinations of these. A common limitation of most trials of group therapies for family caregivers is that delivery of the intervention occurs in person. In-person delivery requires participant travel, could necessitate costly substitute caregiving, necessitates large resources in terms of meeting space and personnel, and is less acceptable for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. In person groups thus suffer from a common drawback of scaling the intervention to assure widespread feasibility and dissemination.\n\nThis is a randomized, controlled trial of smartphone App delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT) to augment caregiver skills training. MIT is a \"second generation\" mindfulness therapy, which couples mindful practice to reduce emotional arousal with psychological principles designed to balance mentalizing. Mindfulness refers to non-judgmental, present focused attention and has been found to reduce depressive and anxious symptoms in community and clinical populations. In MIT, mindfulness is instantiated in gentle stretching and meditative exercises. Mentalizing refers to understanding the mental processes of self and others, and their links to observable behaviors within complex interpersonal situations. In MIT, guided imagery exercises consist of participants imagining their own and others' perspectives and reactions, and the connectedness between self and other. Pilot studies have utilized 4-week group MIT for family AD/ADRD caregivers and found promising benefits for alleviating psychological symptoms of caregiver depression and anxiety, increasing perceived mental well-being and relationship quality. Smartphone delivery of MIT has been shown to be acceptable for family dementia caregivers in a feasibility trial. By increasing mentalizing while providing caregiver skills, the experimental intervention could result in synergism that enables the caregiver to better implement caregiving skills in their unique interpersonal context."
