A secondary aim is to analyze the data to understand research questions relating to the natural history of SLSMDS.",

If available, retrospective clinical data may be accessed and used in analyses as well.\n\nThe PS-NHS will be conducted at two Center of Excellence sites: the Cleveland Clinic and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).\n\nAll PS-NHS data will be entered and stored on the CFR.
