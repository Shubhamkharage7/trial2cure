The study will consist of two portions or phases: 1) Dose Escalation with allowance for backfilling cohorts (up to 50 participants) followed by 2) Dose Expansion at the preliminary RP2DS in 1-2 disease specific cohorts of up to 29 participants each. The Dose Expansion portion of this study will begin after completion of the Dose Escalation portion. The purpose of the Dose Expansion portion of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of MT-601 at the dose determined to be safe in the Dose Escalation portion."
