Potential subjects who are on mechanical ventilation for at least four days and have failed at least one weaning attempt will be considered for the study. Those enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1 manner between the treatment group that is standard of care with the pdSTIM System and a Control group, which is standard of care alone.\n\nThe primary endpoints focus on time to weaning and serious adverse event rates between the Treatment and Control groups.",

Potential subjects who are on mechanical ventilation for \u2265 96 hours (4 days) and have failed at least one weaning attempt will be considered for the study.\n\nThose enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1 manner between a Treatment group that is standard of care with the pdSTIM System and a Control group that is standard of care only. For the Treatment group, stimulation therapy with pdSTIM will occur daily until the subject is successfully removed from mechanical ventilation or the 30-Day follow-up visit, whichever is sooner. All randomized subjects will be followed to 60 (\u00b1 7) days post randomization. Total subject participation will be no longer than 67 days."

Subject has been diagnosed and has been treated for neck cancer within the past 5 years or subject had any prior radiation treatment to the neck.\n7. Subject currently has hemodynamic instability due to any cause (e.g., severe sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, or septic shock) with vasopressor support \\> 0.1 mg/kg/min of norepinephrine or epinephrine, or equivalent, or is actively being titrated.\n8. Subject has a local infection at or around the proposed pdSTIM Lead insertion site.\n9. Subject is neutropenic or has signs of significant immunocompromise. (Subjects intubated for respiratory failure due to COVID-19 are not excluded unless other exclusion criteria apply).\n10. Subject has severe COPD as indicated by evidence of significant expiratory obstruction on the ventilator flow waveform or, where ventilator flow waveforms are not utilized, has a FEV1 \u2264 30%.\n11. Subject has pre-existing severe chronic pulmonary fibrosis.\n12. Subject has pleural effusion occupying greater than 1/3 of the pleural space on either side.\n13. Subject is currently on or expected to begin neuromuscular blockades.\n14. Subject is anticipating withdrawal of life support and/or shift to palliation as the goal of care with less than 6-months life expectancy.\n15. Subject is known or suspected to be pregnant or lactating.\n16. Subject is currently enrolled in or exited early from a) any investigational drug study or b) an investigational device study that may impact the ability to wean or is directly related to the lungs or diaphragm.",
