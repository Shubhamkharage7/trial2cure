            "detailedDescription": "Primary care clinic patients who screen positive for food insecurity between 2021-2023 will be eligible for this study (\\~200 patients). Patients will be recruited by one of four means: during standard clinic visits, or via phone, Electronic Medical Record message, or mail. Registry of patients will be de-identified and list of identifiers will be stored separately from the data set. Data will be stored on password protected computers only available to select research staff. Investigators will utilize a preamble in lieu of informed consent.\n\nThe primary outcome will be to measure the readiness of patients to adhere to a plant-based diet. Investigators will assess readiness using Food Neophobia inventory and will perform a brief Diet Inventory at simultaneous timepoints. Education surrounding benefits and easy ways to increase plant-based eating will be distributed to all participating patients. Enrollment in a local income-based subsidized Community Supported Agriculture share (weekly farm produce box during growing season) will be offered to all patients. Patients can opt into this service, and we will track which patients enroll. Before, during, and after the Community Sponsored Agriculture produce time period, Food Neophobia and Diet Inventory will be reassessed.\n\nAdherence to plant-based eating between the patients who received access to subsidized food and education versus those who received education alone will be evaluated. Qualitative open-ended feedback will be obtained at all time points.\n\nThe secondary outcomes are to measure weight loss, reduction in blood pressure, and improvement in hemoglobin A1C and lipid profile wherever applicable.\n\nStatistical significance is not attempting to be reached, but rather the associations between food neophobia and ability to change diet will be evaluated, as well as other qualitative open-ended feedback."
