            "briefSummary": "Limited ankle range of motion is associated with increased risk for ankle sprains, knee joint dysfunction and injury to the ACL. Therefore, it is important that researchers and clinicians understand the best treatment options to increase ankle range of motion for injury prevention. We are recruiting adults with limited ankle range of motion who are lacking current ankle injuries for a treatment investigation. All study procedures will occur on the campus of the University of South Carolina by a licensed Physical Therapist and experienced researcher.",
            "detailedDescription": "All participants will receive the MWM intervention with weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion measured prior to the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 24 hours (+/- 3 hours) following the intervention. The participant will first place their foot on a 16-inch box to assist in performance of the intervention by the therapist. A licensed physical therapist (PT) will then stabilize the talus for a proper joint mobilization to be performed. The therapist will then mobilize the distal tib/fib in the posterior to anterior direction at end range DF reached through a forward lunge, using a Mulligan's mobilization belt around the distal tibia-fibula. The participant will perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions of the forward lunge and the PT will perform a bout of overpressure at end range during each repetition. Two other investigators will be on either side of participant to assist with balance during the intervention if needed.\n\nWeight bearing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion will be measured via a primary and secondary measure. The primary measurement will be use of a bubble inclinometer and the secondary measurement will be the standing ankle dorsiflexion screen (SADS)."
