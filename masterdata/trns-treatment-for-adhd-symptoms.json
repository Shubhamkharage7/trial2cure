Moderate to severe ADHD as defined as having a minimum score of 12 on either the inattention subscale or the and hyperactivity-impulsivity subscale of the baseline ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score at baseline of greater than 4\n6. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) fluent in English, able to complete ADHD-RS scale and attend all study visits\n7. Has not taken any medication with central nervous system effects, including prescription medications for ADHD, within 7 days of enrollment, as determined by the investigator based on the subject's medical history from the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and, as applicable, medical and pharmacy records\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n1. Has a history of any medical or psychiatric disorder, disease, condition, injury, symptoms or circumstance that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, may: (1) reduce the subject's ability to fulfill the study requirements as per protocol; or (2) adversely impact the integrity of the data or the validity of the study results\n2. Primary DSM-5 axis-1 disorder other than ADHD, which consists of one or more of severe ODD, bipolar psychosis, major depressive disorder, severe oppositional defiant disorder that would pose adherence challenges by the investigator\n3. Substance abuse, that, in the opinion of the investigator, may: (1) reduce the participant's ability to fulfill the study requirements as per protocol; or (2) adversely impact the integrity of the data or the validity of the study results\n4. Impaired functioning to a degree that requires immediate initiation of ADHD medication in the opinion of the Investigator\n5. Known hypersensitivity to Polyamide or Elastomer\n6. Any suicide risk as assessed with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Pediatric (\u226411 years) Quick Screen)\n7. If female, began menstruation, based on a self- or parent(s)/legal guardian(s)-report\n8.
