            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blinded trial of self-acupressure to examine the effect of treatment on aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Acupressure is similar to acupuncture, but uses pressure rather than needles to stimulate specific points on the body. Acupressure involves applying mild to moderate physical pressure using your fingers, or an assistive device, to these points to try to bring about a physiological change in your body, in this case relief from joint pain and stiffness. The investigators will also examine effects of acupressure on other symptoms that commonly develop in AI-treated patients. In addition, changes in stool microbiome with acupressure treatment will be examined in an exploratory way to obtain preliminary information about the effect of acupressure on the gut microbiome in this condition."
