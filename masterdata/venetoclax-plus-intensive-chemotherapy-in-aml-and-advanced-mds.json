            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 1b, open-label study evaluating Venetoclax in combination with intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy in previously untreated, adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In Part 1, the dose escalation phase, the safety and tolerability of the combination with Venetoclax at different doses and duration will inform the appropriate dose(s) and regimen(s) for Part 2. In Part 2, the dose expansion phase, a maximum of 28 additional patients will be randomized 1:1 to the MTD determined in Part 1 and the starting dose (assuming the MTD is not the starting dose), to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study drug combination.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability and determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of daunorubicin \\& cytarabine chemotherapy plus Venetoclax for patients with AML\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess efficacy by response per 2022 ELN and revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria.\n\nII. To determine additional response parameters: CR/CRi and CR/CRh rates.\n\nIII. To determine time to response variables including overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR)\n\nDose Escalation Cohorts:\n\nA minimum of 3 patients will be treated in each cohort (dose level) sequentially in a 3+3 design. Patients will receive the Venetoclax plus daunorubicin/cytarabine combination as shown below\n\nPatients aged \u2264 60 years\n\nCohort 1A:\n\nDaunorubicin 60mg/m2 intravenously (IV) daily on days 2-4 Cytarabine 100mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-8 Venetoclax 100mg orally on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2, 400mg on Days 3-8\n\nCohort 2A:\n\nDaunorubicin 90mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-4 Cytarabine 100mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-8 Venetoclax 100mg orally on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2, 400mg on Days 3-8\n\nCohort 3A:\n\nDaunorubicin 60mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-4 Cytarabine 100mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-8 Venetoclax 100mg orally on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2, 400mg on Days 3-11\n\nCohort 4A:\n\nDaunorubicin 60mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-4 Cytarabine 100mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-8 Venetoclax 100mg orally on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2, 400mg on Days 3-14\n\nNote: No DLTs in induction phase have been observed and Cohort 3A has completed enrollment. However, the daunorubicin dose of 90mg/m2 will not be further studied due to recently reported results of no superiority over the dose of 60mg/m2.\n\nPatients \\>60 years\n\nCohort 1B:\n\nDaunorubicin 60mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-4 Cytarabine 100mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-8 Venetoclax 100mg orally on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2, 400mg on Days 3-8\n\nCohort 2B:\n\nDaunorubicin 60mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-4 Cytarabine 100mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-8 Venetoclax 100mg orally on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2, 400mg on Day 3-11\n\nCohort 3B:\n\nDaunorubicin 60mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-4 Cytarabine 100mg/m2 IV daily on Days 2-8 Venetoclax 100mg orally on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2, 400mg on Days 3-14\n\nExpansion Cohort(s):\n\nA maximum of 28 additional patients aged \u2264 60 years and 28 patients \\>60 years will be randomized (1:1) to the MTD the starting dose (assuming the MTD is not the starting dose), to further evaluate safety and efficacy of the study drug combination and identify the optimal phase 2 dose.\n\nConsolidation Phase:\n\nPatients who achieve CRc post induction will proceed to consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine in combination with escalating doses of Venetoclax. The 3+3 algorithm will be applied for dose escalation/de-escalation of Venetoclax in combination with Cytarabine. As of February 2023, there have been 2/6 hematologic DLTs in consolidation cohort 1B, therefore we will no longer give Venetoclax in combination with high-dose cytarabine during the consolidation phase, in pts \\>60 yrs of age. We will also not explore dose escalation of Venetoclax during consolidation in the 60-year-old or younger age-group before RP2D of induction is determined. All subjects \u2264 60yrs will be treated at the consolidation Cohort 1A dose.\n\nPatients \u2264 60 years\n\nConsolidation cohort 1A:\n\nCytarabine 1.5gr/m2 every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, 5 Venetoclax 200mg on Days 1-7\n\nPatients \\>60 years\n\nConsolidation cohort 1B:\n\nCytarabine 1gr/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, 5\n\nA minimum of 3 patients will be treated in each cohort (dose level) sequentially in a 3+3 design. Additional 3 subjects may be backfilled to lower dose levels so that each cohort will reach a total of 6 subjects. Once the MTD is reached, a maximum of 28 additional patients will be randomized 1:1 to the MTD or a dose level below the MTD the starting dose (assuming the MTD is not the starting dose) for a total of up to 20 patients (6 from Part 1, 20 from Part 2) treated at each of those dose levels. A maximum of 52 patients (including backfill and expansion cohorts) 60 years or younger and 46 patients older than 60 years may be enrolled in this Phase 1b study."
