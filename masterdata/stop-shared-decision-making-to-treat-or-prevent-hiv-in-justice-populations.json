A standardized Patient Navigation (PN) arm will be compared with a shared decision-making model in the form of Patient Choice (PC) through the offer of a menu of existing community-based health service delivery options. This design will offer providers, correctional and public health authorities, payers and policy makers' timely and relevant data to assess the effectiveness of Patient Navigation and Patient Choice models of care as potentially useful re-entry and relapse prevention treatment options.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be done in two phases. Phase 1 the R61 portion of the project will be a Pilot Study, and Phase 2 the R33 portion of the project will be a Randomized Controlled Trail informed by the pilot.\n\nThe focus of this registration is the pilot study. In Year 1 (R61; Aim 1) the intervention of the patient choice menu of options of PrEP/ART and SUD treatment services for justice involved people who use drugs (PWUD) to supplement established peer navigation (PN +PC) will be developed and pilot tested in Western Connecticut only (Fairfield, Litchfield, Southern New Haven Counties).\n\nImplementation procedures for this study include needs assessment survey and focus groups consisting of CAB members and PNs to assess the types of services available in their community, as well as gaps in services and ideas of how services can be improved. These needs assessment surveys and focus groups will occur 3 times throughout the study."
