If eligible, they will be scheduled for out-patient surgery to implant the IMT during routine cataract surgery. Following implantation, patients will return for 5 post-operative follow-up visits over a period of approximately 12 months. Additionally, patients will have up to 12 rehabilitation/training visits with a low vision specialist"
