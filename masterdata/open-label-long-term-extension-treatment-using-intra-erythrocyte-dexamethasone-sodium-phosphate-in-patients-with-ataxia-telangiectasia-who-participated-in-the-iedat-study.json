The study aims to collect information on the long-term safety and efficacy of the trial treatment. Patients meeting all selection criteria will receive monthly infusions of EDS-EP (dose range of \\~14-22 mg DSP/infusion). If this dose of EDS-EP is not tolerated, the patient should be discontinued from the study. During the study, long-term efficacy assessments will be performed every 6 months, while safety parameters will be assessed at each monthly visit.\n\nThe ICARS, EQ-5D-5L and the CGI-C/S will be administered by a site rater. All patients enrolled in this study will have participated in Study IEDAT-02-2015, and there will be no de novo enrollment of new patients.\n\nThe Principal Investigator will ask all patients who meet the above requirements, and determine their interest in continuing to receive treatment with the study medication in a new protocol. The Principal Investigator will then determine the eligibility of the patients on the basis of his/her clinical judgement of patients' status and their safety."
