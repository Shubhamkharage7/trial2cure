All types of AF including paroxysmal, persistent and long standing persistent may be included.\n\nThe registry has three cohorts: 1) Acute Arm, 2) Symptomatic Monitoring Only Arm, and 3) Full Monitoring Arm. In the Acute Arm, patient assessments will occur at pre- procedure and procedure visits. In both the Symptomatic Monitoring Only Arm and the Full Monitoring Arm, patient assessments will occur at pre- procedure, procedure, 3 months, and 1 year post ablation. Additionally, the Full Monitoring Arm will assess for asymptomatic recurrence at 6- and 12-months post-ablation.\n\nSites will be assigned to an arm in which they will enroll under based on their practices current Standard of Care. Sites can only participate in one arm.\n\nThe primary purpose of the registry is to assess clinical outcomes, including procedural efficiency, safety, and long-term effectiveness of pulsed field ablation (PFA) in the treatment of patients with AF. Also, to assess the effect of PFA technology implementation on practice patterns, operational workflow and operator experience.\n\nThe registry will utilize real world clinical data obtained from the use of commercially available technologies under the authority of a health care practitioner within a legitimate practitioner-patient relationship."
