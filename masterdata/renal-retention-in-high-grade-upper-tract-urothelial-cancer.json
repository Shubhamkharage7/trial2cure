            "briefSummary": "This trial will evaluate the use of combination pembrolizumab and enfortumab vedotin for patients with high grade non-metastatic (cN0/NxMx, no measurable regional lymph nodes, no metastases) upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC), preferring to forego standard of care radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) surgery. Currently these patients would not be suitable candidates for neoadjuvant trials, as the patients intention is to forego surgery. The patients are also not candidates for metastatic trials, as the patients have no measurable metastasis. The Investigators hypothesize the combination of pembrolizumab and enfortumab vedotin for patients with high grade cN0/NxMx UTUC deferring RNU will lead to event free survival outcomes similar to that achieved by RNU in a historic dataset.",
            "detailedDescription": "This single arm phase II trial will evaluate the use of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolozumab for high grade upper tract urothelial cancer patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo standard of care nephroureterectomy.\n\nEnfortumab vedotin IV 1.25 mg/kg days 1,8 and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV will be delivered every 21 days in 20 patients with high grade UTUC cT2-T4N0 (non-metastatic) until disease progression outside of the renal/ureter unit and/or intolerance.\n\nPrimary objective is event free survival (EFS), defined as the time to systemic relapse or death. The hypothesis is that the combination of pembrolizumab and enfortumab vedotin for patients with high grade non-metastatic UTUC deferring nephroureterectomy will lead to EFS outcomes similar to that achieved by RNU in historical dataset from the Brady Urologic Institute database (based on a subset of 85 patients with high grade UTUC cT2-T4N0 who underwent surgery without perioperative chemotherapy)."

Subjects who have received a prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplant.\n\n    Subjects who have received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to treatment initiation. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n\n    Note: Any licensed COVID-19 vaccine (including for Emergency Use) in a particular country is allowed in the study as long as they are mRNA vaccines, adenoviral vaccines, or inactivated vaccines. These vaccines will be treated just as any other concomitant therapy. Investigational vaccines (i.e., those not licensed or approved for Emergency Use) are not allowed.\n23. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n24. Subjects with active tuberculosis\n25. Subjects with another underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair the ability of the subject to receive or tolerate the planned treatment and follow-up; any known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperating with the requirements of the study.",
