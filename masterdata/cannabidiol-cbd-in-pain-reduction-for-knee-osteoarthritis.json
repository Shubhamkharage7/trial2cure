            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see if cannabidiol (CBD) orally dissolving tablets (ODTs) can lessen pain, improve function, and improve patient satisfaction in cases of knee osteoarthritis. CBD comes from the cannabis plant and is non-psychoactive (i.e. does not produce a 'high' or altered mental state) as compared to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), another compound found in cannabis. Researchers are studying different forms of CBD for potential use in treating pain, inflammation, and illnesses.",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The study is comparing pain, outcomes, and patient satisfaction in two cohorts: patients with knee OA undergoing physiotherapy/home exercises who receive CBD and a placebo group with PT/home exercise program. Patients will be asked on treatment Day 1, 2, 7, and 14, 28, 42, and 84 to rate their pain according to the VAS scale. Additionally, patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes will be measured."
