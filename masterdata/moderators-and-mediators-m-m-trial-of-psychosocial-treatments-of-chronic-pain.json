            "briefSummary": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CP) is a major public health concern. Psychosocial treatments have been shown to be efficacious when compared to largely inert control conditions, but they are characterized by modest effects on primary outcomes. One strategy to boost efficacy is to increase our understanding of treatment mediators. Studies of mediators that directly compare different treatments with each other are needed to determine which mediators are treatment-specific, which are shared across treatments, and which contribute the most to clinical outcomes. Another strategy is to identify the patient characteristics that moderate treatment responses. Research is needed that is guided by theoretical models and that tests moderators across multiple treatments. Identifying subgroups of patients more likely to respond to one or another treatment can advance precision medicine by informing a priori patient-treatment matches that can optimize treatment effects. To accomplish these goals, the authors will conduct a randomized clinical trial to compare the mediators and moderators of the clinical effects of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) on adults with chronic spinal (axial) pain. Following baseline assessment of outcome variables as well as potential mediators and moderators, 460 participants will be randomized to CBT, ACT, EAET, or treatment-as-usual control (TAU). The three treatments will be conducted as individual therapy provided weekly for 8 weeks via telehealth. The researchers will conduct weekly assessments of both potential mediators and outcomes, as well as post-treatment and 6-month follow-up assessments. The goal of the study is to identify the most powerful treatment mechanisms - specific and shared -- and reveal for whom the mediator-outcome pathways are strongest.This project can increase the effects of our psychosocial chronic pain treatments by identifying the most effective treatment mechanisms and by informing patient-treatment matches that can optimize treatment effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CP) is a major public health concern. A number of psychosocial treatments have emerged in recent decades to help address this problem. These interventions have been shown to be efficacious when compared to largely inert control conditions; however, recent meta-analyses indicate that most of these treatments are characterized by modest effects on primary outcomes. This is a critical shortcoming of these otherwise promising approaches. Rather than attempting to boost efficacy only by developing new and hopefully more powerful interventions, we can also look within our already proven treatments for ways to enhance the magnitude of treatment effects. One strategy is to increase our understanding of treatment mediators. Studies of mediators that directly compare different treatments with each other are needed to determine which mediators are treatment-specific, which are shared across treatments, and which contribute the most to clinical outcomes. The findings from such research could be used to inform adaptations to existing treatment that enhance their benefits. A second strategy for increasing the beneficial effects of existing treatments is to identify the patient characteristics that moderate treatment responses. Research is needed that is guided by theoretical models and that tests moderators across multiple treatments. Identifying subgroups of patients more likely to respond to one or another treatment can advance precision medicine by informing a priori patient-treatment matches that can optimize treatment effects. To accomplish these goals, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial to compare the mediators and moderators of the clinical effects of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) on adults with chronic spinal (axial) pain. Following baseline assessment of outcome variables as well as potential mediators and moderators we will randomize 460 participants to CBT, ACT, EAET, or treatment-as-usual control (TAU). The three treatments will be conducted as individual therapy provided weekly for 8 weeks via telehealth. We will conduct weekly assessments of both potential mediators and outcomes, as well as post-treatment and 6-month follow-up assessments. In addition to comparing the three treatments to each other (and TAU) for overall efficacy, we focus on two specific aims: Aim 1 is to identify mediators that are specific to treatments and those that are shared across treatments. Aim 2 is to identify baseline moderators of specific treatments and general predictors across treatments. This project can increase the effects of our psychosocial chronic pain treatments by identifying the most powerful treatment mechanisms - specific and shared -- and revealing for whom the mediator-outcome pathways are strongest. Via increased understanding of mediator and moderators, more effective pain treatment approaches can be developed, tested, and implemented."
