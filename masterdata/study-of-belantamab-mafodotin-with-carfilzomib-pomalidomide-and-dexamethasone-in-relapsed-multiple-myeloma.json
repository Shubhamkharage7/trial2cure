Evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, including clinically significant ECG abnormalities such as 2nd degree (Mobitz Type II) or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association functional classification system\n    4. Uncontrolled hypertension.\n14. Subject must not have known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncratic reactions to belantamab mafodotin or drugs chemically related to belantamab mafodotin, or any of the components of the study treatment.\n15.

Subject must not have positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C Ribonucleic acid test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment unless the subject can meet the following criteria:\n\n(1) Hepatitis C Ribonucleic acid test is negative (2) Receives successful anti-viral treatment (typically 8 weeks) followed by a negative nucleocapsid ribonucleic acid test after a washout period of at least 4 weeks.\n\nNote: Subjects with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C test is obtained.\n\n19. Subject must not have invasive malignancies other than disease under study, unless the second malignancy has been medically stable for at least 2 years and, in the opinion of the principal investigators, will not affect the evaluation of the effects of clinical trial treatments on the currently targeted malignancy.
