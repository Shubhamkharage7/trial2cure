Answer research questions using data collected from people with blood cancers. Such research involves analyses of subject profile information completed by subjects and medical records data.\n2. Obtain permission from LLS National Research Registry research subjects to have Ciitizen, a third-party engaged by LLS, act as their proxy to retrieve full medical record data including images at no cost to research subjects. Note: Patient can choose to upload their medical records into their account, directly.\n3. Obtain permission from LLS National Research Registry research subjects to share summary data with research partners (like academic researchers, advocacy groups, and pharmaceutical companies) that are advancing treatments for blood cancer. \"Summary data\" represents the important elements of medical record data, coded for research use, with personal identifiers like name, address, and phone number removed.\n4. Obtain permission from LLS National Research Registry research subjects to be contacted from time to time, for them to provide updated medical information."
