Per current recommendations, usual care will be enhanced in both groups with self-care education materials. At baseline, 3 months (end of treatment), and 9 months since baseline participants will undergo comprehensive assessments of cognitive function, psycho-behavioral factors, cardiac vagal control, and HF biomarkers.\n\nThis study has the following objectives:\n\n1. To study the role of MT in improving cognitive function and HF self-care in patients with co-morbid HF and MCI. We hypothesize: 1a) Cognitive function will improve in MT vs. EUC at end of treatment (3 months); 1b) Improvements in cognitive function at end of treatment will mediate effects on self-care and HF biomarkers at follow-up (9 months since baseline).\n2. To study the role of MT in improving interoceptive awareness and HF self-care in patients with co-morbid HF and MCI. We hypothesize: 2a) Interoceptive awareness will improve in MT vs. EUC at 3 months, and 2b) Changes in interoceptive awareness at end of treatment will mediate improvements in self-care and HF biomarkers at 9 months follow-up.\n3. To study the mechanistic pathway linking MT, vagal control and cognitive function. We hypothesize: 3a) Vagal control will improve in MT vs. EUC at end of treatment (3 months); 3b) Changes in vagal control will mediate improvements in cognitive performance at 9 months of follow-up."
