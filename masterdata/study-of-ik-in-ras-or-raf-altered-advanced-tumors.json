Backfilling includes, but is not limited to, patients with the following diagnoses: neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog-mutant (NRASmut) colorectal carcinoma (CRC), NRASmut malignant melanoma , Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog-mutant (KRASmut) CRC, KRASmut pancreatic cancer, KRASmut non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase-mutant (BRAFmut) Class II/III or BRAF fusion positive solid tumors, and Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase-mutant (CRAFmut) or fusion positive solid tumors.\n\nVarious dose levels and schedules will be explored."
