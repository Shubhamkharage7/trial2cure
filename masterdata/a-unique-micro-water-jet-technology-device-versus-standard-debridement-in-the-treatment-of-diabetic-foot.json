            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess performance of the Medaxis Debritom+\u2122 and to collect subject outcome data in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) vs Standard sharp debridement.",
            "detailedDescription": "The economic burden of DFUs costs the United States over $50 billion each year. The cost to treat one subject with DFUs ranges from $11,700 to $16,883. Although approximately 70% of DFUs are shown to heal with good SOC, at least 30% become chronic wounds. These non-healing wounds are at greater risk for infection and lower extremity amputation. Consequently, good standard of care therapy is important for subjects with chronic DFUs to improve subject outcomes, lower treatment costs and reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThe removal of necrotic tissue such as slough, eschar, and underlying biofilm constitutes one of the most important parts of standard of care (SOC). Currently, a variety of techniques are used to debride chronic wounds, such as larval therapy, autolytic and enzymatic methods, monofilament polyester fiber pads or brushes, and mechanical debridement with curettes and scalpels. It has also been demonstrated that more frequent debridement, on average, results in faster wound healing. While regarded as the \"gold standard,\" sharp debridement requires considerable experience of clinicians to ensure that contaminated and devitalized tissue is entirely removed without extensively damaging surrounding healthy tissue. Moreover, a recent research has demonstrated that even when surgical debridement is well-conducted so that it removes the majority of biofilm, within 72 hours, biofilm often re-establishes itself. Given that perhaps 60% of chronic wounds have been found to harbor biofilm, it is challenging to keep such wounds free of biofilm so that the wound-healing process can be sustained. Consequently, any method that could potentially remove more biofilm and/or prevent its recurrence could improve the wound healing trajectory.\n\nMedaxis Debritom+\u2122 cleans and stimulates acute and chronic wounds precisely in a tissue-preserving manner. Its high-pressure micro fluid jet removes slough such as fibrin, necrosis or biofilm, as well as foreign bodies, in effect providing an efficient irrigation and debridement of contaminated wounds. The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess performance of Medaxis Debritom+\u2122 and to collect subject outcome data in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) vs Standard sharp debridement.\n\nThere are two arms in the study:\n\nArm 1: The Experimental Arm , that will include SOC Therapy. SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting \\[TCC\\] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM), use of the Medaxis Debritom+\u2122 micro jet to clean the wound followed by a wound care covering ( Fibracol dressing or equivalent) along with a moisture retention dressing and a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compression wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).\n\nArm 2: The Standard of Care Arm. The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting \\[TCC\\] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM), appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, followed by a wound care covering (Fibracol dressing or equivalent) along with a moisture retention dressing and a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compression wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent)."

As an alternative arterial Doppler ultrasound can be performed evaluating for biphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the level of the ankle within 3 months of SV1.\n* The index ulcer has been offloaded for at least 14 days prior to randomization.\n* Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception (birth control pills, IUD's, barriers or abstinence) during the course of the study and undergo pregnancy tests.\n* Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply - with weekly visits.\n* Subjects must have read and signed the IRB approved ICF before screening procedures are undertaken.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* The index ulcer is deemed by the investigator to be caused by a medical condition other than diabetes.\n* The index ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer or has a positive carcinoma diagnosis.\n* Subjects with a history of more than two weeks of treatment with immune-suppressants (including systemic corticosteroids \\>10mg daily dose), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or application of topical steroids to the ulcer surface within 1-month prior to first SV1, or who receive such medications during the screening period or who are anticipated to require such medications during the course of the study.\n* Subjects taking a selective COX-2 inhibitor, such as Celecoxib, for any condition.\n* Subjects on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days preceding SV1.\n* History of radiation at the ulcer site (regardless of time since last radiation treatment).\n* Index ulcer has been previously treated or will need to be treated with any prohibited therapies. (See Section 6.2.4 of this protocol for a list of prohibited medications and therapies).\n* Subjects with a previous diagnose of HIV, Hepatitis C, or other contagious diseases\n* Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to complete this study or the subject has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.\n* Osteomyelitis or bone infection of the affected foot as verified by x-ray, CAT Scan, or MRI within 30 days prior to randomization. (In the event of an ambiguous diagnosis, the Principal Investigator will make the final decision).\n* Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Presence of diabetes with poor metabolic control as documented with an HbA1c \\> 12.0 within 90 days of randomization.\n* Subjects with end stage renal disease as evidenced by a serum creatinine \u2265 3.0 mg/dL within 6 months of randomization.\n* Index ulcer has reduced in area by 20% or more after 14 days of SOC from SV1 to the TV1/randomization visit.",
