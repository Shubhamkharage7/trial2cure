The results from this study will potentially help to support future recommendations and dietary guidance for infant feeding practices.\n\nThe three primary aims include:\n\nAim 1. Identify the impact of dietary patterns with different protein-rich foods on infant growth.\n\nAim 2. Identify the impact of dietary patterns with different protein-rich foods on infant gut microbiota development.\n\nAim 3. Identify gut microbial taxa and genes that affect infant growth.",
