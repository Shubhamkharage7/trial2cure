The main question it aims to answer is: Does a modified culture reporting intervention reduce unnecessary antibiotics for ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)? Researchers will compare antibiotic use outcomes between eligible patients whose test results are communicated using the modified reporting and those with standard reporting of results.",

A research physician will evaluate likelihood of pneumonia using a standard clinical algorithm, within 24 hours of the order Mon-Fri. If pneumonia criteria are not met AND there is growth of organism(s) (except normal respiratory flora), during the intervention period, the culture report will be modified to reflect the likelihood of asymptomatic colonization instead of reporting bacterial identification.
