            "briefSummary": "Currently there is limited evidence of benefit for the addition of steroids to occipital nerve blocks for treatment of headache, and not all steroids have been explored. The purpose of this research is to learn more about whether the addition of a specific kind of steroid (dexamethasone) provides any additional benefit to nerve blocks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients who are referred by their neurology provider for occipital nerve block as treatment of headache according to current accepted standard of care will be considered for this study. Baseline data will be obtained from the patients prior to proceeding with their nerve block and their headache diagnosis will be recorded based on electronic medical record review. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, anesthetic with dexamethasone or anesthetic without dexamethasone. The injectate will be the same color and amount of solution for each trial arm. Thus, the neurology provider performing the injection remains blinded and the patient remains blinded.\n\nInjection sites will be inspected to ensure no active bleeding, infection, cranial bone or cervical spine defects/prior surgeries that prohibit safe use of landmark-based technique. A neurologist who is experienced at performing nerve blocks will administer the injections to the bilateral greater and lesser occipital nerves using the landmark-based technique. The occipital protuberance and mastoid process are palpated, with the location of the greater occipital nerve at approximately 1/3 the distance laterally and the lesser occipital nerve at approximately 2/3 the distance laterally along the nuchal ridge for a total of 4 injection sites.\n\nPatients will be observed for approximately 10 minutes after the procedure to monitor for any immediate adverse effects and to ensure that anesthesia in the distribution of the injected nerves was achieved. Then, they will be instructed to keep a headache diary after treatment and will be provided a written example diary. A study staff who remains blinded to the patient's trial arm (but not necessarily the neurology provider who performed the injection) will contact the patients via telephone at 1, 2 and 4 weeks to assess response to treatment."
