            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to learn about of the research study drug, telomelysin (OBP-301), in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. The main question it aims to answer is whether this combination is safe and effective in this type of cancer.\n\nParticipants will receive 5 injections of OBP-301, approximately every 2 weeks. OBP-301 will be injected directly into the tumor during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). At the same time as the injection, a tumor biopsy will be taken. Participants will also receive pembrolizumab infusions every 6 weeks until disease progression or for a maximum of two years. Pembrolizumab infusions will occur on different days than OBP-301 injections.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II study of suratadenoturev (OBP-301) with pembrolizumab in advanced or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma that has progressed on at least 1 line of prior therapy for advanced disease. Patients must have received prior immunotherapy (anti PD-1 therapy). This study will examine the addition of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab patients who are refractory to first line immunotherapy.\n\nPatients will undergo intra-tumoral injection of OBP-301 followed 2-4 days later by the administration of pembrolizumab. The OBP-301 injection will then be repeated every two weeks for 4 planned treatments, and up to one additional optional treatment. Pembrolizumab will be administered every 6 weeks until disease progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint is objective response rate, with the target response rate of 20%, to examine the hypothesis that OBP-301 can overcome checkpoint resistance. The expected response to continuing anti-PD-1 therapy in this patient population would anticipated to be \\<5%. As a key secondary endpoint, the investigators will also examine duration of response and progression free survival. In a previous trial of OBP-301 and pembrolizumab in the third line setting, two patients who had a partial response are now off therapy and without evidence of disease, with a duration of response 33+ months and 20+ months. The third patient with a partial response has been on therapy for 15+ months.\n\nThis trial utilizes a Simon's two-stage Minimax design. In the first stage of the trial, 13 patients will be accrued. If there are 0 responses in these 13 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 14 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 27 patients."
