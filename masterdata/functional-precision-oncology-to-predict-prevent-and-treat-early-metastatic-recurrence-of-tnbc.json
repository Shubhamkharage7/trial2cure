In TOWARDS-II, the investigators will develop patient derived models (PDMs), comprising patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids (PDO and PDxO), from patients newly diagnosed with local or locally advanced hormone receptor-low/Her2 negative or triple negative breast cancer. The investigators will prospectively evaluate the correlation between PDX engraftment with recurrence. Using PDMs, the investigators will perform genomic studies and functional drug screens (FPO). Upon disease recurrence, the investigators will return the results to the physician with the intent to inform treatment selection."
