Participants will be randomized into an intervention or a control group. The control arm will receive standard Life's Essential 8 cardiovascular health educational materials. The intervention arm will additionally receive a multi-component intervention aimed at improving sleep health based on evidence-based sleep hygiene education and established behavior change techniques that include personalized sleep health feedback, goal setting and establishing a sleep health plan, coaching, self-monitoring, and addressing light and noise in the sleep environment. Mixed methods will be used to understand implementation determinants, processes, and outcomes, ensuring the successful completion and future expansion of this intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "Improving multiple domains of cardiometabolic health through contextual behavioral interventions can have far-reaching effects for reducing the disparate burden of multiple cardiometabolic morbidities in the Hispanic/Latina/o/x population. Despite a strong evidence base supporting the role of sleep as a major contributor to cardiometabolic health preservation, most lifestyle interventions have targeted diet or physical activity and not sleep. Sleep is amenable to intervention and can improve cardiometabolic health through complementary or synergistic biologic pathways with other lifestyle factors. Sleep health inequities have been shown to account for a large portion of racial and ethnic disparities in cardiometabolic risk. Therefore, culturally adapted sleep health interventions may elucidate scalable and sustainable contextual behavioral approaches to improve cardiometabolic health and extend healthspan."
