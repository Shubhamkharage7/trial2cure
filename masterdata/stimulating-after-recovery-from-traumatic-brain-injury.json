Each participant will be randomized into the block design of sham or tACS/tnVNS during the first three appointments or the last three appointments. While participating, both the tACS and tnVNS will be applied in accordance with the manufacturer's suggested use. Participants will complete computer-based tasks, while taking part in either the sham or tACS/tnVNS stimulation.

The N-back phase of the task allows calculation of cognitive performance of a working memory task. During valuation, participants receive titrating offers of differing amounts of money to perform different difficulty levels of the N-back. The result is an effort discounting curve used to measure the individual effort cost. Effort discounting curves show the perceived cognitive effort required to complete each level of the task relative to another (typically the 1-back).",
