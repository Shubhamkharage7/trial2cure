As such the combination with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan) and Bevacizumab will be evaluated in participants with colorectal cancer, to establish the M9466 maximum tolerated dose if observed and the recommended dose for expansion.\n\nStudy Duration: After a Screening period of up to 28 days, enrolled participants will remain in the study until they have completed all the study visits or until they withdraw consent, are lost to follow-up, or die.\n\nVisit Frequency: The participants will come for a Screening Visit and 1 to 2 visits per treatment cycle. After end of study intervention period, the participants will come for an End of Treatment Visit and a Safety Follow-up Visit."

Prior use of irinotecan is permitted; Either an anti- epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) or an anti- Vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent (not applicable if oxaliplatin was administered in the adjuvant setting); An immune checkpoint inhibitor for participants with known MSI-H status; Cetuximab and encorafenib \u00b1 binimetinib, if locally available, for participants with BRAF V600E mutations. Participants may have received maximally 1 previous regimen for the treatment of metastatic disease (with the exception of participants with MSI-H disease or BRAF positive disease who are allowed to have had up to 2 previous lines of treatment)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) less than or equal to (\\<=) 1\n* Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Persistence of AEs related to any prior treatments that have not recovered to Grade \\<= 1 by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0) unless AEs are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy in the opinion of the Investigator (for example \\[e.g.\\] neuropathy or alopecia)\n* Participant has a history of malignancy within 3 years before the date of enrollment (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, benign prostate neoplasm/hypertrophy, or malignancy that in the opinion of the Investigator, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 3 years). Participants with history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are excluded, irrespective of timeframe\n* Participant with known polymorphisms in UGT1A1, DPYD or other enzymes known to predict for increased toxicity from irinotecan or 5 fluorouracil (5-FU) should be excluded; if status is unknown testing is not mandated, unless required by local guidance. Participants that discontinued prior 5-FU treatment due to toxicity are also excluded\n* Participants with known brain metastases, except if clinically controlled, which is defined as individuals with central nervous system (CNS) tumors that have been treated and are asymptomatic, and who have discontinued steroids (for the treatment of CNS tumors) for \\> 28 days prior to first dose of study intervention\n* Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply",
