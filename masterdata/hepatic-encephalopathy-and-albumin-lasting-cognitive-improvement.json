            "briefSummary": "Hypothesis: Improvement in cognitive dysfunction with IV albumin in patients with cirrhosis with prior HE and MHE lasts for several weeks after albumin infusion has ended, and is due to persistent improvement in inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, albumin function and gut microbial changes.\n\nThis will be a single-arm, single-blind sequential trial of IV 25% albumin and IV saline over 8 weeks with biological sampling and cognitive and health related quality of life (HRQOL) testing with each subject acting as their own control.",
            "detailedDescription": "In outpatients with cirrhosis with prior HE who have cognitive impairment despite adequate therapy, how long the impact of albumin lasts and through which potential mechanism(s) needs to be determined.\n\nA prior recent HEAL trial showed that patients with prior HE and current minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) randomized to albumin experienced significant improvement in cognitive dysfunction and psychosocial quality of life. Moreover, these improvements persisted a week after the last albumin infusion, which was not seen in the placebo group. This was accompanied by an improvement in endothelial dysfunction, ischemia-modified albumin levels and inflammatory markers that persisted one week even after albumin discontinuation. The reported half-life of IV albumin is 2 weeks, but the function and the length of time of albumin's action in decompensated cirrhosis is lower, and further details surrounding albumin pharmacokinetics in this population remain unelucidated. The mechanisms and length of time albumin's potential improvement for patients with MHE after treatment discontinuation also require continued study.\n\nStudy design:\n\nThis will be a single-arm, single-blind sequential trial of IV 25% albumin and IV saline over 8 weeks with biological sampling and cognitive and health related quality of life (HRQOL) testing with each subject acting as their own control.\n\nTh order of the albumin and placebo infusion and blind the infusions from the subjects and the assessors of the outcomes will be changed."
