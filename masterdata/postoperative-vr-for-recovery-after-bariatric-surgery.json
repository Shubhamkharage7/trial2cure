The objective is to investigate whether the use of virtual reality (VR) during the immediate postoperative period could improve patient reported quality of recovery and potentially reduce opioid analgesic requirements as compared to an existing ERAS protocol.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that immersive VR will improve subjective quality of recovery scores at time of Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) discharge as compared to standard ERAS."
