The investigators hope to understand whether such a test may allow future patients to avoid resection entirely."

Patients with intracranial pathologic confirmation of a malignancy which originated extracranially but for which extracranial disease has not been biopsied are eligible.\n* Participants must have an enlarging lesion in the brain at least 4 months after prior stereotactic radiation to the same site for which neurosurgical resection is planned as routine standard of care.\n* Participants must be age 18 years or older.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo study procedures.\n* The effects of gadolinium / other MRI-based contrast agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Participants must possess the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have a contraindication to MRI (e.g. non compatible implanted metallic device for which MRI is absolutely contraindicated).\n* Participants who have chronic kidney disease stage IV-V or end stage renal disease.\n* Participants with a history of anaphylactic reactions to gadolinium.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gadolinium-based agents have not been proven to be safe to administer to a developing fetus.
