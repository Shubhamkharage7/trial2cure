Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n8. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of Nivolumab. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for \\> 1 year.\n9. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n\nSubject Exclusion Criteria:\n\nThe subject must be excluded from the trial if the subject:\n\n1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy with potential anti-neoplastic activity or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy with potential anti-neoplastic activity within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n2. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n3. Hypersensitivity to nivolumab or any of its excipients.\n4. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., \u2264 Grade 2 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n5. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., \u2264 Grade 2 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.\n6. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment other than adjuvant hormonal therapy. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer.\n7. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n8. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n9. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n10. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of treatment with pembrolizumab, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n12. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.\n\nNote: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist\u00ae) are live",
