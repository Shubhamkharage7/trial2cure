Subjects will be identified by the University of Rochester urologists and urogynecologists participating in the study who currently oversee stress incontinence care.

            "detailedDescription": "This will be a double-blind randomized control trial in women with stress urinary incontinence who are undergoing outpatient transurethral bulking procedures. These subjects will be identified by the University of Rochester urologists and urogynecologists participating in the study, who oversee the patient's stress urinary incontinence management. The subjects will be asked to participate in this research project when the doctor is offering options for their SUI treatment.\n\nSubjects will be randomized into two groups. One group will undergo transurethral bulking with TENS for analgesia, and the second group will have the procedure performed with placebo TENS. The application of the TENS device will be performed by a study team member who will know to what group the patient was randomized. Both groups will be given the VAS, satisfaction scale, and 5-point Likert scale questionnaires to be answered before, during, and after they undergo treatment on the scheduled day of the procedure.\n\nThe primary outcome will be a change in the VAS pain measurement. Investigators hypothesized that TENS used during transurethral bulking injections would result in a 10-mm decrease in VAS compared to placebo TENS.\n\nSecondary outcomes will be:\n\n1. A discrete 5-point Likert Scale to assess the internal consistency of the pain rating within the study\n2. A satisfaction 10-point scale questionnaire\n3. Rate of side effects to the use of TENS (skin irritation, pain or burning at electrode site) and transurethral bulking injections (vasovagal symptoms: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, shoulder pain, vertigo, sweating, fainting),\n4. Length of procedure."
