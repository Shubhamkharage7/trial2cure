The tubes provide up to 142 pounds of resistance (adjustable in increments between 3-10 pounds) when simultaneously connected to handles or bar, and multiple tubes can be attached simultaneously. Participants will engage in brief warm up exercises lasting 2-3 minutes prior to each RT session and will rest at least 1 minute between sets of the same exercise to aid muscle recovery. Participants will perform at least 2 sets of 12 repetitions for each of 6 exercises. Including warm up, training sets, and rest, sessions will last approximately 30 minutes.
