The investigators will use a longitudinal design and randomize developmental prosopagnosics to three parallel arms: active control, perception training and memory training.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose a longitudinal design with three parallel arms: active control, perception training and memory training. To maximize power, developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) in the active control group will be subsequently be offered training. Pre-training/control assessments will be performed and within 2 weeks, DPs will be randomized to one of the three training conditions. Next, all DPs will complete 6-weeks of their assigned intervention. The research assistant will provide coaching at least once per week. DPs will be assessed within two weeks of training completion and after a 12-week no-contact period. For those in the active control group, the no-contact period will serve to wash out any placebo effect and Assessment 3 will be used as their new baseline. These DPs will then be randomized to perception or memory training. Assessments will then be given to these DPs within a week after intervention completion and after a 12 weeks no-contact period."
