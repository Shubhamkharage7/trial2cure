This study involves direct vaccination of human volunteers. The endpoints will be determining how vaccination affects neutrophil responses and linking those neutrophil responses to antibody responses following vaccination. The main results will be:\n\n1. Elucidating how neutrophils kill bacteria before and after vaccination\n2. Elucidate the phenotype of neutrophils before and after vaccination\n3. Elucidate how neutrophils interact with B and T cell in vitro before and after vaccination\n4. Measure antibody levels and function before and after vaccination\n5. Correlate neutrophil responses to antibody levels and function"
