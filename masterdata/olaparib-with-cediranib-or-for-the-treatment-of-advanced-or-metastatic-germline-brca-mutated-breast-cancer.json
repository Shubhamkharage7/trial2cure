            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well olaparib with cediranib or AZD6738 works in treating patients with germline BRCA mutated breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). Olaparib, cediranib, and AZD6738 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of olaparib plus cediranib and olaparib plus ceralasertib (AZD6738) combinations in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutations who have been previously treated with PARP inhibitors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with cediranib and in combination with AZD6738 in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations.\n\nII. To assess duration of response (DOR) to treatment. III. To assess best response. IV. To estimate progression free survival (PFS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate BRCA1 expression at baseline and on progression. II. To evaluate hypoxia markers at baseline and on progression. III. To evaluate levels of angiogenesis/ inflammatory markers including VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) at baseline and on progression.\n\nIV. To evaluate novel markers of resistance and response to PARP inhibitor in baseline and upon progression of disease in tumor tissue that are identified by the investigator's basic science collaborator's ongoing studies in vitro and in vivo.\n\nV. To evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline and on progression.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 and ceralasertib PO QD on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."

History of abdominal fistula will be considered eligible, if the fistula was surgically repaired, there has been no evidence of fistula for at least 6 months prior to starting treatment, and patient is deemed to be at low risk of recurrent fistula\n* Patients may not have current dependency on intravenous (IV) hydration or total parenteral nutrition (TPN)\n* Patients may have features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear or bone marrow biopsy, if clinically indicated\n* As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, active bleeding diatheses, renal transplant, or active infection including any patient known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not required\n* Any condition that, in the opinion of the treating investigator would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication\n* Prior exposure to an AZD 6738 and cediranib\n* Patients with uncontrolled seizure\n* Any of the following cardiac criteria:\n\n  * Resting electrocardiography (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) prolongation \\> 450 milli-second, or patients with congenital long QT syndrome or family history of unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age)\n  * Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block)\n* Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g., carotid stenosis\n* Patients with relative hypotension (\\< 100/60 mm Hg) or clinically relevant orthostatic hypotension (\\>= 20 beats per minute change in pulse including a fall in blood pressure of \\>= 20 mm Hg associated with dizziness, syncope, and blurred vision, from lying down or sitting to standing). Uncontrolled hypertension requiring clinical intervention\n* Breast feeding/lactating/pregnant women\n* Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation\n* Progressed on or recurred within 1 months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy in metastatic setting\n* Additional exclusion criteria for olaparib + cediranib: Patients may not have evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis. Therapeutic anticoagulation for prior thromboembolic events is permitted. The clinical indication for therapeutic anticoagulation must be clearly documented prior to enrollment and must be discussed with the principal investigator (PI). Given the increased risk of serious bleeding from cediranib, patients who are on more than or equal to 2 anti-thrombotic agents, including but not limited to anti-platelet agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug \\[NSAID\\]s/aspirin, clopidogrel), heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, and a direct thrombin inhibitor, will be excluded\n* Additional exclusion criteria for olaparib + AZD6738: A diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia\n* Major surgery within 3 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery",
