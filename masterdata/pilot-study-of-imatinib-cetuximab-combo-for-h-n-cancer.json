This interventional study will occur in the time between diagnosis of your cancer and surgery to remove your tumor or radiation or chemoradiation treatment of your primary cancer.\n\nParticipants will undergo a research blood draw and a research biopsy as part of the screening process, and will be in this research study for approximately 13 to 16 months.",

The primary objective is to determine the proportion of patients with a response to imatinib plus CTX in pre-treatment and post-treatment samples obtained as part of a window of opportunity clinical study in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients."
