Favorable urine analysis defined as urinary sodium is \\< 100 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), chloride \\< 90 mEq/L, and osmolality \\< 200 milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg) after 20 weeks and in the absence of previous in utero intervention for the disease (vesicoamniotic shunt placement or fetal cystoscopy).\n7. Absence of chromosomal abnormalities and associated anomalies\n8. Gestational age at the time of the procedure will be between 16 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7 weeks\n9. Normal karyotype by invasive testing (amniocentesis or Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)). Patients declining invasive testing will be excluded.\n10. Family have considered and declined the option of termination of the pregnancy at less than 24 weeks.\n11. Family meets psychosocial criteria, including sufficient social support and ability to understand requirements of the study.\n12. Parents or guardian are willing to provide signed informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Fetal anomaly unrelated to LUTO\n2. Congenital cardiac anomaly\n3. Female fetus\n4. Increased risk for preterm labor including short cervical length (\\<1.5 cm), history of incompetent cervix with or without cerclage, and previous preterm birth\n5. Placental abnormalities (previa, abruption, accreta) known at time of enrollment\n6. Contraindications to surgery including previous hysterotomy in active uterine segment\n7. Technical limitations precluding fetoscopic surgery, such as uterine fibroids, fetal membrane separation, uterine anomalies incompatible with fetoscopy\n8. Maternal-fetal Rh isoimmunization, Kell sensitization or neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia affecting the current pregnancy\n9.
