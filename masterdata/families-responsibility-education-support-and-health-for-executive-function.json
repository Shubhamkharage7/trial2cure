            "detailedDescription": "The currently recommended treatment for children with overweight or obesity (OW/OB), family-based behavioral treatment (FBT), results in sustained weight loss for only 1/3 of children. Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders in children and is characterized by difficulties in Executive Function (EF). Substantial research suggests higher rates of OW/OB in children with ADHD; thus, children with OW/OB and ADHD are likely to have greater difficulties with EF and achieving success in FBT. The proposed study aims to develop a parent-based behavioral treatment enhanced with EF training (PBT-EF) to improve treatment outcomes for children with comorbid OW/OB and ADHD. The treatment will be administered to parents in 18 group sessions over 5 months. Parents and children will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Assessments will include body mass index (BMI), assessments of executive function, and behavioral questionnaires. This study could provide a novel model to treat OW/OB in children with ADHD, and could inform clinical decision making regarding obesity treatment."
