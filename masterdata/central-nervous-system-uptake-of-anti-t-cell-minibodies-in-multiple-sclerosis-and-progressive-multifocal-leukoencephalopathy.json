            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Both diseases can cause muscle weakness and impair vision, speech, and coordination. Researchers are working to better understand how MS and PML affect the CNS.\n\nObjective: To test whether an experimental radioactive tracer (minibody) can help positron emission tomography (PET) scans detect certain immune cells in the CNS of people with MS and PML.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older with MS or PML.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will come to the clinic for at least 3 visits over 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nParticipants will undergo testing. They will have a physical and neurological exam. They will have blood tests and tests of their heart function. They will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. They may have a spinal tap: Their lower back will be numbed, and a needle will be inserted between the bones of the spine to withdraw fluid from around the spinal cord.\n\nMinibody is given through a tube with a needle placed in a vein in the arm. This takes 5 to 10 minutes. Participants will have heart function tests before and after receiving the minibody.\n\nParticipants will return the next day for the PET scan. They will lie on a table that moves through a doughnut-shaped machine. This scan will take about 1 hour.\n\nParticipants with PML may opt to repeat the minibody infusion and the PET scan within 6 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will obtain pilot data for noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of CD8+ T lymphocytes in two inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), by characterizing CNS uptake of anti-CD8+ T cell antibody fragment (aka minibody ) (89Zr-Dfcrefmirlimab), an investigational, intravenous PET tracer.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To detect and localize infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the CNS of adults with MS and PML via PET-CT (computed tomography) scans using a minibody with high affinity for CD8+ T cells.\n\nSecondary Objectives: (1) To characterize safety and tolerability of 89Zr-Df-crefmirlimab in the participant population. (2) For the PML cohort with longitudinal evaluation, to determine the effects of immune reconstitution, either spontaneous or facilitated, on 89Zr-Dfcrefmirlimab uptake.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints: Standardized uptake values (SUV) in different tissue types (lesions, white matter, gray matter, meninges, choroid plexus, as determined from coregistered MRI) in each cohort (MS or PML) by region-of-interest (ROI) analysis.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: (1) Frequency and nature of adverse events; (2) For the PML cohort with longitudinal evaluation, changes in SUV over time."
