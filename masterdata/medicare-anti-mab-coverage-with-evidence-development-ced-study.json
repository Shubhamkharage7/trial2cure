            "detailedDescription": "The Anti-A\u03b2 mAb CED Study is conducted in accordance with the coverage criteria specified in the NCD for patients who have a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD dementia. The complete NCD decision memorandum is available on our website (https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/ncacal-decisionmemo.aspx?proposed=N\\&ncaid=305).\n\nStudy Overview:\n\n1. Clinicians will conduct a neurocognitive evaluation to determine patient eligibility by confirming a clinical diagnosis of MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia, and the presence of amyloid using biomarker testing including imaging (amyloid PET), cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies, and/or blood tests.\n2. For all Medicare beneficiaries receiving anti-A\u03b2 mAb treatment for MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia, the prescribing clinician will assess the patient's baseline clinical status by cognition and function assessments using validated tools appropriate for use in the MCI with AD and mild AD dementia populations and submit these data to the registry via the dedicated CMS CED submission portal every six months for up to 24 months (five total assessments).\n3. In addition to performing the required cognition and function assessments, prescribing clinicians will need to report on the patient's use of anti-platelet and/or anti-coagulation therapy and whether the patient has developed new amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) since the last assessment data submission."
