Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to TSR-042 or other agents used in the study.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry.\n* Participant must not be simultaneously enrolled in any interventional clinical trial\n* Participant must not have had major surgery \u2264 3 weeks prior to initiating protocol therapy and participant must have recovered from any surgical effects.\n* Participant must not have received investigational therapy \u2264 4 weeks, or within a time interval less than at least 5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is shorter, prior initiating protocol therapy.\n* Participant has had radiation therapy encompassing \\>20% of the bone marrow within 2 weeks; or any radiation therapy within 1 week prior to Day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* Participant must not have a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease, or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days) myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n* Patient experienced \u2265 Grade 3 immune-related AE with prior immunotherapy, with the exception of non-clinically significant lab abnormalities.\n* Participant has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or has receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to initiating protocol therapy.\n* Participant has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (type 1 or 2 antibodies).\n* Participant has known active hepatitis B (eg, hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or hepatitis C (eg, hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\] ribonucleic acid \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n* Participant has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunomodulatory drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Participant must not have a history of interstitial lung disease.\n* Participant has received a live vaccine within 14 days of initiating protocol therapy.",
