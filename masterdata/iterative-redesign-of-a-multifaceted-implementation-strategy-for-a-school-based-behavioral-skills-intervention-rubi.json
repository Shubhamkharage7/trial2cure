            "briefSummary": "The increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (1 in 36 youth) in the United States along with the exorbitant cost of care of supporting one autistic individual with and without intellectual disability across their lifespan ($2.4 and $1.4 million, respectively) creates a sense of urgency to improve outcomes for autistic youth. Schools are the primary setting in which autistic children receive intervention. Despite a growing array of evidence-based interventions (EBI) such as behavioral management, EBIs often are unavailable in schools due to misalignment of existing implementation strategies (IS) with that setting. Large numbers of IS have been described for the education sector, but there is a dire need to identify the most efficient IS to support use of EBI in resource-strapped public schools. This project will apply the local Discover, Design/Build and Test (DDBT) framework to redesign and pilot a multifaceted IS to support educator use of a behavioral skills EBI for autistic children in public schools.",
            "detailedDescription": "Specifically, this study will test the effects of the newly redesigned Research Units in Behavioral Intervention in Educational Settings (RUBIES) Implementation Strategy in comparison with the unadapted Research Units in Behavioral Intervention (RUBI) Implementation Strategy on DDBT mechanisms (engagement, usability, appropriateness), proximal implementation outcomes (adoption, fidelity, adaptation, reach) and child outcomes (disruptive behavior, functioning, top problems). Compared with the un-adapted RUBI IS, the newly designed implementation strategy RUBIES-Team will lead to:\n\nH3-1: greater RUBIES usability, engagement, and appropriateness; H3-2: greater RUBIES adoption, fidelity, and reach, with fewer reactive adaptations to the RUBIES IS; H3-3: noninferiority on student disruptive behavior in autistic children; and H3-4: more students with improved behavioral outcomes than deterioration or unchanged outcomes across conditions."
