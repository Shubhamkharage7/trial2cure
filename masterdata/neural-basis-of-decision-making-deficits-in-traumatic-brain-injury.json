            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeople with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have trouble making the best possible decisions. Researchers want to learn more about the parts of the brain that control decision making. They also want to know how these are different between people. This may help predict how people make decisions after TBI.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about which parts of the brain are involved in making decisions and how decisions may be hurt after TBI.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 to 60.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will also take memory, attention, concentration, and thinking tests.\n\nParticipants will do up to 2 experiments.\n\nFor Experiment 1, participants may have 3 scans:\n\nPET: a chemical is injected through a thin tube into an arm vein. Participants lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner.\n\nMRI: a strong magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal cylinder. It makes loud knocking noises. Participants will get earplugs. They might be asked to do a task. A coil will be placed over the head.\n\nMEG: a cone with magnetic field detectors is lowered onto participants head.\n\nAfter the scans, participants will perform a decision-making task.\n\nFor Experiment 2, participants will perform a decision-making task before and after receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\ntDCS: wet electrode sponges are placed over participants' scalp and forehead. A current passes between the electrodes. It stimulating the brain.\n\nParticipants will return 24-48 hours later to repeat the decision-making task.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nDeficits in decision-making are commonly found in individuals after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can have a severe negative impact on quality of life. Converging evidence from both animal model and human studies suggest that decision-making deficits are linked with abnormal mesocorticolimbic network structure and function, and could potentially be mitigated through interventions that improve function within these neuronal circuits.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Quantify differences in performance on a decision-making task between TBI patients and healthy volunteers;\n2. Determine whether baseline features of mesocorticolimbic network structure and function predict subsequent decision-making performance in both TBI patients and healthy volunteers; and\n3. Determine if facilitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a mesocorticolimbic network region crucially involved in decision-making, improves decision-making after TBI.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: The primary outcome measure for both Experiment 1 and 2 is performance in a computerized decision-making task.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Secondary outcome measures will include quantitative estimates of structural and functional mesocorticolimbic network features, including MRI-based structural and functional connectivity, MEG-based functional connectivity, baseline dlPFC GABA concentration measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging, dopamine D2 receptor binding potential within mesocorticolimbic subcortical nuclei measured with \\[11C\\]raclopride PET (Experiment 1). Multimodal data fusion modeling will be used to explore the predictive relationship between baseline mesocorticolimbic network features and decision-making task performance within a unified state-space framework (Experiment 1), as well as the ability of these network features to predict inter-individual differences in the effects of tDCS on decision-making task performance (Experiment 2)."
