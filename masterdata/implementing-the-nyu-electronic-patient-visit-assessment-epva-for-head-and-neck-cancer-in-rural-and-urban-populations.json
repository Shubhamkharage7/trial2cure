            "briefSummary": "The PI and the research team developed the New York University (NYU) Electronic Patient Visit Assessment (ePVA) for head and neck cancer (HNC) as a patient-reported outcome measure (PRO) for the early detection of uncontrolled symptoms. The ePVA is digital patient-reported symptom monitoring system, providing actionable information at point-of-care that enables clinicians to provide real-time interventions. The study aims to advance the science of cancer care delivery by testing the effectiveness of the ePVA as a digital patient-reported monitoring system for patients with HNC in real-world settings and identify implementation strategies that optimize the effectiveness of the ePVA in diverse rural and urban settings. The study hypothesis is that participants assigned to the ePVA arm will have better swallowing, taste and smell, and social function than participants assigned to usual care arm at 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy."

Post-treatment care includes follow-up visits with HNC clinicians (i.e., surgeon, medical oncologist, oral maxillofacial surgeons, and radiation oncologist) to assess the patient's cancer status and identify the patient's acute and long-term symptoms.
