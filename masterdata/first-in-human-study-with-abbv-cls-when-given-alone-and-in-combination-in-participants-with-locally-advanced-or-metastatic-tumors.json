            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective ABBV-CLS-579 is when used alone and in combination with a PD-1 target agent or with a VEGF TKI.\n\nABBV-CLS-579 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of tumors.\n\nThe trial aims to establish a safe, tolerable, and efficacious dose of ABBV-CLS-579 as monotherapy and in combination. The study will be conducted in three parts. Part 1 Monotherapy Dose Escalation, Part 2 Combination Dose Escalation, and Part 3 Combination Dose Expansion.\n\nPart 1, ABBV-CLS-579 will be administered alone in escalating dose levels to eligible subjects who have advanced solid tumors.\n\nPart 2, ABBV-CLS-579 will be administered at escalating dose levels in combination with a PD-1 targeting agent to eligible subjects who have advanced solid tumors.\n\nPart 3, ABBV-CLS-579 will be administered at the determined recommended dose in combination with a PD-1 target agent or with a VEGFR TKI in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic, relapsed or refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).\n\nAdult participants with a diagnosis of some solid tumors for which no effective standard therapy exists or has failed will be enrolled. Participants will receive study treatment until disease progresses or discontinued.\n\nThere may be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires."
