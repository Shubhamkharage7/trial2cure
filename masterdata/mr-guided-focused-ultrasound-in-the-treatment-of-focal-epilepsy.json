The investigators will establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.",

The Investigators will establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.\n\nThe hypotheses tested are that:\n\n1. MRgFUS treatment of focal epilepsy is feasible and safe, with a low risk of adverse effects as evaluated during the follow-up period.\n2. Exablate treatment of foci in patients with focal epilepsy reduces the seizure frequency."
