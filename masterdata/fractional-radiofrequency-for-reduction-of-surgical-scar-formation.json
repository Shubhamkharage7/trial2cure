The subject will act as their own control, where one surgical area will be treated, and the other will not be and will act as the control. Tissue samples will be biopsied from the RF treated skin, as well as non-treated skin, at follow up visits. The samples will be used for histological evaluation to assess tissue structure and regeneration following surgery."
