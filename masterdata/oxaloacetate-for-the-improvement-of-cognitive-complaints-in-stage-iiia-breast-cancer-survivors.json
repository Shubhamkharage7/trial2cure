Oxaloacetate is a natural substance found in the body and is available as a nutritional supplement. Giving oxaloacetate may reduce inflammation in the brain that could be contributing to cognitive complaints seen after cancer treatments.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To examine the effectiveness of anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate (oxaloacetate) in reducing cognitive complaints in breast cancer patients over the course of 8 weeks.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the tolerability of oxaloacetate. II. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an effect on the neurocognitive domain of executive function.\n\nIII. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an effect on patient reported fatigue, insomnia, and depressive symptoms.\n\nIV. To collect blood for assessment of inflammatory markers and glutamate levels.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks in the absence of worsening symptoms or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks."

For this reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; intrauterine device \\[IUD\\]; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of any age who have had their ovaries and/or uterus removed will not be at risk for pregnancy and will not require contraception. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately. Menopausal status will be established as follows: Women who are 55 years or older and who are not menstruating will be considered postmenopausal and not at risk for pregnancy. Women who are less than 55 years old who are menstruating will be considered premenopausal and will require contraception. Women who are less than 55 years with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not menstruating and have not had a menstrual period within the past 2 years will have an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol measured. If the values are in postmenopausal range the woman will be considered postmenopausal and she will not be considered at risk for pregnancy\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has another serious or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that contributes to substantial physical or emotional disability that would detract from participating in the planned study\n* Taking chronic medications that would interfere with cognitive functioning such as medications for sleep, anxiety, narcotics for pain, use of illicit drugs or cannabis\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to oxaloacetate\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because the safety of oxaloacetate in this setting is unknown. A pregnancy test will be performed on all women with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not determined to be postmenopausal",
