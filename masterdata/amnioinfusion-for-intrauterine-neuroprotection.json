            "briefSummary": "Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a serious brain injury in infants, occurs in 2-9 per 1,000 infants after delivery. Up to 60% of infants diagnosed with HIE die and 25% of the survivors have long-term neurologic deficits. Risk factors for HIE include abnormal fetal heart tracings and intrauterine infection. Therapeutic whole-body cooling of infants with HIE is standard of care after delivery, with only 7-9 at-risk infants needing to be treated to prevent one infant from suffering long-term neurologic deficits. However, animal studies show that therapeutic cooling may be more beneficial when given in utero at the time of an insult, rather than after delivery. Though therapeutic cooling in utero has yet to be explored in humans, an established in utero fluid delivery system during labor-amnioinfusion-provides a unique opportunity for in utero intervention. We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of room temperature amnioinfusion on tissue injury including HIE.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a serious brain injury in infants, occurs in 2-9 per 1,000 infants after delivery. Up to 60% of infants diagnosed with HIE die and 25% of the survivors have long-term neurologic deficits. Risk factors for HIE include abnormal fetal heart tracings and intrauterine infection. In addition, maternal fever is associated with a four to five-fold increased risk of HIE. Two phases leading to HIE are recognized: neuronal death from cellular hypoxia and further injury from exhaustion of energy stores.\n\nTherapeutic cooling of infants with HIE provides neuroprotection by reducing metabolic demands and suppressing toxic processes. Studies show that whole-body cooling of infants reduces the risk of neurologic motor and cognitive deficits with brain imaging suggesting that human infants who are cooled earlier have a greater benefit. Moreover, animal studies show that brain cooling may be more beneficial when given in utero at the time of an insult during the first phase of cellular hypoxia, rather than after delivery. Though therapeutic cooling in utero has yet to be explored in humans, an established in utero fluid delivery system-amnioinfusion- provides a unique opportunity for in utero intervention.\n\nAmnioinfusion (AI), the administration of fluid via an intrauterine catheter inserted through the cervix, is a common intervention during labor to improve fetal heart tracings and reduce cesarean delivery. Introduced in 1983, it used warm saline due to a theoretical concern for fetal shock from cold fluids. Subsequent studies showed no advantage of warm fluids, and fluids at room temperature (\\~25oC) have become standard. AI can lower in utero temperature by 1.0\u00b0C (36.4\u00b0C versus 37.4\u00b0C, P\\<0.01). This 1.0\u00b0C degree of cooling has been associated a 6% reduction in brain energy utilization which could be protective against neurological injury. This suggests that AI can be leveraged to lower in utero and fetal temperatures to protect against neurologic injury.\n\nExpanding the indication for AI is a novel approach to reduce neurologic injury in utero. However, there is a gap in the acceptability and efficacy of amnioinfusion for this indication. To fill this gap, we propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility and effects of amnioinfusion with fluids at room temperature on infants at high risk for neurologic injury including HIE."
