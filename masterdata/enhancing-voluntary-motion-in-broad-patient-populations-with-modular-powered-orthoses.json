This project aims to establish feasibility of assisting different populations with these modular powered orthoses. The investigators hypothesize that assisting lower-limb musculature with modular powered orthoses will improve 1) lifting/lowering posture in able-bodied subjects and 2) functional outcomes in elderly subjects.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this project is to develop modular, lower-limb, powered orthoses that fit to user-specific weakened joints and control force/torque in a manner that enhances voluntary motion in broad patient populations. Conventional orthoses tend to immobilize joints, and emerging powered orthoses constrain voluntary motion by using highly geared electric motors and/or control methods that force the user to follow a specific gait pattern. Consequently, these devices have not seen widespread success across populations with weakened voluntary control due to advanced age, musculoskeletal disorders, etc. These heterogeneous populations require partial, not full, assistance of user-specific muscle groups during daily activities. However, there is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to design and control powered orthoses to assist the user without constraining their motion. The central hypothesis of this project is that high-torque, low-inertia motor systems controlled with energetic objectives will enable modular powered orthoses to partially assist the joints. High-torque electric motors combined with minimal transmissions can be freely rotated (i.e., backdriven) by human joints, allowing the use of an emerging torque control method called energy shaping to reduce the perceived weight/inertia of the body during any motion. By mounting these modular actuators to commercial orthoses, this technology will be easily prescribed/configured by clinicians. This project aims to establish feasibility of assisting different populations with modular powered orthoses. The investigators hypothesize that assisting lower-limb musculature with modular powered orthoses will improve 1) lifting/lowering posture in able-bodied subjects and 2) functional outcomes in elderly subjects."
