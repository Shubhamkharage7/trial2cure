            "briefSummary": "Mental health vulnerability due to stress is increased in People of African Descent (PADs) in America due to disproportionate effects of racism, poverty, education, and criminal justice sentencing. Various meditation and mindfulness approaches have provided evidence of measured reductions in multiple negative dimensions of stress. However, the majority of these studies do not have an adequate representation of PADs or other marginalized groups and are not designed to be culturally relevant or community based. Music has been shown to alleviate multiple symptoms of stress and has been shown to be a preferred and effective support for meditation and mindfulness. However, its role in stress management in PADs engaged in meditation or mindfulness is seldom studied. This study aims to evaluate the effects of a virtual, community-based music mindfulness program on stress management in PAD community members with anxiety and depression during COVID19.\n\nMusic Mindfulness Study: Investigators will compare the effects of music-backed guided mindfulness mediation and guided mediation alone in alleviating anxiety and depression.",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators hypothesize that this intervention will lead to reductions in scores on stress scales and will provide preliminary data for studies evaluating these types of community programs as an adjunct to the standard of care.\n\nParticipants will be screened, consented, and enrolled into either a 2-week pilot study (to test the feasibility of the experiment) or an 8-week full length study. The focus of this registration is the 8-week full length study.\n\nUpon completion of the study, participants will be asked to take part in a focus group that will provide valuable feedback on their experience with the mindfulness intervention."
