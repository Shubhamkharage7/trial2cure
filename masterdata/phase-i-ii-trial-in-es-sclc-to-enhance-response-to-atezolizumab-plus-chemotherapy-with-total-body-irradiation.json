            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial studies the side effects, safety, and effectiveness of low dose radiation to the entire body (total body irradiation \\[TBI\\]) and higher dose radiation to known areas of cancer (hypofractionated radiation therapy \\[H-RT\\]) combined with atezolizumab and chemotherapy (carboplatin \\& etoposide) in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has spread to disease sites outside of the lung (extensive stage). Extensive stage disease has historically been treated with chemotherapy alone with consideration of chest (thoracic) radiation therapy for those with response to chemotherapy, as well as consideration of preventative radiation therapy to the head (prophylactic cranial irradiation). Emerging evidence supports the synergistic interactions between immunotherapy and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill tumor cells. Combining TBI and H-RT with atezolizumab and chemotherapy may improve response to treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety of the addition of total body irradiation (TBI) and hypo-fractionated radiation (H-RT) to atezolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with extensive stage-small cell lung carcinoma (ES-SCLC).\n\nII. Evaluate the efficacy of the addition of TBI and H-RT to atezolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate the progression free survival benefit and local and systemic control benefits of the addition of TBI and H-RT to atezolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and atezolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle and etoposide IV on days 1-3 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive TBI twice daily (BID) on day 18 or 19 of cycle 1 and beginning 2-3 days later, H-RT daily over 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive atezolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients also undergo computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every 3-4 months for up to 3 years."

Asymptomatic metastatic lesions that would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain with further growth (e.g., epidural metastasis that is not currently associated with spinal cord compression) can be considered for loco-regional therapy at discretion of treating physician prior to enrollment.\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium \\> 1.5 mmol/L, calcium \\> 12 mg/dL or corrected serum calcium \\> ULN)\n* Active or history of autoimmune disease or immune deficiency, including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Inflammatory bowel disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sjogren syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or multiple sclerosis, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Patients with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are on thyroid- replacement hormone are eligible for the study\n  * Patients with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on an insulin regimen are eligible for the study\n  * Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are eligible for the study provided all the following conditions are met:\n\n    * Rash must cover \\< 10% of body surface area\n    * Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical steroids\n    * No occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high-potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan\n* Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia\n* Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., to prevent a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) are eligible for the study.\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n* Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n* Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti- CTLA-4, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies\n* Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 (IL-2) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF-alpha agents, within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment with following exceptions:\n\n  * Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy are eligible for the study after Principal Investigator confirmation has been confirmed)\n  * Patients who are receiving mineral corticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal sufficiency are eligible for the study.\n  * Systemic steroids required during therapy for adverse event (AE) management are allowed.\n* History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab formulation\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment or within 5 months of the last dose of Atezolizumab. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment.",
