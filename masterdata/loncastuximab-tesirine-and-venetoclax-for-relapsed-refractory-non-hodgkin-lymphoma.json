            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dose and safety of combining two new cancer drugs, loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax, as a treatment for relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma.These drugs are used to treat some lymphomas, but have not yet been tested in combination for the treatment of lymphoma. The main goal of this study is to determine the safety of the combination.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase I trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of loncastuximab tesirine given in combination with venetoclax for treatment of relapsed/refractory non - Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nLoncastuximab tesirine is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by targeting a protein in cancer cells (called CD19) and delivering a small amount of chemotherapy directly to the cancer cells. Loncastuximab tesirine is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Venetoclax, is a targeted anti-cancer drug, which works by imitating a particular protein produced by the tumor and interrupting its normal processes, ultimately causing the tumor cells to die. Adding venetoclax to the loncastuximab tesirine regimen is believed to increase the chance of getting relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma cancer in remission. Venetoclax is approved by the FDA for treatment in some types of cancer, but is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of lymphoma soit is considered experimental in this study. Up to 36 subjects will take in this phase I research study.\n\nThe primary objective for this study: To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of these agents.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\n* To describe the adverse event profile of the combination of loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax.\n* To describe the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR) of relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with the combination of loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax.\n* To describe the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with relapsed / refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with the combination of loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax.\n* To describe the disease-free survival, the disease specific survival and time to treatment failure of subjects with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with the combination of loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax."

Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n\nWith pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of loncastuximab to avoid exposing the embryo.\n\nThe reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior treatment toxicities not resolved to grade \\<2 according to NCI CTCAE 5.0 (with the exception of alopecia or grade 2 sensory peripheral neuropathy).\n* Patients with spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome.\n* Autologous stem cell transplant within 30 days of start of study drug (C1D1).\n* Allogeneic stem cell transplant within 60 days of start of study drug (C1D1).\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Active graft versus host disease\n* Active autoimmune disease\n* Known seropositive and requiring anti-viral therapy for human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus. Note: Testing is not mandatory to be eligible.\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration.\n* Known allergy to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase. Allergy to only one of these agents does not constitute an exclusion criterion.\n* Use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.\n\n  --All medications that fall in these categories should be discontinued 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Administration or consumption of any of the following within 3 days prior to the first dose of study drug:\n\n  * Grapefruit or grapefruit products\n  * Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges)\n  * Star fruit\n* Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Uncontrolled and/or active systemic infection (viral, bacterial or fungal)\n  * Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) requiring treatment. Note: subjects with serologic evidence of prior vaccination to HBV (i.e. hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen negative-, anti-HBs antibody positive and anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody negative) or positive anti-HBc antibody from intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) may participate.\n  * Other uncontrolled conditions including uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or arrythmia, decompensated diabetes or COPD.",
