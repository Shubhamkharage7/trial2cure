            "detailedDescription": "Human Factors Validation Testing will initially be conducted to valuate a lay person's ability to understand and apply as applicable the information contained in the EVRL\u2122 Use Device Proper Use Reference Guide, and device packaging and labeling materials to correctly, safely, and successfully activate and operate the EVRL\u2122 to administer the treatment; and to identify any and all use difficulties, problems and errors, including those pertaining to critical tasks and close calls demonstrated by the lay person during device operation, and to subsequently mitigate each identified instance of use error through device and/or materials modification, and to subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of each modification, as applicable\n\nPhase Two will commence following the successful completion of Phase One. Phase Two comprises the performance of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study of the efficacy of the Erchonia\u00ae EVRL\u2122, manufactured by Erchonia Corporation (the Sponsor), for prescription home use application in providing temporary relief of diabetic peripheral neuropathy foot pain."
