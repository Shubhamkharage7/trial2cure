The main question it aims to answer is, \"What is the rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) with TTFields in addition to concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation durvalumab?\"\n\nStep 1\n\n* All participants will be screened and enrolled in Step 1 prior to SOC concurrent chemoradiation.\n* The purpose of the Step 1 Registration is to ensure that eligible participants are candidate for concurrent chemoradiation and do not have contraindications to TTF therapy or immunotherapy.\n\n  * Starting Level: Participants in Device Duration Level 1 will receive standard of care concurrent chemoradiation following Step 1 Registration.\n  * Escalation Level : Participants in Device Duration Level 2 will begin standard of care chemoradiation and treatment with TTFields following Step 1 Registration.\n\nStep 2\n\n* All participants will complete Step 2 screening and enrollment prior to receiving treatment with durvalumab consolidation therapy and TTFields.\n* The purpose of the Step 2 registration is to ensure that eligible patients meet criteria for consolidation durvalumab after completion of CRT and do not have contraindications to TTF. therapy or immunotherapy."
