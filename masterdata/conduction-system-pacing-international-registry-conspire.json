            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this registry study is to collect information about routine clinical practices with device implantation to treat bradycardia and cardiac systolic dysfunction (heart rhythm disorders) across global centers of excellence in cardiac pacing. In particular, this study will examine the use of conduction system pacing (CSP) in clinical practice. Information collected in the registry will help researchers better characterize strengths and limitations of current technology and treatments.",
            "detailedDescription": "During this past decade, there has been a dramatic surge in interest in new physiologic pacing strategies which engage and take advantage of the intrinsic cardiac conduction system. These approaches include His bundle pacing (HBP) as well as approaches which seek to pace the proximal left conduction system (LCS), including left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) or pacing in the region of the left posterior fascicle. Left ventricular septal pacing (LVS) has also been proposed as another means to avoid dyssynchrony with early data suggestive of comparable electrical synchronization as biventricular pacing. These approaches utilize approved pacing systems and leads which are delivered to new targets in the His-Purkinje system or LV endocardial fibers. Despite the growing interest in HBP, LCS, and LVS, the majority of data are from disparate cohort studies and there has been a lack of uniformity in assembling data or analyzing and interpreting outcomes.\n\nThe goal of the Conduction System Pacing International Registry (CONSPIRE) is to systematically and prospectively collect data across multiple centers of excellence on the early implementation of permanent conduction system pacing devices in order to characterize strengths and limitations of current technology. The study will evaluate patient selection, intraprocedural characteristics, and clinical outcomes among patients receiving conduction system pacing (CSP) as part of their routine clinical care."
