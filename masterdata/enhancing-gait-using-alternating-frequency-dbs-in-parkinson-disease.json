            "detailedDescription": "Postural instability, gait impairment, and falls are among the greatest unmet needs in Parkinson disease (PD). A single fall can be catastrophic, and impairments that limit mobility lead to social isolation or depression, and adversely affect bone and cardiovascular health. Unfortunately, postural instability and gait disorders are refractory to current pharmacological and surgical treatments, including deep brain stimulation (DBS). This project will directly address this pressing need. We will recruit participants to perform a gait task, using a new, alternating DBS frequency paradigm, while body movements and neural signals are recorded. The findings will lead to improved therapies to address these symptoms in the future."
