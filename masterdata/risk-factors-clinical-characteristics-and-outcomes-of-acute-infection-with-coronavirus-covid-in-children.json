Investigators also do not know if a person will get sick or not from the virus after being in close contact with someone who has the virus. Because of this, investigators are performing research on the virus found in respiratory secretions to get more information on how investigators can best detect and treat this new virus in the future.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* To determine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 in children.\n* To characterize the clinical risk factors of Covid-19 in children..\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To characterize the immunological risk factors and serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.- To evaluate the duration of viral shedding in children.\n* To evaluate the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in children. Exploratory Objective",

Timing of follow-up swabs will be guided by standard of care procedures.\n\nWhole blood will be collected at Days 0. Follow-up blood sampling will be guided by standard of care procedures. Samples will be stored at -80oC.\n\nNasal swabs and whole blood will only be obtained at the same time standard of care procedures are performed. If a patient is not getting a blood draw, no sample will be collected."
