Phase 1 will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib when dosed continuously up to 3 mg/m\\^2/dose twice daily (BID) in patients with progressive or recurrent pLGG without prior MEK inhibitor (MEKi) exposure. This phase will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and will contain a small expansion cohort before launching phase 2. Phase 2 will utilize the MTD/RP2D to evaluate mirdametinib efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in broader cohorts of patients with newly diagnosed or progressive/recurrent pLGG (+/- prior MEK inhibitor exposure).\n\nIn Phase 1 of the study, participants with progressive or recurrent pLGG without prior MEKi exposure are eligible and will be enrolled onto a single dose level. The Rolling 6 design will be used to estimate the MTD/RP2D and to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the escalating doses. Once a candidate MTD or RP2D based on 6 subjects has been determined additional evaluable subjects will be enrolled as part of a Phase 1 expansion cohort in order to better describe the safety and tolerability of the MTD/RP2D. The data from all subjects treated at the MTD/RP2D (patients from the dose-finding/dose-escalation study plus expansion cohort) will also be used to assess the stage I efficacy criteria for cohort 2 as part of the Phase 2 design. If these criteria are met, cohort 2 sample size will be expanded beyond the interim analysis and the Phase 2 study will be initiated in cohort 1.\n\nMirdametinib will be administered twice daily in cycles of 28 days and may be continued for up to 24 months (26 cycles) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Doses will be based on the BSA calculated before each cycle of therapy. During the DLT period (i.e., cycle 1), all phase 1 participants (including those in the phase 1 expansion cohort) will receive mirdametinib in dispersible tablets only. Thereafter, patients who can swallow capsules may transition to capsules if permitted by their specific dose level.\n\nOnce the phase 2 is open to enrollment, participants from the phase 1 on a dose level that differs from the RP2D, may choose to change to the RP2D as long as they have not undergone a dose-reduction for toxicity, and if the treating physician and the patient/family agree it is in the best interest of the patient.\n\nIn Phase 2 of the study, participants will be stratified into 3 disease cohorts:\n\n* Cohort 1: Patients with Newly Diagnosed Low-Grade Glioma\n* Cohort 2: Patients with Progressive or Recurrent Low-Grade Glioma without Previous MEKi Exposure\n* Cohort 3: Patients with Progressive or Recurrent Low-Grade Glioma with Previous MEKi Exposure and:\n\n  * Cohort 3A: Previously received 6 or more cycles of MEKi therapy and did not progress on MEKi therapy\n  * Cohort 3B: Previously treated with MEKi, other than mirdametinib, and progressed while on MEKi therapy\n\nTherapy will be administered at RP2D in cycles of 28 days and may be continued for up to 24 months (26 cycles) in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in Cohort 3 with previous exposure to mirdametinib may receive a starting dose lower than the RP2D, depending on the dose they tolerated during their previous exposure. Phase 2 will utilize both the dispersible tablet and capsule formulations."
