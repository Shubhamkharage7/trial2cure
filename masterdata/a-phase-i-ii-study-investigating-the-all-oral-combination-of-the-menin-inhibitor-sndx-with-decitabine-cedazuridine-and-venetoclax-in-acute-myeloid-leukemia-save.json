QTc \\>450 msec for males and QTc \\>470 msec for females using the Fridericia Formula.\n11. History of or any concurrent condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that in the Investigator's opinion might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate.\n12. Clinically active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.\n13. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy post-HSCT at the time of screening with R/R leukemia (must be off all systemic immunosuppression therapy for at least 2 weeks and calcineurin inhibitors for at least 4 weeks).
