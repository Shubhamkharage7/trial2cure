            "briefSummary": "This research is being conducted to understand if treatment can be tailored for participants with HPV-related oropharynx cancers using both clinical features (stage of the tumor, smoking status) combined with an investigational HPV blood test.\n\nThe names of the test and treatments involved in this study are:\n\n* NavDx\u00ae HPV ctDNA testing (HPV blood test)\n* Radiation therapy\n* Chemotherapy: Cisplatin, or Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (not all participants receive any or all of these agents)",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study involves HPV DNA testing (a blood test that measures the levels of DNA from the human papillomavirus in the bloodstream which investigator think sheds from the cancer itself), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for some participants.\n\nThe research study procedures includes: screening for eligibility, and study treatments including evaluations and follow-up visits.\n\nThe names of the test and treatments involved in this study are:\n\n* NavDx\u00ae HPV ctDNA testing (HPV blood test)\n* Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy alone or combined with chemotherapy is considered a standard treatment for this disease. The investigators are researching the effectiveness of reducing the radiation doses and, in some cases, also reducing the chemotherapy dose for certain participants with favorable clinical characteristics and with certain HPV blood test results.\n* Chemotherapy: Cisplatin, or Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (not all participants receive any or all of these agents)\n* Study treatment will for up to 7 weeks and participants will be followed for 5 years from the beginning of the study.\n* It is expected that about 145 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe HPV ctDNA levels will be measured using a blood test called NavDx\u00ae, which will be provided free of charge from the company NAVERIS. ctDNA testing refers to circulating tumor (ct)DNA or measuring DNA fragments floating in the bloodstream that are released from the cancer cells. This testing has shown promise in early detection of cancer recurrence in several solid tumor types (including colorectal, urothelial, and breast cancer). Additionally, recent studies have shown a connection between baseline ctDNA levels and disease risk.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved NavDx\u00ae as a method for guiding treatment decision-making, but this is an important part of this research study. While the NavDx\u00ae assay is investigational, it is performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certified clinical laboratory and is currently available as a clinical tool for measuring HPV ctDNA levels in some cancer patients. CLIA regulations include federal standards applicable to all United States facilities or sites that test human specimens for health assessment or to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease\n\nThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied. Radiation therapy alone or combined with chemotherapy is considered a standard treatment for this disease. The investigators are researching the effectiveness of reducing the radiation doses and, in some cases, also reducing the chemotherapy dose for certain participants with favorable clinical characteristics and with certain HPV blood test results."

Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with AJCC 2017 8th edition stage IVC (metastatic) disease; or patients with fixed cervical nodal disease suggesting extranodal extension or N3 disease as suggested by lymph nodes measuring \\>6 cm.\n* Subject who has had prior radiation and/or chemotherapy for head and neck cancer.\n* Any history of oncologic surgical resection (transoral robotic surgery, TORS) or oncologic neck dissection prior to undergoing definitive RT or chemoradiation. Note: prior tonsillectomy as part of identification of the primary tumor site or biopsy and excisional nodal biopsy is/are acceptable provided the patient would be standardly treated to definitive treatment doses of therapy off protocol. Patients with HPV-associated unknown primary should not have undergone a neck dissection to be eligible.\n* Undetectable baseline HPV ctDNA result by NavDx\u00ae testing or detectable baseline HPV ctDNA result for subtypes 18, 31, 33, or 35.\n* Pregnant or lactating women.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer, and low risk prostate adenocarcinoma being managed with active surveillance. A history of another separate malignancy in remission without evidence of active disease is permitted if chance3 of recurrence is thought to be low.",
