            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will conduct a double-blinded, single-institution, randomized controlled trial to compare patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscus repair with post-operative rehabilitation protocol as (1) a standard-of-care rehabilitative protocol with a non-occlusive blood pressure cuff (inflated to 20-30 mm Hg) applied to the operative extremity versus (2) blood flow restriction training with cuff occlusion applied to the operative extremity. Patients will be enrolled prospectively and pre-operatively at their initial clinic visit after meniscus injury.\n\nRehabilitative exercises would be advanced per the physical therapists' discretion with similar exercises for patients in both groups for direct comparison. These exercises are part of an already-established post-operative protocol that is in place, with the only difference being the addition of the blood flow restriction protocol in the intervention group. All patients would undergo their supervised post-operative rehabilitation at our institution."
