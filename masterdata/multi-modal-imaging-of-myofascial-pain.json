They will undergo all three imaging techniques and complete a number of patient questionnaires over the course of a single study visit. The study team will then identify candidate biomarkers capable of differentiating between healthy (no myofascial pain) and those with active pain to target in a future clinical trial."

The imaging biomarkers will be measured for each participant, including tissue stiffness, hydration, inflammation, blood oxygenation and flow, electrical activity, etc. The biomarkers will be measured and compared in the univariate fashion, which means we assess the differentiation performance for each biomarker independently. For each biomarker, we will compare the difference between the participant groups, using the Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The statistical power will be estimated based on the effect size (Cohen's d) of difference between the participant groups. With an expected effect size of \\>0.9, the proposed sample size can achieve a statistical power greater than 0.8.",
