            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 2 different types of Home Exercise Programs (HEP) on mobility in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Specifically, we will be comparing the Standard of Care (SOC) a program based on aerobic conditioning and calisthenics to a Task Specific Program (TSP).\n\nPrimary Question: Will persons with who receive a Task Specific HEP have greater improvement in mobility than those who receive the SOC? Secondary question: Will a task specific HEP be as well tolerated as the SOC HEP by persons with MS",
            "detailedDescription": "Persons with MS have been shown to benefit from exercise to address the symptoms of their disease. Exercise programs are customarily given by Physical Therapists (PT) in either an inpatient or outpatient setting. Outpatient PT is typically augmented with a Home exercise Program (HEP) which is meant to enhance the work that is done directly with the PT. Since the amount of exercise done at home is often greater than what is done with the PT, the HEP is of great importance.\n\nHowever, the types of exercise that are the most useful for useful for persons with MS has not been established. Previous research has shown that due to the unique ways in which MS can affect the nervous system, exercise programs that may be appropriate for persons without MS may not be ideal for those that have the disease"
