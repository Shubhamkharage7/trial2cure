The study will be conducted in three parts. Part 1 Monotherapy Dose Escalation, Part 2 Combination Dose Escalation and Part 3 Dose Expansion (Monotherapy and Combination therapy).\n\nPart 1, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered alone in escalating dose levels to eligible subjects who have advanced solid tumors.\n\nPart 2, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered at escalating dose levels in combination with a PD-1 targeting agent or with a VEGFR TKI to eligible subjects who have advanced solid tumors.\n\nPart 3, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered alone as a monotherapy at the determined recommended dose in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic, relapsed or refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). ABBV-CLS-484 will also be administered at the determined recommended dose in combination with a PD-1 targeting or with a VEGFR TKI agent in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic, HNSCC, NSCLC, MSI-H tumors refractory to PD-1/PD-L1, and advanced ccRCC."
