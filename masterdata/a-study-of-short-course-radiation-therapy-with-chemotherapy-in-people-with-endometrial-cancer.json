This includes but is not limited to: uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days) myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, and superior vena cava syndrome.\n* Patients unfit for pelvic radiation therapy due to the following:\n\n  * Has had radiation therapy encompassing \\>20% of the bone marrow within 2 weeks, or any radiation therapy within 1 week prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n  * Patients with a history of pelvic radiation.\n  * Patients with a history or current diagnosis of a vesicovaginal, enterovaginal, or colovaginal fistula.\n  * Any hematological abnormality or disorder that would be a contraindication to radiation per the treating physician.",
