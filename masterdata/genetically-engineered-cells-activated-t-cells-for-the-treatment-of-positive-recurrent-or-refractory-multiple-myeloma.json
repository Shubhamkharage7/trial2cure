            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of MUC1-activated T cells in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) and is positive for expression of the MUC1 protein. T-cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill cancer cells. MUC1-activated T-cells are made from the body's own T cells. The manufactured T-cells are made to target the MUC1 genetic marker and may help the body's immune system identify and kill cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the toxicity of in-house, manufactured MUC1-activated T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory MUC1-expressing multiple myeloma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Obtain preliminary efficacy associated with MUC1-targeting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived T cells in conjunction with cyclophosphamide (CTX) in MUC1-expressing multiple myeloma patients.\n\nIa. Assess best objective response observed based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and duration of any partial or complete responses (partial response \\[PR\\] or complete response \\[CR\\]).\n\nIb. Assess progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival. II. Determine feasibility of production and administration of MUC1-targeting PBMC-derived T cells and ability to proceed with T cell dose escalation.\n\nIIa. Assess the feasibility of in-house preparation of in vitro-sensitized T cells.\n\nIII. Evaluate the safety, including all grades of neurotoxicity immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity (ICANS) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as determined by American Society of Transplantation and Cell Therapy (ASTCT) criteria, by monitoring adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, and other safety parameters.\n\nIV. Estimate the incidence of Grade 3 or higher of neurotoxicity and cytokine release syndrome by Grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity (ICANS) or CRS per the ASTCT criteria.\n\nV. Assess efficacy of a single dose of MUC1-activated T cells.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Perform analyses of Vbeta usage by T cell receptors (TCR) to see whether culture expansion generated TCR oligoclonality; whether such T cells persist in the circulation following adoptive transfer; and whether such persistence significantly correlates to objective responses.\n\nIa. Levels of Vbeta alleles on CD3+ T cells in blood by antibody staining or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing (Adaptive Biotechnologies).\n\nII. Characterize the changes in cytokine levels over time. III. Determine whether T cells recognizing MUC1 in an major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted manner in culture (intracellular IFN-gamma assays) correspond to therapeutic efficacy upon subsequent adoptive transfer.\n\nIV. Determine the immune phenotype of the immune cells, the inhibitory profile, and transcription factors using multi-color flow cytometry.\n\nV. Assess hospital resource utilization and health economics.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MUC1-activated T-cells.\n\nLYMPHODEPLETION (LD) CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days -5, -4, -3.\n\nAUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (ASCT): Patients receive MUC1-activated T-cells IV over 10 minutes to 1 hour on day 0.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 28 and every 90 days for up to 2 years."
