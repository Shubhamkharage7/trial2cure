Compared to the control condition, evening-exercisers prescribed morning exercise will exhibit improved sleep quality (increased efficiency, decreased fragmentation) and increased sleep duration.\n\nAim 2. Compared to the control condition, evening-exercisers prescribed morning exercise will exhibit improved mood (increased positive affect, decreased depression, anxiety and anger).\n\nAim 3. Compared to the control condition, evening-exercisers prescribed morning exercise will exhibit decreased stress and increased productivity."
