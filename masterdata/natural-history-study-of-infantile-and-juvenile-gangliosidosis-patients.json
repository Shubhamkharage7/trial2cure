This study aims to build a natural history data set through collection of a number of clinical, imaging, and laboratory assessments that may be specific predictors of GM1 disease progression and clinical outcome. Having a GM1 natural history data set can inform potential efficacy endpoints and biomarkers for future clinical trials.\n\nThis natural history study will follow up to 40 subjects diagnosed with GM1 gangliosidosis (up to 20 infantile (Type 1) and 20 late infantile/juvenile (Type 2)) for up to 3 years. Visits will be conducted every 6 months, during which several procedures will be performed and the data recorded in order to learn about the natural course of the disease, including changes in clinical and neurological assessments and electrophysiologic, imaging and biofluid biomarkers. Study procedures include: physical \\& neurological exam, blood \\& urine sample collection, questionnaires \\& assessments of development, seizure diary, ECHO, ECG, x-ray and ultrasound (if MRI not performed), EEG and genetic testing (if not already done).\n\nThe following procedures are subject to local/institutional policies and the medical discretion of the Study Physician: MRI, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and General anesthesia/sedation (for MRI and LP)."
