Phase 2a and 2b are intended to be conducted in parallel and will not be initiated until after review of the Phase 1 results and approval to proceed to Phase 2 by the FDA.\n\nUp to 3 distinct targets may be treated per subject. The maximum total dose exposure is 30 minutes for one session. Subjects may return after at least 21 days and after all AEs have resolved for an additional session on the same side. Subjects may return after imaging follow-up for inclusion of their contralateral side."

BWL uses short multi-cycle bursts of low amplitude ultrasound to induce stone fracture. This is in contrast to traditional extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), which employs a brief single compression/tensile cycle of high amplitude (shock) waves to achieve stone fracture. Ultrasonic propulsion uses long multi-cycle bursts of low amplitude ultrasound to move stones within the collecting system.",
