            "briefSummary": "The overall goal of this study is to determine whether English-speaking adults who were discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU) at least one month ago and have some level of distress related to their ICU experience will be interested in, willing to use, and satisfied with a new mobile application (app) designed to help the user process a difficult memory. Participants must have internet access and a smartphone in order to use the app. The goal of the app is to help reduce the psychological distress associated with a memory by processing that memory at one's own pace with app guidance. Participants will be asked to use the app for 6 weeks at least 3 times a week for 30 or more minutes at a time. Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires over a 12-week period.\n\nThe investigators aim to test how possible and realistic it is for people who were hospitalized with a critical illness to voluntarily use this app to process relevant distressing memories of their hospitalization. The investigators hope that these results will inform the design of a larger trial that will be able to test if this app can reduce distress in this patient population, as the app may offer affordable and accessible help for some patients experiencing illness-related distress.",
            "detailedDescription": "Critical illness can be an incredibly traumatic experience, often involving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation or other invasive medical procedures, altered levels of consciousness, inability to communicate, sensory and sleep deprivation, physical pain, and delirium. The cumulative physical and psychological stress associated with critical illness can be severe enough to induce clinically-significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients with PTSD symptoms related to prior traumatic medical events are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and medication nonadherence.\n\nExposure therapy (ET) is considered the gold standard treatment for PTSD and involves repeated exposure to trauma-related stimuli leading to habituation of maladaptive emotional responses and an increased sense of control and self-competence. ET is highly effective for improving PTSD triggered by more typical forms of trauma, such as military combat or sexual assault, but less is known about the role of ET for reducing PTSD symptoms after critical illness.\n\nThe goal of this pilot study is to conduct preliminary testing of a newly developed mobile application (Messy Memories) that uses remotely delivered ET to reduce psychological distress and improve health behaviors in survivors of critical illness. The user is asked to audio record a traumatic or distressing memory and process what it feels like to re-experience the memory. Users can return to their recorded memory as often as they like until it becomes easier to re-experience.\n\nThe investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting and engaging critical illness survivors in the Messy Memories intervention. They will also explore the efficacy of the intervention for engaging the mechanistic target (PTSD symptoms) to reduce psychological distress. Additional outcomes will include reduction in other psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and improvement in health behaviors (e.g., sleep patterns, physical activity). The results of this study will form the basis of a future adequately powered randomized controlled trial testing whether the Messy Memories intervention can significantly reduce psychological distress and, in turn, improve behavioral outcomes among critical illness survivors.\n\nAim 1: Assess the feasibility of recruiting and engaging critical illness survivors in a mobile application-based exposure therapy intervention (Messy Memories). Hypothesis: The intervention will be feasible based on recruitment, retention, and completion rates of \u226570%.\n\nAim 2: Assess the acceptability of recruiting and engaging critical illness survivors in a mobile application-based exposure therapy intervention (Messy Memories). Hypothesis: The intervention will be acceptable based on participant satisfaction ratings of \u226570% and qualitative analysis of exit survey responses.\n\nAim 3 (exploratory): Assess engagement of the mechanistic target (PTSD symptoms) by the mobile application-based exposure therapy intervention (Messy Memories). Hypothesis: Participants will report improvement in PTSD symptoms, based on pre-/post-intervention decrease in scores on the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (PCL-5).\n\nParticipants will be asked to engage with the Messy Memories application at least 3 days a week for at least 30 minutes each day using their own mobile smartphone device. Participants may proceed through the modules of the application at their own pace and may return to any module as many times as they desire throughout the 6-week intervention period. Mechanistic target and clinical symptom assessments will occur at Week 0 (baseline), Week 3 (mid-intervention), Week 6 (end of intervention), and Week 12 (follow-up). All study procedures, including eligibility screening, consent process, outcome assessments, and exit surveys, will be conducted remotely via telephone or Zoom video conference."
