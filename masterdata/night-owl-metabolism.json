Both groups will undergo 2 OGTTs (aligned and mis-aligned with chronotype) to compare glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity within-subject (primary outcome) and between groups (Aim 1). Then, youth will also undergo two standardized meals (aligned and mis-aligned with chronotype) while wearing continuous glucose monitoring to compare post-prandial glucose excursions within-subject and between groups (Aim 2). A pilot Exploratory Aim 3 (n=12 per group) will investigate delayed melatonin patterns under dim-light as a potential pathophysiologic mechanism behind abnormal glucose tolerance in youth with late chronotype on morning OGTTs."
