Measuring levels of specific targets such as Bim and soluble PD-L1 during therapy may help track treatment resistance and clinical outcomes. This information may also help researchers determine why some people with melanoma, lung and other cancer types respond to PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and others do not.",

Identify the mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD-1 blockade. III. Quantify and modulate levels of NKG7 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in CD8+ T cells.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients undergo blood sample collection throughout the study. Patients also undergo optional stool sample collection and have their medical records reviewed on study. In addition, patients provide previously-collected tissue sample, if available."
