            "briefSummary": "Spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT or GRID) addresses some limitations of traditional stereotactic body radiation therapy by relying on beam collimation to create high-dose \"peaks\" and intervening low-dose \"valleys\" throughout the target volume. Standard palliative radiotherapy regimens provide limited durability of response, and there are challenges with delivery to large tumors or in previously irradiated fields. In this study, Proton GRID radiotherapy will be used to deliver three-fraction palliative radiotherapy to patients with tumors needing palliative radiation. The safety and efficacy of this approach will be assessed. It is hypothesized that GRID is highly effective, immunogenic, and associated with low rates of toxicity."

This includes continuing a treatment plan which was initiated prior to the start of radiotherapy. A 2-week washout is recommended, but not required.\n* Pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 20 days of study entry.\n* Patients with HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are \\< 350 cells/mcL or they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months prior to registration.
