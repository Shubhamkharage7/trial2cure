The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does Delayed Cord Clamping at 120 seconds (DCC-120) or Delayed Cord Clamping at 30 seconds (DCC-30) after birth lead to better health outcomes?\n* Does DCC-120 seconds or DCC-30 seconds after birth lead to better neuromotor outcomes at 22-26 months of infant age (postnatal)?\n\nParticipants will be asked to do the following:\n\n* Participate in either DCC-120 or DCC-30 at birth (randomized assignment).\n* Complete General Movements Assessment (GMA) at 3-4 months of infant age (postnatal), complete questionnaires / surveys at this time.\n* Complete questionnaires / surveys at 9-12 months of infant age (postnatal).\n* Complete Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE), Developmental Assessment of Young Children 2 Edition (DAYC-2), and questionnaires / surveys at 22-26 months of infant age (postnatal).\n* Permit data collection from electronic medical records for both the mother and infant study participants.\n\nInvestigators will compare DCC-120 vs. DCC-30 to see which approach is more beneficial to both the mother and baby with CHD.",

The DAYC-2 uses a norm-referenced sample to establish standardized scores in each domain, allowing investigators to compare the results to infants of similar age. Percentile ranks, and age equivalents are provided for each domain. Elements are graded on a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" scale, with \"Yes\" being 1 point and \"No\" being 0 points. In general, higher scores reflect better expected outcomes.",

This questionnaire will examine parental perspectives with regards to health and neurodevelopmental outcomes, as compared to those commonly used in pediatric medicine. For example, parents / caregivers may place greater emphasis upon their child being able to conduct physical activity as compared to how well they perform tasks (fine and gross neuromotor function). Additionally, parents may express concern for their infant being able to eat without requiring a feeding tube, or breathing without the need for assistance or additional oxygen support. The survey will also seek to determine areas in which parents / caregivers feel there is room for improvement as it applies to their infant.

The ECHO Core will make the final FCDSS determination for eligibility status and stratification assignment.\\]\n\n   \\[NOTE: A fetal diagnosis of CHD rated as 3 - 6 FCDSS per local review, including borderline cases, will be used to determine preliminary eligibility for consent. Among borderline cases, eligible patients will be included if there is a reasonable expectation of the need for surgery or cardiac catheterization during the birth hospitalization.\\]\n2.
