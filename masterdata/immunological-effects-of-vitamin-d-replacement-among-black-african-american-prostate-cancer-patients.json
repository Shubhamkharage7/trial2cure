            "briefSummary": "This early phase I is to find out how common vitamin D insufficiency is among African American patients with a history of prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and how vitamin D insufficiency affects the immune system. This study also aims to find out if replacing vitamin D results in normalization of the immune function. Information from this study may benefit prostate cancer patients by identifying vitamin D insufficiency which in several studies had been found to contribute to more aggressive prostate cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency among black / African American (AA) prostate cancer patients.\n\nII. Determine the changes in circulating immunological cell function among patients with vitamin D insufficiency and the effects of vitamin D replacement on those changes.\n\nIII. Determine the acceptability of cholecalciferol (vitamin D) replacement therapy among black / AA prostate cancer patients and potential impact on health-related quality of life.\n\nIV. Determine if there are differences in the peripheral blood immunological cell function in black / AA patients with metastatic or locally recurrent prostate cancer compared to those with localized prostate cancer.\n\nV. Determine if vitamin D replacement is associated with improvement in progression free survival (PFS) of black/AA patients with prostate cancer with detectable changes in immune response compared to those with no detectable changes in immune response and compared to stage matched historical controls.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients with low vitamin D3 levels receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) daily for 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection throughout the study."
