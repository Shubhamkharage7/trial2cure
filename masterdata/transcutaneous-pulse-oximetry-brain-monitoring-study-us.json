The purpose of the study is to monitor the pressure in the brain using a monitor placed on the forehead, and compare this to a drain placed in the brain.",
            "detailedDescription": "The device is a non-invasive brain pulse oximeter. It uses red and near-infrared light and provides a signal which represents the change in blood volume associated with each heartbeat.\n\nThe brain signal allows a number of clinically important end-points to be determined, including brain blood flow, oxygen and pressure levels.\n\nThe T-Pot (US) Study will be undertaken in patients that require invasive brain monitoring.\n\nThe primary aim of the study is to assess the accuracy of the brain pulse oximeter compared with the traditional invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring."
