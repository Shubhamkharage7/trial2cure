            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome. Researchers think brain development may be controlled by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). They want to learn how abnormalities in the GABA system may contribute to ASD.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) creates short-term changes in how different parts of the brain communicate.\n\nEligibility:\n\nRight-handed people ages 14-17 with ASD, and healthy volunteers ages 18-25.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nMedicine review\n\nNeurological exam\n\nPsychological tests and rating scales\n\nForms and surveys.\n\nParticipants will have a hearing test and ear exam.\n\nParticipants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. They will lie on a table that moves in and out of the MRI scanner. They may look at a screen while in the scanner. A coil will be placed over their head.\n\nParticipants will have magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It takes pictures of chemicals in the brain using the MRI scanner.\n\nParticipants will have magnetoencephalography. They will sit in a chair. A helmet with magnetic field sensors will be placed on their head.\n\nParticipants will have TMS. A wire coil will be held on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil.\n\nParticipants will have electromyography. Sticky pad electrodes will be placed on the skin during TMS. The electrical activity of their muscles will be measured.\n\nParticipants will have rTMS. It uses short bursts of magnetic pulses to affect brain activity.\n\nASD participants will have 7 visits over 2-3 months. Healthy volunteers will have 3 visits over 3-4 weeks....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis will be a within-subject, controlled, proof-of-mechanism study.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe study aims to evaluate the relationship between local GABA concentration, structural and functional network connectivity and MEG measures of auditory and language processing in adolescents with ASD and the acute impact of a single session of continuous theta burst stimulation over left posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC) on these measures. We hypothesize that GABA concentrations, DWI measures of tissue microstructure and fcMRI obtained BOLD correlations within the language network will significantly contribute to the prediction model for MEG indices of auditory and language processing. Participation in the study involves about seven study visits. Some of the visits may be split up to shorten the length of session and limit fatigue. Visits will be scheduled about once a week. All visits must be completed within six months of the date of enrollment.\n\nPrimary Objective: The overall goal of the current study is to 1) Characterize the relationship between an individual's baseline local cortical GABA concentration, DWI measures of auditory and language network tissue microstructure, and fcMRI indices of local and long-range network functional connectivity (predictor variables) and MEG indices of auditory and language processing (dependent variables).\n\nSecondary Objectives: 2) Evaluate the impact of a single session of cTBS over the left pSTC on these MRS and MEG indices in adolescents (age 14-17) with ASD.\n\nExploratory Objective: 3) Characterize the relationship between the neuroimaging and electrophysiological indices obtained in this study and baseline behavioral symptom presentation.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n1. MEG: Evoked fields and Spectral Power\n2. MRS: GABA+/Cr concentrations in the left pSTC\n3. DWI: Diffusion derived parameters in the auditory radiations and arcuate fasciculus.\n4. fcMRI: BOLD correlations across pre-defined ROIs.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\na. MEG: Inter-trial gamma-band coherence (ITC) and resting state alpha to gamma phase-amplitude coupling.\n\nExploratory Endpoints:\n\na. SRS-2, CELF-5, EVT-3, PPVT-5, ADOS-2 (if available), ADI-R, VABS-III, WASI-II, CBCL."
