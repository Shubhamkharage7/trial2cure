Participants will take a consent questionnaire prior to consenting to ensure the voluntary nature and understanding of study procedures. Participants will undergo a screening visit including diagnostic interviews, clinical laboratory assessments and an EKG to determine eligibility. If eligible, participants will be admitted in-patient to UNC Hospitals and administered a continuous 60-hour infusion of Zulresso using the approved FDA REMS protocol for postpartum depression. A target dose of 90 \u03bcg/kg/hour will be administered over a period of 2.5 days following a strict tapering schedule. Monitoring will occur for an additional 12 hours after the infusion. The subject will participate in 6 follow up visits at day 7 post-infusion, day 14, day 21, day 30, day 60 and day 90."
