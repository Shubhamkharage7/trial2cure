            "briefSummary": "The research program will evaluate the theoretical claim that age-related memory and cognitive decline in humans result from the inefficient orchestration of rhythmic activity within large-scale cortical networks. The results will contribute to the basic science groundwork for developing future non-pharmacological interventions aimed at boosting memory and cognition in aging and clinical populations.",
            "detailedDescription": "We hypothesize that aged-related memory and cognitive impairments emerge from large-scale functional dysconnectivity, and by stimulating the brain noninvasively with extremely weak levels of electrical current, we may be able to re-synchronize connectivity and stabilize or improve memory and cognitive function, measured behaviorally. The experiments of this project are proposed as between-subjects, sham-controlled, and double-blind in design, and use noninvasive electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements of rhythmic brain activity. The experimental intervention involves the application of low-intensity, high-definition, transcranial electrical current stimulation while subjects perform a variety of computer-based tasks that probe memory and cognitive function."
