The following assessment will be made before and after\n\n1. Visual analogue scale (VAS).\n2. Quantitative sensory testing (QST). It includes non-invasive assessment of tactile sensation threshold (TST), electrical sensation threshold (EST), electrical pain threshold (EPT), and thermal thresholds.\n3. Hear rate variability (HRV). It consists of 5-minute electrocardiogram (ECG) recording before and after a treatment session."
