            "briefSummary": "This project seeks to determine the effectiveness of two types of interventions to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke in residential buildings. One intervention is geared toward all building residents (resident endorsement) and the other targets smokers (smoking reduction via relocation and reduction in personal smoking/cessation) with the goal of reducing personal smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.",
            "detailedDescription": "Smoke-free housing policies in multi-unit housing are promising and increasingly widespread interventions to reduce smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. Little research has identified factors that improve compliance with smoke-free housing policies in low-income multi-unit housing and test corresponding solutions.\n\nThe proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) addresses key gaps in knowledge and capitalizes on key scientific opportunities by: 1) leveraging the federal mandate to ban smoking in a public housing system of more than sufficient size to conduct an adequately powered RCT; 2) expanding our understanding of smoke-free policy compliance beyond policy implementation by testing two novel treatments: a) in-residence smoking cessation and b) resident endorsement, while 3) addressing population and location-specific tobacco-related disparities.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the relocation/cessation plus resident endorsement intervention will yield significantly larger reductions in personal smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, compared to standalone interventions and the standard approach."

            "description": "Data from approximately 512 participants will be released to sponsor (NIH) once the final dataset is analyzed and main findings are accepted for publication to support and validate study findings. This will include participant demographics, data from interviews, and laboratory data from saliva samples. Identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecimens could be used for future research studies without additional consent from the subject. De-identified participant data may be utilized for the purposes of repeated analyses by other researchers to verify findings, and/or to promote further research with new or alternative hypotheses. The mechanism of distribution will be a data sharing agreement.",

With the data sharing agreement in mind, the data can be made available for the duration of time needed to conduct analyses.",

Individuals should also express their intended use of the data. These requests will be routinely reviewed by the principal investigator \\[and/or designated team member\\]."
