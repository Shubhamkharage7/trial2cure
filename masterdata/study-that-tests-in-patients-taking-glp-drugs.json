One arm consists of patients concomitantly taking tirzepatide, semaglutide or liraglutide, and a second comparator arm consists of patients not taking any GLP drug but who otherwise would meet the criteria for prescribing a GLP-1 (i.e., BMI\u226527). Each arm is composed of approximately 20 participants. The participants on GLP-1 must be on a stable maintenance dose that has remained unchanged for at least four weeks prior to enrollment. All study procedures, including open-label dosing of AD109, are the same for both arms; the arms differ only in concomitant GLP-1 use."

Positive screen for drugs with abuse liability is an important but not sole determinant of substance use disorder and study eligibility. Participants who use marijuana daily should be excluded.\n* A serious illness or infection in the past 30 days as determined by investigator.\n* Clinically significant cognitive dysfunction as determined by investigator.\n* Narrow angle glaucoma.\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing. Prior/Concomitant Therapy\n* Participants with prior use of mandibular advancement devices, nasal devices, or sleeping position devices for the treatment of OSA may enroll as long as the devices are not used during participation in the study.\n* Participants with history of chronic oxygen therapy are excluded.\n* Participants with implanted devices for the treatment of OSA are excluded (e.g., hypoglossal nerve stimulator, or investigational devices).\n\nPrior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience\n\n\u2022 Use of another investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to dosing.\n\nDiagnostic Assessments\n\n* Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) \"Suicidal Thoughts question response of thinking of or planning suicide.\n* Systolic blood pressure up to 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure up to 90 mm Hg is allowed in participants not currently treated with antihypertensives. If the participant is under the care of a healthcare provider managing blood pressure and on stable (at least 1 month) antihypertensive therapy, systolic blood pressure up to 145/90 is allowed at enrollment. If initial blood pressure (measured in triplicate, use average of final two readings) is above this enrollment threshold, it may be repeated up to a total of 3 times (each in triplicate) to confirm that the reading was not due to measurement technique or transient factors, with selection of the lowest repeated measure. The determination that blood pressure meets enrollment criteria involves the clinical judgment of the investigator interpreting blood pressure readings.\n* Unexplained or new identification of hepatic transaminases (AST or ALT) \\>2X the upper limit of normal (ULN) generally is exclusionary. However, elevation between 2-2.5 may be allowed with prior consent of the sponsor if evidence suggests it is due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or other condition that would not be expected to acutely worsen or require medical intervention during the course of the study.\n* Total bilirubin \\>1.5X ULN (unless confirmed Gilbert syndrome).\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate \\< 50 ml/min.\n* ECG abnormality indicative of clinically significant cardiac disease that may be adversely affected by AD109 Other Exclusions\n* Night- or shift-work sleep schedule which causes the major sleep period to be during the day, including on a rotating basis.\n* Frequent travel or jet lag is likely to interfere with study procedures or evaluations.\n* Employment as a commercial driver or other vehicle operator (includes independent contractors and ride-share services).\n* History of sleepiness-related motor vehicle accident (MVA).\n* Unwilling to use specified contraception.\n* Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would present an unreasonable risk to the participant, including nature or severity of OSA symptoms, or which would interfere with their participation in the study or confound study interpretation.\n* Participant considered by the investigator, for any reason, an unsuitable candidate to receive AD109 or unable or unlikely to understand or comply with the dosing schedule or study evaluations.\n* Subjects with a history of gastric weight loss surgery (i.e., sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, biliopancreatic diversion)",
