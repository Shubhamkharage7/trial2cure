            "briefSummary": "This is a first in human phase 1 study of AG01 an anti-Progranulin/Glycoprotein88 (PGRN/GP88) antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors. AG01 is a recombinant monoclonal antibody expressed in a CHO production cell line. The antibody AG01 binds to human PGRN/GP88, expressed on cancer cells.\n\nThis study will have a dose escalation portion (1A) to evaluate maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum administered dose (MAD), the safety and tolerability of AG01treatment before the dose expansion portion (1B) of the study is initiated. The dose escalation portion of this study (1A) will also be used to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AG01 antibody to be evaluated in the cohort expansion portion (1B).",
            "detailedDescription": "PGRN/GP88 is an 88 kilodalton glycoprotein produced by cells of epithelial or mesenchymal origin. It is an autocrine growth factor, which is overexpressed in several human cancers including breast and ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, non small cell as well as other tumors. High GP88 expression is associated with the malignant phenotype, increased proliferation and survival associated with drug resistance to some currently used therapeutic agents. Pathological studies have shown that PGRN/GP88 is an independent prognostic factor in several cancers including breast, non-small cell lung carcinoma, prostate and digestive cancers. High GP88 expression in tumor tissues is associated with decreased disease-free survival and increased mortality. In addition, in stage 4 breast cancer patients, high circulating level of PGRN/GP88 is associated with decreased overall survival.\n\nThis study will enroll patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies (1A) who failed one or more standard chemotherapy or targeted therapy regimens per SOC guidelines such as NCCN guidelines and for whom no standard therapy exists. In 1B portion of the study patients with triple negative breast cancer, hormone resistant breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma will be accrued. The treatment period (cycle) will consist of 28-day cycles, the AGO1 will be infused every 14 days. The dosing schedule/frequency of treatments for subjects in the dose escalation portion (1A) will be the same as for subjects in the expansion portion (1B)."
