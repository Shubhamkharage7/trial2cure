            "briefSummary": "Fasting hyperglycemia contributes disproportionately to nonenzymatic glycosylation and the microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the regulation of glucose concentrations in the fasting state relative to what is known about the postprandial state. The proposed experiment is part of a series of experiments designed to establish how glucagon and insulin interact with their receptors to control fasting glucose in health and in prediabetes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Decreased insulin action increases glucagon concentrations. In rodents, insulin signaling restrains glucagon secretion. It is unclear if this is the case in all (subtypes of) prediabetes. Impaired hepatic insulin action exacerbates glucagon's effects on endogenous glucose production. Also, insulin resistance in the \u03b2-cell impairs negative feedback inhibition of insulin secretion. This leads to hyperinsulinemia in rodents and humans. How these variables interact is unknown. This experiment will determine how insulin variably regulates fasting glucagon (and insulin) secretion directly, or indirectly, in prediabetes.\n\nThe inability of the proinsulin to insulin ratio to reliably predict \u03b2-cell integrity, endoplasmic reticulum stress and \u03b2-cell function has led to the identification of novel markers of \u03b2-cell health. In addition, the relationship of glucagon and insulin pulses will be quantified. Preliminary data shows that there is heterogeneity in these relationships even in normal fasting glucose. Th experiment will also determine how islet hormone / glucose crosstalk and pulse characteristics contribute to prediabetes."
