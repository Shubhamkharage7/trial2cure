Reward-related brain circuits will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nParticipants will include volunteers who report more than two prior uses of MDMA (also known as Ecstasy), when they were 18 years or older.\n\nThe investigators will recruit individuals who have previously tried MDMA rather than those who are MDMA-na\u00efve.\n\nParticipants will receive an oral dose of MDMA (80mg and 120mg) and placebo (saline) at 3 separate study sessions. Following established procedures, these three sessions will be randomized in a blinded protocol in order to limit expectancy effects.\n\nThroughout each session, participants will be monitored. Functional imaging will commence after the drug has reached peak levels, following previously established time courses for MDMA administered orally. Participants will also be monitored after the functional imaging session. Secondary effects of MDMA on behavior and self-reported experience will be assessed.\n\nIn the assessment of the acute effects of MDMA, the investigators will take into account the cumulative effects of prior drug exposure."

Have evidence or history of significant (controlled or uncontrolled) hematological, endocrine, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, coronary, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, immunocompromising, or neurological disease, including seizure disorder, or any other medical disorder judged by the investigator to significantly increase the risk of MDMA administration (participants with hypothyroidism who are on adequate and stable thyroid replacement will not be excluded).
