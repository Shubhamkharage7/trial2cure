As of November 2023 The BN-16-01 main study has completed active recruitment (20 subjects were accrued) and all safety and pharmacokinetics data have been analyzed with subsequent publications pending. Characterization of the safety and pharmacokinetics of letrozole in combination with standard of care treatments, such as TMZ has been completed for the main study and provides the rationale for initiation of a sub-study.\n\nA new sub-study \"Letrozole and Temozolomide\" expansion cohort has been opened to accrual. This Phase 1 expansion cohort of letrozole 15mg administered in combination with 50 mg/m2 metronomic temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with high grade gliomas. 19 subjects total (2 historical subjects from the main study and 17 new accruals) will be enrolled into this expansion cohort."
