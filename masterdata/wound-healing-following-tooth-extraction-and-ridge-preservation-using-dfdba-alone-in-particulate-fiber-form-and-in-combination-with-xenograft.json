            "detailedDescription": "The study plan is to extract non-molar teeth and graft with the various graft materials. Each subject will provide a single non-molar tooth site for study treatment. Following approx. 18-20 weeks of healing, the study team will harvest a core biopsy at the time of implant placement. The implant osteotomy is prepared with a trephine drill and the core inside the trephine is placed in 10% formalin for future processing and histomorphometric analysis. The core biopsy will be evaluated for the primary histologic outcome of % vital bone formation and the secondary histologic outcomes of % residual graft material, and % \"CT/other\" (fibrous tissue and marrow space). The study team will also evaluate the following secondary clinical outcomes using a custom measuring stent for each subject: change in ridge width; change in buccal ridge height and change in lingual ridge height. During the 18 to 20-week healing period, patients will be followed as needed per standard care to evaluate healing."
