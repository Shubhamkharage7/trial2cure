Several single-item symptom measures commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. The questionnaire was designed to be cancer-specific, multidimensional in structure, appropriate for self-administration, and applicable across a range of cultural settings. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher score represents higher symptomatology in each respective domain.",
