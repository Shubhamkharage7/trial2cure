Theorefore, it is vital to offer an intervention that can be just as effective yet more accessible than other available treatments targeting insomnia. That is why this study will investigate the efficacy and feasibility of an online ACT intervention for insomnia among college students. Specifically, Is an online ACT for college students effective in treating insomnia? And, is an online ACT for college students feasible and acceptable in treating insomnia? Participants will be randomized into one of two conditions: waitlist or online ACT guide. Participants will receive questionnaires at baseline, post-treatment (4 weeks), and 1-month follow up."

The ISI has been shown to be a valid, clinical questionnaire designed to gauge insomnia severity (Bastien, Valli\u00e8res, \\& Morin, 2001), is sensitive to treatment response (Morin, Belleville, B\u00e9langer, \\& Ivers, 2011), and has been agreed upon as essential for insomnia treatment efficacy studies (Buysse, Ancoli-Israel, Edinger, Lichstein, \\& Morin, 2006). Additionally, the ISI has been used a previous randomized control trails (RCT) among college student to determine treatment efficacy (Taylor et al., 2014).",
