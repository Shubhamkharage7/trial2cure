            "detailedDescription": "Study Design: This is a pilot randomized study with enrollment of 9 patients each to 4 groups: PREHAB+Surgery, No PREHAB+Surgery, PREHAB+Radiosurgery, and No PREHAB+Radiosurgery. Eighteen patients will be enrolled to receive each treatment type: surgery and radiosurgery. Within each type, patients will be randomized to PREHAB or NO PREHAB at a 1:1 ratio using stratified permuted blocks. The treatment modality will be determined by the patient and investigator(s) based upon collective consultations with neuro-otology, neurosurgery, and radiation oncology aligned with the Medical College of Wisconsin sporadic VS treatment guidelines.\n\nStudy Intervention: A PREHAB visit will be done once weekly for three weeks to determine exercise regimen prior to surgery or radiotherapy. Therapy includes balance exercises (twice daily), gaze stabilization exercises (12-20 minutes daily), and habituation exercises (as applicable). Standard surgical approaches including retrosigmoid, translabyrinthine, and middle fossa and radiosurgical (SRS) delivery will be determined based on current VS management guidelines and followed by study randomization to PREHAB."
