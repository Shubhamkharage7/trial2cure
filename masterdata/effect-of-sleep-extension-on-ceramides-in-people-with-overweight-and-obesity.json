            "briefSummary": "The overall goal is to determine how a sleep extension intervention (increasing time in bed) in individuals who maintain less than 6.5 hours sleep per night affects their plasma ceramides and insulin sensitivity. Participants will undergo a randomized controlled trial, with sleep extension (intervention) and healthy lifestyle (control) groups. The sleep extension is designed to increase participant's time in bed by 2 hours per night. Alternatively, the control group will receive basic health information (e.g., physical activity, goal setting, and nutrition when eating out).",
            "detailedDescription": "A randomized controlled trial with real-world sleep extension in adults with overweight and obesity who habitually obtain short sleep duration will be conducted. Group allocation will be 1:1 and research staff and participants will be blinded until the conclusion of the baseline segment. The sleep extension group will receive counseling and instruction to increase nightly time in bed by 2 hours per night. Participants randomized to control will maintain their habitual sleep habits in their home environment. The intervention segment will last 8 weeks regardless of group assignment. Both groups will have equal contact time with the study team.\n\nPrior to enrollment participants will complete a clinical overnight sleep disorders screening. Baseline consists of an \\~1-week ambulatory real-world monitoring segment. Following baseline, participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the sleep extension or control group for 8 weeks at home (intervention segment). Throughout the study, sleep duration will be monitored using an actiwatch wrist-device and a daily electronic sleep log. Following the baseline and intervention segments participants will complete rigorous overnight laboratory visits to assess plasma ceramides (targeted metabolomics assay) and insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp)."
