            "briefSummary": "This biospecimen collection study will evaluate the feasibility of engrafting and testing resected Central nervous system (CNS) tumors tumor tissue ex vivo to estimate drug response, in pediatric and adult subjects. CNS tumors display remarkable heterogeneity and unfortunately there are no reliable precision oncology platforms that can identify the most effective therapy for each patient. Recent work has demonstrated the success of functional precision oncology platforms using patient-derived explant (PDE) at predicting drug response in various cancers. Since PDEs maintain important aspects of tumor heterogeneity they may prove effective as functional models for CNS tumors. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a novel PDE platform to generate drug sensitivity scores from patients with central nervous system tumors in Pediatric and adult subjects having low- or high-grade CNS tumors resected. The secondary objective is to estimate the proportion of successfully scaled PDEs generated per given tumor size."
