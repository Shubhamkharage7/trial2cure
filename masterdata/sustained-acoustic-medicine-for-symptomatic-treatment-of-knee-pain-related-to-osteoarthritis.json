            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of long-duration low intensity therapeutic ultrasound (LITUS) to alleviate knee Osteoarthritis pain over a 24-week period.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of LITUS in subjects suffering from knee Osteoarthritis pain.\n\nSecondary objectives are to assess the ability of LITUS to improve joint function.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a 24-week study to clinically evaluate the effectiveness of the wireless Sustained Acoustic Medicine (SAM) device combined with diclofenac on symptoms of patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis. The class-II device, sam\u00ae, has been FDA-cleared for home use. On the first day of the study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain score before treatment. During the following 24 weeks, patients will self-apply their assigned treatment for the 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores will be recorded immediately before application of SAM device as well as at the completion of treatment. Assessments on quality of life \\& function, depression \\& anxiety, and sleep will be performed prior to the patient beginning the protocol, at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and at the conclusion of the protocol.\n\nOver 300 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study sites. The study is designed to reach a target patient population which includes rural citizens and socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals."
