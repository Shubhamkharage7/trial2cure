The secondary objective of this study is subject self-assessment through the Dermatology Quality Life Index (DQLI) and Hair-Growth Assessment (HGA) as well as investigator-assessment from baseline. Platelet rich plasma is an autologous blood product, and platelet rich plasma will be administered intralesionally for this study. The platelet rich plasma used for this study will be prepared using the Eclipse Easy Spin centrifuge. The duration of this study for participants is 8 months, including an initial screening visit, 6 monthly treatment visits, and a follow-up visit. Subjects eligible for this study are those diagnosed with frontal-fibrosing alopecia via biopsy and clinical assessment."
