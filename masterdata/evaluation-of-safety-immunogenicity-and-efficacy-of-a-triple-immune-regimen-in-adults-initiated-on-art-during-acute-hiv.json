            "detailedDescription": "A5374 is a phase I/IIa randomized, two-arm, double-blind placebo-controlled, multi-step strategy trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of therapeutic vaccination with chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdV)- and poxvirus modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-vectored conserved mosaic T-cell vaccines in a sequential regimen with the Toll-like Receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist vesatolimod (VES) and two broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the CD4 binding site and V3-loop base classes in individuals with HIV-1 who started suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute HIV-1.\n\nParticipants will be screened for eligibility and have a pre-entry visit. After determination of eligibility, participants will be randomized prior to entry to either the active intervention arm (Arm A) or the placebo arm (Arm B) in a 2:1 ratio.\n\nThe study consists of four steps including an analytical treatment interruption (ATI).\n\n* Step 1: Study Intervention and ART (67 weeks)\n* Step 2: Analytic Treatment Interruption (up to 24 weeks)\n* Step 3: ART Restart (24 weeks)\n* Step 4: Continuation of ATI (up to 24 weeks) Each participant will complete Step 1 and Step 2. At the end of Step 2, participants who have experienced virologic rebound will enter Step 3 and resume ART. Participants with continued virologic control for 24 weeks in Step 2 will enter Step 4 for an extended ATI.\n\nEach participant will be enrolled for up to approximately 110 weeks. The total time on study for each participant is dependent on the time spent in the treatment interruption steps (Step 2 and 4)."
