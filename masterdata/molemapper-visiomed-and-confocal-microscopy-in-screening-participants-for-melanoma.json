Analyzing images (photographs) made with three different portable imaging systems may be as good as a visit to a dermatologist's office for finding melanomas before they can spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the clinical utility of clinical images, digital dermoscopy images and in-vivo confocal microscopy for teledermatology.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To incorporate in vivo confocal images into the triage system in order to determine to what degree the information gathered in this modality changes the classification of a lesion assigned by a licensed dermatologist.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the potential improvement of virtual patient triage when adding digital dermoscopy images to clinical images presented by patients to their provider (via e-visit or e-consult).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants undergo imaging of suspicious moles via smartphone application (app) MoleMapper/Sklip app/native smartphone camera app, digital dermoscopy, and confocal microscopy. Participants then receive lidocaine subcutaneously (SC) and undergo shave or punch biopsy of suspected melanomas.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up within 1 week."
