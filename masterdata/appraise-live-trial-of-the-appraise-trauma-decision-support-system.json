Evaluate the robustness of the System (i.e., whether the software performs in real-time in accordance with a priori technical specifications during real-time clinical use);\n2. Evaluate whether the real-time display of the System causes distraction or confusion to clinicians treating the trauma patient such that its risks exceed its benefits;\n3. Collect pilot data to allow for a statistical power analysis to design a future clinical trial evaluating efficacy."
