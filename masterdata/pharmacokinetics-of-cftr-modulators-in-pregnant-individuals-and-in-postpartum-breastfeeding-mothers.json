            "briefSummary": "This study aims to evaluate the pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy, postpartum, and in breast milk in cystic fibrosis patients receiving a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) modulator, including Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor, Ivacaftor, or Lumacaftor.",
            "detailedDescription": "The advent of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) therapy has significantly increased the life expectancy for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\nAs a result, adults with CF are more likely to have families than they have in the past.\n\nAlthough the overall pregnancy rate among women with CF age 18-44 is declining (mirroring trends in the general population), the overall number of pregnancies is increasing due to the increasing number of adults with CF. However, little is known about CFTR modulator use in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, as outlined in a recent review of CF-therapies in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Presently, there is one report of an uncomplicated pregnancy during ivacaftor use, and one case of a successful pregnancy in a woman who was maintained on lumacaftor/ivacaftor with reported maternal and fetal drug levels. In this study, we aim to study the pharmacokinetics of CFTR modulators in pregnancy as well as while breastfeeding.\n\nThis information will hopefully improve counseling while offering them for CF patients given the tremendous improvements seen in non-pregnant adults."
