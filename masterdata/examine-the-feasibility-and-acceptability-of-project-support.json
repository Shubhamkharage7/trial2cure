Investigators hypothesize that Project Support will be feasible and acceptable as evidenced by benchmarks for recruitment, retention at post assessment, engagement, fidelity, and program satisfaction. Investigators will also explore trends on caregiver emotional support, parenting self-efficacy, and child mental health symptoms.",
            "detailedDescription": "Over two-thirds of children experience traumatic events such as child maltreatment, violence, or sudden or violent loss. Many of these children sustain significant emotional and developmental difficulties including trauma symptoms, aggression, and suicidality. Emotional support from a caregiver is theorized to buffer against the effects of trauma; however, many caregivers lack the self-efficacy and skills to effectively support their child, or struggle to apply these skills during the stressful time following trauma. Unfortunately, programs designed for caregivers following child trauma are scarce. Existing interventions are lengthy (lasting 8-20 sessions) and result in families placed on long waitlists. This proposal asserts the adverse effects of child trauma can be interrupted though a brief intervention (the Project Support Positive Parenting Module) that enhances supportive parenting - delivered via telehealth to families on waitlists for trauma-focused services. In this study, Investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept pilot trial with n = 30 families waiting for trauma-focused services. Investigators hypothesize that Project Support will be feasible and acceptable as evidenced by benchmarks for recruitment, retention at post assessment, engagement, fidelity, and program satisfaction. Investigators will also explore trends on caregiver emotional support, parenting self-efficacy, and child mental health symptoms. Long-term, this research will generate an effective intervention that addresses the needs of families affected by trauma, which can be scaled up to address other public health epidemics that impede supportive parenting and child development."

Attentive listening involves providing accurate and timely responses to show interest and keep the child engaged until they are ready to end the conversation. Comforting involves using the same attentive listening skills when the child is upset or distressed. Effective mastery of the listening and comforting skills also requires caregivers to withhold any non-listening or non-comforting responses (e.g., interruptions, criticisms).\n\nThe program is individually tailored such that caregivers with stronger skills could complete the program in less time (i.e., fewer sessions). Service providers educate caregivers about the skills, then engage in an iterative process of modeling the skills, engaging the caregivers in behavioral practice, and providing tailored, supportive feedback to help caregivers gain mastery.",
