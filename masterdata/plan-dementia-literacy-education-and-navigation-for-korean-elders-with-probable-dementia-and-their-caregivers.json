            "briefSummary": "Studies have shown that ethnic-racial minority elders are more likely to be neglected from appropriate dementia care in time than the white counterparts. Among minorities group, Korean Americans (KAs) are the 4th largest and one of the most rapidly growing Asian subpopulations and have been characterized as under-resourced and underserved population of dementia care. This research is being done to understand how an education and navigation support program led by trained community health workers (CHWs) helps Korean American elders with probable dementia and the Korean American elders' caregivers. In a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 288 dyads, the investigators' aims are to (1) test the effect of a community-based intervention delivered by trained CHWs for undiagnosed KA elders with probable dementia and the KA elders' caregivers, (2) evaluate the effect of the PLAN on improving caregiver's dementia literacy, self-efficacy in dementia care and service use, social support, depression, and quality of life at 6 months in comparison to usual care, and (3) examine whether the effect of PLAN differs across age, sex, English proficiency and education caregiver subgroups. Exploratory Aim 1 is to test the effect of PLAN on Korean elders with probable dementia and caregiver development of a plan regarding dementia care at 6 months in comparison to usual care. The other two Exploratory Aims are to test the applicability of this study in another environment: Exploratory Aim 2: Using an equity-informed human-centered design framework, scale PLAN for implementation in ethnic daycare and Exploratory Aim 3: Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of PLAN in ethnic adult daycare.\n\nAim 1 and Exploratory Aim test the following hypotheses: (1) Korean elders with probable dementia who receive the PLAN will have higher rates of linkage to medical service for dementia than those in the control group (Aim 1) and (2) Korean elders with probable dementia and the KA elders' caregivers who receive the PLAN will have higher rates of having a plan for dementia care than those in the control group (Exploratory Aim). Aim 2 tests the following hypothesis: Caregivers in the PLAN group will have higher dementia literacy, self-efficacy in dementia care and service use, social support, and quality of life, and lower depression than those in the control group."
