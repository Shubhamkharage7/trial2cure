The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 Does mavacamten treatment improve blood flow in the heart muscle?\n\nParticipants will take mavacamten at the direction of their treating physician. Participants will complete 2 myocardial Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scans. The first scan will be completed before participants start taking mavacamten. The scan will be repeated after 12 months of mavacamten treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, before-and-after investigation of the effect of mavacamten therapy on myocardial blood flows in adult human subjects prescribed mavacamten for clinical standard of care for oHCM. We hypothesize that 12 months of mavacamten therapy will improve myocardial blood flows as assessed by PET/CT. The investigation will take place at a single site. Participants who consent will be prospectively enrolled once mavacamten therapy has been approved by their health insurance/payer. Enrolled participants will undergo myocardial PET/CT before starting mavacamten and after 12 months of therapy."
