Oxygen saturation measurements (SpO2) will be obtained via pulse oximetry and invasive arterial oxygen measurements (SaO2) will be obtained via arterial blood samples as part of your clinical care and assessed by co-oximetry. The study will aim to enroll a diverse population to help us understand the impact of skin pigmentation.",

All data analyses specified below will be calculated and summarized by each of SpO2 sensors under test. Demographics and baseline characteristics, including sex assigned at birth, age, ethnicity, race, baseline height, baseline weight, BMI, skin pigmentation and sensor application site measurements will be summarized with descriptive statistics using the analysis set."
