The investigators will then develop and refine equity-focused implementation strategies with the community advisory board, comprised of community-based organization members, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church networks, clinicians, and community health workers (CHWs). In phase 3, the investigators will use a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness/implementation design with a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with MBTI and a waitlist control in Black women with insomnia. Specialists will assess and address social needs of Black women, and registered nurses will deliver the online MBTI intervention in the community settings. The focus of this registration is phase 3.\n\nThe study will contribute to equity-focused implementation science and policy decisions by providing multi-level implementation determinants, equity-relevant metrics, and contextual factors through community-engaged research and evaluation of the outcomes."
