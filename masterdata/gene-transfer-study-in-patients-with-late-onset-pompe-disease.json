Subjects will receive a single dose of AT845 delivered via intravenous (IV) infusion.\n\nUp to 3 nominal dose levels of AT845 are planned to be evaluated in this study. A single AT845 administration via IV infusion is planned for each subject. The initial dosing cohort received a single dose of 3x10\\^13 vg/kg of AT845. The second dose cohort will receive a single dose of 6\u00d710\\^13 vg/kg. The third dose cohort will receive a single dose of 1\u00d710\\^14 vg/kg. Dose escalation between cohorts will be based on evaluations of safety and in consultation with the independent DMC.\n\nThere will be a core observation period of 48 weeks with scheduled visits and assessments. Following the conclusion of the core observation period, subjects will be seen every 6 months for a safety follow-up visit for up to 5 years postdose."

Concomitant medications that may predispose the subject to peripheral neuropathy will be evaluated.\n* Subject has any clinically significant laboratory values (other than those directly associated with LOPD \\[e.g., GAA, serum creatine kinase (CK)\\]) that would preclude participation in the study.\n* Subject has clinically significant underlying liver disease at Screening, or has any of the following:\n* Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) \\> 5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Active hepatitis B or C, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HB core antibody (HBcAb), HBV-DNA positivity or HCV-RNA viral load positivity, respectively.\n* Negative viral load assays in 2 samples, collected at least 6 months apart, will be required to be considered negative. Both natural clearers and those who have cleared HCV on antiviral therapy are eligible.\n* Currently on antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C\n* Subject has serological or viral load evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2.\n* Subject has received drugs for treatment of myopathy or neuropathy with immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, IV immunoglobulin, rituximab) within 3 months prior to starting the study\n* Subject has a high risk for a severe allergic reaction to rhGAA (ie, previous moderate to severe anaphylactic reaction to alglucosidase alfa or and/or a history of sustained high immunoglobulin G \\[IgG\\] antibody titers to alglucosidase alfa that suggests a high risk for an allergic reaction to ERT).\n* Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to \u03b22 agonist drugs such as albuterol, levalbuterol, bitolterol, pirbuterol, terbutaline, salmeterol, which contraindicates pulmonary function testing.\n* Subject has an active viral infection based on clinical observation.\n* Subject has a history of or concurrent medical condition other than Pompe disease that could jeopardize safety of the subject or impact study results.\n* Subject has a history of, or currently has, a clinically important cardiac condition, such as an echocardiogram (ECHO) with ejection fraction below 40% or has symptoms or signs of cardiomyopathy that precludes enrollment.\n* Subject has a contraindication to study drug or to corticosteroids, or has demonstrated hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study drug.\n* Subject tests positive for GAA antibodies with titers \\> 1:50,000 total\n* Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to MRI contrast agents including gadolinium.\n* Subject has a known hypersensitivity to local anesthetics such as lidocaine.\n* Subject has a bleeding diathesis, e.g., due to anti-coagulation or anti-platelet treatments.\n* Subject has a concurrent medical condition (including uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol use disorder, certain autoimmune conditions, Lyme disease, active malignancy requiring chemotherapy and/or radiation, uremic nephropathy, known exposure to heavy metals) commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy. Other concurrent medical conditions that may predispose to peripheral neuropathy will be evaluated and action taken on a case-by-case basis, following discussion between the Investigator and Medical Monitor.\n* Subject has a history of diagnosed peripheral neuropathy or an abnormal NCS and/or mISS that is consistent with peripheral neuropathy.",
