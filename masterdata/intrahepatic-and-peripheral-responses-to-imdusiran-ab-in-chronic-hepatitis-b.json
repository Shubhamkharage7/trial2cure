The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* how well is it working in the liver\n* how does Imdusiran affect the hepatitis B virus\n\nParticipants will receive injections of Imdusiran, one injection every 8 weeks, for a total of 4 doses. They will also undergo 2 liver biopsies: one with the first dose of Imdusiran, and the second 8 weeks after the last dose of Imdusiran.",

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the intrahepatic concentrations of Imdusiran. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of Imdusiran on viral markers.\n\nUp to 10 participants will receive a total of 4 subcutaneous injections of 60mg Imdusiran (one injection every 8 weeks). They will undergo 2 liver biopsies: one with the first dose, and the second 8 weeks after the last dose. There is an optional third liver biopsy at the end of study (week 52)."
