            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test a brief psychological intervention given to individuals in the first days following childbirth who have experienced a potentially stressful childbirth. The treatment is aimed at preventing post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth and promoting maternal-infant bonding.\n\nIn the days following childbirth, participants will be asked to write about their childbirth experience or a neutral event for three consecutive days, for around 15 minutes each day. Additionally, they will complete a short survey before and after the intervention about their birth experience and mental health. Around 2 months postpartum, participants will take part in mental health and physiological assessments, and in a brief play session with their infant.",
            "detailedDescription": "Childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD) is a debilitating maternal mental disorder that undermines the well-being of mothers and can interfere with bonding with their infants during an important time of infant development. A significant portion of delivering women, particularly those who have experienced complicated deliveries, are at-risk for developing CB-PTSD. Underrepresented minorities are also at higher risk for CB-PTSD. An estimated 240,000 American women are likely to be affected by CB-PTSD each year.\n\nCurrently, there is no recommended intervention for individuals exposed to traumatic childbirth in hospitals in the United States. Immediate postpartum interventions delivered to at-risk women that are low-cost, low-burden, and feasible are lacking. This study will attempt to fill this gap in effective treatment. Evidence shows that expressive writing (EW), or briefly disclosing in writing mainly thoughts and feelings about a highly stressful event, can have positive effects on mental and physical health. Therefore, the investigators will test the therapeutic effects of EW about recent childbirth in women at-risk for CB-PTSD."
