Data on study feasibility, quality of life (QOL) and anthropometric measurements, and biomarkers will be collected and analyzed. After the study is completed, the investigators may also perform a post-hoc analysis on subjects who received adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with AET vs. AET alone."
