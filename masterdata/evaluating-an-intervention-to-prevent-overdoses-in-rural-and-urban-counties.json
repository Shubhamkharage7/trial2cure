            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and associated benefits and harms of integrating FTS education and distribution into select Project DAWN sites in rural and urban communities in Ohio.",
            "detailedDescription": "Purpose: Opioid-related fatalities are a leading cause of death in Ohio and nationally, with an increasing number of overdoses attributable to fentanyl. Rapid fentanyl test strips (FTS) test for the presence of some types of fentanyl in urine samples and are increasingly being used to check illicit drugs for fentanyl before they are used. FTS use is a promising harm reduction strategy and research shows when people who use drugs (PWUD) receive a positive result, they are more likely to perform overdose risk reduction behaviors. However, access to FTS is limited, and there are barriers to the adoption of this intervention in some communities. This study will investigate FTS distribution and education as a harm reduction strategy to prevent overdoses among PWUD. Study findings will contribute valuable information about the feasibility and acceptability of integrating FTS drug checking into Project DAWN sites in rural and urban communities in Ohio and help us achieve our long-term goal of reducing overdose deaths.\n\nStudy Design: Project DAWN sites that volunteer to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or non-intervention arm of the study.\n\nClients in the intervention arm of the study will receive:\n\n* One-on-one education on the purpose, benefits, and limitations of FTS testing\n* A brief 20-minute fentanyl test strip educational intervention, including a 2-3-minute video and hands-on demonstrations on how to use FTS\n* A supply of FTS upon enrollment and throughout the 2-year follow up period\n\nClients in the non-intervention arm of the study will receive:\n\n\u2022 FTS education and a supply of FTS will be offered to participants in the non-intervention arm in the last year of the study\n\nConsent: Written documentation of informed consent will be obtained from all participants.\n\nIncentives: Participants will be compensated for their time with a gift cards for completing the baseline survey, the survey at 6-months, and each biweekly survey.\n\nRecruitment and Retention: Having a close partnership with Project DAWN sites will help us recruit and retain study participants. In addition to key informant interviews in year one and questionnaires in year five, the research team will survey coordinators quarterly to collect data on Project DAWN site and coordinator experiences, identify concerns, and take corrective actions. The investigators will also maintain regular communication with Project DAWN site coordinators when the study staff are onsite.\n\nThe research team will handle all enrollment of study clients, delivery of the FTS intervention, and follow up with study participants. Project DAWN sites will be asked to provide a small space for the research team to enroll participants and provide the FTS intervention (if applicable). The sites will also be asked to refer potentially eligible individuals to the research team at times when they are on-site."

The video will be accessible to participants after study enrollment. Participants will be advised of the possibility of both false positive/negative results, and that the drugs may be mixed with other substances not detectable with FTS.
