            "detailedDescription": "There are three specific aims that this study will use to assess a new model of care aimed at treating opioid use disorder (OUD). These aims address whether treatment is maintained by patients, if patients' opioid use outcomes improve and to determine if adherence to treatment for infectious disease results in fewer re-hospitalizations and emergency room visits, as well as improved quality of life.\n\nThe specific aims:\n\nAim1: The primary outcome will be a binary indicator of whether a patient is enrolled in and receiving effective medication treatment for OUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or injection naltrexone) at 12 weeks (3 months) after randomization.\n\nAim 2: Evidence of improved opioid use outcomes (lower days of using opioids, negative urine opioids).\n\nAim 3: Have higher rates of completion of the antimicrobial regimen for their infectious disease, decreased re-hospitalizations and emergency room presentations related to either their infectious disease or OUD over the 12-week follow-up period, and improved measures of quality of life.\n\nThe intent of this study is to test the hypothesis:\n\nAssignment to the ID/LAB arm (OUD managed directly by the infectious disease (ID) specialists or hospitalist team with long acting injection buprenorphine (LAB)) will promote greater enrollment in effective medication treatment for OUD at 12 weeks after randomization, compared to TAU."
