            "briefSummary": "Adequate bowel cleansing is a critical component in the care of hospitalized patients undergoing colonoscopy. However, inpatient status is a well-established risk factor for inadequate bowel preparation. However, few strategies have been rigorously shown to reduce the risk of inadequate bowel preparation. Moreover, inadequate bowel preparation is frequently related to the poor tolerability of high volumes of bowel preparation in the medically complex and comorbid hospitalized population. Low volume bowel preparations have been developed that have been shown to be noninferior compared to high volume bowel preparation with regards to adequacy of bowel preparation but with improved tolerability. However, the use of low volume bowel preparations for colonoscopies have largely been evaluated in the outpatient setting. In this study, we plan to compare rates of adequate bowel preparation and tolerability of a low volume bowel preparation, MoviPrep, compared to standard high volume bowel preparation, GoLYTELY, in hospitalized patients undergoing colonoscopy. This study promises to highlight low volume bowel preparation as a viable and better tolerated alternative to high volume bowel preparation in hospitalized patients which may ultimately decrease delays in inpatient endoscopy as well as hospital length of stay."
