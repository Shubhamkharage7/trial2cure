Results from this clinical trial will provide valuable information to support guidelines of physical activity for people to improve musculoskeletal health, especially post-menopausal women. The scientific questions that will be investigated are:\n\n1. What are the acute effects of the daily timing of exercise on serum concentrations of bone turnover markers and 24-h total urinary calcium excretion?\n2. Are differences in initial exercise-induced responses of bone turnover markers and urinary Ca excretion maintained across two weeks of exercise training?"
