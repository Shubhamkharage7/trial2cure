Patients will be recruited by screening all patients undergoing surgical treatment for fractures at our institution. Patients who provide written consent will be randomized to one of two treatment arms after confirming eligibility criteria. Group A will be advised to begin early normal bathing (non-submerged showering) with uncovered surgical wounds. Group B will be advised to follow traditional delayed bathing with covered wounds.\n\nThose who do not wish to participate in the randomized trial will be invited to participate observationally (no randomization) and have the same prospective follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a single center, non-inferiority, parallel group, randomized control trial assessing the effect of early versus delayed bathing on orthopaedic surgical wounds in patients undergoing surgical treatment of fractures. Patients will be recruited by screening all patients undergoing surgical treatment for fractures at our institution. Patients who provide written consent will be randomized to one of two treatment arms after confirming eligibility criteria. Group A will be advised to begin early normal bathing (non-submerged showering) with uncovered surgical wounds. Group B will be advised to follow traditional delayed bathing with covered wounds.\n\nPatients will have follow-up with data collection at two, six and 12 weeks post-operatively. The primary outcome measure will be patient satisfaction as measured by a Likert Scale. The Likert Scale as utilized will be a patient reported outcome measure consisting of one question allowing the subject to express their attitude towards a particular subject: \"How satisfied are you with your surgical treatment\" with possible answers consisting of: \"very satisfied\", \"somewhat satisfied\", \"neutral\", \"somewhat unsatisfied\", and \"very unsatisfied\". The secondary outcome measures will be development of an infection (subcategorized as either superficial or deep) and development of peri-incisional inflammation (eg. adhesive rash).\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to compare patient satisfaction as measured using a Likert Scale associated with early and delayed surgical site bathing.\n\nSecondary Objectives: The secondary objective is to compare the infection rate of orthopaedic surgical wounds between early and delayed bathing.\n\nThose who do not wish to participate in the randomized trial will be invited to participate observationally (no randomization) and have the same prospective follow-up."
