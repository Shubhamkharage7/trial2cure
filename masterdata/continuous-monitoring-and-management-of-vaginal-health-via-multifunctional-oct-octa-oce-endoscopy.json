This technology is able to obtain a comprehensive image of the vaginal epithelium, blood vessels, and lamina propria. The primary focus of this study is establishing the Optical Coherence Tomography system's capability of capturing vaginal changes that occur before and after menopause, as well as before and after treatment with fractional-CO2 laser therapy.\n\nThere are two aims of this study.\n\nAim 1:\n\n1. To determine the feasibility and sensitivity of the integrated optical coherence endoscope to assess vaginal tissue integrity in pre, peri and postmenopausal women.\n\nAim 2:\n\nTo optically visualize the effects of fractional-CO2 laser treatment on vaginal tissue over the course of C02 vaginal laser therapy.",

The primary focus of this study is establishing the Optical Coherence Tomography system's capability of capturing vaginal changes that occur before and after menopause, as well as before and after treatment with fractional-CO2 laser therapy.\n\nThere are two aims of this study.\n\nAim 1: To determine the feasibility and sensitivity of the integrated optical coherence endoscope to assess vaginal tissue integrity in pre, peri and postmenopausal women\n\nWe will enroll up to 90 women (age: 18 and older) who will be classified as pre-menopausal, peri- menopausal, or post-menopausal. There will be 30 women in each group. All enrolled subjects will first complete informed consents.\n\nThey will then fill out a questionnaire (the vulvovaginal symptom questionnaire) about their vaginal health. This will be followed by a pelvic exam to determine the vaginal health (vaginal health index) and to obtain a vaginal swab for assessment of the vaginal microbiome .\n\nThis will be followed by OCT scan of the vaginal tissue. There will be only one visit.\n\nAim 2: To optically visualize the effects of fractional-CO2 laser treatment on vaginal tissue over the course of C02 vaginal laser therapy.\n\nUp to thirty Post-menopausal subjects with GSM who desire fractional-CO2 laser therapy, will be recruited.\n\nEach visit will include: completion of a questionnaire (the vulvovaginal symptom questionnaire) about their vaginal health; followed by a pelvic exam to determine the vaginal health (vaginal health index) and to obtain a vaginal swab for assessment of the vaginal microbiome and an OCT scan of the vaginal tissue before the CO2 vaginal laser treatment.\n\nThis group will have a total of three visits with CO2 laser treatments. There will be a fourth visit which will include all the above study procedures except the CO2 laser treatment.\n\nSubjects who complete 3 laser treatments will be offered participation in long term follow up with repeat OCT imaging every 3 months at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the final laser treatment to study the long- term effects of the laser treatment on the vaginal tissue."
