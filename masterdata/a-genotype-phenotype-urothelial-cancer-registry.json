This will let us look at large groups of people who do and do not have this kind of cancer.\n\nThe investigators will look at risk factors to learn more about how these impact cancer. The investigators will also look at genetic markers. These are genes that are found in a known place. They are often associated with a particular trait. If the gene changes in some way, it may predict cancer or response to treatment. The investigators will look for markers in your saliva.\n\nThis registry will help us develop better methods of:\n\nPreventing these cancers. Diagnosing these cancers. Treating these cancers."
