            "briefSummary": "The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat subjects with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most subjects. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD138 antigen (CAR138 T cells).\n\nIn previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical structure carrying the subject's genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD138. This antibody floats around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called multiple myeloma cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD138. Anti-CD138 antibodies have been used to treat people with multiple myeloma, but have not been strong enough to cure most subjects. For this study, the anti-CD138 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the multiple myeloma cells is attached to the T cells instead of the entire antibody. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD138 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cell Procurement Up to 300 mL total of peripheral blood (up to 3 collections) will be obtained from subjects for cell procurement. In subjects with a low CD3 count in the peripheral blood (less than 200/\u03bcl by flow cytometry), a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T-cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.\n\nCAR138 T-cell Administration Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days following lymphodepletion. The lymphodepletion regimen will consist of Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m\\^2 and Fludarabine 30 mg/m\\^2 IV each given daily over 3 consecutive days.\n\nDuration of Therapy Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days following lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine by a licensed provider (oncology registered nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 5-10 minutes through either a peripheral or central line. The expected volume is 1-50cc.\n\nTreatment with one infusion will be administered unless:\n\n* The subject decides to withdraw from the study, OR\n* General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.\n\nDuration of Follow-up Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will continue follow up for evaluation of progression free survival, overall survival and replication-competent retrovirus monitoring.\n\nSubjects who experience disease progression after receiving a cell infusion will still be required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.\n\nArms and Interventional ArmTitle : CAR138 T cells Description: The first 3 subjects enrolled in the study will receive 5x10\\^6 CAR138 T-cells/m\\^2 via infusion. The number of cells for the infusion will be increased to 1x10\\^7 CAR138 T-cells/m\\^2 and then, 2.5x10\\^7 CAR138 T-cells/m\\^2, 5x10\\^7 CAR138 T-cells/m\\^2, 1x10\\^8 CAR138 T-cells/m\\^2 and 2x10\\^8 CAR138 T-cells/m\\^2 in subsequent cohorts of 3 subjects provided no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed within 4 weeks of the cell infusion. Cohort enrollment will be staggered, requiring each subject to complete at least 2 weeks of safety monitoring following CAR138 T-cell infusion at the designated dose level for the cohort before another subject is allowed to enroll in the cohort."

The male partner of WOCBP subjects enrolled into the trial should use a condom and female participants must take the responsibility to inform their partners of the need to use a condom.\n\n   Not pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study).\n\n   No tumor in a location where enlargement could cause airway obstruction.\n\n   No diagnosis of any of the following conditions: amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome or multiple myeloma with CNS involvement.\n   * Subjects with plasma cell leukemia are allowed to participate.\n\n   No active inflammatory or infectious gastrointestinal disorder (e.g. infectious colitis, diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease).\n\n   No psychiatric illness which would prevent the subject from giving informed consent or neurological illness that clinician believes would complicate monitoring for CNS neurotoxicity following CAR-T infusion\n\n   Subjects are willing and able to comply with study procedures based on the judgment of the investigator or protocol designee.\n\n   No medical condition, which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the subject.\n\n   No other prior or concurrent malignancies with the exception of subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial at the investigator's discretion.\n\n   Adequate cardiac function is defined as:\n   * No ECG evidence of acute ischemia\n   * No ECG evidence of active, clinically significant conduction system abnormalities\n   * Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening not felt to put the subject at risk has to be documented by the investigator as not medically significant\n   * No uncontrolled angina or severe ventricular arrhythmias\n   * No clinically significant pericardial disease\n   * No history of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to registration\n   * No Class 3 or higher New York Heart Association Congestive Heart Failure\n\n   No active infection (fungal, bacterial or viral) including HIV, HBV , or HCV (tests can be pending at the time of cell procurement; only those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to generate transduced cells). Note: To meet eligibility, subjects are required to be negative for HIV antibody or HIV viral load, negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen, and negative for HCV antibody or HCV viral load.\n\n   Subjects must have autologous transduced activated CAR138 T-cells that meet the Certificate of Analysis (CofA) acceptance criteria.\n\n   Subjects must have stopped taking corticosteroids for at least 48 hours prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy; No current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses \u226510mg prednisone daily or its equivalent (those receiving \\<10mg/day prednisone equivalent may be enrolled at discretion of the Investigator)\n\n   Subjects must have stopped systemic chemotherapy for at least 14 days prior to lymphodepletion\n\n   Subjects must have stopped radiation therapy for at least 7 days prior to lymphodepletion\n\n   Subjects should have repeated multiple myeloma serologies performed within 7 days of lymphodepletion. If markers of measurable disease no longer fall within the guidelines outlined above (procurement eligibility criterion #5), the Principal Investigator should be contacted. In such an event, the subject may be allowed to receive lymphodepletion and CAR138 T-cell infusion if it is felt to be in the subject's best interests. The subject would not be evaluable for response (disease not measurable) but would be evaluable for all other safety and efficacy measures.\n\n   Subjects must demonstrate adequate organ function prior to lymphodepletion as defined below; all tests must be obtained within 72 hours prior to lymphodepletion.\n   * Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): \u2265 1000 cells/mm\\^3; subjects should not have received G-CSF or GM-CSF within 1 week or pegylated G-CSF (Neulasta) within 2 weeks of screening for lymphodepletion\n   * Platelets: \u2265 50,000 cells/mm\\^3; subjects should not have received platelet transfusion within 1 week of screening for lymphodepletion\n   * Calculated creatinine clearance: \u2265 30 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n   * Bilirubin: \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) unless attributed to Gilbert's syndrome\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): \u2264 AST \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): \u2264 AST \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN\n   * Pulse oximetry: \u226590% on room air\n\n   Has not received treatment with any investigational drug within 21 days or any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks prior to lymphodepletion.\n\n   No major surgery within 28 days prior to lymphodepletion.\n\n   Male subjects with female partners must have had a prior vasectomy or agree to use an adequate method of contraception (i.e., double barrier method: condom plus spermicidal agent) prior to lymphodepletion through 3 months after the last dose of study therapy.\n\n   Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to lymphodepleting therapy for female participants of childbearing potential. NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.\n3. Eligibility Criteria to be fulfilled prior to CAR138 T-cell infusion _______________________________________________________ Karnofsky score of \u2265 60%.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study (starting prior to procurement), and for 6 months after the study is concluded. WOCBP are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for \\> 1 year. The two birth control methods can be composed of: two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. The male partner of WOCBP subjects enrolled into the trial should use a condom and female participants must take the responsibility to inform their partners of the need to use a condom.\n\nNo tumor in a location where enlargement could cause airway obstruction.\n\nThe subject is willing and able to comply with study procedures based on the judgment of the investigator or protocol designee.\n\nNo medical condition which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the subject.\n\nAdequate cardiac function, defined as:\n\n* No ECG evidence of acute ischemia\n* No ECG evidence of active, clinically significant conduction system abnormalities\n* Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening not felt to put the subject at risk has to be documented by the Investigator as not clinically significant\n* No uncontrolled angina or severe ventricular arrhythmias\n* No clinically significant pericardial disease\n* No history of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to registration\n* No Class 3 or higher New York Heart Association Congestive Heart Failure\n\nNo active infection (fungal, bacterial, or viral)\n\nNo neurological illness that the clinician believes would complicate monitoring for CNS neurotoxicity following CAR-T infusion\n\nEvidence of adequate organ function as defined by:\n\n* Bilirubin \u22641.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless attributed to Gilbert's Syndrome\n* AST \u2264 5 times ULN\n* ALT \u2264 5 times ULN\n* Serum creatinine \u22641.5 time ULN\n* Pulse oximetry of \\> 90% on room air\n\nNo current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses \u226510mg prednisone daily or its equivalent; those receiving \\<10mg daily may be enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator.\n\nThe subject is a good candidate for treatment with CAR138 T-cells.\n\nSubject has no clinical indication of rapidly progressing disease in the opinion of the treating physician.",
