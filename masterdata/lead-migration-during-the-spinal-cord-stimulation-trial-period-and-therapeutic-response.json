Of note- scs trial period is a procedure name, not to be confused with this clinical trial study.\n\nThe main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is there a difference in migration distance and/or rate for those with external leads secured by an anchor device versus and anchor device with suture?\n* How does participant activity levels during the trial period compare to migration rates? \u00b0 Does the temperature, heat index, and humidity during the trial period impact migration rates? Participants will come in for the scs trial procedure as normal. They will be asked to complete an activity survey upon return to the clinic for lead pull after the scs trial. They will also have an additional image upon return to the clinic to document lead position prior to lead pull.\n\nResearchers will compare two groups- those with securement via anchor and those with securement via anchor and suture to see if there is an impact on therapeutic effect (percentage of pain relief) form the scs trial."
