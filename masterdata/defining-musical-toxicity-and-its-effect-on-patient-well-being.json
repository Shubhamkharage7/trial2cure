Discover any interventions or treatments which musicians found helpful while going through cancer treatment.\n\nIII. Investigate whether the priority of playing music changed through the course of cancer treatment and beyond, in relation to other priorities including cancer cure and length of life.\n\nIV. Discover treatment and cancer related factors which are correlated with worse musical toxicity.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nMUSICAL TOXICITY GROUP: Patients complete a questionnaire, participate in an interview and have their medical records reviewed on study.\n\nNO MUSICAL TOXICITY GROUP: Patients have their medical records reviewed on study."
