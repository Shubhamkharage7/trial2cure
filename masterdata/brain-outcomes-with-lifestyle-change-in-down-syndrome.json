The weight loss group will be asked to follow a reduced energy diet, attend monthly education sessions delivered remotely and self-monitor diet and body weight using commercially available web-based applications. The control group will be asked to attend remotely delivered monthly education sessions on general health education topics.\n\nAll participants will come to the University of Kansas Medical Center, 3 times across 12 months for a blood draw, cognitive testing, a MRI, assessment of height and weight, and assessment of diet intake."
