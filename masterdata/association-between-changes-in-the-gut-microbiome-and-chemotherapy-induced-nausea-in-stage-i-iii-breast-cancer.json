            "briefSummary": "This pilot study seeks to understand how changes in the bacteria composition (microbiome) of the gut may be associated with the occurrence of chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) in women undergoing chemotherapy for stage I-III breast cancer. Patients undergoing chemotherapy may experience nausea as a result of their treatment. Known risk factors for CIN do not explain the differences in CIN occurrence between patients, but changes in the functions of the gut microbiome may be related to the occurrence of CIN. This study collects stool samples from breast cancer patients before and after chemotherapy to evaluate how changes in the microbiome may be associated with CIN.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the feasibility of patient recruitment and retention, as well as specimen collection.\n\nII. Estimate the effect size for changes in gut microbiome composition profiles and metabolites in stool as well as blood from T1 to T2 that are associated with the occurrence of CIN.\n\nIII. Evaluate associations between patient reported demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities at T1, and changes in gastrointestinal and neuropsychological symptoms, food intake as well as exercise from T1 to T2 with the occurrence of CIN.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of stool and blood samples and complete questionnaires at baseline and 3-5 days following initiation of standard of care chemotherapy."
