The main objectives of this trial are:\n\n* Compare changes in social cognitive performance between the active vs. sham treatment groups\n* Compare changes in social cognitive network functional connectivity between the active vs. sham treatment groups\n\nEach participant will receive iTBS (active or sham) five days per week for four consecutive weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, clinical assessments, and cognitive tests will be performed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6 months after the completion of treatment."
