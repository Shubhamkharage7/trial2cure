This further increases metabolic and physical dysfunction. As such, obesity programs should not only focus on weight loss, but muscle metabolic health. Dairy nutrients have anti-inflammatory and anabolic properties, but mostly evaluated in isolation and/or pre-clinical designs. Also, it is unknown if the circulating benefits extend to the muscle. We hypothesize that dairy full-fat milk will improve these obesity characteristics."
