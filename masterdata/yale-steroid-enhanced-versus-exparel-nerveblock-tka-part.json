The secondary objective of this study is to test the effects of perineural use of B-DEX-MPA vs B-LB on the quality of postoperative recovery as well as surgical outcome and neuropathic pain among patients undergoing bilateral TKA.\n\nThis study will also assess if perineural B-DEX-MPA results in improved quality of postoperative recovery as compared to B-LB.\n\nThis will be a single center study at Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) performed at two clinical sites: York St. Campus (York Street, New Haven) and St. Raphael Campus (Chapel Street, New Haven). An anticipated 66 participants who are scheduled for primary, elective bilateral TKA will be enrolled."
