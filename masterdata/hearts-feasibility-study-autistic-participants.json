The 6 HEARTS sessions cover: healthy and unhealthy relationships, launching new relationships, neurohealth, meeting and reconnecting, boundaries, and healthy endings.\n\nParticipants who take part in this research study will be in this research study for three months. During this time, participants will be asked to complete two 30-minute and six 10-minute online surveys, and participate in two 20-minute interviews over Zoom."
