            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this pilot intervention study is to test the effectiveness of a self-management approach (combining education- and exercise-based strategies) for improving arthralgia (joint pain) associated with Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) in older breast cancer survivors. Survivors will be recruited from local cancer clinics prior to the completion of primary cancer treatment, as arthralgia can occur soon after initiating AI medication. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: an enhanced standard care group (AI prescription plus information) or a treatment group (educational classes plus group exercise sessions). Older survivors (\u226560 years) will be targeted because they are at increased risk of medication complications which may impede adherence. For the baseline assessment, a cancer-specific geriatric assessment will be conducted and a blood sample will be collected to interpret the effects of the self-management study in the context of geriatric experiences. Additionally, there will be an assessment of knowledge, PA habits, and AI-related joint pain and AI adherence. These will be measured again at 4, 6 and at follow up at 12 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "To improve AIA and AI Adherence in older survivors, it will: first, adapt an evidence-based intervention (AIM 1) and then; test the adapted intervention with breast cancer survivors \u226565 years. The Investigators will educate survivors about possible AI-related side effects and teach survivors ways to use PA to self-manage AIA (AIM 2), and support adherence to hormonal therapy recommendations (AIM 3). Given evidence that survivors experience AIA soon after initiating hormonal therapy, potentially eligible participants would be identified early in the treatment process. By identifying potential participants after diagnosis or during active treatment, survivors would have a minimal delay in beginning the exercise intervention after initiating hormonal therapy (i.e. AIs). All participants will have completed surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, which is consistent with current ASCO guidelines for AI use.\n\nTwo groups will be randomized to either an information-only group (enhanced standard care) or an education plus exercise group (treatment). At the initial clinical visit during the intervention, participants in both groups will receive printed information along with their AI medication prescription. The treatment group will subsequently receive a one-on-one exercise consultation with a certified exercise trainer (e.g ACSM or similar), followed by a modified version of the Fit \\& Strong! program, which includes bi-weekly supervised exercise (60 minutes) and educational sessions (30 minutes).\n\nThe exercise sessions will include light weights or resistance bands plus low-impact aerobic exercise, in which movements will be explained, demonstrated and modified based on the needs of participants. The exercise protocol will be reviewed and revised based on recommendations from clinical advisers. Educational materials will provide information about the purpose of AI medications (e.g., to reduce cancer recurrence) in layperson language and basic information about potential side effects. As part of in-person sessions, participants will develop a plan to continue exercise at home. Participants can do an activity of their choice (e.g., walking) and use resistance bands which will be provided for the at-home program which will begin after 8 weeks and will include follow up phone calls to assess progress and reinforce the program. Educational sessions will be modified to reflect relevant content and advice for older survivors beginning AIs. Assessments will be taken at 4 and 6 months, with follow up at 12 months.\n\nAll supervised exercise sessions will be conducted remotely to accommodate recommended COVID safety protocols."
