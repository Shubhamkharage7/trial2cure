The reported case-fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2 in the United States is 1.8% with a current death toll of \\>300,000 and climbing.4 There is no accepted standard of care or FDA approved therapies for treatment of COVID-19. Virus specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have become an important part of the treatment landscape for viral reactivation post hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation. Donor derived CTLs have been shown to be safe and effective against a variety of viruses including CMV, EBV, BK and adenovirus. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 specific CTLs generated from a previously infected family donor will be safe and effective for treatment of COVID-19 in family members with mild to moderate disease."
