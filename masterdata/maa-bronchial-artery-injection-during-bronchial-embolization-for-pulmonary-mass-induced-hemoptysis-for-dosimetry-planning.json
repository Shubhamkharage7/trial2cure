            "briefSummary": "This research study will evaluate the administration of a particle called macro-aggregated albumin (MAA) labelled with the radiotracer technetium 99m (Tc99m) as a proxy to estimate the anticipated dose of radiation to tumor and adjacent structures.\n\nAdministration of this labeled MAA will not have a therapeutic benefit on the participant's cancer. Administration will help researchers determine if arterial administration of radiation may be feasible for lung cancer in the future.",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this study intervention.\n\nAs mentioned above, standard of care treatment for Stage III lung cancer includes chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy. However, arterial administration of radiation to these tumors may represent an alternative method of radiotherapy, with dose directly administered to the tumor. The potential radiation dose to the tumor and adjacent structures is not known.\n\nThis study aims to estimate the dose of radiation to tumor and adjacent structures in the chest via administration of a radiotracer called Tc99m-MAA. Tc99m-MAA is a particle that is used to assess blood flow distribution and has a similar size to the particles that are utilized for arterial delivery of radiation therapy, also called radioembolization. Tc99m-MAA is currently used to estimate radiation dosimetry prior to arterial radiotherapy administration for liver malignancies.\n\nIf this study is successful, the results will allow doctors to use the distribution of Tc99m-MAA to estimate radiation dose to tumors and adjacent structures in the setting of intra-arterial radiation therapy. This will provide information to plan future therapy with intra-arterial radioembolization for lung malignancies."
