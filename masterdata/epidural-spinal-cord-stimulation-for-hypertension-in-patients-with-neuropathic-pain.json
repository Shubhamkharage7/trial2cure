We also aim to determine the extent to which higher baseline BP (i.e., hypertension) predicts reductions in pain following SCS implant. This is an observational study of patients undergoing an implantation of a SCS device.",
            "detailedDescription": "The broad research goal of this study is to examine the extent to which arterial blood pressure (BP) and blood markers related to hypertension and kidney function are reduced in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing implantation of an epidural spinal cord stimulator (SCS) for the purpose of managing chronic pain in the lower back and/or limbs.\n\nSpecific aims:\n\n1. Examine the extent to which BP (primary variable), norepinephrine (marker of sympathetic nerve activity in the blood), and a vascular ultrasound scan are improved following the implant of a SCS device among patients with chronic pain and hypertension.\n2. Examine the extent to which markers of kidney function in the blood \\[serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\\] are reduced following the implant of a SCS device among patients with chronic pain and hypertension.\n3. Determine the extent to which BP predicts reductions in pain following the implant of a SCS device."
