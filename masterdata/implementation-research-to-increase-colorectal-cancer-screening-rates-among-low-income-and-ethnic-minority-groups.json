            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial implements research strategies to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among low income and ethnic minority groups. CRC is the second most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States and disproportionately burdens low income and ethnic minority groups. Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is a test to check for blood in the stool. A brush is used to collect water drops from around the surface of a stool while it is still in the toilet bowl. The samples are then sent to a laboratory, where they are checked for a human blood protein. Blood in the stool may be a sign of colorectal cancer. Despite its potential for reducing CRC incidence and mortality, screening remains woefully underutilized. There is an unmet need for practical and effective programs to improve CRC screening rates. By implementing a culturally-tailored screening CRC program that supports providers and clinic staff to encourage eligible patients to complete FIT, researchers hope to reduce cancer disparities among low-income and ethnic groups and increase the CRC screening rate, which will help providers find CRC sooner, when it may be easier to treat.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To increase CRC screening rates within Northeast Valley Health Corporation (NEVHC).\n\nOUTLINE: Clinic sites are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I CLINICS: Physicians and clinic staff receive ongoing training, education, and feedback on CRC screening, and utilize point-of-care clinical decision support tool throughout the trial. Patients receive CRC screening recommendations from provider, a FIT kit with culturally tailored instructions, consultation with clinic staff, and text message reminders throughout the trial.\n\nGROUP II CLINICS: Physicians and clinic staff provide and patients recieve CRC screening usual care throughout the trial."
