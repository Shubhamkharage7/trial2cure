Cognitive Training (CT) is a digital intervention that has shown promise in extending the durability of another similar drug (ketamine). This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy and safety of apimostinel (vs. saline) for the acute treatment of depression, and will test the potential of CT to enhance and/or extend the durability of apimostinel's antidepressant effect."
