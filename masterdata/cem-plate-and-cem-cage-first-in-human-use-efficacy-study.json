Fifty patients will be enrolled in the study and, after undergoing a 2-level ACDF, will be evaluated at 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months.",

Fifty patients will be enrolled in the study and, after undergoing a 2-level ACDF, will be evaluated at 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months.\n\nThe study consists of a screening period, surgical procedure, and 6 post-operative visits. At each indicated visit, quality of life scales and adverse events will be collected. In addition, at 4 weeks post-operatively, patients will undergo static lateral cervical plain x rays to assess implant positioning and integrity. At 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months, patients will undergo flexion/extension and neutral lateral plain radiographs to assess overall success and fusion.\n\nThe study has co-primary endpoints for efficacy (fusion) and overall success where overall success is defined as fusion, device implanted as intended, no serious adverse events related to the surgical procedure, no device-related serious adverse events, no subsequent surgical interventions at the index levels, and absence of clinically significant device malfunctions. Fusion data will be compared to benchmark data (Davis et al, 2013, control arm of the 2-level Mobi-C IDE study)."
