            "detailedDescription": "Cancer patient navigation (PN) is an effective strategy for resolving patient barriers to care and improving completion and consistency of cancer screening, follow-up of abnormal findings, and treatment initiation. However, as the current standard one-on-one PN model is challenging to scale across cancers and economically difficult to sustain, the investigators propose to convert one-on-one PN into a learning health system \"PN 2.0 Checklist\" that will help coordinate navigation workflow and integrate clinical team members with community/local resources. This pragmatic, randomized trial tests whether this checklist strategy is as effective as one-on-one PN in addressing patients' social determinants of health and recommended cancer-related screenings, behavioral counseling, and immunizations.\n\nIn this study, half of the participants will be navigated using the \"PN 2.0 Checklist\". The other half will be navigated using the \"One-on-One PN\". All participants enrolled in the study will be asked to report their utilization of health services and be asked to complete a patient survey at the beginning of the program and every 6 months."
