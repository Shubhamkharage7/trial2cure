            "detailedDescription": "As women age oocytes are gradually depleted with a consequent progressive loss of ovarian function and fertility. When a woman's follicle cohort falls below a critical level, she enters a transitional time of diminished ovarian reserve known as ovarian aging. Recently the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (A-PRP) has been proposed as an additional strategy for improving ovarian function. A-PRP is prepared from autologous blood using an FDA approved device. The rationale for the use of PRP is that it contains growth factors which stimulate cellular anabolism, inflammatory modulators that create an anti-inflammatory effect and fibrinogen which acts as a scaffold for regenerating tissue. The investigators hypothesize that the growth factors present in PRP may have a beneficial effect promoting growth and recruitment of antral follicles. The investigators will recruit a prospective cohort of 90 patients with evidence of Premature Ovarian Aging/DOR. Women invited to participate in this RCT will have FSH above 12 and AMH below 1.0 ng/mL respectively and will have had fewer than 6 oocytes retrieved in a previous ovulation attempt. Consenting participants in this trial will be randomized in a doubly blind fashion to two groups. One will receive Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and the other will receive Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP). Women assigned to PPP will be offerred PRP in a future cycle if they so desire."
