            "briefSummary": "Currently there is no clinical biomarker that can be used to select patients for CCR2-targeted therapy and to monitor response to such therapy. Considering the toxicity and the rate of response to CCR2-targeted therapy, it is crucial to be able to identify patients who may not response to this therapy in order to avoid the morbidity and expense associated with ineffective therapy.\n\nTherefore, the combination of the novel CCR2 imaging agent with the novel CCR2-targeted therapy in this trial is of great importance to promote science while prolonging the life and its quality in patients with PDAC. The investigators also believe that this combination will make substantial contributions to the fields of cancer immunotherapy and tumor monocyte/macrophage biology. Moreover, this imaging agent has the potential to not only facilitate development and testing of future CCR2-targeted therapeutic agents but also serve as a prescreen tool to select appropriate patients for imaging guided treatment."
