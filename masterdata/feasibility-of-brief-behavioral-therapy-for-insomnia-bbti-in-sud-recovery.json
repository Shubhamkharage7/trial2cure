            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical study is to learn whether treating sleep problems is helpful in people with substance abuse problems who are living in a residential treatment program. Another goal is to study whether treating sleep problems will help individuals stay in substance abuse recovery treatment for a greater amount of time.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete surveys at the time of enrollment and every week for the next 9 weeks for a total of 8 times. Participants will be asked to wear a watch that measures sleep (sleep watch) while the participants are in the group and for a 2-week period after the participants complete the group. Participants may also be asked to participate in an interview about the experience with the group and wearing the watch. Participants will also have \"homework\" throughout a 4 week period. Homework is to complete a sleep diary each morning.\n\nThe first group of 50 participants will be enrolled in the brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI) group where the participants receive typical treatment plus the sleep intervention program. The investigators will use qualitative and quantitative data to identify implementation facilitators and barriers, then further modify BBTI to improve feasibility. After modifying the BBTI protocol and re-training staff, study procedures will remain intact with the exception that the investigators will double the recruitment and randomize participants to the modified BBTI (N=50) or standard-of-care (SOC) (N=50). All participants will complete all assessments except the SOC group will not complete treatment satisfaction surveys.",
            "detailedDescription": "Brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI) is an efficacious evidence-based sleep intervention derived from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) that may address barriers to widespread dissemination of insomnia therapy because it is brief (4 weeks), easily deliverable without need for specialty training (uses a hard-copy workbook) and behaviorally-focused. This proposal has the following two aims:\n\n1. To use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, a well-established implementation framework that informs evaluation of health-related programs, including in community and substance use treatment settings, to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a modified BBTI among underserved special population of individuals in a residential recovery program;\n2. To conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the modified BBTI on subjective and objective sleep outcomes compared with conventional standard-of-care. The end goal of this project is to provide empirical evidence of a modified BBTI's value in SUD recovery for individuals of diverse racial backgrounds. Successful completion of this study will promote the dissemination and sustainable adoption of an evidence-based, pragmatic, and accessible insomnia intervention in real-world SUD recovery programs."
