            "briefSummary": "This study investigates the impact of \u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) on recognition memory in healthy, regular cannabis users. Participants complete the same recognition memory task after self-administering one of three different strains of cannabis flower one day and while not intoxicated another day. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are measured via electroencephalogram (EEG) during the recognition memory task. Blood is collected to quantify THC and CBD exposure. Participants also complete self-report measures of medical history, sleep quality, subjective cognitive function, physical activity, psychological functioning, substance use, and acute drug effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "Previous research has established cannabis's harmful cognitive impact, with particularly robust and consistent effects in the domain of verbal episodic memory. However, prior work has not sufficiently considered that the memory effects of cannabis are the compound action of different cannabinoids, which vary in their pharmacology and effects. Specifically, CBD, a non-psychotomimetic component of cannabis (doesn't produce a \"high\"), is thought to have cognitively protective properties and may mitigate some of the harmful effects of THC. Further, few prior studies have tested the effects of high potency strains that are commonly available.\n\nThis study tests the effects of commercially available cannabis flower strains on recognition memory performance and ERPs that are related to different underlying memory processes in healthy, regular cannabis users. An episodic memory task is used to assess recognition memory, which asks participants to discriminate between previously studied and non-studied items using words as stimuli. Participants complete the same memory task while intoxicated one day and not intoxicated another day. A THC-dominant, a CBD-dominant, and a strain containing both THC and CBD are included in the study. Participants self-administer one of the three cannabis strains prior to memory encoding and retrieval.\n\nBlood is collected to determine THC and CBD exposure, as well as to explore how genetic variation in genes related to cannabinoid metabolism, cannabis-related behavior, and neurocognitive function associate with memory function before and after cannabis use. Participants also complete self-report measures of medical history, sleep quality, subjective cognitive function, physical activity, psychological functioning, substance use, and acute drug effects."
