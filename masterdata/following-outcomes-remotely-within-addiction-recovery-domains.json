Adults with opioid use disorder who participate will complete surveys monthly online and once per year by phone about their substance use, mental health, treatment involvement and functioning. The goal of this study is to better understand how people with opioid use disorder recover over time to improve intervention for this group.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a longitudinal follow-up study that will collect yearly outcomes data on adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) who participated one of two prior clinical trials in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network. This longitudinal, observational study will entail annual phone and online assessments of domains of interest (e.g., substance use, treatment engagement) as well as monthly assessments that are distributed via text messaging and email to be completed electronically by the participant. No participant randomization will occur for this study, and study data will be considered observational in nature. We aim to characterize the long-term course of OUD and to evaluate the long-term course and recovery of OUD."
