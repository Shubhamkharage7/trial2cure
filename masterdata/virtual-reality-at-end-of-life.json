            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research is to determine the effect that repeated, personalized virtual reality experiences have on symptom severity, comparing self-reported symptom severity both pre and post each session, and overtime across sessions. We will also determine if this intervention results in a high rating of presence in VR, and if presence is related to the magnitude of the change in symptoms.\n\nH1: Symptom severity will decrease from pre-intervention to post-intervention. H2: The change in symptom severity will be greater in session two than it was in session one.\n\nH3: Presence score will be higher in session two than session one. To recruit 30-40 participants, we will have our clinical team working to help the research team identify eligible participants from their caseloads. We will be including all hospice eligible patients, this includes people who are enrolled in hospice care but also a subset of those who are enrolled in palliative care who qualify for hospice but have refused to or haven't yet transitioned to hospice care. The site serves about 670 (as of May 2023) patients a month. Therefore, it is the researcher's intent to recruit about 3 patents per month, or a total of 30-40 patients (about 5% of the monthly population) over the course of one year.\n\nThe intervention that participants will be experiencing is personalized virtual reality experiences. The content of this experience will be determined at the initial visit during which the participant will complete a preference questionnaire which identifies the location they want to \"go\" to. These experiences will be filmed on the insta360 One R camera by the research coordinator. Each experience will be approximately 20 minutes. To view the videos participants will wear the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset."
