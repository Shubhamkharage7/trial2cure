            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism by which yoga lowers blood pressure in hypertensive adults.\n\nFree radicals and enzyme activity will be analyzed from isolated immune cells and blood pressure and vascular health will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12 during the interventions or control conditions. Sedentary adults (ages 30-60 years) with elevated blood pressure or stage I hypertension will be recruited and randomized to 12 weeks of yoga, video-based breathing, or app-based breathing conditions. Yoga classes will be completed 3 times weekly at Texas State University and slow, deep breathing interventions will be completed at home 5 times weekly. Participants assigned to the app-based breathing group will also complete 5- 20-minute breathing exercises per week at home before being re-randomization at week 12. Three testing sessions will be completed at the beginning of the study: 1) familiarization and screening for elevated blood pressure or hypertension and other exclusion criteria; 2) confirmation of elevated blood pressure or hypertension via addition seated blood pressure measurements and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and 3-day physical activity monitoring; and 3) blood marker assessment and endothelial function measurements.\n\nAll outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 4-week intervals throughout the 12-week data collection period in all 3 groups. At each follow up visit after randomization, testing will be completed over the course of 2 sessions: 1) ambulatory blood pressure monitor and physical activity monitoring and 2) blood marker and endothelial function measurements. At the end of the waitlist sham/control period, waitlisted participants will be rerandomized to yoga or slow, deep breathing interventions. Once re-randomized, participants in each group will complete follow up testing 4,8, and 12 weeks into their respective interventions."
