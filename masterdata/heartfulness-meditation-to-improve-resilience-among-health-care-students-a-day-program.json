It is also hypothesized that those students who participate in the meditation program will increase resilience.",

Feasibility will be assessed by participant compliance, retention, and acceptability to the participants.\n\nCriteria: Feasibility will be achieved by Compliance with average of at least 3 trainer led meditations / week Retention of 75% of participants at the end of 45 days (intermediate point) and 90 days (primary end point).\n\nCriterion: Acceptability will be indicated by a CSQ8 score \\> 17. SA2: Examine the benefits of Heartfulness meditation on improving resilience, decreasing depression, and decreasing anxiety of health care students.\n\nH2: At the end of 90 days (primary end point), students who participate in the Heartfulness Resilience Training (HEART) will have better resilience (CD-RISC) compared with students who do not participate and will have less anxiety and depression (HADS).\n\nSA3: Examine the association between the number of sessions completed and changes in resilience, depression, and anxiety at 45 and 90 (primary end point) days.\n\nH3: Changes in resilience, depression, and anxiety will be significantly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficients) with total number of sessions completed (H3a) and with number of one-on-one sessions with a trainer (H3b)."
