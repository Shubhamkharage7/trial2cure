            "briefSummary": "Social anxiety (SA) is a highly prevalent mental health concern, thought to disproportionately affect youth with recent international estimates of more than 30% of individuals reporting clinically elevated symptoms. Despite the prevalence of SA, as few as one in five individuals receive care, due to limited access to evidence-based treatments. Additionally there has been a notable increase in social anxiety since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proposal will use iExposure to develop a personalized mechanism-focused approach to optimizing treatment response for individuals with social anxiety by testing standard iExposure against two augmentations that incorporate distinct attention mechanisms (attention guidance and attention control)."

This video will explain the intervention, its rationale, and the procedure.\n2. Participants will then complete 10 simulated teleconferencing interaction trials with different topics, each lasting a maximum of two minutes. During each call participants will be prompted by one of the audience members to respond to a question (described in further detail in the Materials section, below).\n3.
