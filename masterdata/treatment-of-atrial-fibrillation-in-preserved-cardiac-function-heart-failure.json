            "briefSummary": "Heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular function (pEF) is difficult clinical syndrome to treat effectively with few evidence based therapies. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is now an important co-morbidity being observed in 43% of patients with HFpEF. Rhythm control has not been studied in this population. Catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs are rhythm control therapies that have been used for treatment of AF without HF or HF with reduced systolic function but have not been widely applied in HFpEF. No controlled comparative evaluation has been performed in HFpEF.\n\nThe introduction of wireless pulmonary artery hemodynamic monitoring has permitted optimization of HF therapy in patients with chronic HF with reduced and preserved EF. Reduction in HF hospitalizations has been observed in post hoc analyses of HFpEF patients but has not been systematically applied in AF patients with HFpEF.\n\nIn this study, we propose to study both rhythm control and optimized HF therapeutic approaches in an AF with HFpEF study population in a pilot study using a sequential two phase randomized controlled clinical trial design.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective pilot study utilizing a randomized comparative sequential evaluation of these two therapeutic approaches in two consecutive phases:\n\nPhase 1 will examine an initial catheter ablation strategy versus an initial antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy strategy for safety and efficacy in patients with atrial fibrillation with preserved systolic cardiac function, heart failure hospitalization in the past year or one or more documented HF events.\n\nPhase 2 will examine optimized rhythm control therapy with and without wireless pulmonary artery pressure hemodynamic monitoring for HF therapy optimization in the same patients as in Phase 1 with documented atrial fibrillation with preserved systolic cardiac function, prior HF hospitalization and class III heart failure.\n\nThis is an open label two phase study in which patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ablation or AAD with a pilot phase 1 that will consist to 100 patients enrolled at 10 centers. They will be followed for a minimum of 6 months, after a three month blanking period, for event rates of the primary endpoint as well as safety and efficacy. Phase 2 will randomize patients completing Phase 1 to hemodynamic monitoring with a wireless pulmonary artery sensor insertion and guided HF therapy or empiric standard of care HF therapy. They will be followed for a minimum of 6 months, after a three month blanking period for optimization of rhythm and HF therapies.\n\nThis study is a sequential randomized, open label, active-controlled trial, designed to compare a composite clinical outcomes endpoint of heart failure hospitalization and/or cardiovascular mortality among these patients randomized to each of these treatment strategies. This endpoint will be employed in both pilot trial phases to assess event rates, as well as safety endpoints. This data will form the basis of a larger pivotal trial"
