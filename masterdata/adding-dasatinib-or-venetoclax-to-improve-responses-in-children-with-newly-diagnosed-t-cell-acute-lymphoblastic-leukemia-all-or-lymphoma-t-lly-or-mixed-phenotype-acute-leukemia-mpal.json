            "briefSummary": "This is a clinical trial testing whether the addition of one of two chemotherapy agents, dasatinib or venetoclax, can improve outcomes for children and young adults with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma or mixed phenotype acute leukemia.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* To evaluate if the end of induction MRD-negative rate is higher in patients with T-ALL treated with dasatinib compared to similar patients treated with 4-drug induction on AALL1231.\n* To evaluate if the end of induction MRD-negative rate is higher in patients with ETP or near-ETP ALL treated with venetoclax compared to similar patients treated with 4-drug induction on AALL1231.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To assess the event free and overall survival of patients treated with this therapy.\n* To compare grade 4 toxicities, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with this therapy in induction and reinduction to toxicities of similar patients treated on TOT17.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients will be identified in the first 3 days of therapy during their treatment on INITIALL.\n\nTreatment will consist of 3 main phases: Induction, Early Post Induction \\[including Consolidation, High-Dose Methotrexate, Intensification, Interim 1, Reinduction 1, Interim 2, and Reinduction 2\\], and Maintenance.\n\nInduction:\n\n* Remission Induction includes 3 days of therapy on the INITIALL classification protocol as well as the remainder of a total of 4 weeks of induction treatment on this trial. Treatment includes a total of 28 days of dexamethasone, 4 weekly doses of vincristine, 3 doses of daunorubicin, 1 dose of Calaspargase pegol, 6 doses of Intrathecal triple therapy (IT MHA), and one of 3 additional drugs. Patients with T-ALL without near-ETP or ETP phenotype (hereafter referred to simply as T-ALL) will receive 25 days of dasatinib. Patients with ETP or near-ETP ALL as well as those with MPAL will receive 14 days of venetoclax. Patients with T-LLy will receive bortezomib. Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Induction, although patients with Induction failure (MRD \u22655% disease) will proceed directly to consolidation.\n\nEarly Post Induction:\n\n* Consolidation will be given following completion of Remission Induction Therapy. Patients will receive 2 cycles of BFM-1b therapy (a single dose of cyclophosphamide at the start of week 1, 4 daily doses of cytarabine in two consecutive weeks, and 2 weeks of mercaptopurine) separated by a week of nelarabine. Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Consolidation.\n* High-dose Methotrexate will be given for 4 cycles to all patients. Patients will also receive an intrathecal chemotherapy treatment with each of the 2-week cycles and will take oral mercaptopurine continuously if tolerated.\n* Intensification will be given to patients with T-ALL or ETP/ near-ETP. This therapy includes a week of nelarabine, one week of combination cyclophosphamide and cytarabine, and 1 week of rest without chemotherapy.\n* Interim Therapy 1 includes 6 weeks of oral mercaptopurine, 2 weeks (5 days of each week) of dexamethasone, and two doses (weeks 1 and 4) of daunorubicin, vincristine, and calaspargase pegol.\n* Reinduction Therapy 1 will consist of 3 weekly doses of vincristine, 1 dose of daunorubicin and calaspargase pegol at the start of the first week, and dexamethasone for 7 days in the first and third weeks. Patients will also receive the same additional agent received during induction based on immunophenotype.\n* Interim Therapy 2 includes 6 weeks of oral mercaptopurine, two doses (weeks 1 and 4) of daunorubicin, vincristine, and calaspargase pegol.\n* Reinduction Therapy 2 will consist of 3 weekly doses of vincristine, 1 dose of daunorubicin and calaspargase pegol at the start of the first week, and dexamethasone for 7 days in the first and third weeks. Patients will also receive the same additional agent received during induction based on immunophenotype.\n\nMaintenance therapy:\n\n* Early Maintenance Therapy follows Reinduction 2 and lasts 31 weeks. Patients will receive mercaptopurine and methotrexate interrupted by 1 week of nelarabine (week 3), 5 cyclophosphamide/ cytarabine pulses, and every 4-week dexamethasone/ vincristine pulses. For the first 32 weeks, patients will also receive every 4-week pulses including 5 days of dexamethasone and 1 dose of vincristine. Patients will receive low-dose methotrexate in all weeks when they do not receive dexamethasone or vincristine. All patients will receive every 4-week intrathecal chemotherapy beginning 4 weeks after the week of nelarabine.\n* Late Maintenance Therapy follows early maintenance and includes daily mercaptopurine, weekly methotrexate, and every 8-week intrathecal chemotherapy. It lasts a total of 44 weeks.\n\nDuration of therapy is approximately 2\u00bc years. It is recommended that patients be followed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year and then yearly until the patient is in remission for 10 years and is at least 18 years old."
