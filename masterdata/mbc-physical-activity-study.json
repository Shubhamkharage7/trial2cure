            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates the impact of a tailored physical activity program on physical activity in patients with breast cancer that has spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic). It has been shown that decreased physical activity contributes to poor performance and quality of life. Evidence has also shown that exercise could improve physical fitness, physical functioning, quality of life, and cancer-related fatigue, however, there is concern that it may not be available to those with physical limitations. The proposed physical activity program offers a comprehensive and individualized assessment for each metastatic breast cancer patient and includes a high quality, tailored exercise home-based program designed by an advanced qualified cancer exercise specialist. A tailored physical activity program may improve physical activity in metastatic breast cancer patients."
