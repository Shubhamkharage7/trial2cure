            "briefSummary": "Prenatal multivitamin/multimineral supplements (MVI) provide important nutrition supplement to the diet of pregnant women to cover potential deficiencies and optimize nutrition status of both mom and baby, especially when the diet is suboptimal or nutrient demand is high while absorption is hindered by various factors such as genetic variance and gastrointestinal function. In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will recruit 70 pregnant women at gestational week 12-14 and randomly assign them to either receive a Ritual prenatal MVI (n=35) or another commercially available prenatal MVI (n=35) through out pregnancy. Both supplements are over the counter and commercially available. The major differences between the two MVIs are the chemical form of folate as either 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate or folic acid, and the dosages of vitamin D, biotin, and docosahexaenoic acid. The investigators will collect blood samples in each trimester of pregnancy and the placenta and cord blood at delivery to assess differences in blood nutrient levels. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of Ritual MVI leads to better nutrition status and biomarkers in maternal-fetal dyads compared to control during the antepartum period."
