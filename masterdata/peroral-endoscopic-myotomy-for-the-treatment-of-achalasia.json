All the subjects enrolled in prospective chart review will be first consented for their study participation. Subjects will undergo a clinically indicated endoscopic procedure and POEM and subsequent follow-up clinical visits as part of their standard medical care. All procedures, barring research activities such as consenting and data collection from Electronic Health Records, will be either clinically indicated and/or standard of care.\n\n* Each patient in the study will be assigned a Case ID number to de-identify their personal health information during data collection\n* The Case ID number connecting the patient to the personal health information will be in an encrypted electronic file on a computer that can only be accessed by study members at MDMC.\n* A procedure report and outpatient clinical records for each subject's POEM procedure will be used to record each patient's data for the registry\n* That data will only be shared by members of the study (PIs, research coordinator) who require it for conducting of data collection/interpretation\n\n\"Disclaimer: Any cost associated with the procedures stated herein will be billed directly to you or to your insurance (as applicable).\""
