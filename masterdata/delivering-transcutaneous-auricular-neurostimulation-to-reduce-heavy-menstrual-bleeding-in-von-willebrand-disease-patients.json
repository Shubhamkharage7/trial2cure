Participants will be enrolled in the study over the course of two consecutive menstrual cycles.\n\nDuring the First Menstruation (baseline), no tAN treatment will be delivered. Participants will estimate blood loss daily throughout the duration of the menstruation phase of their first menstrual cycle. Dysmenorrhea, a general quality of life assessment, and total duration of menstruation will be collected on the final day of first menstruation.\n\nDuring the Second Menstruation, participants will self-administer 2, 1-hour sessions (daily total of 2 hours) of active tAN daily beginning Day 1 of menstruation through the final day of second menstruation. Participants will estimate blood loss daily throughout the duration of the menstruation phase of their second menstruation. Dysmenorrhea, a general quality of life assessment, and total duration of menstruation will be collected on the final day of second menstruation."
