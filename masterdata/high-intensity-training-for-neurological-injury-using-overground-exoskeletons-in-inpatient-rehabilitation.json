This study will also evaluate if exercising at high intensity will lead to improvement in walking ability. Participants in this study will be asked to attend 5 walking training sessions using Ekso exoskeleton. There will be two additional sessions, one before and one after the five training sessions. At these two sessions, study participants will be asked to participate in seated balance, walking speed and endurance tests and breathing assessments.",
