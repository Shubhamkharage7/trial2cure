            "detailedDescription": "Phase 1, single-center, open-label study in subjects receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases. The study will consist of 4 principal cohorts (n=3 in each cohort). Each cohort will receive an escalating dose of ascorbate-meglumine as an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-detectable adjunctive therapeutic to SRS.\n\nSubjects will complete a planning MRI for SRS with gadolinium- diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (GD-DPTA) per standard of care for SRS. Forty-eight hours after the planning MRI, the subjects will complete the study MRI with ascorbate-meglumine contrast agent. Each cohort will receive an escalating dose of ascorbate-meglumine by intravenous administration over 1 hour during the MRI. The total dose of ascorbate-meglumine will escalate from the first cohort to the next cohort in a sequential manner. During ascorbate-meglumine infusion, MRI scans will be performed to evaluate the contrast effect and PK blood draws will occur at defined time points.\n\nPatients will return for the SRS procedure within 1 week following the planning MRI per standard of care. During SRS, subjects will receive a second dose of ascorbate-meglumine as an adjunctive therapeutic.\n\nPatients will enter into a follow up phase within 2 weeks after the SRS procedure per standard of care.\n\nThe primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety of parenteral ascorbate-meglumine as a MRI-detectable adjunctive therapeutic to SRS."
