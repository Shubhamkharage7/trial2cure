The study includes 9-weeks interventions, delivered remotely. It will examine changes in social isolation, processing of social rewards and depression severity over 9 weeks of treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Postpartum depression is linked with decreased motivation to seek rewarding activities and enjoyment of pleasurable experiences. Social isolation and low perceived social support predict persistence of postpartum depression. Engagement in rewarding social activities with significant others may increase motivation and enjoyment, motivating utilization of a therapy that addresses social isolation and reward response. The investigators developed Engage \\& Connect (E\\&C), a 9-week psychotherapy program that focuses on increasing meaningful social activities with significant others. This study will be a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial that will compare the 9-week E\\&C course for mothers with postpartum depression with a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation condition (SRP) for mothers with postpartum depression."
