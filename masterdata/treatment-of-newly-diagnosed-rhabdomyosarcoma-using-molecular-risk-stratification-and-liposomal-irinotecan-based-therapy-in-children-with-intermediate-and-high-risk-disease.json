The phase I part (dose-finding phase) is a dose-escalation part using the BOIN design with maximally 18 patients for each of groups (intermediate -risk, high-risk, and intermediate -and-high-risk-with-early-radiation). Phase I part is to find the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose for the subsequent phase II part. Phase II part has two primary objectives. The first objective will derive the sample size and it is for efficacy and the endpoint is defined as a 2-year event-free survival (EFS) for each stratum, with 4 years enrollment and 2 years follow-up for each patient, by 80% power and 5% type I error rate, a single-arm adaptive phase II design is used to have estimated numbers of patients for intermediate-risk and high-risk groups are 46 and 33, respectively. The study will end once the last enrolled patient has been followed by 2 years. The second objective is to evaluate the local recurrence rate (LRR) of patients with tumor size \u2265 5cm by using a 2:1 randomization design of comparing administration of the two radiation strategies, 59.4 GyRBE and 68 GyRBE. For this part, 27 additional patients will be required."
