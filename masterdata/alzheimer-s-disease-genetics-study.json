Qualifying families will have two living blood-related individuals who have been diagnosed with or are showing symptoms of AD or dementia. Local study sites are located all over the United States, and arrangements may be made for eligible families who do not live near a participating site. The biological samples and data from these families will be made available to qualified researchers, who must sign a Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) in order to protect the privacy rights of study participants before receiving samples and data."
