Upon consent, data will be collected from the patient's HCP(s) retrospectively for at least 3 months prior to Last Menstrual Period (LMP). Data will be collected during pregnancy and throughout the infant's first year of life. Pegvaliase exposure will be recorded during pregnancy and breastfeeding including exposure during each trimester of pregnancy. Duration of individual subject participation will be up to approximately 21 months."
