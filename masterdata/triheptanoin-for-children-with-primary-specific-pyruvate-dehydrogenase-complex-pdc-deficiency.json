The medication is triheptanoin, which is currently FDA approved for the treatment of Long-Chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders. Previous research suggests that triheptanoin may also be effective in the treatment PDC Deficiency. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy (how well it works) of triheptanoin in patients with PDC Deficiency.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participation in the study will require the patient to participate in up to 10 visits over a two-year period. Five of those visits must be done at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP). Other visits can take place at CHP or remotely. All of these visits will include blood draws.\n\nTriheptanoin will be added to the patients' diet and administered at least 4 times per day. The target dose will be 1.2-3.9 g of triheptanoin per kg body weight with a max goal dose of about 4 g/kg per day.\n\nThe triheptanoin will be provided to the patients at no cost. All other costs will be billed to the patients' insurance."
