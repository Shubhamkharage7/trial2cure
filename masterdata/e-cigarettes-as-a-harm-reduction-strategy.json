            "briefSummary": "E-cigarettes have emerged as an effective strategy for replacing cigarettes among smokers from the general population, but there is a dearth of studies investigating their utility in replacing cigarettes among smokers with opioid use disorder (OUD). This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a cigarette harm reduction intervention involving e-cigarettes in office-based buprenorphine clinics.",
            "detailedDescription": "Between 84-94% of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) smoke cigarettes, a rate six times higher than the general US adult population. Despite the majority of smokers with OUD expressing motivation to quit, cessation rates remain extremely low, even with evidence-based medications. E-cigarettes have emerged as a harm reduction strategy for smokers unable or unwilling to quit. Research on the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking reduction among individuals with OUD on buprenorphine/methadone maintenance treatment is scarce but promising. This study is an open-label single-arm clinical trial testing the use of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy among smokers with OUD on buprenorphine in a real-world setting."
