During dose expansion, the primary objective will be to assess preliminary anti-tumor activity and further characterize the safety of the recommended dose for expansion.\n\n. Around 318 participants will be enrolled in this study, and they will be assigned to different treatment groups. Both the participants and their doctors will be aware of which treatment group they are assigned to throughout the study.\n\nThe treatments, BGB-A3055 alone or in combination with Tislelizumab, will be administered intravenously to evaluate their safety and determine the highest dose that can be tolerated by participants. The study will be conducted at multiple medical centers worldwide. The expected duration of participation in this study is two years. Treatment will continue until participants no longer receive any benefits from the drugs, experience excessive side effects, or decide to withdraw their consent."
