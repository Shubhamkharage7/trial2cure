            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests the effectiveness and safety of artificial intelligence (AI) to determine dose recommendation during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) planning in patients with primary lung cancer or tumors that has spread from another primary site to the lung (metastatic). SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Even with the high precision of SBRT, disease persistence or reappearance (local recurrence) can still occur, which could be attributed to the radiation dose. AI has been used in other areas of healthcare to automate and improve various aspects of medical science. Because the relationship of dose and local recurrence indicates that dose prescriptions matter, decision support systems to help guide dose based on personalized prediction AI algorithms could better assist providers in prescribing the radiation dose of lung stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy (reduction in local failure free survival) in patients receiving SBRT to the lung with personalized artificial intelligence dose guidance (Deep Profiler + iGray).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v.) 1.1 in patients receiving individualized radiation doses to the lung as recommended by Deep Profiler + iGray.\n\nII. To evaluate respiratory function per the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Pulmonary Function Scale.\n\nIII. To assess toxicity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5.0 in patients receiving individualized radiation doses to the lung as recommended by Deep Profiler + iGray.\n\nIV. To evaluate the feasibility, defined as 85% receiving within 10% of the projected dose, of implementing the individualized radiation doses recommended by machine learning software (Deep Profiler + iGray) in a clinical practice.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo radiation planning with AI-directed analysis for dose recommendations with Deep Profiler + iGray software on study. Patients then undergo SBRT on study. Patients also undergo positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or x-ray imaging during screening and follow-up."

Patients of child-bearing potential (POCBP) must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from time of informed consent, for the duration of study participation, and for 7 days following completion of therapy. Should a patient become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant while they or their partner are participating in this study, they should inform their treating physician immediately. People who can impregnate their partners treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception from time of informed consent, for the duration of study participation, and 90 days after completion of administration\n* Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Informed consent must be signed prior to registration on study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had prior radiotherapy with radiation field overlap\n* For primary lung cancers, patients with ground glass opacities without a solid component will be excluded\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events confined to the thorax (i.e. pneumonitis, bronchial insufficiency, bronchial hemorrhage, esophagitis) due to prior anticancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\>= grade 2) with the exception of alopecia. low blood counts (neutropenia, anemia, etc), or anatomically distinct toxicities (i.e. cystitis)\n* Patients who are receiving any other concurrent investigational agents or genotoxic chemotherapy for cancer treatment\n\n  * Note: Patients receiving targeted therapies are permitted to enroll on the study. However, patients must pause treatment with targeted therapy 3 days prior to SBRT and restart medication at least 3 days after SBRT. Concurrent immunotherapy (if not investigational) is permitted. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations are allowed\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen. Patients who have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to any of the following, are not eligible:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection requiring systemic treatment\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Stage 3 or greater idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n  * Any other illness or condition that the treating investigator feels would interfere with study compliance or would compromise the patient's safety or study endpoints\n* Female patients who are pregnant or nursing. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation therapy has teratogenic or abortifacient effects",
