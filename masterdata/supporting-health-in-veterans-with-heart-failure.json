            "briefSummary": "This study will test the effectiveness of a culturally-sensitive, telephone-based, tailored problem-solving intervention to improve physical and mental health in Veterans with heart failure (HF). Veterans will be recruited from VA clinics throughout the United States. As a component of this study, Veterans will partner with a registered nurse for a 12-week telehealth program that includes 8 telephone sessions. Follow-up data will be collected at 3-months (post intervention) and 6-, 12-, and 18-months to examine sustainability of intervention effect.",
            "detailedDescription": "The long-term goal of this research is to support physical and mental health of Veterans with heart failure and enrich rehabilitation and independent living by enhancing disease self-management and coping processes in the home.\n\nStudy objectives include: (1) Evaluate the feasibility of recruitment and enrollment processes, attrition, and program acceptability in a sample of Veterans with HF; (2) Evaluate program effectiveness on study outcomes (i.e., self-care, symptoms, depression, anxiety, quality of life, stress, resilience, coping, and healthcare utilization); and (3) examine the sustainability of intervention effect.\n\nThis study will be guided by quantitative inquiry and include a single-group, repeated measures design. A sample size of 100 participants is desired based on a power analysis for repeated measures ANOVA with 5 time points, alpha level of .05, a medium effect size (f = 0.25), and 80% power, plus oversampling for potential attrition (20%). Following verbal informed consent via telephone, all participants will complete baseline data collection which will include a Sociodemographic and Clinical Survey, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List - 12 (ISEL), the Social Problem-Solving Inventory Revised-Short (SPSIRs), the Self-care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI, v 7.2), the Heart Failure Symptom Survey (HFSS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the 5x5 Resilience Scale, the Brief COPE, and a healthcare utilization survey.\n\nAll participants will participate in a tailored problem-solving intervention designed to help manage heart failure-related problems experienced in the home over 12 weeks (Weeks 1-4, 6, 8, 10, 12). Follow-up data collection will occur at 3-months (post-intervention) and 6-, 12-, and 18-months. Quantitative data on study variables will be collected using the following self-report surveys: SPSIRs, SCHFI, HFSS, PHQ-9, GAD, MLHFQ, PSS, 5x5 Resilience scale, Brief COPE, and healthcare utilization. All data will be collected by a trained research assistant who will collect study data over the telephone and mark participants answers on a computerized data spreadsheet. Possible treatment effectiveness on heart failure self-care, heart failure symptoms, healthcare utilization, depression, anxiety, quality of life, stress, resilience, coping, and differences among subgroups over the study period will be examined using multilevel modeling."

Participants will receive a program manual containing examples of common HF-related problems experienced by heart failure patients and suggested management strategies, with some strategies tailored to the rural sociocultural context. The nurse will lead participants in a card sorting task intended to help participants prioritize current HF-related problems and will guide participants in developing management strategies for the highest priority problem(s). Participants will utilize these strategies until the next session at which time the nurse will guide participants in evaluating the effectiveness of chosen strategies. The iterative process then begins again. Participants will receive 7 follow-up telephone sessions with the nurse. In the intervention, the nurse will focus on problems related to self-care, disease management, mental health, and quality of life, including those specific to the rural population.",

The core belief of TSPS is effective problem-solving requires a positive problem orientation (i.e., viewing problems as a challenge versus a threat) and elicits rational problem-solving versus avoidance or impulsivity/carelessness. Problem-solving follows from a positive problem orientation and involves accurate problem identification, generation of appropriate potential solutions, active decision-making, and solution implementation and evaluation. The goal of this intervention is to move participants toward a positive problem orientation and use of rational problem-solving strategies that support greater physical and mental health.",
