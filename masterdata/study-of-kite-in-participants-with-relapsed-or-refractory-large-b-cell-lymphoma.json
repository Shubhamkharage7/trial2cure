The goal of Phase 1a of this clinical study is to learn more about the safety, tolerability and dosing of study drug KITE-197, in participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/rLBCL). The goal of Phase 1b of this clinical study is learn about the effectiveness of the recommended dose of KITE-197 in participants with r/r LBCL.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are:\n\nPhase 1a: To evaluate the safety of KITE-197 in participants with r/r LBCL and determine the target dose level for Phase 1b.\n\nPhase 1b: To evaluate the efficacy of KITE-197 in participants with r/r LBCL as measured by the complete remission (CR) rate.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be followed for approximately 24 months after the infusion of KITE-197 before transitioning to a separate Kite long-term follow-up study KT-US-982-5968, in which they will be followed for the remainder of the 15-year follow-up period."
