            "detailedDescription": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating inherited hemoglobin disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of pain and chronic hemolytic anemia. Chronic anemia contributes to multi-organ damage and decreased life expectancy in SCD. However, there are limited treatment options for anemia in SCD. Erythropoietin (EPO) is the standard of care for treatment of anemia related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is also used ad hoc in patients with SCD. However, there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of EPO in patients with SCD, especially in combination with hydroxyurea. Therefore, this study aims to treat patients on stable hydroxyurea therapy with subcutaneous EPO, with the goal of assessing the safety of EPO therapy and its effect on chronic anemia in SCD.\n\n(Note: Outcome measure changes were in place prior to study initiation.)"
