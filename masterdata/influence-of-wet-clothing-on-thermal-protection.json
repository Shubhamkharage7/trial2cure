            "briefSummary": "The aim of this investigation is to provide guidance for assessing the influence of wet clothing, and its drying time, on body temperature responses during cold air exposure. Twelve healthy and fit adults (men and women aged 18-49) will complete this study. Four cold air exposures (41\u00b0F, 180 min) will be randomly conducted, each while wearing a different clothing ensemble that has been saturated by water. During each cold air exposure, you will be asked to rest for 60 min and perform weighted (38.5lbs) treadmill walking for up to 120 min.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants, in their first visit, will undergo baseline weighted treadmill walking consisting of \\~20 min of treadmill walking with a load of 77lbs followed by \\~25 min of treadmill walking with a load of 38.5lbs. They will also have their body composition evaluated (DEXA) and be fit for each uniform ensemble. This first laboratory visit will require \\~3 hrs.\n\nOn separate days, participants will complete 4 experimental trials. After being submerged up to the neck in warm water for two minutes, three of the trials will ask that the participant move to a 41\u00b0F air environment, stand with minimal movement for 60 min, complete 60 min of weighted (38.5lb) treadmill walking at 2 mph, and up to 4% grade, and then complete 60 min of weighted (38.5lb) treadmill walking at 2.5 mph and up to 4% grade. Each of these three experimental trial visits will require \\~5 hrs.\n\nA single trial will ask that after being saturated in warm water, participants enter a 41\u00b0F air environment, immediately begin weighted treadmill walking (38.5lbs) at 2.0mph and up to 4% grade for a duration of 60 min before standing with minimal movement for 60 min. This trial will require \\~4 hrs.\n\nDuring all experimental trials, the primary outcomes include core temperature, measured continuously using a small pill inserted as a rectal suppository, and skin temperature, measured continuously using 11 small skin attached sensors. Secondary outcomes include metabolic rate, heart rate, thermal perceptions, and changes in body mass.\n\nNon-federally employed civilians may be eligible to be paid $13.50/hour for participation (for a total of up to $310)."
