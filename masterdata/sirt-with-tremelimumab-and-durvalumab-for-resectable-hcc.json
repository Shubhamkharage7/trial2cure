            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized research study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab and durvalumab with or without Selective Internal Yttrium-90 Radioembolization (SIRT) in participants with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who will undergo liver surgery.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: Durvalumab + Tremelimumab versus Durvalumab + Tremelimumab + SIRT. Randomization means that a participant is put into a group by chance. Radioembolization is a combination of radiation therapy and a procedure called embolization to treat cancer. SIRT blocks tumor blood supply by injecting radioactive particles into the hepatic artery and delivers internal radiotherapy on the tumor.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Durvalumab as treatment for HCC but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe U.S. FDA has not approved tremelimumab as a treatment option for HCC.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including evaluations, radiology scans of the liver, blood tests, electrocardiograms, and follow up visits.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last about 18 months with long-term follow up for a maximum of 3 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.\n\nAstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company, is supplying the study drugs, tremelimumab and durvalumab. Sirtex Medical Inc., a medical device company, is supplying the Yttrium-90 resin Microsphere beads."
