            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well enfortumab vedotin works for treating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the growth of tumor cells. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To estimate the best response rate of enfortumab vedotin treatment for patients with metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma (mPSCC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine overall response rate (ORR). II. To determine safety and tolerance of enfortumab vedotin in men with mPSCC. III. To characterize duration of response to enfortumab vedotin in mPSCC. IV. To estimate median overall survival and progression-free survival in men with mPSCC treated with enfortumab vedotin.\n\nV. To analyze response in subgroups by human papillomavirus (HPV) status (related/unrelated as assessed by p16 biomarker).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive enfortumab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1,8 and 15 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months until progressive disease, followed by every 6 months for up to 5 years from registration."
