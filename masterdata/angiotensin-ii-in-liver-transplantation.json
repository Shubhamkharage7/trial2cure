            "detailedDescription": "This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects will receive an infusion of either Angiotensin II (AngII) or a saline control (placebo) in addition to usual care with traditional vasopressors (catecholamines and vasopressin) during liver transplantation (LT). AngII is a vasopressor approved by the FDA for the treatment of vasodilatory shock. It targets the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and has been shown to effectively raise the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in patients with septic shock. It also allows for lower doses of traditional vasopressors and may improve microcirculatory flow to the kidneys. The study drug will only be administered if the participants require \\> 0.05 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine while undergoing liver transplantation. The study drug will be titrated throughout the case and discontinued at the end of surgery. Randomization will be stratified based on (a) the need for renal replacement therapy preoperatively and (b) the use of normothermic machine perfusion of the liver graft."
