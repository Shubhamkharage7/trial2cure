            "briefSummary": "ActivSight\u2122 combines an innovative form factor and proprietary software to deliver precise, objective, real-time visualization of blood flow and tissue perfusion intraoperatively for laparoscope-based surgery. A small adaptor that fits between any existing laparoscope and camera systems and a separate light source placed along any current commercial system will deliver objective real-time tissue perfusion and blood flow information intraoperatively.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the feasibility of ActivSight\u2122 in detecting and displaying tissue perfusion and blood flow in the conduit and foregut anastomoses in esophageal resection/reconstructive surgery. The investigators will compare the precision and accuracy among the naked eye inspection, ICG and LSCI in assessing the vascularity of the conduit.",
            "detailedDescription": "Design:\n\n* This is a prospective interventional cross-over study where ActivSight\u2122 will be used in sequence to the standard practice of visualizing perfusion status of the conduit using the naked eye visual inspection and ICG during esophageal resection.\n* Feasibility will be determined by technically successful completion of intended visualization.\n* Safety will be determined through clinical assessments and evaluation of any adverse event.\n* Assessment of preliminary efficacy will be performed through analysis of any intraoperative decisions made based on visual display as compared to standard endoscopic approach, or non-inferiority to ICG-based visualization and usability.\n* Patient outcome and follow up to Postoperative day 28 will be monitored for clinical outcome.\n* Target enrollment for the assessment of esophageal anastomoses is a total of seventy patients powered to detect \\~ 2-3 cm discordance between ICG and LSCI lines of demarcation between well vascularized and less vascularized sites in the gastric conduit. Since ActivSight\u2122 can detect the difference of \\> 2 cm between perfused versus less perfused in comparison to ICG with 80 % confidence at p\\<0.05 in a sample size of n = 21, the investigators estimate that the study will require an accrual of 63 patients. With potential unforeseen dropout and mortality, the investigators will recruit a total of 70 patients for the proposed study."
