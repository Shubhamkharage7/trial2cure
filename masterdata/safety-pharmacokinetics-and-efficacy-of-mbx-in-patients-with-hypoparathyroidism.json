A heterosexually active male patient and his female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 effective birth control methods for the duration of the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. A male patient must agree to refrain from sperm donation from the date of screening until 90 days after his last dose of study drug.\n15. Has any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may make the patient unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that presents undue risk from the investigational product or procedures.\n16. Has a known allergy or sensitivity to PTH or any of the excipients used in MBX 2109.\n17. Has a diagnosis of drug or alcohol dependence within 12 months prior to the Screening visit.\n18.
