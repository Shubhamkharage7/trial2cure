            "detailedDescription": "The objective of the registry is to create a cohort of AA subjects to study long-term safety and effectiveness of AA treatments. Because the long-term understanding of safety and efficacy is still limited even after regulatory approval,enrollment and long-term follow-up of a large number of diverse real-world patients exposed to therapies of interest is important to understand safety and effectiveness. The observational structured data collected will be used to better characterize the natural history of the disease and to extensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications approved for the treatment of AA to support ongoing risk benefit evaluation by drug manufacturers and regulators.Further, data collected will inform clinical decision making by subjects and treating providers. This will be done through the standardized collection of validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the active evaluation of prevalent and incident comorbidities and adverse events, and the recording of medication utilization patterns. Personal information is also collected from each consenting registry subject allowing for linkages to other public or private clinical and administrative databases, as well as to databases maintained by organizations focused on the care and treatment of AA for the purposes of clinical, market, or outcomes research. This provides an opportunity to evaluate other aspects of the disease and its treatment including but not limited to clinical and drug cost-effectiveness, health care resource utilization, and subject adherence."
