During the acquisition phase, participants chose one of two stimulus locations until they identified the correct location on 8 of 10 consecutive trials. Then, they proceeded to the reversal phase in which the correct location is switched without warning, and participants had to identify the new correct location on 8 of 10 consecutive trials. Testing was discontinued if they did not reach criterion within 50 trials on either phase. Participants completed two practice tests to establish test comprehension.
