            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective cohort study in which pregnant women (at any stage of pregnancy), the offspring's biologic father, and the offspring will be enrolled at study sites and the offspring will be observed from birth to age 3 years. The enrollment goal is at least 2500 pregnant women who agree to enroll their offspring at birth. Enrollment of biological fathers will be attempted; however, enrollment of the mother or child is not dependent on enrollment of the biological father.\n\nDuring the study, biological and environmental samples and questionnaire information will be collected from the parents and the children, and the children will be assessed for allergic diseases at clinic visits at ages 2, 5, 12, 24, and 36 months."
