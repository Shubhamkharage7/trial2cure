            "briefSummary": "Immunosuppressive therapy is used to treat and manage solid organ and bone marrow/stem cell transplants in children. However, it can be harmful if too little or too much is given. Monitoring immunosuppressive drug (cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus) concentrations in the blood is important to ensure that the drug is given safely and effectively, but current approaches for collecting blood from a vein are painful and often difficult in children. Investigators seek to compare a new approach for monitoring immunosuppressive drug concentrations using a novel small volume blood sampling device, called Tasso-M20, to the traditional way of collecting blood from a vein. Additionally Investigators are interested in assessing patient and family perceptions of the Tasso-M20 device being used for immunosuppressive therapy and their comfortability using the device outside of a clinical setting.\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to identify the relationship between cyclosporine A (CYA), tacrolimus (TAC), and sirolimus (SIR) concentrations in the venous blood (gold-standard) and capillary whole blood obtained using the microsampling device Tasso-M20.\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to investigate the stability of CYA, TAC, and SIR in blood samples collected using the Tasso-M20 device under the conditions of shipping and storage.\n\nThe sub-study objective is to thematically compare subjects' and families' perceptions of blood collection via the Tasso-M20 device and standard venous blood collection.",
            "detailedDescription": "Immunosuppressive therapy is used to treat and manage solid organ and bone marrow/stem cell transplants; however, suboptimal dosing can lead to organ rejection and graft failure. Immunosuppressant drugs require therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to ensure dosing is adequate and therapeutic concentrations are achieved and maintained. The optimal blood concentrations of these drugs are critical to minimize toxicity and simultaneously prevent allograft rejection in an individual transplant patient. Often life-long TDM is required necessitating hospital or laboratory visits for routine venous blood sampling by phlebotomy. Immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporine A (CYA), tacrolimus (TAC), and sirolimus (SIR) require routine TDM. This entails immunocompromised people leaving their homes for laboratory visits, potentially increasing their risk of acquiring infections.\n\nTDM for CYA, TAC, and SIR are required due to their narrow therapeutic targets: CYA 150-400 ng/mL, TAC 5-12 ng/mL, and SIR 4-12 ng/mL. CYA, TAC, and SIR are primarily distributed in erythrocytes and should be quantified in whole blood. Immunoassays and the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays are the two commonly used methods of TDM for CYA, TAC, and SIR. While immunoassays provide an accurate measurement of concentrations, they often have some limitations on specificity. LC-MS/MS assays are very specific and efficient since they can quantify multiple analytes with a single method. At the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the clinical TDM immunoassays for CYA, TAC, and SIR require 0.5-1.0 mL of blood. TDM immunoassays require blood collection by a trained practitioner.\n\nVolumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) with an FDA-approved Tasso-M20 device allows for the accurate and precise collection of a fixed volume of blood from a capillary needle without the need for phlebotomy. The Tasso-M20 (FDA Class 1 exempt device) consists of a sample head with a lancet that is activated with the push of a button to accurately and painlessly collect blood samples from the deltoid (or similar) muscle (capillary sampling) of the subjects on all four tips (17.5 \u00b5L each). An LC-MS/MS assay with 20 \u00b5L blood, as obtained by the Tasso device, was shown to provide the required test range for TDM of trough values. This microsampling technique could be utilized clinically to promote the provision of TDM in children but has not been studied for immunosuppressive drugs (CYA, TAC, and SIR) in children.\n\nChildren and their parents/guardians who consent to the optional sub-study will be administered a brief survey after one study visit, to ask about their perceptions of the two methods of blood collection that they experienced at the visit."
