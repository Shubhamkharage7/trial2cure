            "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the biology and therapeutic potential of sodium-free chloride supplementation. While sodium homeostasis has been the focus of substantial investigation, very little research has been devoted to understanding chloride homeostasis. Thus, this proposal is designed to obtain the full spectrum of information pertaining to chloride, such as novel areas with great interest by the scientific community (i.e. modulation of the WNK-kinase system and the use of exosomes), to more practical/basic questions (i.e. what happens to sodium chloride balance when a patient is challenged with chloride).\n\nThis study is designed as a highly controlled inpatient \"GCRC\" arm to be compared to a real world efficacy study that has been proposed as a separate study. With extensive biobanking and analysis of samples in the inpatient setting, we will be able to deliver a great wealth of information on the biology and therapeutic potential of manipulating chloride homeostasis in heart failure."
