As a digital assessment solution, the CCE combines objective insights into cognitive ability with patient-reported insights to detect early signs of cognitive impairment and reveal specific modifiable risk factors earlier than the existing status quo assessments. The CCE is an FDA-listed Class II 510k exempt software as a medical device. The CCE has two components: The Digital Clock and Recall (DCR\u2122) test and the Life and Health Questionnaire (LHQ)."
