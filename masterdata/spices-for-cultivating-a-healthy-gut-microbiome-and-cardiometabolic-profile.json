As the required doses of spice-derived polyphenols to elicit prebiotic and systemic metabolic effects are not well-characterized, additional research is warranted. Thus, the investigators propose to use a food-first synbiotic (prebiotic + probiotic) approach to examine alterations in the gut microbiota pre- and post-intervention/placebo and their relationship with systemic cardiometabolic effects mediated by short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and gut-derived metabolites.",
