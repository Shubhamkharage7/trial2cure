During the post-operative period through 3 months, pain medication intake, subject reported pain (on post-operative day 7, 14, 21, 28, and 3 months) and quality of life (on day 28, 3 months, and 1 year) and incidence of intra-operative and post-operative adverse events related to the ventral hernia repair will be collected."
