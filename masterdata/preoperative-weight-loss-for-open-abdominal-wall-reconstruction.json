The main question is will abdominal wall specific quality of life (using the HerQLes survey) for the group undergoing upfront surgery be non-inferior compared to the group in the weight management program.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, single-center, registry-based, parallel, randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation. The study will consist of 2 arms: an intensive 6-month medical weight loss program prior to open retromuscular ventral hernia repair compared to upfront surgery without required weight loss. The medical obesity intervention will be conducted by physicians, nurse practitioners, and dieticians specializing in weight loss medicine. The study operations will be performed at Cleveland Clinic by six hernia surgeons with advanced abdominal wall reconstruction training."

An individualized intense lifestyle intervention will be implemented with the addition of an anti-obesity medication (phentermine, naltrexone/bupropion, phentermine/topiramate, liraglutide, semaglutide, etc). Medication use will be based on disease risk, patient preference, severity of obesity, contraindications, potential drug interactions and insurance coverage.
