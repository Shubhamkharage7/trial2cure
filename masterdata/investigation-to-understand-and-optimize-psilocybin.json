            "briefSummary": "This study will examine whether the antidepressant effect of a single dose of psilocybin administered with psychological support can be increased and extended via the use of post-dosing transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS), a known inducer of neuroplastic brain processes believed to be involved in the therapeutic effects of psilocybin. In addition, the study will examine objectively measured aspects of real-world social behavior known to promote wellbeing. Finally, the study will explore strategies for improving our ability to identify pre-treatment or early post-treatment behavioral responses to psilocybin predictive of good and bad longer-term therapeutic outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "One hundred forty-one adults ages 18 to 70 experiencing a major depressive episode of at least 60 days duration of moderate or greater severity at screening (as indexed by a Montgomery-Asperg Depression Rating Scale \\[MADRS\\] score at screening \u2265 28) will be enrolled to obtain evaluable data on approximately 120 subjects.\n\nAll subjects will receive a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin using a \"set and setting\" therapeutic approach that will include 1) several hours of preparatory sessions prior to dosing and 2) the presence of two facilitators throughout the dosing session; and 3) several post dosing integration sessions with a facilitator. Following the psilocybin dosing session, subjects will be randomized with a 1-to-1-to-1 allocation to 1) 7 days of twice daily transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) vs. 2) 7 days of twice daily sham taVNS vs. 3) treatment as usual (TAU), comprised of 3 post-psilocybin dosing integration sessions. Of note, because the provision of post-dosing integration sessions is current standard of care for psychedelic assisted therapy, subjects randomized to taVNS or sham will also receive 3 post dosing integration sessions, in keeping with the study's goal of evaluating whether TAU can be enhanced by the addition of taVNS. Both taVNS and sham sessions will be paired with prompts for subjects to focus on key elements of their' psychedelic experiences and with selections of music used during the psilocybin dosing session. This pairing approach is consistent with data demonstrating that the effect of taVNS is maximized when the procedure is used in conjunction with contextual cues relevant to the sought behavioral change.\n\nAssessments throughout study participation will assess depression, anxiety, well-being, functional disability, quality of life, social behavior, suicidal ideation, and adverse events prior to, and post-psilocybin dosing."

The MEQ has 4 sub scales: 1) transcendence, 2) positive mood, 3) ineffability, and 4) mystical. The total possible range for each sub scale and total score is 0-100% with higher percentages indicating a larger mystical experience.

Experiences queried include 1) facing emotionally difficult feelings that are usually pushed aside; 2) experiencing a resolution of a personal conflict/trauma; 3) being able to explore challenging emotions and memories; 4) having an emotional breakthrough; 5) getting a sense of closure on an emotional problem, and 6) achieving an emotional release followed by a sense of relief.
