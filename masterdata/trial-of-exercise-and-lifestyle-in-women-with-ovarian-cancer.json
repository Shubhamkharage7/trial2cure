If women are interested and eligible, the study team will obtain consent and collect baseline data. Participants will be randomized to an 18-week exercise and medical nutrition intervention or attention control throughout therapy. After the standard 6 cycles of chemotherapy (\\~18 weeks), a post-chemotherapy/end of intervention visit will be conducted. Follow-up assessments will be at standard of care visits (3-months post-chemotherapy and 12-months post-diagnosis). Data required to calculate the primary endpoint (relative dose intensity of chemotherapy) will be abstracted from the medical record directly following each chemotherapy session."
