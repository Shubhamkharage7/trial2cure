The current study will pilot and compare relative feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of three adapted GBAT groups and a Watchful Waiting (WW) group. The three groups include GBAT+Individual (GBAT+I; individual sessions to supplement the 10 group sessions), GBAT+Engagement Booster (GBAT+E; supplemental materials), and GBAT+Both (GBAT+IE individual sessions and supplemental materials)."

If the participant goes outside the outline, a buzzer sounds and puts the participant back at the start point. Prior to tracing any stars, the participant's affect is assessed using a 100-point scale (0 = none and 100 = extreme) to assess frustration, anxiety, happiness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and physical discomfort. The participant traces the \"difficult\" star again, only this time they are given an option to quit. The participant's time is recorded to measure how long they persist on the final star, referred to as task persistence. Afterwards, they rate affect from 0-100 in order to assess change in affect.",
