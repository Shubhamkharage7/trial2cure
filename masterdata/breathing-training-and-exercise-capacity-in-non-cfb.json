With each breath-out, the user exhales against the resistance provided by the weight inserts, and each inspiration (i.e., breath-in) is unresisted. During each resisted exhalation, the weight inserts are 'lifted' within the acrylic tube depending on the level of expiratory pressure generated by the participant.",
