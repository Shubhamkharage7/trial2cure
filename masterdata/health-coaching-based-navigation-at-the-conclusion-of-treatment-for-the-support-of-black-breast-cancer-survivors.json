A coaching-based navigation may perform a needs assessment and coach the participant to access relevant supportive content including physical rehabilitation, emotional and psychosocial support, and nutrition and exercise programming. This trial aims to see whether this navigation program may improve the quality of life of black breast cancer survivors.",

To evaluate the feasibility of coaching-based navigation for black breast cancer survivors including recruitment, dropout, and survey completion rates.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the preliminary impact of health coaching on completion of scheduled survivorship related referrals and participation in support services.\n\nII. To determine the preliminary impact on quality of life and self-efficacy pre and post coaching.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients are assigned a Black patient navigator for racial concordance and receive coaching from patient navigator over 30 minutes every other week for 3 months and then monthly for 3 months."
