            "briefSummary": "Approximately 20% of Veterans have a diagnosis of dry eye (DE) syndrome which is often accompanied by ocular pain that significantly impacts activities of daily living. Currently very few treatments are available for chronic ocular pain, likely because the mechanisms underlying this type of pain have only recently begun to be studied. New treatments that target the neuropathic mechanisms contributing to this type of pain are needed. The proposed research provides a crucial step in addressing the lack of treatments for neuropathic ocular pain by validating the methodology needed to support a randomized controlled trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). TENS is a non-pharmacologic, non-addictive, non-invasive treatment that has been shown to be effective in other chronic pain conditions. The present pilot study aims to address the need for preliminary support of safety and efficacy of TENS for ocular pain, t to advance the study of new treatments for the long-term relief of chronic ocular pain and its impact on health."
