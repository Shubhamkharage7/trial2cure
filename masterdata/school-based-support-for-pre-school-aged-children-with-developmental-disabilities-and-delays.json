The investigators designed an educational-clinical linkage model, Preschool and Me (PreM) which incorporates key components of a CCL. It also utilizes a personalized medical-education care plan with remote lay navigator support to increase access to school-based services.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants (n=320) will be randomized to either: 1) 6 months of PreM (intervention group) or 2) a waitlist control arm receiving the intervention after a 6-month delay. All participants will be followed for 12 months with data collection occurring at 4 timepoints (baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months). There will also be a simultaneously conducted mixed-methods implementation evaluation focusing on implementation outcomes to serve as indicators for implementation success; measures of implementation quality; and intermediate outcomes to understand and address successes and failures in relation to clinical outcomes."
