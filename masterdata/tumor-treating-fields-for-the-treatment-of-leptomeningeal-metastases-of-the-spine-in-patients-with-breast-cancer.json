Patients wear the portable Novo TTF-200T device that produces electric fields to target areas on the body to stop the growth of tumor cells. The information from this study will help researchers develop a better treatment for leptomeningeal metastases in the future.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of TTFields in treatment of the spinal component of leptomeningeal metastases.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To document any preliminary signals of activity, as measured by radiographic and clinical response, or durable stability of objective neurologic examination, utilizing Leptomeningeal Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (LANO) criteria, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytologic examination, and patient-reported symptom assessment (M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory \\[MDASI\\]-spine module).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients have transducer arrays applied and digital photographs taken of placement on study. Patients wear the NovoTTF-200T portable system on study. Patients also undergo MRI and may undergo lumbar puncture (LP) during screening and on study."
