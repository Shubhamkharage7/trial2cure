            "briefSummary": "Study CL3-95031-007 (CHONQUER) is a Phase 3, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of orally administered ivosidenib. Participants are required to have a histopathological diagnosis consistent with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) gene-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma Grades 1, 2, or 3 and not eligible for curative resection. IDH1 mutant status will be determined during pre-screening/screening phase. Participant must have radiographic progression/recurrence of disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and have received 0 to 1 prior systemic treatment regimen in the advanced/metastatic setting for conventional chondrosarcoma. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) in Grades 1 and 2 participants. Key secondary endpoints are PFS in all randomized participants, overall survival (OS) in Grades 1 and 2 participants, and OS in all randomized participants.\n\nParticipants who meet enrollment criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral ivosidenib 500mg once daily, or a matching placebo once daily."
