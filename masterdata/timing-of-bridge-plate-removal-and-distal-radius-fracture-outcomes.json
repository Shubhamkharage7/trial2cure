The secondary aim of the study is to determine whether a reduced duration of bridge plate fixation leads to an increase in wrist range of motion following plate removal compared to the standard duration of fixation. 100 patients with comminuted distal radius fractures that are indicated for bridge plate fixation will be randomized to the Accelerated Removal arm (n = 50) or the Standard Removal arm (n = 50)."
