Approximately 132 patients will be enrolled. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg orally daily or darolutamide 600 mg orally twice daily, in combination with standard LHRH agonist based treatment. Cognitive assessments will be performed using modules from Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) an internationally recognized software for assessing cognitive function and impairment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of the trial is to assess cognitive and quality of life outcomes over the 52-week primary data collection period of the trial. This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase II study comparing cognitive outcomes between men with metastatic or non-metastatic CRPC (mCRPC or M0CRPC) treated with darolutamide or enzalutamide. This will be a multicenter trial conducted at 12 sites across the US.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be the percent change in the maximally changed cognitive domain by 24 weeks in each study arm. Patients will be stratified by age (\\<65, 65-80, \\> 80). Patients will be allowed to cross over from either treatment to the opposite treatment arm at 12 and 24 weeks if they meet any of the cross-over criteria as described in the protocol.\n\nCognitive assessments will be performed using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), an internationally recognized software for assessing cognitive function and impairment. Tests available in the CANTAB battery include tests of learning and executive function; working memory; visual, verbal and episodic memory; and attention, information and processing time. The maximally changed cognitive domain is defined as the domain most changed from baseline in each individual.\n\nBlood samples will be collected for exploratory genomic analyses (AR CAG repeat length, PHS, exosome analysis).\n\nPatients will have the option to opt into an additional separate MRI sub-study. A subset of 40 patients (20 per arm) will undergo fMRI to measure percent signal change in the HP PFC circuit at baseline, 24 and 52 weeks or/and cross-over/end of treatment visit (if applicable)."
