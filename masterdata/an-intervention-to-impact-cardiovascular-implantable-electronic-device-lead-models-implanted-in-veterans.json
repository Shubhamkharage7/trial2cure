Each cardiac electrophysiologist will participate in a videoconference during which time an academic detailing and audit and feedback intervention will be implemented, which will include details and recommendations about lead selection for implantation, based on cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED: pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator \\[ICD\\]) lead-specific failure rates for lead models currently available in clinical practice. The cardiac electrophysiologist will also be presented with quantitative data about the individual physician's facility's implants and national data on implants over the past year. These data will be shared in advance, with time for questions and discussion. The electrophysiologist will be asked if anything can be done to facilitate selection of CIED lead models with the statistically and clinically significantly lower failure rates.\n\nThen, over the subsequent 3 months, a quantitative evaluation of the CIED lead models implanted will be evaluated, comparing changes in lead model selection among the electrophysiologists receiving the intervention to a control group of all VA cardiac electrophysiologists who do not receive the intervention. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to assess reasons for changes, or lack thereof, in CIED lead model selection - including barriers and facilitators. Finally, quantitative data will be included to each of the cardiac electrophysiologists, with additional feedback."
