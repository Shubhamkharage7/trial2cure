            "detailedDescription": "Clinically, there is a critical need for improved therapies in ovarian cancer. There has been recent success with maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer with both PARP inhibitors and bevacizumab approved in the up-front maintenance setting and in the recurrent, platinum sensitive maintenance setting. However, it is unclear what treatment should be used post-PARPi or bevacizumab maintenance. Additionally, the benefit derived from bevacizumab maintenance therapy is modest with generally a few month improvement in progression free survival. Further, there is emerging evidence that after progression on a PARPi, there is decreased response to platinum-based therapy. This provides a critical unmet need to enhance platinum response, particularly after previous maintenance therapy. This also provides a large group of patients who could potentially benefit from EZH2 targeting agents to block stromal-mediated chemotherapy resistance and metastasis.\n\nThis study aims to investigate whether CPI-0209 will enhance ovarian cancer sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and prolong the disease free interval after completion of chemotherapy by blocking stromal mediated chemotherapy resistance, metastasis promotion and ovarian cancer growth."
