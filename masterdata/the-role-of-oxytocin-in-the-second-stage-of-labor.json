            "detailedDescription": "Oxytocin is widely used on Labor and Delivery units throughout the world.Laboring patients are most likely to initiate oxytocin in the first stage of labor. Among those who receive oxytocin, first stage initiation is far more common than second stage initiation. The goal of first stage administration is to increase uterine contractility and cause cervical dilation, particularly in patients who have epidural analgesia. Once complete cervical dilation has been achieved, most providers choose to continue oxytocin in the second stage of labor for the theoretic benefit of increased expulsion \"power\" while pushing. This practice is currently not evidence-based as the limited data thus far suggests no difference in operative deliveries with the use of oxytocin augmentation in general. The benefits and risk of oxytocin continuation in the second stage of labor is unknown. Oxytocin administration is associated with the risk of uterine tachysystole, postpartum hemorrhage,and maternal hyponatremia. These risks call for a closer look at prolonged oxytocin use past the first stage of labor. This is a randomized controlled trial investigating the utility of oxytocin administration in the second stage of labor."

This protocol for titration and administration will be applied in this study to the oxytocin group. The intravenous pumps on Labor and Delivery have automated functions for intravenous administration of oxytocin that is milliunit-based and the same routine pumps will be used in this study. The study bag will be administered per current oxytocin protocol. Since patients will already be on oxytocin at time of randomization, their current bag of oxytocin will be continued by the primary provider at a rate of their discretion.",
