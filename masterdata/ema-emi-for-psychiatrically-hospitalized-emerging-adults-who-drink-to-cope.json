            "briefSummary": "The goal of this proposed study is to evaluate an ecological momentary assessment plus an ecological momentary intervention (EMA+EMI) for emerging adults in a psychiatric partial hospitalization program who drink to cope with negative affect (NA) as compared to personalized feedback only. This intervention combines a personalized feedback intervention (PFI) with EMA technology and tailored EMI text messaging (PFICope+EMI). PFICope+EMI not only aims to reduce drinking to cope, but also alcohol use and NA. This study consists of a 6-week randomized controlled treatment trial to test the PFIcope+EMI intervention as compared to personalized normative feedback only (PNF).",
            "detailedDescription": "Given the relationship between mental health and alcohol problems, there is a need to address comorbidity among emerging adults (EAs) with anxiety and/or depression. The weeks after psychiatric hospitalization are a risky time for problematic alcohol use and recurrence of psychiatric symptoms. The delivery of tailored, coping skills-based, real-time messages could have a significant impact on problematic drinking and depression/anxiety outcomes by reducing the likelihood that an individual drinks to cope with NA.\n\nThe aim of this study is to test a 6-week PFIcope+EMI intervention as compared to personalized normative feedback only (PNF) for EA in a partial hospitalization program who drink to cope and binge drink (n=60). The PFIcope+EMI includes: 1) an in-person personalized feedback session to present feedback on problems with drinking to cope, discuss the individual's use of alcohol to cope, and generate coping skills messages to be used in the EMI intervention; 2) EMA to monitor affect, intention to drink, coping skills usage, alcohol use, drinking to cope post-discharge; 3) tailored text messages (EMI) based on EMA (individualized coping skills messages when NA and intention to drink are reported). The Personalized Normative Feedback condition (PNF) will receive a personalized normative feedback report but no EMA or EMI.\n\nParticipants' alcohol outcomes and psychiatric symptomatology at 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and 6-months will be assessed to determine outcomes and feasibility/acceptability. It is hypothesized that:\n\n1. Individuals in PFIcope+EMI arm will report between-subjects reductions in drinking to cope, alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and NA as compared to PNF.\n2. PFIcope+EMI will be feasible to implement and result in high rates of participant satisfaction.\n\nMechanisms that may underlie the efficacy of the intervention for the PFIcope+EMI group utilizing the daily EMA data will be explored. It is hypothesized that:\n\n1. In response to NA, participants will report an increase in coping skills utilization and decreased intent to drink at the following EMA assessment point.\n2. NA reductions and increased coping skills utilization will be related to improvements in alcohol use rates and problems at the following EMA assessment."
