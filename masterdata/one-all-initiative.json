These goals are increasingly difficult to achieve, given the challenges of changes to workflow, staffing shortages, and increased costs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the pandemic brought to light the critical need to transform healthcare access for our racially and culturally minoritized and low-income families that have long been victims of health disparities, specifically with poorer health outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall objective is to successfully implement a patient app that will be used by families to 1) increase throughput for all patients, including minoritized, low-income, and low health literacy patients, and 2) reduce administrative burdens on providers.\n\nTo evaluate this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be examined:\n\nAim 1: Document modifiable factors that negatively and positively impact providers' ability to provide high-quality patient care in a post-pandemic healthcare system while addressing health disparities through implementation science.\n\nAim 2: Create a \"boarding pass' experience for providers and patients using technology (app) which allows patients and their families to fully prepare for their clinical visits and bridge care between home, primary care providers, and specialty care.\n\nAim 3: Investigate multilevel contextual factors related to app implementation, to inform future strategies to promote scalability and sustainability of app in all specialties."
