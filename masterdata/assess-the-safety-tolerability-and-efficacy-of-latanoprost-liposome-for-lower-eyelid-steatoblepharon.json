Subjects will be randomized to receive either one of two doses of POLAT-001 (1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL) or placebo (normal saline). POLAT-001 will be injected into the eyebags at three of the visits. Each subject will attend 7-10 clinic visits total over 98 to 140 days to assess efficacy and safety. Subjects assigned to placebo will crossover to receive active treatment. Efficacy will be determined using questionnaires and photography. Safety will be assessed by subject-reported events and investigator observations of the subjects."
