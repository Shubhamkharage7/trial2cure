            "detailedDescription": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. The pathogenesis of IBD involves immunological, genetic and environmental factors. Currently there is no cure for Crohn's disease and available medical and surgical treatments are expensive and often associated with significant side effects. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-\u03b1) agents are widely used for treatment of Crohn's disease. Electrical neuromodulation is a new treatment approach of bioelectronic medicine, involving molecular medicine, neuroscience, and bioengineering. Multiple possible mechanisms have been proposed for electrical neuromodulation in GI diseases, including central, autonomic, and/or enteric mechanisms. Vagal tone is significantly blunted in IBD and is associated with high TNF- \u03b1 levels. Animal and preliminary human studies have demonstrated that electrical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), including non-invasive vagal stimulation (nVNS), exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by harnessing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. In healthy humans nVNS has been shown to decrease tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels. Invasive VNS has been shown to improve inflammation in preliminary studies in patients with Crohn's disease.\n\nAdult patients with active Crohn's disease will be asked to self-administer transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation three times per day for 16 weeks. Inflammatory laboratory markers will be compared for each patient against their baseline levels to determine if the intervention helps reduce inflammation cause by their Crohn's disease. Questionnaires will be administered to evaluation their symptoms, and quality of life over the 16 week treatment period."
