            "briefSummary": "The primary aim of this clinical trial is to determine the acute effects of OLIPOP (a lower sugar, high fiber prebiotic soda) consumption, compared to consumption of a commercially available sugar-sweetened soda pop, on blood glucose in response to the beverages alone and in combination with a carbohydrate-rich mixed lunch meal in free-living, generally healthy adults.This study will consist of one screening/randomization clinic visit (day 0) and one follow-up clinic visit (day 5), with participants consuming study products on their own (e.g., at home) following an assigned treatment sequence on days 1, 2, 3, and 4. The main questions answered by this trial are the impacts of a prebiotic rich soda versus a traditional soda on: 1) blood glucose levels with and without a meal, 2) perceived hunger levels, 3) perceived alertness levels and 4) total caloric intake."

If use occurs during the intervention period (e.g., subject takes an aspirin), details of the use (e.g., time, amount, product) should be documented.\n14. Unstable use of any prescription medications that affect blood glucose levels, whereby stable is defined as no change in regimen within 90 d prior to visit 1a. Examples include diabetes medications, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, medications for anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and other mental health problems (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone), thyroid hormone replacement medications, statins, protease inhibitors, adrenergic receptor blockers, and isotretinoin.\n15.
