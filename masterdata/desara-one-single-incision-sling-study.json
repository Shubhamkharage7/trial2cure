The study will compare results from SIS patients (N=150) and TOR patients (N=150) at up to 40 sites for a total period of 36 months, with follow-up visits at 2 and 6 weeks, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. This study will enroll adult females who are clinically indicated for a mid-urethral implant for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) resulting from urethral hypermobility and/or intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD)."
