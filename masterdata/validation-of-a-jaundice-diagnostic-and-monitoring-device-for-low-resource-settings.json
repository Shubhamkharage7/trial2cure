            "briefSummary": "A team of researchers at Rice University in partnership with clinicians at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital created BiliSpec, a low-cost battery-powered reader designed to immediately quantify serum bilirubin levels from a small drop of whole blood applied to a lateral flow strip. The simple and affordable BiliSpec system offers a faster and more cost-effective means to detect neonatal jaundice in under-resourced clinics and determine when phototherapy is needed. The goal of this study is to validate the accuracy of the BiliSpec device in measuring bilirubin levels in neonates relative to the laboratory spectrophotometric bilirubinometer and transcutaneous bilirubinometer measurements.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will validate the accuracy of the BiliSpec device in measuring bilirubin levels in neonates relative to a laboratory spectrophotometric bilirubinometer (Reichert UNISTAT\u00ae Bilirubinometer) and transcutaneous bilirubinometer measurements.\n\nThis study will enroll up to 500 neonates at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and Kamuzu Central Hospital each, for a total of up to 1000 neonates, at risk for jaundice based on clinical signs and symptoms or undergoing phototherapy for treatment of jaundice. During the pilot study, 100 participants were evaluated and 147 samples total were collected. However only 7 samples collected were over 20 mg/dL. In addition to confirming the accuracy of BiliSpec in this validation study, enough samples of clinically high bilirubin concentrations (\\>20mg/dL) will need to be collected to ensure the device functions properly over the intended dynamic range (0-35 mg/dL). To accomplish this, data from up to 500 participants at each location will be collected.\n\nInformed consent will be requested from the parents of all eligible babies on the ward for this study. If the guardian does not consent, the patient's bilirubin levels will be assessed using the standard of care on the ward.\n\nDuring the study, the following steps will be taken:\n\nThe trained study nurse will assess the subject for clinical complications before performing the necessary heel prick blood draw.\n\n* A transcutaneous measurement of bilirubin and a heel stick will be performed on the neonate by a trained study nurse or clinician.\n* One drop of blood will be collected on the sample card and immediately used for analysis. BiliSpec will be operated by a trained nurse or trained research assistant.\n* Another drop of blood, collected in a capillary tube, will be centrifuged and then measured using the laboratory spectrophotometric bilirubinometer (Reichert UNISTAT\u00ae Bilirubinometer 1310310C). The spectrophotometric bilirubinometer will be operated by trained research assistants from the Rice department of bioengineering and the University of Malawi. Bilirubin concentration values measured by the gold standard laboratory bilirubinometer will be used to guide diagnosis.\n\nMeasurements will be made at multiple time points as indicated clinically.\n\nThe neonatal bilirubin concentration in mg/dL will be determined using the BiliSpec device, the gold standard laboratory spectrophotometric bilirubinometer, and the transcutaneous bilirubinometer described in the testing procedure. Measurements of bilirubin levels will be compared. All data will be recorded using a pre-determined data collection form. Analysis of the usability and robustness of BiliSpec will also be performed with regards to usability and device function by maintaining a log of any user error in using the device and a log of any observed device malfunctions. Data will also be collected on the effectiveness of BiliSpec to monitor neonates undergoing phototherapy.\n\nPersonal identifiers will be removed and confidentiality of the subjects will be strictly preserved. The data will be kept on a secure server accessible only to the study personnel."
