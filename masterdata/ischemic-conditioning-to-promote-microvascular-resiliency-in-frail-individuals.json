            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to see how small blood vessels respond to the stress of high intensity exercise, and if a safe and simple intervention called ischemic conditioning can protect blood vessels from the stress of exercise.\n\nParticipants will come in for 3 study visits and get home-based ischemic conditioning. At Study Visit 1, participants will be assessed for their frailty and physical function. Afterwards, they will perform an exercise test. At Study Visit 2, patients will undergo 2 microvascular assessments, perform a high-intensity exercise, then undergo the same 2 microvascular assessments again. Participants will be given a handheld sphygmomanometer and a blood pressure cuff to take home. Depending on which group the participants get randomized into, participants will place the blood pressure cuff around their non-dominant upper arm and inflate to either a low or high pressure for 2 weeks at home. Participants will repeat the same steps in Study Visit 2 for Study Visit 3. In addition, participants will also be assessed for their frailty and physical function.",
            "detailedDescription": "In elderly individuals the small blood vessels that regulate blood flow to organs and other tissues can become damaged when they are exposed to stress, which can lead to complications following stressful events like surgery. In this study we will examine how these blood vessels respond to the stress of high intensity exercise, and if a safe and simple intervention called ischemic conditioning can increase resiliency of these vessels.\n\nOur previous work showed that conditioned athletes are protected from the stress of a single, high intensity exercise bout whereas non-athletes are not. Others have shown that elderly individuals have reduced large artery function following the high intensity exercise. This study will be the first to examine how the small blood vessels respond to this stress in the elderly. Participants will be asked to come in for 3 study visits.\n\nStudy Visit 1\n\n1. Complete assessments on frailty and physical function\n2. Complete an exercise test using either a total body recumbent stepper or a bicycle and pedal in a seated position\n\nStudy Visit 2\n\n1. Undergo a blood draw to measure plasma sphingolipids\n2. Have a CytoCam device take images of small vessels inside their mouth\n3. Be assessed by the Laser Doppler Flowmeter while small doses of a vasodilator called acetylcholine are infused into the skin and the local temperature increases\n4. Complete a high-intensity interval exercise on a bicycle or an elliptical machine\n5. Have a CytoCam device take images of small vessels inside their mouth\n6. Be assessed by the Laser Doppler Flowmeter while small doses of a vasodilator called acetylcholine are infused into the skin and the local temperature increases\n\nHome-based Ischemic Conditioning\n\n1. Get a handheld sphygmomanometer and a blood pressure cuff to take home.\n2. Depending on which group the participants get randomized into, participants will place blood pressure cuff around non-dominant upper arm and inflate to either a low or high pressure.\n3. This intervention will be completed 5 times a day for 2 weeks\n\nVisit 3\n\n1. Undergo a blood draw to measure plasma sphingolipids\n2. Have a CytoCam device take images of small vessels inside their mouth\n3. Be assessed by the Laser Doppler Flowmeter while small doses of a vasodilator called acetylcholine are infused into the skin and the local temperature increases\n4. Complete assessments on frailty and physical function\n5. Complete an exercise test using either a total body recumbent stepper or a bicycle and pedal in a seated position\n6. Complete a high-intensity interval exercise on a bicycle or an elliptical machine\n7. Have a CytoCam device take images of small vessels inside their mouth\n8.
