A secondary aim is to examine how the menstrual cycle and use of hormonal birth control impact patient-reported outcomes and glycemic responses to physical activity.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this project is to further understand the impact of hormonal status on glycemic metrics and to test personalized changes to insulin dosing, through implementing the following specific aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Using CGM, examine glucose levels among women with T1D by menstrual cycle phase over a three month period to establish baseline glycemic variability, to identify personalized patterns of glycemic control across the menstrual cycle phase, and to test glycemic responses to acute bouts of aerobic, interval and resistance training.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Using the data from the observational period, examine patterns of glycemic variability by menstrual cycle phase in order to determine the appropriate alteration to insulin delivery needed to improve glycemic control across the menstrual cycle among women with T1D\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Test an intervention that includes up to four personalized adjustments to food intake, insulin dose and glycemic algorithms by menstrual cycle phase in a randomized intervention and control group. We will also examine responses to daily activity, planned exercise activities, and acute bouts of aerobic, interval and resistance exercise."
