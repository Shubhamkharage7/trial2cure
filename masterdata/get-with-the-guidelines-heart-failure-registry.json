The program aims to help ensure that eligible patients are initiated on guideline recommended therapies and receive appropriate counseling prior to hospital discharge.",
            "detailedDescription": "Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure was initiated in 2005 with over 500 U.S. hospitals participating is designed to improve the quality of care in patients hospitalized with heart failure. The program aims to help ensure that eligible patients are initiated on guideline recommended therapies and receive appropriate counseling prior to hospital discharge.\n\nPeer-reviewed research(with over 35 manuscripts) has demonstrated that through participating in Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure, hospitals will provide equitable care (regardless of race, ethnicity, age, or gender), the importance of scheduled physician follow-up after heart failure hospital discharge, the value in device-support as necessary for the acute heart failure patient, and many other significant findings.\n\nAchievement measures tracked through Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure:\n\n* Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at discharge\n* Evidence-based specific beta blockers\n* Measure left ventricular function\n* Post-discharge appointment for heart failure patients\n\nQuality Measures tracked through Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure:\n\n* Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist at discharge\n* Aldosterone antagonist at discharge\n* Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation\n* Hydralazine nitrate at discharge\n* DVT prophylaxis\n* CRT-D or CRT-P placed or prescribed at discharge\n* ICD counseling, or ICD placed or prescribed at discharge\n* Influenza vaccination during flu season\n* Pneumococcal vaccination\n* Follow-up visit within 7 days or less\n* Lab monitoring follow-up\n* SGLT-2 inhibitor at discharge\n* Defect-free care for quadruple therapy medication for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction\n* Direct-acting oral anticoagulant at discharge for non-valvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter patients\n\nAdditional measures collected by Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure can be viewed at: http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@private/@hcm/@gwtg/documents/downloadable/ucm_310967.pdf"
