            "briefSummary": "Millions of patients survive care in medical and surgical Intensive Care Units (ICUs) every year, only to suffer from a new or accelerated dementia-like process, called post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment (ICU-LTCI). ICU-LTCI causes considerable problems with personal relationships, return to work, and everyday tasks, such as managing medicines and money. No treatment for these patients is currently available. Technology using computerized cognitive rehabilitation could improve ICU-LTCI by harnessing the healing potential of the brain (i.e., neuroplasticity). This intervention is scalable, portable, and economical. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of computerized cognitive rehabilitation in a randomized controlled trial of 160 VA patients with ICU-LTCI. The investigators hypothesize that this intervention could improve cognition, and brain structure shown by MRI. This research has high potential to influence rehabilitation strategies for Veteran and civilian ICU survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "Over a lifetime, an average American will be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) twice, will spend nearly a week in an ICU during their last six months of life, and will have a one in five chance of an ICU-related death. Of those millions who annually survive critical illness, ICU survivorship is marked by an inability to manage medication, handle finances, live independently, and maintain employment due to post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment (ICU-LTCI).\n\nData from the investigators' group and others show that 50% of ICU survivors suffer from ICU-LTCI. The investigators' Veterans Affairs (VA) Merit Award funded research, \"Measuring the Incidence and determining risk factors for Neuropsychological Dysfunction in ICU Survivors\" (MIND-ICU) study, helped define the epidemiology of this persistent and progressive chronic brain dysfunction that affects both executive function and memory domains of cognition. Among survivors from medical and surgical ICUs, 40% have impairments rivaling moderate traumatic brain injury, and 30% have impairments similar to mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The MIND-ICU study indicates that the number of Veterans who develop ICU-LTCI is as high as the number of new traumatic brain injury diagnoses among all Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserves of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. For a public health problem of this magnitude, there is a driving unmet need to find solutions for ICU-LTCI.\n\nThe investigators' pilot randomized \"Returning to Everyday Tasks Utilizing Rehabilitation Networks-I\" (RETURN-I) Study showed that a 12-week cognitive rehabilitation intervention (vs. controls) improved executive dysfunction. Next, the investigators transformed this non-computerized, resource-intensive strategy into a novel, efficient, and scalable Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation (CCR) method. This plasticity-based adaptive CCR was applied to a case-series of ICU survivors which signaled improvements across multiple cognitive domains.\n\nBuilding on nearly two decades of aging brain research with the VA-Tennessee Valley Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), the investigators now propose a Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the efficacy of CCR for survivors with ICU-LTCI. The Returning to Everyday Tasks Utilizing Rehabilitation Networks-III Study (RETURN-III Study) will be the next logical data-driven approach to develop and offer innovative real-world solutions for civilians and Veterans surviving critical illness with disabling ICU-LTCI.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, the RETURN-III study will randomize medical and surgical VA ICU survivors to either intervention using CCR, or control of non-specific computer games. At three, and twelve months post-randomization, trained research personnel blinded to group assignment will use a validated battery to assess global cognition \\[primary outcome\\]."
