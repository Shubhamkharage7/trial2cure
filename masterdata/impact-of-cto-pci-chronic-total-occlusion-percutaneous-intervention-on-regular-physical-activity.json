            "briefSummary": "Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the US. . Heart blood vessel chronic total occlusions are 100% blockages of the heart vessels. These patients often suffer from chest pain, shortness of breath, and depression. Heart doctors thread special cables from the groin and wrist to the heart and open up these 100% blocked vessels. . This treatment improves symptoms and quality of life. Exercise is very beneficial for health. Previous studies suggest that even a 1000 steps/day increase in daily steps can improve health. But, patients with occluded heart vessels are often inactive because they have chest pain, feeling tired, or are short of breath. It is unknown whether opening these 100% blocked heart vessels will help patients have a more active lifestyle, which is good for health. The goal is to measure the impact of opening these occluded heart vessels on daily exercise in this project. Specifically, the investigators will give a smart watch to patients referred for this treatment. The smart watch will track the patients' daily steps before and after the procedure.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will compare the daily steps before and after the procedure to understand if the patients are more active. In addition to tracking daily steps, The investigators will track calorie expenditure with the watch.\n\nThe investigators will also use surveys to evaluate chest pain and depression. In sum, the investigators will study the impact of opening occluded heart vessels on daily exercise. If the investigators find that this routinely used treatment leads to increased daily steps, the investigators will know better which patients this treatment can help live longer and healthier"
