            "briefSummary": "Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) is a rare cannabinoid and is a homologue of THC that differs only in the length of the alkyl side chain (3C vs 5C, respectively). Pre-clinical and clinical trials have shown that THCV has medical potential as a neuroprotectant, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and most notably as a therapeutic to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients.\n\nSeveral THCV products are available in states with recreational cannabis. Anecdotal reports from adult cannabis users indicate that THCV provides an energizing, focusing and euphoric high-while still creating a lucid, uplifting experience. Additionally, unlike THC-dominant products, THCV was not reported to increase appetite. Other anecdotal comments referring to increased ability to focus for long periods of time and being more active were common.\n\nGiven anecdotal evidence, which shows that THCV is activating and improving focus, this provides rationale and justification to conduct a clinical research study to further test and understand whether THCV improves motivation, focus, level of energy, and does not stimulate appetite in healthy adults.",
            "detailedDescription": "The rationale for this study is to determine the effect of a consumer-grade, state-legal formulation of cannabinoids including Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) on motivation, energy level, focus, and appetite. A consumer-driven, decentralized observational clinical research study is therefore well suited to examine the effect of this formulation in healthy individuals.\n\nThe investigators will examine the outcomes in a broad age-range of adults who have chosen to try these products. The study will incorporate participant reported outcomes and surveys collected after each product use session to engage the participant in their typical day-to-day activities. There is no \"physician-patient\" relationship as part of this research since the participant as a consumer is making the informed choice to take the products and take part in the observational process with self-reported measures. Findings from this study will contribute knowledge toward the design of future cannabis research studies and the improvement of the product formulation.\n\nA new study questionnaire was developed as no existing questionnaire would be able to capture all interest areas of this study in a holistic manner. Other questionnaires related to focus, attention, concentration, fatigue, work, and motivation were assessed and used to support the study questionnaire development."
