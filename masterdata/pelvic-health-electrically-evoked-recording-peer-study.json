Willing and able to independently and accurately complete diaries, questionnaires, attend visits, and comply with the study protocol\n5. Willing to maintain current regimen (dosage and frequency) of any OAB medication from baseline diary through the end of therapy evaluation\n6. For subjects with urinary urge incontinence, have a diagnosis of OAB as demonstrated on a voiding diary by having a minimum of 3 episodes of urinary urge incontinence in the first 72 hours (Episodes must have a mild, moderate, or severe degree of urgency to meet this criterion) of the voiding diary.\n7. For subjects with urinary frequency, have a diagnosis of OAB as demonstrated on a voiding diary with greater than or equal to 8 urgency frequency episodes per day within the first 72 hours of the voiding diary.\n\nNote\\*: Candidate for or undergoing a Medtronic InterStim lead implant for labeled indication means that a clinical decision has already been made between a physician and the patient to undergo Medtronic Interstim lead implant to treat the subject's condition. This decision is to be made prior to discussing with the patient whether to enroll in the study.\n\nNon-Obstructive Urinary Retention Inclusion Criteria\n\n1. 18 years of age or older\n2.
