This study will consist of a screening period (up to 2 weeks), a 24-week treatment period consisting of a 12-week double-blind main treatment period and a 12-week double-blind transition period, which is followed by a 16-week follow-up period. The total duration of the study is up to 42 weeks.\n\nAt baseline, patients will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive the first 3 treatments of ADL-018 300 mg, XOLAIR 300 mg, ADL-018 150 mg or XOLAIR 150 mg (main treatment period). At Week 12, prior to receiving their fourth dose of study medication, patients in the XOLAIR 300 mg and the XOLAIR 150 mg treatment groups will be randomized 1:1 to receive 3 additional doses of XOLAIR (at the same dose level as prior to randomization, or switch to 3 doses of ADL-018 (transition period) at the same dose level as prior to randomization. All patients in the ADL-018 groups will continue to receive ADL-018 at the same dose levels."
