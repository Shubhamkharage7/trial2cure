One group will have an actionable driver oncogene and initiate treatment in any line with a TKI as standard of care and concurrent to participation to this study; expected to have an objective response rate in \u226540% who have not previously seen anti-bone resorptive therapy. The other group will not have actionable mutations and initiate treatment with chemotherapy/immunotherapy along with new onset therapy with IV zoledronic acid 4mg Q4 weeks or subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg Q12 weeks for bone disease, which is standard of care and would be concurrent to participation in this study.\n\nBaseline and on-treatment imaging and serum total alkaline phosphatase will be performed per SOC.\n\nAdditional non-SOC bone turnover markers including , urine N-telopeptide (NTX) and serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), will be checked at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months."
