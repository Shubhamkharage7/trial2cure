PPM is a bladder cancer-specific nanoparticle that can specifically target and deliver treatment to the tumor cells in the bladder. PPM contains paclitaxel, which is a drug that kills tumor cells or keeps them from growing.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of PPM administered through intravesical instillation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate tumor response at 6 weeks after completion of PPM intravesical therapy.\n\nII. Assess event-free survival rate at 12 months.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive PPM intravesically over 1 hour once a week (QW) for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET), and cystoscopy with biopsy at screening and follow up and undergo collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and then every 3 months per standard of care for 2 years."
