            "briefSummary": "The goal of this longitudinal study is to study the effects of a parenting skills group (Circle of Security Parenting, aka COSP) in mothers with postpartum depression. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Will changes in methylation of the OXTR rs53576 be apparent in mother and/or infant after having gone through the 8-week COSP program?\n* Will COSP participation be associated with improved symptoms of postpartum depression (over and above standard care), attachment style, and relational characteristics of the mother-infant dyad?\n* Will COSP participation be associated with changes in social behavior in the infant, and if so, do they persist throughout childhood?\n\nParticipants will\n\n* Participate in an 8-week COSP program delivered remotely via Zoom.\n* Provide buccal swabs (mother and infant) to assess changes in methylation of OXTR rs53576 pre- versus post-intervention.\n* Complete a series of assessment questionnaires delivered remotely.\n* Videotape a play-based assessment in their home.\n* Receive infant developmental testing\n\nResearchers will compare characteristics of waitlist controls to those participating in the COSP program at the mid-way point of the program to see if the two groups differ.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aims of this study are to 1) better understand the biological/genetic mechanisms and processes of behavior change in mothers and babies relating to oxytocin receptor gene methylation; 2) complete an outcome assessment of the efficacy of the COSP intervention using a tele-health format, specifically in relation to treating maternal depression; 3) to better understand the mechanisms and processes of change in relation to maternal and infant co-regulation achieved through the promotion of a secure attachment between mothers and their at-risk infants, and to understand how these processes form a trajectory of behavioral outcomes in kindergarten.\n\nThe COSP program lasts for 8 weeks and will be delivered via Zoom. Researchers will collect a variety of data including biological samples, self-report questionnaires, developmental assessment, and direct observation to assess predictors and outcomes relating to participation in the COSP program. Data will be collected prior to starting COSP, half-way through participation, after having completed the program, and at several timepoints following completion."

The COSP program provides parents with relationship tools and techniques for understanding their children's needs in new ways that provide lasting security for the child and more satisfaction for the parent. There are two major themes in the program: 1) teaching parents how to read their children's behavior and use it as a guide for meeting their needs and 2) helping parents to understand how their own early attachment relationships have influenced them as a person, and how those influences show up in their parenting and impact their ability to help regulate their child and respond to their needs.",
