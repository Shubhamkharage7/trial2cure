            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well erdafitinib works in controlling IDH-wild type (WT) gliomas with FGFR-TACC gene fusion that have returned or that have grown, spread, or gotten worse (progressed). Erdafitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal FGFR protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This may help keep tumor cells from growing and may kill them. Giving erdafitinib may help to slow the growth of or to shrink tumor cells in patients with recurrent or progressive IDH-wild type gliomas with FGFR-TACC gene fusion.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of erdafitinib in patients with recurrent or progressive IDH-WT glioma with FGFR-TACC gene fusion as measured by the best response at any time during treatment in terms of objective response rate (ORR).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of erdafitinib in patients with recurrent or progressive IDH-WT glioma with FGFR-TACC gene fusion.\n\nII. To assess the overall survival (OS) of erdafitinib in patients with recurrent or progressive IDH-WT glioma with FGFR-TACC gene fusion.\n\nIII. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months of patient with IDH-WT glioma with FGFR-TACC gene fusion treated with erdafitinib.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of erdafitinib followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients receive erdafitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter study completion, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years."

The increased T2/FLAIR must have occurred with the patient on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy and not be a result of comorbid events (e.g., effects of radiation therapy, demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects).\n* For patients with WHO grade 2 glioma progression is defined by any one of the following:\n\n  * Development of new lesions or increase of enhancement (radiological evidence of malignant transformation)\n  * A 25% increase of the T2 or FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, not attributable to radiation effect or to comorbid events\n* There must be measurable disease (enhancing or non-enhancing as per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology \\[RANO\\] or RANO-low-grade glioma \\[LGG\\] criteria), as evaluated on pre-treatment MRI\n* Patient understands the procedures and investigational nature of the study drug and agrees to comply with study requirements by providing written informed consent\n* Patient must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 (or Karnofsky \\>= 60%)\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1000/uL\n* Hemoglobin \\> 8 g/dL (Patients are allowed to be transfused to this level)\n* Platelets \\>= 100 x 10\\^9/L\n* Serum total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to Gilbert's disease or disease involvement following approval by the medical monitor\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 3 x institutional ULN\n* Creatinine clearance \\> 30 mL/min (patients with mild or moderate renal impairment) based on the Cockroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation\n* Patient must have normal serum phosphate level as per local laboratory parameters.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients should be New York Heart Association Functional Classification class 2B or better\n* The effects of erdafitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because FGFR inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and one month after completion of erdafitinib administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and one month after completion of erdafitinib administration\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to erdafitinib\n* Patients requiring any medications or substances that are moderate CYP2C9 inducers and strong CYP3A4 inducers are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because erdafitinib is an FGFR inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with erdafitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with erdafitinib\n* Current central serous retinopathy (CSR) or retinal pigment epithelial detachment of any grade\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation as confirmed by electrocardiography (ECG) at screening (Fridericia; QTc \\> 480 milliseconds)\n* Patients who have previously received FGFR inhibitors",
