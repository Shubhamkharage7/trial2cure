Patients between 18-75 years old with a one-year history of migraine who experience \u22653 migraine days/month will be screened. This study will include migraine patients treated with or without injectable CGRPmAbs. As was the case in the clinical trials, this will be a single-attack study. Patients will be randomized to treat a single migraine attack with ubrogepant 50mg or 100mg. Patients will record dosing time, most bothersome symptom (nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia - chosen by patient), pain freedom, pain relief, the use of a 2nd dose if required, and adverse reactions. Patients will follow up within 30 days post treatment. Patients will be assessed for adverse events, and the safety data will be compared with the original clinical trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of ubrogepant (UBRELVY) in patients currently treated with one of the injectable monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or the CGRP receptor (Aimovig, Ajovy, or Emgality). There are currently very limited data available about the use of CGRP receptor antagonists in this population, resulting in difficulty obtaining prior authorization to use ubrogepant in patients currently treated with CGRPmAbs. Questions remain as to whether these patients, whose CGRP or CGRP receptors are suppressed, will experience the same safety and efficacy results as patients without such suppression by CGRPmAbs.\n\nThis is a prospective open-label randomized study assessing similar endpoints included in the pivotal trial for ubrogepant, which are pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom at two hours. Patients between 18-75 years old with a one-year history of migraine who experience \u22653 migraine days/month will be screened.
