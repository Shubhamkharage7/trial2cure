            "briefSummary": "This study aims to examine the long-term effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, on chronic headaches following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). rTMS has been shown to be effective in reducing chronic headaches without side effects commonly seen in medications, such as sleepiness and addiction. This study uses rTMS to manage chronic headaches to improve post-concussion symptoms and reduce the economic burden due to delayed recovery. This project aims to better identify biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis and maximize recovery from mTBI."
