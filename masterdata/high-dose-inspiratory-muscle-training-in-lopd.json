            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to develop treatments that enhance respiratory strength and function to provide meaningful clinical improvements for people with LOPD. Identification of a cost-effective adjunctive intervention to address respiratory weakness remains critical to reduce disease burden, ease activity limitations and participation restrictions, and improve health-related quality of life. The proposed study will provide a high-dose inspiratory muscle training (IMT) stimulus to enhance treatment efficacy and efficiency. Our hypothesis is that high-dose IMT is necessary to produce meaningful changes in respiratory muscle strength and other outcomes in participants with LOPD."
