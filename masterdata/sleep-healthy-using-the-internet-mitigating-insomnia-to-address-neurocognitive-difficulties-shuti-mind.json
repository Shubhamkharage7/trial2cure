            "detailedDescription": "This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of an Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention on sleep and the extent to which it contributes to cognitive health in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Participants with insomnia who meet the study criteria for mild cognitive impairment will be recruited to determine the effects of the CBT-I intervention compared to patient education (PE) control condition on sleep and cognition. Internet-based recruitment methods will be used, and outcomes include sleep variables (reduced overall insomnia severity and wake after sleep onset), daytime variables (reduced levels of fatigue, improved quality of life, and improved mood), and cognitive status (memory, attention/psychomotor speed, and executive functioning domains). Participants will complete a pre-assessment battery, which consists of an online cognitive test, an online questionnaire, and two weeks of sleep diaries. Once complete, participants will be randomized to either the Internet-based PE or CBT-I intervention. At the start of week nine, all participants will be instructed to complete the post-assessment battery (cognitive test, questionnaires, and diaries). After completing the post-assessment, participants will have continued access to their assigned online program throughout the study duration. This same assessment (cognitive test, questionnaires, and diaries) will be completed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months."
