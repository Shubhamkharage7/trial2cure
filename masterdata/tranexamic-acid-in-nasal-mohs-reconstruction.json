            "detailedDescription": "Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent that acts to decrease bleeding by stabilizing the fibrin matrix involved in the clotting cascade. The use of TXA has been extensively described in the literature to prevent exsanguination in trauma and in various surgical procedures, as well as for heavy menstrual bleeding and epistaxis. Studies have suggested administration of TXA may improve outcomes in aesthetic surgery as well, specifically regarding intraoperative bleeding and postoperative ecchymosis and hematoma formation. TXA may be administered systemically, via IV or PO routes, or locally, via topical application or subcutaneous injection. Local administration allows for similar benefits with minimal risk of systemic effects.\n\nFollowing facial Mohs reconstruction patients often experience surgical site ecchymosis and swelling, which may be distressing, painful, prolong healing, and result in increased healthcare utilization. Other complications include hematoma, wound dehiscence, and suboptimal scarring. Given the growing body of literature demonstrating the benefits of TXA in surgical bleeding outcomes, TXA may also be beneficial in improving postoperative Mohs complications and patient satisfaction.\n\nTo date, no studies have investigated the use of perioperative TXA specifically in nasal Mohs reconstruction. This study will be a prospective randomized control trial to evaluate the effects of subcutaneously administered TXA among patients undergoing nasal Mohs reconstruction with local flaps at VUMC."
