Participants will be treated according to a standard treatment pathway, which includes contracture release treatment modalities such as limited fasciectomy, PNA and CCH injection, followed by post-operative radiation. All enrolled participants will undergo radiation treatment as soon as possible following contracture release. Radiotherapy will consist of 5 daily treatments of 300 cGy delivered to the palmar area followed by a 6-8 weeks break then a second 5 day course of radiation at 300 cGy, for a total of 3000 cGy in 10 total fractions. This dosing schedule is commonly used in the published literature. The data to be collected about participants, is their Southampton Dupuytren's score, history and clinical symptoms and photographs of their hand. This information will be obtained at baseline (pre-surgical intervention), at radiation treatment planning, approximately 6 weeks after completion of all radiation and at 1 and 2 years following completion of radiotherapy."
