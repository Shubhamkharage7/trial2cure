This study will iteratively evaluate different parameter sets that intend to maximize hearing performance benefits within technical requirements. This study is exploratory in nature and will achieve its objectives through ongoing review and adjustment of device parameters and fitting",
            "detailedDescription": "Alternative modes of stimulation will be investigated that may improve spectral resolution through reduced cochlear spread of excitation and in turn provide enhanced speech perception and real-world clinical benefits over MP stimulation. The purpose of this study is to balance the clinical improvements of alternative modes of stimulation with technical and usability requirements for power usage. By iteratively evaluating different sets of stimulation and sound coding parameters, this study will determine device settings and fitting techniques. Measures of speech recognition, listening effort, neural responses, electrode placement, battery life, and usability acceptance will be obtained to evaluate clinical benefits"
