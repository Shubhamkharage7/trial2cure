This study will have a total of 4 phases that include a preparatory work phase (Non-Human Subjects Research), a pre-implementation phase, an implementation phase, and a post-implementation phase.\n\nFindings from the preparatory work and pre-implementation phase and discussions with key partners will inform the co-design of intervention strategies and endpoints for the later phases (implementation and post-implementation phase).",
            "detailedDescription": "The preparatory work phase (Non-Human Subjects Research) will collect information on policies and procedures related to language access (LA) services use. Educational and patient-facing materials will also be reviewed. This information will be collected pre- and post-implementation.\n\nDuring the pre-implementation phase surveys and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders will be conducted to assess their views on barriers and facilitators to LA services and preventive services use and ideas about potential intervention strategies and resources to improve these services. Additionally, patients seen for ambulatory care preventive visit at one of the 4 study locations will be invited to complete an anonymous post-visit survey to assess their views on LA services use and provider-patient communication. Community members will also be invited to complete an anonymous survey to assess knowledge of LA rights and satisfaction with LA services. NYC Health \\& Hospitals (H+H) EHR reports will also be generated to collect visit-level information.\n\nThe implementation phase will include the development of culturally and linguistically appropriate and HL informed strategies and materials/toolkit for community members, patients, and health care providers and staff. Findings from the preparatory work and pre-implementation phase and discussions with key partners will inform the co-design of intervention strategies.\n\nDuring the post-implementation phase surveys and in-depth interviews will be conducted with key stakeholders to assess their views on barriers and facilitators to LA services and preventive services use and ideas about future potential intervention strategies and resources to improve these services. We will also examine perceived appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of the intervention. We will assess use and adoption of the intervention toolkit. Additionally, patients seen for ambulatory care preventive visit at one of the 4 study locations will be invited to complete an anonymous post-visit survey to assess views on LA services use and provider-patient communication. Community members will be invited to complete an anonymous survey to assess knowledge of LA rights and satisfaction with LA services. H+H EHR reports will also be generated to collect visit-level information."
