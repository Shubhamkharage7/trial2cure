The specific aims of the project are to: 1) adapt NECT to be responsive to the needs and preferences of youth with FEP, and 2) Assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the modified intervention (NECT-YA) combined with coordinated specialty care (CSC) services, compared to CSC services alone, in a small (n = 40) RCT.",

The investigators will also collect qualitative data on participants' impressions of NECT-YA, which will inform additional revisions of the manual."
