            "briefSummary": "The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes, ease of use, and cost of the Werewolf FLOW50 device to the institutional standard of care which is does not include the use of electrocautery devices during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery in patients 12-18 years of age using a randomized control trial design.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that a lower proportion of participants who undergo ACLR and are randomized to the Werewolf FLOW50 procedure will experience post-operative arthrofibrosis compared to those randomized to standard of care (control group).",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators foresee minimal risks to participants. The Werewolf FLOW50 is an FDA approved medical device to be used in the knee joint. he surgeon performing each surgery has used both the Werewolf FLOW50 device (according to FDA-approved indications for use) and no electrocautery device as standard of care during ACL reconstruction surgery.\n\nThere is minimal risk associated with the subsequent MRI. Participants may experience slight discomfort from the confined space, flashing lights in their eyes, or temporary warmth/reddening of the skin following MRI. Participants will be informed of these risks and discomforts and pregnant participants or those with any metal and/or electronic devices inside their bodies will not receive the MRI.\n\nThere is the risk of unintended disclosure of protected health information (PHI) to individuals outside the research team. To mitigate this risk, data points are entered into a password-protected, HIPAA compliant REDCap database accessible to only the PIs and study personnel. Children's Colorado affiliated and approved study personal will have access to all study information collected at all involved study sites. However, other study sites will only have access to the information collected on patients enrolled at their site. We believe this system will contribute to the protection of PHI. The only PHI collected will be visit dates; all participants will be linked to their information via a unique study identifier.\n\nThe PI will periodically review the status of this protocol. Any unanticipated problems will be disclosed to COMIRB \\[Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board\\] within five days with a cover letter detailing the assessment and actions to be taken."
