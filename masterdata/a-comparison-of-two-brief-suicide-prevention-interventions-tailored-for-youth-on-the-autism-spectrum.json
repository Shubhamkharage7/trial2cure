            "briefSummary": "Rates of suicide have increased significantly over the past two decades, particularly among youth. Compared to the general population, autistic people are significantly more likely to think about suicide, attempt suicide, and die by suicide. Autistic individuals have identified suicide prevention as a top research priority; however, little is known about how to best help autistic youth at risk for suicide. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of two suicide prevention strategies tailored for autistic individuals: the Safety Planning Intervention tailored for Autistic individuals (SPI-A) and SPI-A plus structured follow-up contacts (SPI-A+).",
            "detailedDescription": "This study includes three aims:\n\nAim 1: Among autistic youth (age 12-24) at risk for suicide, compare the effectiveness of SPI-A vs. SPI-A+. The primary outcomes of interest are suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behavior (SB). Secondary patient-centered outcomes are mental health treatment initiation and engagement, quality of life, well-being, skills to manage SI, access to lethal means, safety plan use, and acute care services for suicidality.\n\nAim 2: Compare implementation outcomes of acceptability and feasibility for the two interventions from the perspectives of patients, clinicians, and health system administrators.\n\nAim 3: Explore patient characteristics that may moderate the relationship between intervention and SI and SB."
