            "briefSummary": "The COPE-AKI study is a randomized, pragmatic, parallel-arm trial comparing a multimodal intervention to usual care on hospital-free days through 90 days of study follow up. The primary study hypothesis is that patients randomized to the intervention will have increased odds of more hospital-free days through 90 days (primary clinical) compared to those randomized to usual care. Key secondary hypotheses will investigate the impact of the intervention on rates of major adverse kidney events, rates of recurrent AKI, and changes in patient-reported outcomes. Participants (N=2145) will be allocated 1:1 to the intervention or usual care using a web-based system to maintain allocation concealment using stratified randomization with randomly permuted blocks. Randomization will be stratified by clinical site.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary study hypotheses for the COPE-AKI study are: compared to usual care, patients randomized to a multimodal intervention will have increased odds of more hospital-free days through 90 days (primary) and lower rates of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) at 180 days, lower rates of recurrent AKI at 180 days, and greater improvements in patient-reported outcomes over 90 days (secondary).\n\nThe primary outcome is hospital-free days through 90 days of follow up, defined as 90 minus the number of calendar days in the hospital as either an inpatient or on observation status, based on the determination made by the corresponding hospital. Key secondary outcomes include: rates of MAKE (measured at 90, 180, and 365 days), rates of recurrent AKI (90, 180, and 365 days), and 4 patient-report outcomes: global health related quality of life, AKI-specific health related quality of life, provider interactions, and social support (30, 90, 180, 365 days).\n\nA multimodal process-of-care intervention that includes 1) study physician oversight and follow up care recommendations at the time of hospital discharge; 2) involvement of a nurse navigator to provide kidney-disease related education, coordinate care, and assess symptoms; and 3) pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and review. Participants in the usual care arm will be provided information about their kidney disease, nephrotoxins to be avoided, and the importance of follow up with a physician will be emphasized."
