            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of venetoclax and azacitidine in treating patients with therapy related or secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving venetoclax in combination with azacitidine may work better in treating patients with therapy related or secondary myelodysplastic syndrome.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the proportion of participants that achieve a complete remission following treatment with azacitidine and venetoclax.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess safety of azacitidine and venetoclax combination therapy. II. Determine the overall response rate (ORR). III. Determine the complete cytogenetic response rate (CCyR). IV. Determine the duration of response (DOR). V. Estimate event-free survival (EFS). VI. Estimate overall survival (OS). VII. Determine combined hematologic improvement rate (HIR). VIII. Determine red blood cell transfusion independence rate. IX. Determine platelet transfusion independence rate. X. Determine proportion of participants whose disease transforms to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nXI. Determine proportion of participants that proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT).\n\nXII. Compare response criteria between the 2006 International Working Group (IWG) and 2023 IWG criteria.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine baseline frequencies of cytogenetic aberrations and their relationships to response to study therapy.\n\nII. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS). III. Obtain quality of life (QoL) information from patient-reported responses to Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Short Form 7a and European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) - Core 30 (C30) questionnaires.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7 or days 1-5 of week 1 and days 1 and 2 of week 2. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months for up to 24 months."
