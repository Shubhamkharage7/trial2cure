The purpose of this study is to estimate rate of acute clinician-reported gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity using WP PBS PRT in the definitive treatment of gynecologic cancers in the post-surgical, adjuvant setting.",

The study will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiation Oncology and associated Clinical facilities.\n\nThe study intervention is Whole Pelvis (WP) Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Radiation (PBS PRT) as part of the definitive treatment of gynecologic cancers in the post-hysterectomy, adjuvant setting. Patients will be treated with doses of 45 or 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions."
