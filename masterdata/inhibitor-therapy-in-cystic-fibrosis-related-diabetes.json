            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this proposal is to collect pilot data for safety and feasibility metrics to support a future larger randomized controlled trial. In this study, we will examine the safety and tolerability of Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin as an add-on therapy to insulin for overweight/obese adult patients with CFRD. We hypothesize that empagliflozin will be safe, well tolerated and will improve glycemic control in overweight/obese adult patients with CFRD.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Collect pilot data on the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of empagliflozin therapy in overweight/obese patients with CFRD to support a future larger randomized controlled trial.\n\nHypothesis 1: Empagliflozin will be safe and well tolerated, with no evidence for electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, ketosis or increased risk of severe hypoglycemia in overweight/obese adults people with CFRD.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Collect preliminary data to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on glycemic outcomes.\n\nHypothesis 2: Treatment with empagliflozin will improve glycemic control as indicated by glucose levels as measured by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and on glycemic outcomes as measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)."
