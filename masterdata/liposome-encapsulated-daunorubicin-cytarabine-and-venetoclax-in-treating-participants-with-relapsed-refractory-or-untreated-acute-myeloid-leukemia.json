Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy (complete remission \\[CR\\], complete remission without blood count recovery \\[CRi\\], complete remission without platelet recovery \\[CRp\\]) of liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) in combination with venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess safety of CPX-351 in combination with venetoclax in patients with AML.\n\nII. To assess the event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with AML.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance in AML treated with CPX-351 and venetoclax.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax.\n\nINDUCTION: Participants receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 of cycle 1 and on days 1 and 3 of cycle 2. Participants also receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCONSOLIDATION: Participants receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 and venetoclax PO QD on days 2-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for 3 years."

Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation\n* Prior treatment with CPX-351 or venetoclax.
