Veterans undergo brain imaging and physiological measures in conjunction with traumatic scripts before and after three months of twice daily treatment with tcVNS or sham stimulation at home.",
            "detailedDescription": "Description: This study assesses brain function measured with High Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) during exposure to stressful traumatic scripts paired with tcVNS or sham stimulation, with secondary measures of blood inflammatory biomarkers, and sympathetic function. Participants then undergo three months of twice daily home treatment with repeat measures.\n\nDrug/Device Handling: \\[O-15\\] radiolabeled water has a half-life of 110 seconds and is made on site at the Emory Center for Systems Imaging (CSI). Dr. Bremner holds the Investigational New Drug (IND) approval for use of radiolabeled water at Emory University. The investigators have performed hundreds of studies in human subjects at Emory and there have been no adverse events or untoward effects to date.\n\ntcVNS with the GammaCore device is approved by the Emory IRB for a recently completed study in PTSD and others in progress for Opioid Use Disorder and was shown to be well tolerated and there have been no adverse events or untoward effects with the device. The FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation for PTSD for the gammaCore tcVNS device based on the investigators' studies. Devices are blinded by ElectroCore and the devices and information are kept by the Data Manager under double lock and key. Device records are kept by the Data Manager and stored on Redcap or secured research drives. Devices are given to the study team along with a device schedule under direct supervision from the investigator."
