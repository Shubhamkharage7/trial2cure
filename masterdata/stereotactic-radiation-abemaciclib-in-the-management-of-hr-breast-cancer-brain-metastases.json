Treatment will be initiated with one week of abemaciclib followed by stereotactic radiation to sites of brain metastases or post-operative cavities with continued abemaciclib. Safety will be monitored initially by a 3+3 design. This will be followed by a phase 2 study to evaluate intracranial progression free survival (PFS). If unexpected neurologic toxicities are noted, the dose of radiation therapy will be modified."
