Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, only if the dose does not exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent.\n29. History of allergy or sensitivity to study drug components or prior monoclonal antibody treatment; known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab or bevacizumab formulation.\n30. History of allergy or sensitivity to study drug components or prior monoclonal antibody treatment; known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab or bevacizumab formulation. \\\\History of life-threatening toxicity related to prior immune therapy (eg, anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 or anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 treatment or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways \\[eg, CD40, 4-1BB\\]) except those that are unlikely to recur or are expected to be manageable with standard countermeasures (eg, hormone replacement after adrenal crisis). Individual cases should be discussed with Medical Monitor as appropriate.\n31. Conditions in which anticoagulant therapies cannot be safely stopped in the periprocedural period or patients on coumadin with a target INR \\>2.5 or that cannot be temporarily reversed toINR\u22641.7 around the time of intratumoral injections.\n32. Treatment with botanical preparations (eg, herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) intended for general health support or to treat the disease under study within 2weeks before initiating study treatment.\n33. Prior organ transplantation including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.\n34. Major surgery within 28days before starting bevacizumab or anticipated major surgery while on study.\n\nNote: If a patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the intervention before starting study treatment and must have adequate wound healing, based on surgeon's assessment, before starting bevacizumab.",
