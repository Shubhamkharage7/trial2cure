            "briefSummary": "The participants of this study will have confirmed Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC).\n\nParticipants will also have inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) a drug used to treat PBC.\n\nPBC is a disease that progresses slowly. It causes damage to the bile ducts in the liver, leading to a build-up of bile acids which causes further damage.\n\nThe liver damage in PBC may lead to scarring (cirrhosis). PBC may also be associated with multiple symptoms. Many people with PBC may require liver transplant or may die if the disease progresses and a liver transplant is not done.\n\nThis study will compare a daily dose of elafibranor (the study drug) to a daily dose of placebo (a dummy treatment). Each participant will be in the study up to about 7 years.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to determine if elafibranor is better than placebo in preventing clinical outcome events showing disease worsening (including progression of disease leading to liver transplant or death).\n\nThis study will also study the safety of long-term treatment with elafibranor, as well as the impact on symptoms such as itching and tiredness."
