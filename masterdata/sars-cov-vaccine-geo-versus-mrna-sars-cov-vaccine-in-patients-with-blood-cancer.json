            "briefSummary": "This phase 2 trial studies the immune response to GEO-CM04S1 (previously designated as COH04S1) compared to standard of care (SOC) mRNA SARS-COV-2 vaccine in patients with blood cancer who have received stem cell transplant or cellular therapy.\n\nGEO-CM04S1 belongs to a category called modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccines, created from a new version of MVA, called synthetic MVA. GEO-CM04S1 works by inducing immunity (the ability to recognize and fight against an infection) to SARS-CoV-2. The immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that would block the virus from entering healthy cells. The immune system also grows new disease fighting T cells that can recognize and destroy infected cells. Giving GEO-CM04S1 after cellular therapy may work better in reducing the chances of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or developing a severe form of COVID-19 disease in patients with blood cancer compared to SOC mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate the biological activity and the role of timing of 2 injections of GEO-CM04S1 vaccine administered at 2.5e8 PFU/dose compared to SOC mRNA vaccine.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess safety of GEO-CM04S1 vaccine. II. Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 S and N-specific Th1 vs Th2 polarization. III. Evaluate T-cell levels and function. IV. Evaluate activated/cycling and memory phenotype markers. V. Evaluate durability of immune responses. VI. Evaluate maintenance of immunity that can be associated with protection over the study period.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Surveillance for incidental COVID-19 infection during follow-up (1 year).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I : Patients receive one dose of GEO-CM04S1 intramuscularly (IM) in the upper arm on days 0 and 28.\n\nARM II : Patients receive one dose of SOC mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine IM in the upper arm on days 0 and 28.\n\nAfter the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 90, 120, 180, and 365."
