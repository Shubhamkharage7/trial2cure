            "briefSummary": "In order to support the desire of most adolescents to delay pregnancy (parenting) until their own adulthood, pediatricians must be comfortable and skilled in having reproductive health conversations with adolescents and the mothers of adolescents. Artificial intelligence, such as a chatbot, could be programmed to simulate the perspective of the mother or the daughter as a tool for pediatricians to practice communication before interacting with \"real\" families. Through human-centered design, an iterative problem-solving approach, our overall goal is to develop and test a communication training chatbot tool that is accurate, developmentally tailored for adolescents and mothers, culturally tailored, and aids pediatricians to manage resistance and conflict about contraception to ultimately close disparities in teen births. The investigator's primary hypothesis is that a communication focused intervention will improve pediatrician interactions with dyads about contraception. Through three stages, the study team will develop an artificial intelligence tool as a behavioral intervention. The study team will gather basic communication data to generate, refine, modify, adapt, and pilot test novel communication tools with real-world encounters while keeping humans at the center of attention",
            "detailedDescription": "In Stage 1 (formative), the investigators will characterize communication content and styles of pediatricians (residents, fellows, attendings) and adolescent-mother dyads on contraception discussions with 50 real-life clinical encounters. Through separate post-encounter surveys of each pediatrician-adolescent-parent \"triad\" using validated scales, the investigators will describe the overall quality of the interactions (concordant contraception plans, satisfaction), communication (confidence, comfort, self-efficacy, confidentiality) and decision-making (perceived autonomy, ownership, and power) to determine \"ideal, moderate and poor\" communication interactions. Then, separate group interviews (n = 15, with adolescents, mothers and physicians) will review recorded vignettes to identify optimal culturally tailored communication strategies. In Stage 2 (development), the investigators will upload de-identified and anonymized vignettes to an AI communication training tool to develop and refine the tool through prompt engineering and performance evaluation with adolescent, parent and pediatrician advisory boards. Then, the investigators will iteratively test the acceptability and feasibility of the tool on 10 pediatrician learners. In Stage 3 (proof-of-concept), the investigators will test how an AI communication intervention tool can improve reproductive health encounters by comparing evaluation results of 50 pre-training and 50 post-training real encounters. This study will advance pediatrician communication training, empower adolescent sexual health, support mothers' priorities, and test how AI communication training chatbots can improve triadic interactions."
