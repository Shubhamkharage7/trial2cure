            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test whether one minute of stair stepping at a comfortable pace can reduce blood sugar after meals. The main objectives of the study are:\n\nCompare continuously measured post-meal glucose after stair-stepping to control condition Compare continuously measured post-meal glucose after stair-stepping between meals Assess interaction between condition and meal to determine if the effect of stair-stepping on post-meal glucose depends on meal\n\nParticipants will be in the study for 10 days and will be asked to:\n\nWear a continuous glucose monitor over the course of the study Perform either one minute of comfortable pace stair stepping 15 min after each meal OR no exercise 1 hour after eating a meal on alternating days Perform a dietary recall every two days Perform no exercise within one hour after each meal on any day during the study Consume no calories within one hour after each meal during the study",
            "detailedDescription": "After being informed about the study and potential risks, all participants giving written informed consent will undergo a screening to determine eligibility for study entry. At day 1, patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomly assigned to Arm 1(stair stepping day followed by no exercise day sequence) or Arm 2(no exercise day followed by stair stepping day sequence). At this time participants will also be familiarized with the continuous glucose (i.e., blood sugar) monitor they will wear for ten days, be instructed how to fill out a food log every day and determine a comfortable stair stepping pace. On day 10 participants will return to the lab for sensor removal and transmitter return."
