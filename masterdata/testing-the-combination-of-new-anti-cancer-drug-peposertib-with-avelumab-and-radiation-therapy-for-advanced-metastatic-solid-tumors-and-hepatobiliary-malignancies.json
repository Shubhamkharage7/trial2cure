            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of peposertib and to see how well it works with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies that have spread to other places in the body (advanced/metastatic). Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving peposertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of peposertib (M3814) in combination with hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination of hypofractionated radiation, M3814, and avelumab as compared to the combination of hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with advanced/metastatic hepatobiliary tumors by objective response rate (ORR) in non-irradiated lesions. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of M3814 in combination with avelumab. (Phase I) III. To determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of hypofractionated radiation, M3814, and avelumab as compared to hypofractionated radiation and avelumab by measurement of disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), PFS outside the irradiated field, and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced/metastatic hepatobiliary tumors. (Phase II) IV. To determine if baseline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair defects inherent to some cholangiocarcinomas correlate with a more dramatic response to radiation compared to those without as measured by gamma H2AX phosphorylated (p)NBS1 multiplex immunofluorescence (IFA) assay. (Phase II) V. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of M3814 and avelumab. (Phase II)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), and T cell receptor sequencing in order to:\n\nIa. To determine if baseline tumor mutation burden and pattern, and neoantigen burden correlate with response.\n\nIb. To determine if combination therapy results in changes in the immune landscape in both the tumor and the host that correlate with response.\n\nIc. To determine if baseline defects in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair in some cholangiocarcinomas correlate with an increased response.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of peposertib followed by a phase II study.\n\nPHASE I:\n\nPatients with advanced/metastatic malignant solid tumors undergo 8 fractions of hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) every day (QD) on days -17 to -7. Patients also receive peposertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPHASE II: Patients advanced/metastatic cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder cancer are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients undergo 8 fractions of hypofractionated RT QD on days -17 to -7. Patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo biopsy, computed tomography (CT), and collection of blood on the trial.\n\nARM B: Patients undergo 8 fractions of hypofractionated RT QD on days -17 to -7. Patients also receive peposertib PO BID on days 1-28, and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo biopsy, CT, and collection of blood on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter."

If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The effects of M3814 and avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown and there is the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For this reason, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study treatment, and for 6 months after completion of M3814 and avelumab administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M3814 and avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M3814 and avelumab\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics are eligible\n* Patients with known chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must have an undetectable viral load on suppressive therapy if indicated. Patients with known chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. Patients who are currently on curative treatment are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are allowed on study provided they have:\n\n  * A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)\n  * No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infection\n  * A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL\n  * An undetectable HIV viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing\n* Patients with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced), organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan\n* Patients with known concurrent malignancy that is expected to require active treatment within two years, or may interfere with the interpretation of the efficacy and safety outcomes of this study in the opinion of the treating investigator. Superficial bladder cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and low-grade prostate cancer not requiring cytotoxic therapy should not exclude participation in this trial.

Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 must be stopped at least 3 weeks prior to the first dose. Drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic index as judged by the investigator must stop at least 1 day prior to first M3814 dose. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. The primary elimination mechanism of avelumab is proteolytic degradation, thus there are no contraindicated medications with respect to avelumab\n* Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) prior to starting M3814 and avelumab. These must be discontinued \\>= 5 days prior to starting M3814 and avelumab. Patients do not need to discontinue calcium carbonate. H2 blockers are allowed provided they are taken at least 2 hours after M3814 dose\n* Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine) and not able to discontinue prior to starting M3814 and avelumab are excluded\n* Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study because M3814 and avelumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M3814 and avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M3814 and avelumab\n* Patients who have received live vaccination within 30 days before starting M3814 and avelumab",
