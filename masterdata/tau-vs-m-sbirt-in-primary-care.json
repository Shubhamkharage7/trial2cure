Secondary Aim is to compare m-SBIRT to TAU on Substance Use Treatment Attendance.",

To do so the study, Investigators will be comparing a text message based substance use screening and treatment program, called Mobile Screening, Brief intervention, and Referral to Treatment (m-SBIRT) to standard of care Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral Treatment which traditionally takes place in-person. Patients at the MUSC Bee Street Primary Care Clinic between the ages of 18-75 may be eligible."
