The presence of sexual dysfunction is associated with decreased well-being and quality of life. There is limited research supporting pharmacological and other therapeutic approaches for managing sexual dysfunction in MS. Physical activity has bene\ufb01cial e\ufb00ects on many of the consequences of MS, and physical activity represents a promising non-pharmacological approach for managing symptoms of sexual dysfunction in MS. The proposed research examines the e\ufb00ect of an Internet-delivered lifestyle physical activity intervention for improving sexual dysfunction in women with MS. The research proposed, if successful, will provide evidence for the e\ufb03cacy of physical activity as a translatable approach for managing sexual dysfunction among women with MS."

The chats support adherence to the intervention,discussion of website material,supportive accountability,and reporting of adverse events/injuries.
