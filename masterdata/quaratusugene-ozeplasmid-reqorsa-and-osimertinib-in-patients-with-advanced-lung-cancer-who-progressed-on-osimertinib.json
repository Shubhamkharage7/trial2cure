            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this randomized study is to determine the safety and efficacy of quaratusugene ozeplasmid (Reqorsa) added to osimertinib in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations who have progressed while on treatment with osimertinib. Quaratusugene ozeplasmid consists of non-viral lipid nanoparticles that encapsulate a DNA plasmid with the TUSC2 tumor suppressor gene and is the first systemic gene therapy for cancer.\n\nThe study will comprise of a Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 evaluations of safety and efficacy. In the Phase 1 dose escalation, patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts treated with successively higher doses of quaratusugene ozeplasmid in combination with osimertinib. When the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined in Phase 1, Phase 2a will be initiated and patients will be enrolled in 2 parallel, non-randomized cohorts treated with quaratusugene ozeplasmid at the RP2D in combination with osimertinib. In Phase 2b, patients will be randomized to receive either quaratusugene ozeplasmid plus osimertinib or platinum-based chemotherapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Acclaim-1 is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating quaratusugene ozeplasmid (Reqorsa) plus osimertinib (investigational arm) versus platinum-based chemotherapy (control arm) in patients with advanced metastatic or recurrent NSCLC.\n\nToxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Serious Adverse Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be reviewed by a Safety Review Committee.\n\nPhase 1 - Dose Escalation: The RP2D of quaratusugene ozeplasmid when given in combination with osimertinib will be identified.\n\nPhase 2a: Once the RP2D of quaratusugene ozeplasmid is identified in Phase 1, 2 expansion cohorts will be enrolled to better characterize safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination therapy.\n\nPhase 2b: Quaratusugene ozeplasmid in combination with osimertinib will be further evaluated using the RP2D identified in Phase 1. Patients may receive local therapy, such as radiation therapy, to progressing lesions prior to enrollment. Patients will be randomized to receive either the investigational arm or the control arm in a 1 to 1 ratio and stratified based on prior local radiotherapy."
