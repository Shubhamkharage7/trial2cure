            "briefSummary": "Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a significant and pervasive issue among upper limb amputees, severely impacting their quality of life. The literature delineating prevalence of upper versus lower limb amputations is limited, but the prevalence of total amputations in the United States is estimated to reach 3 million individuals by 2050, with approximately 185,000 new cases annually. PLP affects 60-68% of these patients, leading to heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and reduced overall well-being.",
            "detailedDescription": "Although studies exploring the efficacy of VR therapy for PLP have reported positive outcomes, several limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of randomization, and inconsistent treatment protocols, have impeded widespread adoption of these innovative approaches. Additionally, the literature does not sufficiently delineate which aspects of the phantom limb experience may be addressed with VR therapy. To overcome these limitations and optimize treatment efficacy, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of the phantom limb experience, including both somatosensory and kinesthesia-related symptoms. Additionally, this study will address these limitations by employing a larger sample size, rigorous methodology, and a standardized treatment protocol."
