            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to understand how the difference in positioning of a patient intraoperatively, as part of performing an anterior posterior spine fusion surgery, can affect short term and long term outcomes. This will be accomplished through observational techniques that will not affect the care patients will receive for their spinal conditions.\n\nPatients will be asked to complete health and wellness surveys before and after survey to determine how they are doing before surgery and then what if any changes their respective surgeries have had on their lives. Further spine x-rays that they have taken to plan their surgeries and assess their recovery will be measured, when available. X-rays will not be taken only for research purposes. Additionally aspects of their surgeries will be noted such as where hardware is placed and how long different parts of the surgery took.\n\nFollow-up is planned to be out to 10 years post-operatively with the goal of collecting information about any revision spine surgeries that would happen during those 10 years as well."
