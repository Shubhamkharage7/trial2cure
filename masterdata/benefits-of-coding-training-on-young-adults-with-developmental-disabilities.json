            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the present study is to develop and evaluate the Technology Early Career Preparation Intervention (TECH-Prep) program with African American high school students with developmental disabilities. Developmental disabilities include conditions such as Autism spectrum disorders, seizure disorders, behavior disorders, brain injury, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome/effects. This program is designed to increase technology career interests, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, goal persistence, and increase entrance into post-secondary education or work subsequent to high school completion of African American youth with developmental disabilities.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigator's goal is to recruit 30 African American high school students with developmental disabilities to participate in this TECH-Prep study each year for the next five years (2019-2024). The TECH-Prep program integrates many empirically supported strategies identified in the STEM education and the secondary transition research literature. The program will incorporate overview of coding careers, reviewing video testimonials of individuals working in technology fields, and reviewing/responding to training materials intended to facilitate workplace social skills development.\n\nThe program will require participants complete three surveys to track their progress. To receive incentives for completing program components, data on program component completion will be tracked of participants in the treatment group. This involves tracking data on when a participant completes review of the final segment of each learning module.\n\nData collection for this study will consist of three surveys completed at baseline, immediately after completion of the program, and six weeks after completion of the program."
