            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if a machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI)-based electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm (Tempus Next software) can identify undiagnosed cardiovascular disease in patients. It will also examine the safety and effectiveness of using this AI-based tool in a clinical setting. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Can the AI-based ECG algorithm improve the detection of atrial fibrillation and structural heart disease?\n2. How does the use of this algorithm affect clinical decision-making and patient outcomes? Researchers will compare the outcomes of healthcare providers who receive the AI-based ECG results to those who do not.\n\nParticipants (healthcare providers) will:\n\nBe randomized into two groups: one that receives AI-based ECG results and one that does not.\n\nIn the intervention group, receive an assessment of their patient's risk of atrial fibrillation or structural heart disease with each ordered ECG.\n\nDecide whether to perform further clinical evaluation based on the AI-generated risk assessment as part of routine clinical care.",
            "detailedDescription": "There is a large burden of undiagnosed, treatable cardiovascular disease (CVD), encompassing various heart conditions such as arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation) and structural heart diseases (e.g., valvular disease). Early detection and accurate diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely, guideline-based interventions or therapies.\n\nThe goal of this study is to leverage machine learning approaches to enhance the detection and diagnosis of CVD. By identifying patients at risk of undiagnosed CVD and referring them for further clinical evaluation, we aim to improve health outcomes.\n\nStudy Overview:\n\nThe NOTABLE study will compare the rates of new disease diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and cardiovascular outcomes between two groups of patients managed by clinicians at Northwestern Medicine:\n\nPatients whose clinicians use ECG predictive models. Patients whose clinicians do not use ECG predictive models.\n\nIntervention Details:\n\nThis study utilizes the Tempus Next software, which includes AI algorithms for analyzing 12-lead ECGs. Clinicians randomized to the intervention group will automatically receive an ECG with \"Risk-Based Assessment for Cardiac Dysfunction\" when ordering a 12-lead ECG within EPIC during the study period. If a high-risk result is identified, clinicians will receive an EHR inbox message recommending a follow-up diagnostic test, such as echocardiography and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring.\n\nOutcome Tracking:\n\nA monthly report will track and provide data on:\n\nThe proportion of patients with a high-risk result. The proportion of patients receiving the follow-up diagnostic test. The proportion of patients receiving guideline-recommended therapies. This report will be sent to the study participants and clinicians randomized to the intervention group. Clinicians in the usual care group will not receive any communication from the study investigators."
