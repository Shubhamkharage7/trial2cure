This study will extend current body of knowledge and will investigate the effect of L-Citrulline on brain vascular function.",
            "detailedDescription": "Endothelial function is associated with nitric oxide (NO) availability for vasodilation, blood pressure and blood flow regulation, and vascular health. A large body of evidence demonstrates that aging is associated with a decrease in bioavailability of NO, with more pronounced decrease in sedentary individuals. NO can be produced via the NO synthase (NOS) enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of L-Arginine - a semi-essential amino acid found in fish, nuts and legumes amongst others - to L-Citrulline and produce NO as an endproduct. While the effect of L-Citrulline is extensively studied in relation to muscle strength, exhaustion, exercise performance, as well as on endothelial function in healthy and diseased individuals (including obese and those with heart failure), the effect of L-Citrulline on brain vascular function is not well studied."
