The Ia stage is a dose-escalation study that will focus on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients with advanced solid tumor who failed from previous standard treatment or without standard therapy exists will be enrolled in the phase Ia study. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period is 28 days.\n\nPatients in phase Ib/II part will be recruited into certain tumor cohorts and receive RP2D CBP-1019 iv infusion every two weeks. Primary efficacy of objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), etc., will be evaluated. The correlation between tumor response and the receptors will be explored. Safety information will be collected in phase Ib/II stage."
