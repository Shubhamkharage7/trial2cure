They want to know if these issues may indicate other connective tissue problems in girls and women with heavy menstrual bleeding who do not have a known cause.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* Compare the severity of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women with and without Generalized joint Hypermobility Syndrome Disorder/hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (G-HSD/hEDS) using bleeding scores.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* Compare the frequency of co-morbidities in women with and without G-HSD/hEDS.",
            "detailedDescription": "The researchers will screen for patients referred to St. Jude due to HMB. Patients will be eligible for inclusion and offered to be screened for enrollment in this study if the duration of their menses was greater than or equal to 7 days, and they reported either \"flooding\" or bleeding through a tampon or napkin in 2 hours or less with most periods, have no identifiable bleeding disorder, and have evidence of severe iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin \\< 8 g/dL).\n\nOnce enrolled, joint hypermobility will be evaluated using a Beighton score which will be used to assign participants to two groups: with and without Generalized joint Hypermobility Syndrome Disorder/ hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (G-HSD/hEDS). Participants will then undergo a detailed clinical examination to further classify them using the 2017 diagnostic criteria and complete symptom questionnaires. Finally, participants will be consented to TBANK (NCT01354002) and INSIGHT HD (NCT02720679) to provide a sample of leftover blood for banking for future research. Participants will be seen annually for the next 3 years as part of their standard of care to document the course of their symptoms.\n\nVisit 1: Self-BAT Questionnaire, Beighton Score examination, 2017 hEDS examination, PROMIS (Peds/Parent) questionnaire, PHQ15 questionnaire, COMPASS31 questionnaire, Menstrual distress questionnaire (ENDOPAIN), and Heavy menstrual bleeding checklist (both pediatric and adult).\n\nVisit 2: Self-BAT Questionnaire, PROMIS (Peds/Parent) questionnaire, PHQ15 questionnaire, COMPASS31 questionnaire, Menstrual distress questionnaire (ENDOPAIN).\n\nVisit 3: Self-BAT Questionnaire, PROMIS (Peds/Parent) questionnaire, PHQ15 questionnaire, COMPASS31 questionnaire, Menstrual distress questionnaire (ENDOPAIN)."
