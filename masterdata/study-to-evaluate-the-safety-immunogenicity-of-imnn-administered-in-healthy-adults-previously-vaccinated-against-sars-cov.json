Participants will receive a single intramuscular (IM) dose of IMNN-101 on Day 0 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post-vaccination (through Study Day 365).\n\nPhase 1: A total of twenty-four (24) participants will be enrolled into one of three groups listed below:\n\nGroup 1 (8 participants) - 0.25 mL at 2 mg/ml of IMNN-101 DNA to be administered as 0.5 mg dose intramuscularly (IM) at Day 0\n\nGroup 2 (8 participants) - 0.50 mL at 2 mg/ml of IMNN-101 DNA to be administered as 1.0 mg dose intramuscularly (IM) at Day 0\n\nGroup 3 (8 participants) - 1.0 mL at 2 mg/ml of IMNN-101 DNA to be administered as 2.0 mg dose intramuscularly (IM) at Day 0\n\nTo assess early safety signals for this Phase 1 study, vaccination will proceed in a staged fashion. Sentinel participant dosing will begin with 4 participants in Group 1 (0.25 mL). If no halting rules have been met after Group 1 sentinels complete Day 7, then the remaining 4 participants in Group 1 may enroll and sentinel dosing will begin with 4 participants in Group 2 (0.5 mL). If no halting rules have been met after Group 2 sentinels complete Day 7, then the remaining 4 participants in Group 2 may enroll and sentinel dosing will begin with 4 participants in Group 3 (1.0 mL). If no halting rules have been met after Group 3 sentinels complete Day 7, then the remaining 4 participants in Group 3 may enroll.\n\nPhase 2: Once a review of the safety and immunogenicity is completed in Phase 1 then an expansion Phase 2 will commence utilizing the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Fifty (50) healthy participants meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled."

History of coagulation dysfunction (e.g., coagulation factor deficiency, coagulation disease).\n13. Received any vaccine within 28 days prior to the study vaccine.\n14. Receiving immunotherapy or inhibitor therapy within 3 months (consistently oral or infusion for more than 14 days).\n15. Received systemic immunosuppressants within 4 months prior to vaccination or anticipating the need for immunosuppressant at any time during participation in the study. Topical or inhaled treatment is allowed if not used within 14 days prior to vaccination.\n16. Received any blood products within 3 months before IMNN-101 administration.\n17. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 3 years before first vaccination.\n18. Has donated \\>450 mL of whole blood within 28 days prior to vaccination.\n19. History of anaphylaxis or angioedema, including but not limited to a history of anaphylaxis after receipt of any vaccine.\n20. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would (a) pose a health risk to the volunteer if enrolled or (b) could interfere with evaluation of the study vaccine or interpretation of study results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).\n21.
