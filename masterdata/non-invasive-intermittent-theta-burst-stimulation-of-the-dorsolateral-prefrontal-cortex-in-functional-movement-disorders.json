FMD can cause major disability. Researchers want to learn more to create better treatments for FMD.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test whether non-invasive brain stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) improves FMD symptoms.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople between the ages of 18 and 80 who have been diagnosed with FMD by a neurologist.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group is an active brain stimulation group and the other is a sham brain stimulation group.\n\nParticipants will have a baseline visit. This will include:\n\nNeurological exam\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nUrine test\n\nBrain MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They will be asked to respond to images on a screen while in the scanner.\n\nWithin 2 weeks of the baseline visit, participants will begin 5 daily sessions of TMS. The active group will have stimulation delivered to the brain via a coil. In the sham group, a dummy coil will be used that will not deliver stimulation. A total of three 3-minute cycles will be done in one visit. There will be 20-minute breaks between the cycles.\n\nParticipants will have visits 1 month, 2 months, and 6 months after their last day of TMS. Their FMD symptoms will be evaluated. They will complete health questionnaires. These visits can be in person or virtual.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThe purpose of this protocol is to investigate efficacy of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with functional movement disorders (FMD). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either active iTBS or sham stimulation of the left DLPFC for 5 consecutive daily sessions.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To investigate efficacy of iTBS of the left DLPFC on motor symptoms in patients with FMD\n\nSecondary Objectives: To investigate efficacy of iTBS of the left DLPFC on mood symptoms and its effect on fronto-amygdala circuit on functional neuroimaging\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Relative change in Functional Movement Disorder Rating Scale (S-FMDRS) from the baseline to 1 month after iTBS vs sham: 100 \\*( S-FMDRS at one-month S-FMDRS at baseline)/ S-FMDRS at baseline\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n* S-FMDRS immediately after, 2 months and 6 months after the treatment\n* HADS at 1 month, 2 months and 6 months after the treatment\n* DLPFC-amygdala functional connectivity\n* Amygdala BOLD response to emotional stimuli"
