            "briefSummary": "This is a study to find out if a cutting-edge technology called transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) can be used to treat how people with anxiety or related concerns cope with emotional situations. tFUS is a brain stimulation technology that causes temporary changes in the activity of deep brain areas without a need for any surgery or other permanent or invasive procedures.\n\nThis study is recruiting participants who recently started treatment for anxiety or a related concern to come in for 3 visits at the Medical University of South Carolina. At the first visit, participants will do interviews and surveys asking about anxiety and related concerns, and they do tasks where they respond to emotional pictures while brain activity is measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At the next two visits, participants again do a task where they see and react to emotional images, and this time the task is done once before and again once after receiving tFUS that either actively causes temporary changes (lasting for about an hour) in a targeted brain area or is not active (no changes elicited). At each tFUS visit, responses are measured with sensors worn on the hand, arms, face, and head (these visits do not involve MRI).\n\nEach visit in this study is expected to last between 2 - 3 hours. This study is not a treatment study, but it could help improve treatment in the future. Participants in this study are paid for their time.",
            "detailedDescription": "Escape and avoidance are core targets of anxiety and related disorder treatment, but such behaviors also often persist even after reduction of reported symptoms or they keep an individual from engaging in treatment at all. Novel methods to directly target motive drivers of escape/ avoidance coping early in treatment are needed to improve retention and outcome especially for the 20% of individuals who do not benefit from and 40% who do not complete treatment. Basic science identifies multiple neural mediators of real-world escape and avoidance, and it suggests these mediators may not be directly or adequately targeted by current treatment techniques. Moreover, the direct neural mediators may be primarily subcortical and thus not be accessible to therapeutic technologies like transcranial magnetic stimulation that can only stimulate cortical areas. A novel technology called transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), meanwhile, has demonstrated ability to non-invasively and stimulate even the deepest areas of the brain in humans, and thus may have utility in directly modulating the subcortical drivers of exaggerated escape/ avoidance coping. Given this exciting possibility, the primary goal of this research is to determine if tFUS to subcortical neural mediators can be used to cause measurable changes in the downstream escape/ avoidance dispositions. Results will then inform the potential use of noninvasive tFUS stimulation as a precursor to evidence-based therapy to reduce risk of dropout and enhance outcomes."
