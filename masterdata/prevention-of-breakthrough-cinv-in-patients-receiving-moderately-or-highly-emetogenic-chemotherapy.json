            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the proposed study is to provide a clinical approach to chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prophylaxis in cycle 2 of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for patients who developed breakthrough CINV after cycle 1 based on the available data in the literature as well as the recommendations provided by established guidelines",
            "detailedDescription": "Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) adversely affects patients' quality of life and may affect patients' treatment decisions. The emetogenicity of the chemotherapy administered and specific patient characteristics such as female gender, age, and history of low alcohol intake can increase a patients' risk for CINV.\n\nTable 1. Patient-Related Risk Factors for Emesis Following Chemotherapy Major Factors Minor Factors Female History of Motion Sickness Age \\< 50 years Emesis during past pregnancy History of prior low chronic alcohol intake (\\<1 ounce of alcohol/day) Anxiety History of previous chemotherapy-induced emesis\n\nSignificant and uncontrolled CINV may result in patients returning to the chemotherapy treatment facility one to three days post-chemotherapy for rehydration, or emesis or nausea control. If CINV cannot be controlled in an outpatient facility, patients may subsequently be treated in an emergency department or require hospitalization. Patients who have an electrolyte imbalance or those who have recently undergone surgery or radiation therapy, are at greater risk of experiencing serious complications from CINV.\n\nThe use of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists has improved the control of CINV Additional improvement in the control of CINV has occurred with the use of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists, and olanzapine, an antipsychotic which blocks multiple neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.\n\nThe primary endpoint used for studies evaluating various agents for the control of CINV has been complete response (CR) (no emesis, no use of rescue medication) over the acute (24 hours post-chemotherapy), delayed (24-120 hours), and overall (0-120 hours) periods. The combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a NK-1 receptor antagonist have improved the control of emesis in patients receiving either highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) over a 120-hour period following chemotherapy administration\n\nThe use of effective antiemetic agents in various clinical settings has been described in established guidelines from the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)\\], and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN).\n\nThe purpose of the proposed is to provide a clinical approach to CINV prophylaxis in cycle 2 of MEC or HEC for patients who developed breakthrough CINV after cycle 1 based on the available data in the literature as well as the recommendations provided by established guidelines."
