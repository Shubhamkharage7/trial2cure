The investigator will evaluate the effect of a novel, bidirectional conversational agent (\"Penny\"), compared to usual care, to assist patients with scheduling appointments, lab work as well as scans and specialty appointments as needed.",
            "detailedDescription": "To achieve this, the investigator will use a two-arm randomized controlled trial to explore how multilevel factors impact the acceptability and effectiveness of this strategy by collecting qualitative and quantitative data from patients. Penny is a conversational agent (\"chatbot\") that engages patients in real time via text messaging, allowing for bidirectional communication and motivational cues to promote adherence. The chatbot will assist patients who have not been see for cancer follow-up care, with scheduling follow-up appointments, labs, scans, specialty appointments, and monitor compliance with the appointments made."
