            "briefSummary": "The goal of the study is to develop and refine a personalized behavioral parent training intervention for caregivers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The behavioral intervention will teach positive parenting through videos and quizzes that caregivers can access through a smartphone application. The program also gives parents and caregivers in-the-moment feedback their use of parenting strategies. The current study, a micro-randomized trial, aims to see whether the in-the-moment feedback given to parents (a push notification on their smartphone) changes parenting behavior right after the feedback. Micro-randomized means that parents are randomly assigned repeatedly, in this study multiple times per day, to receive or not receive parenting feedback or suggestions on their smartphones.\n\nThe main questions to answer are:\n\nIs parenting feedback provided by a smartphone application acceptable to caregivers? When parents receive the feedback, do they use more positive parenting skills in the next few minutes compared to when they do not receive the feedback? Is the phone application usable and acceptable to parents and caregivers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?"
