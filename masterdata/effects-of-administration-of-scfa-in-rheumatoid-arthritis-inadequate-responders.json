The study will include up to 35 participants to obtain a sample size of at least 25 participants taking the oral supplement. The researchers hypothesize that oral SCFA will change the participants' gut microbiome and regulatory immune responses. Clinical data to assess for adverse events, stool, urine samples and peripheral blood will be collected at baseline, 1 month, and with an optional 2 month time-point. Fecal microbiome will be analyzed. Adaptive immune responses will be analyzed from participant blood samples."
