            "briefSummary": "This clinical study will use the small molecule translocator protein (TSPO) ligand, 18F-labeled DPA-714, to visualize and quantify neuroinflammation in treatment naive women with stage II-III newly diagnosed breast cancer (without brain metastases) prior to starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (baseline) and within 4 weeks after finishing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with at least 2 cycles administered and before surgery. . The TSPO PET and MRI data acquired through this study will be correlated with cognitive test data, clinical data, and genetic testing collected in this study. We will enroll 20 participants in this study (20 participants with breast cancer).\n\nStudy Aim 1:\n\nTo examine the association between neuroinflammation and cancer related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in women with breast cancer before and after undergoing chemotherapy treatment.\n\n(Hypothesis 1): Treatment-na\u00efve women with Stage II-III breast cancer (without known brain metastases) will experience increased amount of neuroinflammation and greater cognitive decline after completing neodjuvant Chemotherapy Treatment (NACT).\n\n(Hypothesis 2): Greater levels of neuroinflammation as measured by the amount and distribution of \\[18F\\]DPA-714 in the brain using PET/MRI after completing NACT will be associated with lower levels of cognitive functioning as measured by self-report and/or objective cognitive impairment/change.\n\nNeuroinflammation will be measured using PET with tracer \\[18F\\]DPA-714 using a simultaneous PET/MRI system, and cognitive functioning will be measured with self-report and objective neuropsychological measures.\n\nExploratory Aim 2:\n\nTo investigate the relationships between CRCI and quality of life (QOL) and everyday functioning in breast cancer survivors after completing chemotherapy treatment.\n\nFor this Aim, we will assess QOL using self-report measures."
