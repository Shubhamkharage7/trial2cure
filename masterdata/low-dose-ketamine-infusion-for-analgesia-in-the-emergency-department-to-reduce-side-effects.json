            "briefSummary": "This will be an intent to treat prospective, double blind, double-dummy, randomized trial. Our primary objective is the reduction of side effects of sub dissociative dose ketamine given by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes vs. 15 minutes in the treatment of acute, severe pain in Emergency Department (ED) patients. The secondary objective will be to maintain adequate pain control (as defined by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of \u2264 5cm) at 30 minutes for both groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "Previous research has shown that low dose ketamine (LDK) Intravenous push (IVP) (0.3mg/kg) to have equivalent pain reduction in moderate to severe acute pain in the Emergency Department (ED) when compared to standard of care of morphine intravenous push (IVP) (0.1mg/kg). Ketamine has been shown to produce side effects in these studies, including dizziness, feeling of unreality and mood changes, but no unexpected side effects or adverse events. Additional studies have compared IVP with slower infusion of low dose ketamine (LDK) and have shown a decrease in side effects while maintaining similar analgesic efficacy. This previous trial found increased feelings of unreality for the IVP group (difference of 37.5%) as well as increased rates of sedation.\n\nIn clinical practice, increasing the time/duration of the infusion has resulted in a decrease of reported side effects from patients while still maintaining analgesia. There have been no studies done to prove that there is a further reduction in side effects with a longer LDK infusion. The investigators believe that increasing the infusion time to greater than 15 minutes will reduce the frequency and intensity of expected side effects of ketamine felt by participants and allow for further use of ketamine as a non-opiate analgesic in the ED.\n\nOverall aims of project:\n\n1. Reduce overall side effects of low dose ketamine when given over 30 minutes versus 15 minutes.\n2. Maintain adequate pain control, as defined by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of \u22645 cm at 30 minutes for both groups.\n\nHypothesis: Slow infusion of low dose ketamine (LDK) over 30 minutes will provide adequate pain control (as defined by VAS score of \u22645 cm), and reduce incidence and severity (by at least 20% or 1 point on SERSDA scale) of known side effects when compared to LDK given over 15 minutes in moderate to severe acute pain for patients presenting to the ED.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThe location of this study will be the Akron City Hospital Emergency Department. The trial will enroll approximately 48 participants over a 24-month enrollment period.\n\nThis will be an intent to treat prospective, double blind, double-dummy, randomized trial. The primary outcome will be a comparison of side effects of sub dissociative dose ketamine given by slow IV infusion over 15 minutes vs 30 minutes in treatment of moderate to severe acute pain in ED patients. The secondary outcome will be adequate pain control (VAS \u22645 cm), and need for rescue analgesia between the two groups.\n\nThe control group will receive slow IV infusion of ketamine over 15 minutes. The experimental group will receive slow IV infusion of ketamine over 30 minutes.\n\nIf the potential participant meets all eligibility criteria, they will be consented by study staff members and then randomized to receive Ketamine 0.25mg/kg in 100cc normal saline (NS) as IV infusion over specified time as well as \"placebo\" 100cc NS over the other time slot.\n\nPharmacy staff will blind medication as well as provide medication in a blinded fashion to the nurse who will use infusion pumps to deliver both study medication and placebo simultaneously. Nursing staff will receive training on administration of medication prior to starting the study.\n\nThe investigators will measure the side effect profile using the Side Effects Rating Scale for Dissociative Anesthetics (SERSDA) along with the VAS (visual analog scale) scores from 0-100mm.\n\nVital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) will also be obtained at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes from the start of the ketamine/NS placebo infusion."
