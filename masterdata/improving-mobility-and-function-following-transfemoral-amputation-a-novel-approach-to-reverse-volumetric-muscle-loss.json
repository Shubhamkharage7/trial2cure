            "detailedDescription": "One in every 190 Americans is currently living with the loss of a limb. Following lower limb amputation (LLA), individuals have double the risk of knee and hip pain, a high prevalence of osteoarthritis in the intact limb with a prevalence ratio of 3.3 compared to those without amputation, and up to 90% experience severe back pain. The long-term consequences of LLA may be mitigated through regular use of prosthesis and physical activity, which would also increase the likelihood of returning to work and reintegration of Service Members (SMs) and younger Veterans.\n\nClinicians and researchers often focus on the prosthetic fit to improve outcomes, however just providing a prosthetic, even the most advanced prosthetic, is not enough to restore function. Interventions targeting physical capabilities to complement device intervention may be key to improving outcomes in individuals with LLA.\n\nAlong with increased orthopaedic risks, individuals with traumatic LLA also have an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared to the general population. SMs with traumatic unilateral transfemoral amputation have a 1.58 times greater risk of death from cardiovascular causes and their relative risk of aortic aneurysm is 5.1 times greater than Veterans without amputation. There is evidence to suggest that individuals with LLA have increased peripheral vascular resistance following amputation, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Reduced arterial function (i.e. increased arterial stiffness) is an important measure in those with LLA because it predicts mortality, heart failure, and cardiovascular events. In addition, improved arterial function improves perfusion to muscle and reduces fatigue during exertion. Therefore, strategies that reduce arterial stiffness and vascular resistance in individuals with LLA are important to improve mortality and quality of life for SMs and Veterans.\n\nTherefore, we propose implementing ischemic preconditioning (IC) as a novel intervention to strengthen and hypertrophy leg muscles and increase arterial function for improving outcomes after amputation."
