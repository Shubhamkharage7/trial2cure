Patients will then undergo standard of care chemoradiation. Immunotherapy will begin 2 weeks (-7/+4 days) after completion of radiation. One single dose of 8R-70CAR T cells will be administered IV. The dose will depend on the enrolling cohort. Dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 design."
