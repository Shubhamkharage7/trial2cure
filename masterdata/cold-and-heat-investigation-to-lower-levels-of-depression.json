Participants will complete a baseline assessment of their depressive symptoms as well as 1-week and 2-week post-treatment followup assessments.",
            "detailedDescription": "The CHILL'D Study aims to figure out how using heat exposure as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) can work better. The researchers want to see if being exposed to heat followed by cold plunge can help people feel better emotionally compared to just being exposed to heat alone.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that adding cold plunge to heat exposure will enhance the antidepressant effect of heat exposure alone.\n\nTo answer study questions, 112 adults, ages 18 to 65 experiencing depression for at least 60 days and who meet study eligibility criteria, will be randomized to receive either 1) a single session of heat exposure or 2) a single session of heat exposure followed immediately by cold plunge.\n\nParticipants in the heat exposure alone group will receive a single heat session using the Clearlight Sauna Dome lasting up to 140 minutes. Participants in the heat exposure and cold plunge group will receive a single heat session using the Clearlight Sauna Dome lasting up to 140 minutes followed by a cold plunge session lasting up to 10 minutes."
