            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe chemical messenger dopamine carries signals between brain cells. It may affect addiction. Heavy use of pain medicines called opioids may decrease the amount of dopamine available to the brain. Researchers want to study if decreased dopamine decreases self-control and increases impulsiveness.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about how opiate use disorder affects dopamine in the brain.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults 18-80 years old who are moderate or severe opiate users\n\nHealthy volunteers the same age\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will first be screened under another protocol. They will:\n\n* Have a physical exam\n* Answer questions about their medical, psychiatric, and alcohol and drug use history\n* Take an MRI screening questionnaire\n* Give blood and urine samples\n* Have their breath tested for alcohol\n\nParticipants will have up to 3 study visits.\n\nThey will have 2-3 positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A radioactive chemical will be injected for the scans. Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the donut-shaped scanner. A cap or plastic mask may be placed on the head.\n\nVital signs will be taken before and after the PET scans.\n\nParticipants will get capsules of placebo or the study drug. They will rate how they feel before, during and after.\n\nParticipants will have their breath and urine tested each day.\n\nParticipants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They will lie on a table that slides into a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They may do tasks on a computer screen while inside the scanner.\n\nParticipants will have tests of memory, attention, and thinking.\n\nParticipants will wear an activity monitor for one week....",
            "detailedDescription": "Objectives: Primary objective is to assess whether the balance between dopamine D1 (D1R) and D2 receptors (D2R) signaling in striatum is disrupted in participants with an opioid use disorder (OUD) who are on opioid agonist medication (MAT+: methadone or buprenorphine) relative to OUD participants treated with the opioid antagonist medication naltrexone and OUD participants in recovery and not being treated with medications (MAT-). Secondary objectives are to assess how striatal D1R to D2R availability (assessed with PET) influences: (1) striatal dopamine (DA) release; (2) the function of brain reward and self-control networks (assessed with task fMRI activation and with resting functional connectivity, RFC) and (3) behavior (locomotor activity and neuropsychological tests); (4) to assess if DA increases, as induced by oral methylphenidate (MP), improve the function of brain reward and control networks in OUD; and (5) to assess if there is recovery after protracted treatment (comparing treated and non-treated) by repeating fMRI at 6 month follow-up.\n\nStudy population: We will complete studies in 180 (n=180) subjects: N=60 healthy control adults and N=120 OUD participants (60 MAT+, 30 naltrexone-treated and 30 MAT-) aged 18-80 (male/female) will be included.\n\nDesign: Single-blind. Participants will undergo three scans with positron emission tomography (PET): one with \\[11C\\]NNC-112 to assess baseline D1R, another with \\[11C\\]raclopride after placebo to assess baseline D2R and a third one with \\[11C\\]raclopride after MP administration (60mg oral) to assess striatal DA release (assessed as the difference in specific binding of \\[11C\\]raclopride between baseline and MP). In addition, participants will undergo two imaging sessions with MRI to assess functional reactivity to drug-cues and to a measure of self-control (delayed discounting task), to assess RFC and to obtain structural brain measures (including diffusion tensor imaging, DTI). One of the sessions will be done under baseline conditions (no drug administered) and the other after MP (about one hour after the \\[11C\\]raclopride MP scan is completed). Neuropsychological tests (NP) and accelerometers will be used to assess cognitive performance and locomotor activity respectively.\n\nOutcome Measures: Main outcome: (1) Differences in D1R to D2R striatal ratio between participants with an OUD and controls and between MAT+, naltrexone, and MAT- groups. Secondary outcomes: Correlations between striatal D1R to D2R and (1) striatal DA release; (2) fMRI activation in reward and controls networks (assessed with cue-reactivity and delay discounting tasks, and with RFC) and (3) NP performance and locomotor activity. (4) Differences in fMRI activation and RFC after MP when compared with baseline measures."

Participant may be included in the PL administration with PET and/or MR but is excluded from MP administration and subsequent PET and/or MR scan if history is reported.\n12. Glaucoma as assessed by medical history. Participant may be included in the PL administration with PET and/or MR but is excluded from MP administration and subsequent PET and/or MR scan if history of glaucoma reported.\n13. Cannot lie comfortably flat on their backs for up to 2 hours in the PET and MRI scanners self-report.\n14. Weight \\> 400 pounds, which is the maximum weight the PET scanner can hold.\n15. Study investigators and staff, as well as their superiors, subordinates and immediate family members (adult children, spouses, parents, siblings).\n16. \\*Non-English speakers (must also be able to read and comprehend English).\n\n    Additional exclusion criteria for MAT+ / MAT- / Naltrexone OUD participants:\n17. Participation in a court ordered residential treatment program.\n\nNote that subjects will not be excluded from enrollment onto this study if their urine test or breath alcohol level (BAL) is positive for drugs/alcohol on initial screening. The following guidelines will be followed for positive drug/alcohol screens on study procedure days:\n\nIf a Healthy Volunteer subject s urine drug/breath alcohol (\\>0.08%) screen test is positive on days involving imaging (MRI and/or PET) and NP testing, the procedures will be postponed and rescheduled. We will allow for up to 3 rescheduled study days resulting from positive urine drug/breath alcohol screens. If urine drug screen is positive for THC-COOH, a saliva drug screen will be performed and subject may proceed with study day testing procedures if saliva results for THC are negative. If the urine/saliva drug test is positive on the third rescheduled visit, the participant will be withdrawn from the study. Source - Urine drug screen (CRIS) or BAL screen (CRIS).\n\nIf an OUD subject s urine drug/breath alcohol (\\>0.08%) screen test is positive for drugs (other than opiates), the procedures will not be postponed. If urine drug screen is positive for THC-COOH, a saliva drug screen will be performed to verify if THC is present. Positive results for drugs other than opiates will be considered at the time of data analysis as a co-variate. Source - Urine drug screen (CRIS).\n\n\\*The intent of the research has no prospect of direct benefit to the subject. Therefore, we are excluding non-English speakers in this research study since it includes the administration of questionnaires, surveys and assessments that are validated for English, although some are available in Spanish. In addition, our fMRI paradigms (particularly the Delay Discounting task) require that the subject be able to speak, read and comprehend English.\n\nAlso, note that at any time during participation in this study if any subject expresses that he/she wants to get treatment for their OUD, we will immediately refer him/her to a treatment program. The subject will be withdrawn from the study at that time. No OUD medications will be stopped or held for participation in this protocol.",
