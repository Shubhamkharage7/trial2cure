            "briefSummary": "This is a clinical trial of a novel intervention, Behavioral Therapy for Irritability and Aggression (BTIA), for adolescents on the autism spectrum. The main goals of BTIA are to help adolescents develop emotion regulation skills to handle frustration and to strengthen skills for navigating the challenging and diverse experiences associated with the transition to adulthood. The study will test whether BTIA can be helpful to adolescents on the autism spectrum and to their families.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized controlled study of BTIA versus a supportive therapy control condition in 126 adolescents (ages 12 to 18 years) with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and significant levels of disruptive behaviors such as aggression, anger outbursts, and oppositional behavior. BTIA consists of 15 ninety-minute weekly sessions that will be conducted with the teens and their parents by therapists using a structured, detailed manual. The effects of BTIA on the reduction of behavioral problems will be rated by an experienced clinician who does not know which treatment each participant is receiving (a \"blinded\" evaluator). Study participants will receive a thorough diagnostic assessment of autism spectrum disorder and other forms of psychopathology that may co-occur with ASD. In addition to testing the effects of BTIA on disruptive behavior, the changes in adaptive functioning, or children's ability to function competently in their everyday environment, will be examined before and after treatment."
