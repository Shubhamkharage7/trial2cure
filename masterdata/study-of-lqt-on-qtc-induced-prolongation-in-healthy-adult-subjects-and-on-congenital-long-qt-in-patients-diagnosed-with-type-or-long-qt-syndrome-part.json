This is a 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study with approximately up to 28 healthy subjects, with screening procedures within 28 days of enrolment.\n\nPart 2: This is a Phase 2a, single-blind, placebo run-in, multiple-dose safety study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of LQT-1213 in patients diagnosed with LQT1, LQT2 or LQT3. Up to 12 participants with LQT1, up to 20 participants with LQT2 and up to 12 participants with LQT3 will be recruited.",
            "detailedDescription": "Part 1: This is a 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study. Approximately 28 healthy subjects, with the attempt to balance for sexes, will be enrolled to complete approximately up to 20 subjects in the study. In both treatment periods, all subjects will receive dofetilide on Days 1 and 2 of each period. Randomization will take place before Day 3 of Period 1. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA).\n\nPart 2: Up to 12 participants with LQT1, up to 20 participants with LQT2 and up to 12 participants with LQT3 will be enrolled. After initial screening, which may be conducted remotely by the CRU, individual participants with LQT1, LQT2 or LQT3 will undergo a 1-day, single-blind placebo run-in period followed by 3 dosing days of LQT-1213 administered BID (the last dosing day will have a single dose). LQT-1213 will be administered BID on Days 2-4. Participants will be discharged from the CRU on Day 5. Approximately 7 days after discharge from the CRU, the Follow-up Visit will be conducted remotely via telephone call."
