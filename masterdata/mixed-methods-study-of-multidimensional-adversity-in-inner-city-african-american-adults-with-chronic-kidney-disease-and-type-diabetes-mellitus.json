            "detailedDescription": "Multidimensional adversity (MDA), defined as having three or more social adversities such as loss of employment, housing instability, food insecurity, transportation needs, utility needs, interpersonal safety, and financial strain impacts the complex self-management of DKD such as self-monitoring and behavior modification. This study utilizes a convergent parallel mixed methods study design to understand facilitators and barriers to care and develop a culturally tailored intervention to improve clinical outcomes, quality of life, and self-care behaviors in African American adults with DKD experiencing MDA and living in the inner-city.\n\nAim 1 (Qualitative): Identify facilitators and barriers to care in African American adults with DKD experiencing MDA and living in the inner-city using in-depth patient and stakeholder interviews.\n\nAim 2 (Quantitative): Examine the effect of increasing burden of MDA on clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, lipids), quality of life, and self-care behaviors (diet, exercise, and medication adherence) in a sample of 300 African American adults with DKD experiencing MDA and living in the inner-city.\n\nAim 3 (Integrative): Integrate findings from Aims 1 and 2 and develop a culturally tailored intervention to improve clinical outcomes, quality of life, and self-care behaviors in African American adults with DKD experiencing MDA and living in the inner-city."
