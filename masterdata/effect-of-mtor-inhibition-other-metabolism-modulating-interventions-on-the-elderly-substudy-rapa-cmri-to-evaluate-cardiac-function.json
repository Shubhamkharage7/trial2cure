            "briefSummary": "The ability to mount an effective immune response declines with age, leaving the elderly increasingly susceptible to infectious diseases and cancer. Rapamycin, an FDA approved drug to prevent transplant rejection, increases the lifespan and healthspan of mice and ameliorates age-related declines in immune responsiveness, cancer survival, and cognition in laboratory animals. Investigators are conducting a translational trial to test whether rapamycin also improves life functions in humans focusing on elderly persons (aged 70-95).\n\nSubstudy E will evaluate the Rapamycin and Cardiac Function.",
            "detailedDescription": "The main study has completed and results are reported (NCT02874924)\n\nPurpose of Sub-study E - Rapamycin and cMRI to evaluate cardiac function:\n\nThe over-arching hypothesis is that RAPA treatment will effect simultaneous improvement in parameters known to be negatively impacted by aging. For example, systemic inflammation is higher in older individuals and contributes to the development of age-related pathologies affecting both the heart and the vasculature. In particular, evidence indicates that aging-associated alterations in inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways are critically involved in the etiology of age-related declines. The study team hypothesize that mTOR antagonism with RAPA will improve detrimental age-related pathologies affecting the heart in elderly humans."
