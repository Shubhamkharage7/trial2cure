Patient reported outcomes including Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) Score, and PROMIS physical function and pain scores, will also be evaluated.\n\nData from this study will be compared to a previous study involving healthy controls that underwent the same exercises and imaging."
