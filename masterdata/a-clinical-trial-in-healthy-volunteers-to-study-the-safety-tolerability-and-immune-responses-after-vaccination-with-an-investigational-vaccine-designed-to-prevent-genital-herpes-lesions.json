Part B of the trial will expand the safety characterization for two dose levels of BNT163 selected based on Part A data and also enable a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of pre-existing immunity to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1 and -2 on the safety and BNT163-induced immune responses than could be assessed in Part A.",

In part B, participants will be randomized 1:1 to either of the two selected dose levels based on data from Part A. Participants will receive three intramuscular doses of a fixed dose level of the BNT163 vaccine (Part A and B) or placebo (Part A only)."
