The program sessions focus on getting to know what's important to the participants, reviewing or setting goals, and using different skills and behaviors to better manage health. The trial will help the study team learn about ways to deliver health information in a way that is useful and interesting.\n\nThis research will take place remotely (e.g., Zoom, Facetime, Phone) and participants will be randomized to the Telehealth (TeleTx) group intervention or the Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) control group. Both groups will be asked to have follow-up visits up to 12 months from the baseline visit."
