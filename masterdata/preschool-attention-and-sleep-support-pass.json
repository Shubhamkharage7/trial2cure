During Aim 1, caregivers of preschoolers with attention concerns, pediatric behavioral health professionals, and pediatric primary care providers will take part in two virtual focus groups to provide their perspective on ways to improve the telehealth intervention being evaluated.",
            "detailedDescription": "During Aim 2, caregivers of preschool children with ADHD symptoms will be randomly assigned to participate in one of two 8-week telehealth interventions. Both interventions will teach evidence-based skills and provide practice opportunities to manage their children's ADHD-related behaviors. Caregivers and their children will also attend three study visits (one before the intervention, and two following the intervention) where they will be asked to complete questionnaires and assessments related to the child's ADHD symptoms, psychiatric health, and sleep habits. Following each study visit, participating children will be asked to wear an ActiGraph device on their nondominant wrist for 24 hours/day for a 7-day period. During this time, the caregivers will be asked to complete an electronic daily diary about their child's sleep."
