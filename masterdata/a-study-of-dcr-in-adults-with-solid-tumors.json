Antitumor effects will be evaluated for DCR-STAT3 as a monotherapy."

Dose escalation decisions will be evaluated in conjunction with a Safety Review Committee (SRC).\n\nThe study will be conducted over 4 dose cohorts in a 3+3 design and will initially comprise 12 to 24 participants. Should one DLT occur within a given cohort, an additional 3 participants will be enrolled in that cohort. Two cohorts will be backfilled or expanded to a total of at least 10 participants in each cohort, for a total enrollment of approximately 32 participants. The cohorts and associated dose levels will be chosen in a data-driven fashion as the study proceeds, in conjunction with the SRC.",
