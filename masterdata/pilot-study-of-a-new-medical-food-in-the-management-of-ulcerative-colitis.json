The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n1) How well does the new medical food lower an inflammatory biomarker known as fecal calprotectin (fCal) in ulcerative colitis as compared to the historical active therapy levels of fCal? Participants will take a specified dose of the medical food in water each day for 12 weeks. The level of fCal will be measured through a stool sample at baseline, one during the 12 weeks, at the end of 12 weeks, and once more at 16 weeks. The levels of fCal will be compared across the 16 weeks and compared with levels before the new medical food was taken.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this clinical trial is to assess the physiological response to a biologic food substance in maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis in children. This will be measured through the measurement of fecal calprotectin (fCal) levels across the study period as well as in comparison to historical active therapy levels. Secondary endpoints will include a variety of biologic markers (inflammatory, microbial, metabolic) as well as clinical scores including patient reported outcomes and serum-based biomarkers such as ferritin and hemoglobin. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the medical food as a safe and well-tolerated non-pharmacologic approach for reducing dependence on drug therapies and their associated side effects in the treatment of ulcerative colitis."
