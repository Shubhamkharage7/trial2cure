            "briefSummary": "B-cell Lymphoma is an aggressive and rare cancer of a type of immune cells (a white blood cell responsible for fighting infections). Classic Follicular Lymphoma is a slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of epcoritamab in adult participants in relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have received at least 1 prior line of systemic antilymphoma therapy including at least 1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy or R/R classic follicular lymphoma (cFL). Adverse events will be assessed.\n\nEpcoritamab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of R/R DLBCL and R/R cFL. Study doctors will assess participants in a monotherapy treatment arm of epcoritamab. Participants will receive escalating doses of epcoritamab, until full dose is achieved. Approximately 184 adult participants with R/R DLBCL and R/R cFL will be enrolled in the study in approximately 80 sites in the United States of America.\n\nParticipants will receive escalating doses of subcutaneous epcoritamab, until full dose is achieved, in 28-day cycles.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects."
