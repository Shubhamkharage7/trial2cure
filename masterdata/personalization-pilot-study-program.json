Users are then enrolled in nutrition, fitness, or sleep challenges within the app that are aimed at improving overall wellness and thus helping to reduce biological age. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions require numerous decisions that integrate behavioral theory, user feedback, and technical and practical feasibility considerations. The main purpose of this research program is to test if the application works as intended. This pilot study program is managed internally by Pepsico clinical researchers."
