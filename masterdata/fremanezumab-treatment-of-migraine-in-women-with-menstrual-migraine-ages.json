The study includes people ages 18 to 45 who have been diagnosed with migraine and who have a migraine with their menstrual period or those who have migraines with their menstrual period and at other times of the month as well.\n\nThe main question the study aims to answer are:\n\n\u2022 Does fremanazemab, an injectable calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway targeting therapy, decrease migraines associated with menstruation?\n\nParticipants will\n\n* have an evaluation and examination by a headache specialist physician\n* will receive the study medicine or inactive substitute every three months for two treatments\n* fill out diaries about their migraines\n* have tests on saliva to measure hormone levels\n\nResearchers will compare the people who get the medicine to those who get the inactive substitute to see if there are differences in response.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients who meet the eligibility criteria and wish to participate will be consented, and will then be randomized to receive two rounds of treatment with either fremanezumab or placebo, administered 3 months apart, to understand efficacy and response in decreasing migraine days. The investigators will monitor with daily logs and use evidenced metrics to assess response. Participants will be carefully screened to ensure that they do not become pregnant while in the study. The investigators will measure monthly hormone levels using salivary samples. Each participant will have three in-person visits and will have five 5 visits via secure telehealth. The investigators are studying decreased headache days, severity, disability and quality of life."
