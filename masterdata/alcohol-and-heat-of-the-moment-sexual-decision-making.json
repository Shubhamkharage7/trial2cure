            "briefSummary": "HIV transmission remains a significant public health concern, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). Condomless anal intercourse (CAI) continues to be the major route of transmission for MSM. Thus, to reduce the incidence of HIV, it is critical to identify how contextual risk factors influence CAI and develop behavioral strategies that modify risk factors directly or reduce their influence on behavior. This study will examine the mechanisms through which one of the central contextual risk factors, heavy drinking, influences sexual decision processes in the natural environment and test the benefit of a brief intervention designed to reduce sexual risk behavior among those who engage in heavy drinking.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite prevention efforts over the past two decades, HIV transmission remains a significant public health concern, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). Approximately 65% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States are due to male-to-male sexual contact. Condomless anal intercourse (CAI) continues to be the major route of transmission for MSM. Thus, to reduce the incidence of HIV, it is critical to identify risk factors that underlie HIV acquisition and transmission and develop behavioral strategies that modify them directly or reduce the influence of these factors on behavior. Alcohol use, particularly heavy episodic drinking, is a central modifiable risk factor that may increase CAI in conjunction with other contextual variables. Although there have been a limited number of HIV prevention interventions that incorporate alcohol in sexual risk reduction efforts, relatively little is known about how such interventions impact sexual decision-making in \"heat-of the-moment\", particularly while intoxicated and in high arousal states that commonly are proximal to sexual behavior.\n\nThe goals of this study are to: (1) better understand the within-person mechanisms linking alcohol and arousal with CAI and (2) test the efficacy of an HIV prevention intervention approach that both reduces alcohol consumption and mitigate the influence of intoxication and arousal on CAI. These complementary objectives are addressed through an experience sampling method study (ESM) that examines the impact of an HIV prevention intervention that targets sexual risk and alcohol use. This study will examine whether mechanisms that underlie sexual risk in the natural environment and can be modified by intervention.\n\nIn the proposed study, non-monogamous adult MSM who engage in heavy drinking and CAI will be randomly assigned to an intervention condition that addresses alcohol use and sexual decision-making in \"heat-of-the-moment\" situations. The intervention will be preceded and followed by 3-week ESM bursts of intensive longitudinal assessment of alcohol use, arousal, sexual delay discounting, working memory, and CAI. 4-month follow-up data will be collected. Results will contribute to the long-term goal of enhancing effectiveness of behavioral HIV prevention interventions that address alcohol use."
