            "briefSummary": "Given the widespread use of anticonvulsants in the pediatric chronic pain population and the absence of scientific data supporting their use, the investigators propose a randomized, double blind, two group parallel design in which a broad group of children and adolescents with chronic neuropathic pain would be randomized to receive either Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine.\n\nThe Primary Aim of the Study is to assess the frequencies of successful treatment of pediatric patients with neuropathic pain treated with either Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine.\n\nThe Primary Hypotheses are as follows:\n\nHypothesis I: Both Gabapentin and Oxcarbazepine will result in significant reduction in pain scores when compared to each patient's baseline.\n\nHypothesis II: Patients who continue on active drug (Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine) during the second phase of the trial will report greater pain reduction relative to baseline than patients who are randomized onto placebo at this randomization point.\n\nSecondary Aims of the Study are to compare groups treated initially with Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine with regard to reduction in pain scores (both at rest and with evoked maneuvers), functional disability scores, tolerability, and measures of mood and cognitive functioning.\n\nSecondary Hypotheses are that Gabapentin and Oxcarbazepine differ in their effects on:\n\n1. Pain scores at rest and with evoked maneuvers\n2. Functional disability scores\n3. Tolerability (frequencies of side-effects)\n4. Depression and anxiety scales\n5. Neuropsychological measures of cognitive processing speed, working memory, and attention."
