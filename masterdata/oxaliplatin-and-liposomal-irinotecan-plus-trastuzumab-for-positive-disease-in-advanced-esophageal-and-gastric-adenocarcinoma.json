Participants in Cohort 1 (HER-2 negative) will receive 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI. Cohort 3 (HER-2 negative) will use nivolumab in addition to 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI. Participants in Cohort 2 (HER-2 positive) will receive trastuzumab in addition to 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI. Cohort 4 (HER-2 positive) will also include pembrolizumab in addition to trastuzumab, 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI.\n\nChemotherapy doses will be the same for all cohorts and will follow similar modifications for toxicities. Agents will be administered as per institutional standards when similar regimens (such as FOLFIRINOX, FOLFOX, and trastuzumab) are used.\n\nCohort 1 (HER2-negative tumors): Up to 13 evaluable participants will be accrued to Cohort 1.\n\nCohort 2 (HER2-positive tumors): Up to a total of 6 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the proposed 5-Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and liposomal Irinotecan combination in HER2-positive subjects.\n\nCohort 3 (HER-2 negative tumors):12 participants will be enrolled during stage 1. If at most 5 objective responses per RECIST 1.1 are observed, then further enrollment will be halted. Otherwise, 15 additional participants will be enrolled for a total number of 27.\n\nCohort 4 (HER-2 positive tumors): treated with oxaliplatin, Nal-IRI and trastuzumab in combination with pembrolizumab. A total of up to 6 subjects will be accrued to evaluate safety and tolerability."
