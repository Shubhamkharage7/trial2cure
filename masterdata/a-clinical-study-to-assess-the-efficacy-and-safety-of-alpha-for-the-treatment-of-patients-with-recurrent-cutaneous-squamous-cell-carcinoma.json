The primary objectives are to determine the objective response rate (ORR) established by the confirmed best overall response (BOR) following intratumoral administration of DaRT - Diffusing Alpha-Emitters Radiation Therapy, as well as to assess the Duration of Response (DOR) 6 months from initial response. Secondary objectives are to assess the safety of DaRT, and to assess the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), Overall Duration of Response (O-DOR), local control and quality of life (QOL) for patients treated with DaRT.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective multicenter, pivotal, single arm, open label clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of intratumoral Alpha DaRT-224 for the treatment of patients with recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nThe \"Diffusing Alpha-emitter Radiation Therapy (DaRT)\", based on the interstitial intratumoral placement of an encapsulated Radium-224 source (3.7 days half-life), is described in this study. These sources release short-lived alpha-emitting atoms into the tumor microenvironment by recoil. DaRT seeds will be inserted into recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) tumors and will be removed following 14-21 days.\n\nThe Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be determined based on the confirmed Best Overall Response (BOR) following DaRT insertion. Duration of Response (DOR) will be assessed for up to 6 months from initial response is documented. Safety will be assessed based on the cumulative incidence rate, severity and outcome of device related Adverse Events (AEs). Classification of AEs will be done according to CTCAE v5."
