            "briefSummary": "This study evaluates cancer-related weight and muscle mass loss, symptoms, and physical function (cachexia) in patients undergoing treatment for colorectal, lung, or pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Patients with these cancer types are at risk for developing cancer cachexia (CC), which is defined as weight loss, muscle loss, and fat loss due to cancer. CC has been associated with reduced physical performance, impaired quality of life, and poorer survival. Many studies that have evaluated treatments for cancer-related weight and muscle loss have aimed to treat all patients with weight loss exactly the same and, unfortunately, have not been successful. Like different cancer types, weight and muscle loss related to cancer may have different causes in different individuals and the best treatment strategy for this condition may not be a one-size-fits-all approach. Information gathered from this study may help researchers develop new diagnostic criteria for CC and design better treatments and clinical trials for cancer-related weight and muscle loss in the future to improve the quality of life in patients with advanced colorectal, lung, or pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To identify multiple distinct diagnostic subtypes within the syndrome of CC as defined by host characteristics (e.g. cachexia symptoms, physical activity, physical function, blood biomarkers including hemoglobin and albumin, and body composition) at baseline and change in these factors over time in patients with cancer at high risk for CC.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the association of each CC phenotype with overall survival. II. To validate CC diagnostic phenotypes developed in a separate, independent cachexia observational study performed by our collaborators at Kaiser Permanente.\n\nIII. To collect human samples of blood, tumor tissue, and medical images and build a large, comprehensive CC database clinically annotated with cancer-related outcomes, cachexia symptoms, and physical function data.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate for tumor-derived factors contributing to CC by determining the association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in tumors and IL-6 and CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) levels in the blood in patients with CC.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients complete surveys over 30 minutes, undergo physical function tests over 30 minutes, undergo collection of blood and archived tumor samples, and wear actigraphy over 24 hours for 7 days to record daily sleep and exercise activity at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Patients' medical records are also reviewed at baseline, 3-month and 1-year follow-up."
