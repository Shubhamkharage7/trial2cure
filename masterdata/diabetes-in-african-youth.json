            "briefSummary": "This RCT aims to improve T1D care in East African children and young adults by testing the hypothesis that enabling patients to continuously monitor glucose levels with flash CGM technology will improve glucose time-in-range (glucose level 70-180 mg/dl). A second primary endpoint is to perform a cost analysis on flash glucose monitoring compared to 3x/day SMBG, to determine whether this technology is cost-effective in the setting of a less-resourced nation.\n\nAfter a 2 week assessment with blinded CGM when a potential subject's ability to wear CGM is confirmed, subjects will be enrolled for 12 months in randomized, open label study, with a primary endpoint measurement at 6 months. All subjects will receive monthly diabetes self-management education.\n\nFor the first six months, months 1-6:\n\n* Half of patients (n=90) will be randomized to an unblinded FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM.They and their care providers will be able to continuously see their CGM glucose levels to assist in insulin adjustment.\n* Half of patients (n=90) will be given sufficient test strips for 3x daily SMBG while wearing blinded CGM (control group). Neither they nor their care providers will be able to see their CGM glucose levels (the blinded CGM is simply for outcome measurement, not an intervention). As per usual clinical practice, only the SMBG glucose levels will be available to assist in insulin adjustment.\n* The change between baseline to 6 months in CGM-derived glucose percent time-in- range will be compared between groups (first primary study endpoint).\n\nFor the second six months, months 7-12:\n\n* The control group will switch to unblinded CGM months 7-12 (their data months 7-12 months will be compared to their data months 1-6 as part of the primary endpoint assessment).\n* The patients who wore the unblinded CGM months 1-6 will continue for another 6 months to assess the impact of wearing the CGM for 12 continuous months (a secondary endpoint).\n\nOnce the clinical portion of the study is complete, study investigators who are health economists from the Uganda Ministry of Health will perform a costs analysis (second primary endpoint)."
