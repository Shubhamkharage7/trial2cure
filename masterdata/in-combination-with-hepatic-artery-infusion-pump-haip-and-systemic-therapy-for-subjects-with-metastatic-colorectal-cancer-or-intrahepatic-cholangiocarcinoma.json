            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nOne way to treat liver cancer is to deliver chemotherapy drugs only to the liver (and not to the whole body). Researchers want to see if adding the drug M9241 can improve the treatment. The drug triggers the immune system to fight cancer.\\<TAB\\>\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if treatment with HAIPs to deliver liver-directed chemotherapy in combination with M9241 is effective for certain cancers.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 and older who have cancer of the bile ducts that is only in the liver, or colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood tests\n\nPregnancy test (if needed)\n\nTumor biopsy (if needed)\n\nElectrocardiogram\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scans\n\nParticipants will have an abdominal operation. A catheter will be placed into an artery that feeds blood to the liver. The catheter will then be attached to the HAIP. The HAIP will lay under the skin on the left side of the abdomen.\n\nParticipants will have chemotherapy drugs or heparin with saline infused into the HAIP every 2 weeks. M9241 will be injected under the skin every 4 weeks. They will get systemic chemotherapy through an IV or mediport every 2 weeks. They will receive this treatment until their cancer gets worse or they have bad side effects.\n\nParticipants will have 2 study visits each month. They will have CT scans every 8 weeks. At visits, they will repeat some screening tests.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit 1 month after treatment ends. Then they will be contacted every 6 months for 5 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nRegional chemotherapy for hepatic malignancies takes advantage of the fact that tumors are perfused almost exclusively by the hepatic artery and, that the agent used (Floxuridine, FUDR) has a 95% first-pass metabolism by the liver.\n\nEarly clinical trials performed during the 1970's and 1980's demonstrated impressive response rates that led to the adoption of hepatic artery infusion pump chemotherapy (HAIP) at select centers; however, little has changed in the ensuing decades with respect to regional\n\ntherapy for the liver, although there has been continued and even renewed interest.\n\nDose reductions of FUDR are common after several treatments, which has limited both the magnitude and duration of treatment responses in many cases.\n\nWe posit that the logical and much-needed next step in regional therapy is to take advantage of the FUDR-induced tumor necrosis with an agent able to activate local tumor immunity for a synergistic effect.\n\nM9241 (NHS-IL12) is an immunocytokine composed of two IL-12 heterodimers, each fused to the H-chain of the NHS76 antibody. The NHS76 IgG1 antibody has affinity for both single- and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and targets regions of tumor necrosis where DNA has become exposed. M9241 targets necrotic areas of the tumor and activates immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to induce a Th1 polarization of lymphocytes and the release of IFN-y. IFN-y in turn induces a host of immunomodulatory effects that contribute to robust antitumor responses.\n\nData from a recent Phase I study demonstrate that subcutaneous administration of M9241 is safe and a MTD has been determined. Moreover, preclinical models indicate that M9241 synergizes with therapies able to effectively induce tumor necrosis, which may also\n\nminimize toxicity by limiting off-target exposure.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To determine the overall response rates in participants with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) treated with M9241 in combination with HAIP and systemic therapy.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver (Cohort 1) or unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Cohort 2).\n* No evidence of extrahepatic metastases\n* Participants must have received first-line systemic chemotherapy.\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n\nDesign:\n\n-Open label, single center, non-randomized Phase II study"

Archival tumor sample may be used but if archival tissue is not available or is not adequate, tissue biopsy will be required.\n* Clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease to regional (porta hepatis) lymph nodes will be allowed, provided it is amenable to resection.\n* Participants must have radiographically measurable disease\n* Disease must be considered unresectable at the time of preoperative evaluation.\n* Participants must have received 1st line systemic chemotherapy\n* ECOG performance status \\<= 1.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * leukocytes \\>= 2,000/ mm(3)\n  * absolute neutrophil count \\> 1,500/mcL\n  * platelets \\>= 75,000/ mm(3)\n  * hemoglobin \\> 8 g/dL\n  * total bilirubin \\< 1.5 mg/dl\n  * creatinine \\<= 1.5 mg/dl\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nExclusion Criteria- All Cohorts\n\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants who have previously received rIL-12.\n* Participants with active autoimmune diseases, that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory agent with the exceptions:\n* diabetes type I, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible;\n* Participants requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at doses \\<= 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;\n* administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or inhalation) is eligible.\n* History of organ transplant, except for transplants that do not require immunosuppression.\n* History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis).\n* Known hypersensitivity or allergic reactions attributed to any compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the study medication, such as recombinant IL-12 or other monoclonal antibodies and history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition to FUDR or heparin.\n* Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke \\< 6 months prior to enrollment, myocardial infarction \\< 6 months prior to enrollment, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (\\>= NYHA III) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.\n* All conditions associated with significant necrosis of nontumor-bearing tissues.\n* Esophageal or gastroduodenal ulcers \\< 6 months prior to treatment.\n* Active ischemic bowel disease.\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Active concurrent malignancies within the last five years other than colorectal primary except basal cell skin carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma.\n* Prior radiation to liver.\n* Participants with active Hepatitis B or C infection.\n* Significant acute or chronic infections (i.e., tuberculosis) history of exposure or history of positive tuberculosis test; plus, presence of clinical symptoms, physical or radiographic findings).\n* Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities and/or insufficient normal liver parenchyma, which places the participant at unacceptable risk if they were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria-Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma\n\n-Participants with incontrovertible radiographic evidence of disease outside of the colon/rectum (primary) and liver given unlikelihood of benefit from liver-directed therapy.\n\nNote: Lung lesions seen on CT do not always represent metastases. They are very hard to qualify, therefore exception to this exclusion is participants with fewer than five lung lesions greater than 1 cm that have not increased in size by more than 10% over a 4-month period of time and are amenable to resection should subsequent problematic growth occur. Lesions less than 1 cm are indeterminant as far as etiology is concerned and will be ignored. Participants with liver metastases and oligometastatic lung lesions (we define oligometastatic as less than 5 amenable to thoracoscopic removal) are still likely to benefit from liver directed therapy.\n\n* Participants who have undergone extra-hepatic metastasectomy and have a documented disease-free interval less than or equal to 4 months.\n* MSI-high participants who need to be treated with check-point inhibitors.\n* Prior treatment with FUDR.\n\nExclusion Criteria-Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma\n\n-Presence of distant metastatic disease. Clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes will be allowed, provided it is amenable to resection.\n\nNote: Lung lesions seen on CT do not always represent metastases.
