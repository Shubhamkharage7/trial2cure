            "briefSummary": "This research study involves testing the safety and efficacy of an investigational intervention for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has spread, or metastasized, to other parts the body and is PD-L1-negative.\n\nThe names of the study interventions involved in this study are:\n\n* Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy\u2122;IMMU-132)\n* Pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae; MK-3475)",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug or a combination of investigational drugs to learn whether the drug or drug combination works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug or drug combination is being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sacituzumab Govitecan for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but it is currently approved only for patients who have had 2 or more prior regimens for metastatic disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pembrolizumab for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but it is currently approved only for patients with PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we are:\n\n* Studying Sacituzumab Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that are PD-L1-negative.\n* Sacituzumab Govitecan is composed of a chemotherapy drug, called Irinotecan, which is attached to an antibody. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the immune system that bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm. The antibody in this study binds to certain types of cancer tumors, including triple-negative breast tumors.\n* Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, called an anti-PD-1 or a checkpoint inhibitor, and is an antibody (a type of human protein) designed to allow the body's own immune system to seek out and destroy tumors. It has been used in previous research studies to treat breast cancer, where it has been shown to be effective.\n* The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of either Sacituzumab Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab, in delaying the worsening of triple-negative breast cancers that are PD-L1-negative.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, research blood collections, at least two research biopsies, paired research stool collections, questionnaires, data collection, and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of two groups.\n\n* Group A: Sacituzumab Govitecan on days 1 and 8 and Pembrolizumab on day 1 of a 21-day cycle\n* Group B: Sacituzumab Govitecan alone on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as they are benefitting from this therapy. Participants will be followed for the rest of their life.\n\nIt is expected that about 110 people will take part in this research study."

Patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery.\n* Uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled non-malignant systemic disease, uncontrolled seizures, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy (\\> 10 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive medication (including disease modifying agents) and has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic therapy.\n* Participant has documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that currently requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n* History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.\n* Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers that have been diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years are eligible: cervical/prostate carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 3 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the study principal investigator to determine eligibility.\n* Participant has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as detected HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\]) infection. HIV-positive participants are ineligible due to the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions of combination antiretroviral therapy with study drugs and the increased risk of fatal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Note: No testing for HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n* The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to study treatment initiation. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is allowed.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, participants who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.",
