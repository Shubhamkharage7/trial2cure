The ketogenic diet (a high fat, low carbohydrate diet) and metformin (a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat type 2 diabetes) are both known to lower blood glucose levels. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the tolerability of a ketogenic diet in conjunction with metformin and whether maintaining and the diet with metformin will have any effect on participants. Participants will prepare their own meals with the help of a nutritionist. Participants will continue on treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects"

Patients must have histologically confirmed high-grade glioma (e.g. glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic mixed glioma or other anaplastic gliomas).\n2. Patients must have an MRI performed within 21 days prior to beginning the study diet and on a fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days.

On a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days.\n    3. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease postoperatively, a MRI should be done:\n\n       * No later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or\n       * At least 4 weeks post-operatively, and\n       * Within 14 days of registration, and\n       * If the 96-hour scan is more than 21 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, diabetes requiring oral hypoglycemic drugs and/or insulin, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n6. Patients known to have a malignancy that has required treatment in the last 12 months and/or is expected to require treatment in the next 12 months (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ in the cervix).\n7. The effects of a Ketogenic diet or metformin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n8.
