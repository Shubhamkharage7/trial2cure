This study proposes to examine a novel approach for increasing PE law compliance by testing a PE audit and feedback tool (adapted from a tool used by the New York City Department of Education) in Oakland, California schools to determine the effectiveness, adaptability, and scalability of this potential cost-effective approach for increasing PE law compliance and student physical activity."

We will calculate the estimated minutes of PE class-time students receive per week using the number of PE minutes scheduled per week, the proportion of scheduled PE classes that did not occur on days we randomly arrived to observe class, and actual observed PE class length from System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT) observations. Differences in changes in calculated minutes of PE/week and meeting the California PE minute mandate will be determined using adjusted linear and logistic mixed effects models with a time by group interaction term and random effects on teachers nested within school.",
