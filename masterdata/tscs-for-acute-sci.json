            "briefSummary": "This project will focus on a novel approach to stabilizing blood pressure (BP) during inpatient rehabilitation after acute SCI. After SCI, people have unstable blood pressure, ranging from too low (orthostatic hypotension) to too high (autonomic dysreflexia). Unstable BP often interferes with performing effective physical rehabilitation after SCI. A critical need exists for the identification of safe, practical and effective treatment options that stabilize BP after traumatic SCI. Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (TSCS) has several advantages over pharmacological approaches: (1) does not exacerbate polypharmacy, (2) can be activated/deactivated rapidly, and (3) can be applied in synergy with physical exercise. The study team is asking the key question: \"What if applying TSCS earlier after injury could prevent the development of BP instability?\" To facilitate adoption of TSCS for widespread clinical use, the study team plans to map and develop a parameter configuration that will result in an easy to follow algorithm to maximize individual benefits, while minimizing the burden on healthcare professionals. This project will provide the foundational evidence to support the feasible and safe application of TSCS in the newly injured population, thereby overcoming barriers to engagement in prescribed inpatient rehabilitation regimens that are imposed by BP instability.",
            "detailedDescription": "This site-specific project will focus on a novel non-pharmacologic approach to stabilizing blood pressure (BP) during acute inpatient rehabilitation after acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Current forms of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for hypotension and orthostatic hypotension remain inadequate in the SCI population. A critical need exists for the identification of safe, practical and effective treatment options that stabilize BP after traumatic SCI as low BP limits the ability of individuals from fully participating in acute rehabilitation therapies. Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (TSCS) has several advantages including being able to be activated/deactivated rapidly and the ability to be used during inpatient therapy for rehabilitation following SCI. The study team is asking the key question: \"What is the safety and feasibility of applying TSCS in acute SCI to prevent the development of BP instability?\" To facilitate adoption of TSCS for widespread clinical use, the study team has designed a mapping and parameter configuration protocol to develop a standard, easy to follow algorithm that will maximize individual benefits of spinal neuromodulation, while minimizing the burden on healthcare professionals. This project will provide the foundational evidence to support the feasible and safe application of TSCS in the newly injured SCI population, thereby overcoming one of the major barriers (i.e., low BP) that prevents full participation in acute SCI rehabilitation."
