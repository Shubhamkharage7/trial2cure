The investigators also want to look for reasons why some women get lymphedema and others don't. Specifically, the investigators want to do tests on the breast tissue that is removed at the time of surgery to see if they can identify inflammation in the breast tissue, which may increase a woman's risk for lymphedema. The investigators will also ask the patient to answer questions to see how much their quality of life is affected by lymphedema, and whether this study can help women by detecting lymphedema earlier."
