            "briefSummary": "The investigators are conducting this research study to better understand how individuals with bipolar disorder regulate their emotions, and if transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can help improve emotion regulation for individuals with bipolar mood disorders.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study protocol is to test whether intermittent theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS-TMS) to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) or inferior parietal lobule (IPL) can improve performance on emotion regulation tasks in patients with bipolar disorder. Results from this study will help inform future treatment development to improve emotion regulation in patients with bipolar disorder. The study will proceed in two phases: During Phase 1, a cohort of 30 healthy control subjects will be recruited in order to establish a normative sample from which to compare patient data. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data will be collected from healthy control participants during performance on two emotion regulation tasks (probing implicit and explicit emotion regulation). Data from these subjects will provide a normative distribution of VLPFC and IPL function from which to compare individual patients. During Phase 2, a cohort of 30 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder will be recruited. Patient participants will perform the same two emotion regulation tasks during fMRI scanning. Data from individual patients will be analyzed to detect specific VLPFC and IPL subregions showing activation deviations from healthy controls (Phase 1 data). Patient-specific VLPFC and IPL subregions showing patterns of activation greater than two standard deviations from healthy controls will be used as individualized target sites for TMS stimulation. Patients will then receive high-dose iTBS-TMS (1800 pulses) of the VLPFC and IPL, and sham iTBS-TMS to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) across three separate study visits. Order of target stimulation will be randomized across participants. TMS sessions will take approximately 10 minutes and will be immediately followed by an fMRI scanning session, during which participants will again complete the implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks. TMS sessions will take place in the scanning bay to enable quick transition to the fMRI task. Baseline scanning sessions and either active TMS-fMRI or sham TMS-fMRI sessions will occur on separate days, no more than two weeks apart. Effects of iTBS-TMS on emotion regulation will be evaluated by comparing pre-TMS versus post-TMS behavior, neural activation, and functional connectivity patterns during performance on implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks."

Participants report via a button press the identity of the target number that differs from the two distractor numbers. Noninterference (control) trials: distractor numbers are always zeros, and the identity of the target number always corresponds to its position on the button response pad (100, 020, 003). Interference trials: distractor numbers are always numbers other than 0, and the identity of the target number is always incongruent with its position on the button response pad (e.g. 211, 232, 331, etc.). Each trial of the MSIT is overlaid on a negative, positive, or neutral IAPS image. Reaction time (ms) and accuracy (% correct) is calculated for each trial.",
