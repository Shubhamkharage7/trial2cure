The investigators have previously developed an intervention comprised of (a) a set of conversation cards designed to enable patients to identify aspects of life with diabetes important to them and to share them with their clinician to obtain their input; and (b) materials that help clinicians respond to patient concerns. The investigators will now conduct a randomized clinical trial to test the feasibility of the research procedures and efficacy of the intervention with respect to patient reported outcome measures.",
