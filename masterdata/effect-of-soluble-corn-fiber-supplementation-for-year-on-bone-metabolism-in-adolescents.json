            "briefSummary": "The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the effects of soluble corn fiber (SCF) supplementation for 1 year on bone metabolism in growing adolescents compared to controls. For the proposed study, a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 236 healthy adolescents aged 10-13 years, equally randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: SCF (12 g/d), SCF + calcium (12 g/d of SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium), placebo (0 g/d of SCF or of calcium), and placebo + calcium (0 g/d of SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium); all administered twice a day. Bone mass will be assessed at baseline at 6 months and at 12 months and bone related biomarkers and fecal microbiome will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The adolescent period is crucial for optimizing future bone health because bone accumulates rapidly during these years and accounts for up to half of adult peak bone mass. Calcium intake during this period is critical for adequate bone mineralization but this is the nutrient most deficient in the diets of adolescents. A strategy to maximize bone mineralization during this critical period is to increase the absorption of the calcium being consumed. This could be achieved by supplementing diets with certain non-digestible carbohydrates, such as soluble corn fiber (SCF).\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of SCF supplementation for 1 year on bone metabolism in growing adolescents compared to controls. A randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 236 healthy adolescents aged 10-13 years, equally randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: SCF (12 g/d), SCF + calcium (12 g/d of SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium), placebo (0 g/d of SCF or of calcium), and placebo + calcium (0 g/d of SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium); all administered twice a day. Bone mass will be assessed at baseline at 6 months and at 12 months and bone related biomarkers and fecal microbiome will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months. The treatments will be provided in the form of flavored drinks twice per day (this was previously used in a short-term study among adolescents with excellent acceptance). Bone mass and anthropometric measurements will be assessed at baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months and bone related biomarkers and fecal microbiome will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months. Assessment visits will be conducted in the Clinical Research Center of the Stempel School of Public Health at Florida International University. We will also have short home visits at 3 and 9 months to collect unused supplements and provide more supplements. In all visits, participants will complete several questionnaires, such as general health, diet and activity questionnaire. Compliance will be evaluated at all visits and also in real time using a study mobile app.\n\nThe primary outcome is change in bone mineral content (BMC) measured using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)\n\nThe secondary outcomes include biochemical markers reflecting vitamin D status, calcium homeostasis and bone, such as serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, osteocalcin, carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX), parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone specific alkaline phosphatase, 25-(OH) vitamin D3, 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and urinary calcium, phosphorus, creatinine and N-telopeptide cross-links."
