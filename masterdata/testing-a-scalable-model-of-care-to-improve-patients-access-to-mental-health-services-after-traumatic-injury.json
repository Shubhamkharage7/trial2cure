            "detailedDescription": "In 2015, our team launched the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP) at the Medical University of South Carolina's Level I trauma center. TRRP is a stepped model of care that is designed to deliver education at the bedside about mental health recovery after traumatic injury as well as risk assessment and brief intervention for high-risk patients (Step 1), foster symptom self-monitoring and continued education via our automated text messaging system (Step 2), screen for PTSD and depression by chatbot or telephone 30 days post-injury (Step 3), and provide a referral and warm handoff to mental health services if needed (Step 4). The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the clinical and functional impact of TRRP over a period of 12 months. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with one-year follow up of TRRP vs. enhanced usual care (EUC) with 350 patients at The George Washington University (GWU) hospital, which serves a diverse population of \\~2000 trauma center patients per year (15% penetrating mechanism). Trained, supervised interviewers blind to study condition will assess clinical and functional outcomes 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline (Aim 1). Qualitative interviews will be conducted with \u2265 30 patients from underrepresented minority groups (i.e., African American, Latinx) as well as \u2265 20 victims of violent trauma (penetrating mechanism) to identify opportunities to strengthen the model to meet the diverse needs of these patients (Aim 2). GWU does not currently have an embedded mental health program in place, which will enable us to explore implementation determinants systematically (Aim 3)."

Patients with positive substance use screens via GWU's SBIRT protocol (\\~7% of the patient population) will be assessed by the clinical team with reference to severity and recency of substance use problems. We have found at MUSC that a high percentage of patients with SBIRT- positive screens are nevertheless good candidates for TRRP (\\>85%), but patients with serious, active substance abuse problems are likely not good candidates for TRRP and therefore will be excluded and referred to a substance use treatment center.",

Additionally, we will prepare manuscripts for submission to research journals, such as JAMA, JAMA Surgery, JAMA Psychiatry, Am J Psychiatry, J Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, J Am College of Surgeons, Am J Public Health, and other sources that ensure broad dissemination.
