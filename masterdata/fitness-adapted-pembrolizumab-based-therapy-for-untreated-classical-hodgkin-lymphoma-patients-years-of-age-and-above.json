            "briefSummary": "This is a multi-center, open-label phase II study to assess the efficacy of a novel fitness-adapted regimen in previously untreated older patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All participants will receive up to a total of 8 cycles of pembrolizumab (Q6 week dosing). The first cycle of pembrolizumab will be administered in combination with brentuximab vedotin (BV) (\"lead-in treatment\").\n\nFollowing lead-in treatment, all participants will undergo interim PET/CT (iPET) as well as fitness testing to help inform participant level of fitness for subsequent lymphoma-directed therapies.\n\nParticipants deemed \"Frail\" by this assessment will continue 3 additional 6 week cycles of concurrent pembrolizumab and BV (\"induction therapy\", each cycle is 42 days), then continue single-agent pembrolizumab to complete up to 4 additional cycles (i.e., 8 total) of therapy (\"consolidation and maintenance therapy\", Frail cohort). Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.\n\nThose deemed \"fit\" after lead-in therapy (Fit cohort) will continue pembrolizumab and switch from BV to concurrently-administered combination chemotherapy using doxorubicin (A), vinblastine (V), and dacarbazine (D) for a total of 4 planned AVD cycles (3, 6-week pembrolizumab cycles, \"induction therapy\"). Chemotherapy drugs will be given at standard doses as in ABVD (no bleomycin will be given in this study) on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (C1AVD), and pembrolizumab dosing will remain every 42 days. Following end-induction PET/CT, pembrolizumab will continue every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in the consolidation/maintenance phase. Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.\n\nParticipants deemed \"unfit\" after lead-in therapy and by fitness assessment will continue pembrolizumab and switch from BV to concurrently administered combination chemotherapy termed \"mini-avd\" as induction therapy. Mini-avd consists of lower doses of conventional AVD chemotherapy (doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) and will be administered for on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle for 4 planned cycles. Pembrolizumab will continue every 42 days. Following end-induction PET/CT, pembrolizumab will continue every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in the consolidation/maintenance phase. Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5."

Prior exposure to hepatitis B is allowed as long as there are no HBsAg detected (ie positive Hepatitis B core antibody with negative HBsAg). Prior treatment with Hepatitis C is allowed if the screening HCV RNA by PCR is negative.\n* Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB; Mycobacterium tuberculosis).\n* Is currently taking a strong CYP3A4 modulator. Subjects taking strong CYP34A modulators that can safely stop these medications prior to treatment should complete a washout period of 4 weeks or 5 times the half-life of a particular drug, whichever is shorter.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n\nNote: given older age at enrollment, WOCBP are not anticipated to enroll on this study.",
