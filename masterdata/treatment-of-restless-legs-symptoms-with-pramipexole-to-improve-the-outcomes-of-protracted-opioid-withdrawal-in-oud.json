            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose to test the use of pramipexole in patients being treated for Opioid Use Disorder to test its ability to reduce symptoms of both Restless Legs Syndrome and protracted opioid withdrawal and thereby promote initiation, engagement, and retention in treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a parallel, two-arm, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled 2-week trial investigating the effects of pramipexole 0.25-0.5 mg on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) symptoms in patients suffering from opioid withdrawal. The investigators hypothesize that pramipexole is an effective treatment for RLS symptoms in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) patients during post-detox clinical stabilization. Further, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of RLS in this context will also improve overall symptoms of opioid withdrawal.\n\nRLS is a sensory-motor neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs. The investigators have recently confirmed anecdotal reports that RLS is common among patients with OUD experiencing opioid withdrawal. Dopamine agonists such as pramipexole are efficacious and first-line FDA-approved treatments in low doses for RLS.\n\nRecruitment and enrollment will occur at the Gavin Foundation Clinical Stabilization Services (CSS) in Quincy, Massachusetts. Eligible patients will be randomized to two weeks of pramipexole or placebo after an initial 3-day screening period and will be asked to complete 5 remote study visits over video or phone. Participants will be asked to complete sleep diaries and questionnaires at various points throughout the study."
