Additionally, to characterize the safety and toxicity profile of the study treatment as measured by the adverse event rates.",

This study evaluates the hypothesis that the use of sFOLFOXIRI in gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) will increase response rates beyond that expected with FOLFOX, while maintaining acceptable tolerability. The primary endpoint of this study is the objective response rate (ORR) while the key secondary endpoints include the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse event (AE) rates. The goal of this study is to establish the activity level of sFOLFOXIRI, with the thought that this could be further developed in the metastatic and/or peri-operative space if a sufficiently interesting degree of efficacy is observed."
