            "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of ficlatuzumab combined with cetuximab (Arm 1 or Arm 2) to a control arm of placebo plus cetuximab (Arm 3) in participants with R/M human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative HNSCC. Eligible participants must have failed prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 \\[programmed cell death protein 1\\] or PD-L1 \\[programmed death ligand 1\\] immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and with platinum-based chemotherapy, administered in combination or sequentially. Failure of prior treatment may be due to progression of disease or intolerance to treatment. It is anticipated that the study will enroll approximately 410 participants across 3 arms."
