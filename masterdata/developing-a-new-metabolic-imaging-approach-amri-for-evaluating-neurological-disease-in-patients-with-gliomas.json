            "briefSummary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter k\u1d62\u2092\\*V differs in tumor versus (vs) normal brain. Researchers will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Post-gadolinium (Gd) T1 MRI will be used to distinguish the contrast-enhancing \"ring\" region indicating the metabolically active tumor periphery from the less viable and/or necrotic tumor core. The utility of aMRI to differentially assess the metabolically active tumor periphery and necrotic core regions will be determined and compared to that of \u00b9\u2078FDG PET (SUVmax).\n\nII. Characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter k\u1d62\u2092\\*V differs in the various normal appearing brain sub-regions unaffected by tumor, in comparison to \u00b9\u2078FDG PET.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare how the aMRI metabolic parameter k\u1d62\u2092\\*V within disease lesions change with different disease types, their disease stage, and their treatment status.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive \u00b9\u2078FDG IV, then 60 minutes later undergo simultaneous MRI and PET scanning. During this scanning period, patients will receive gadoterate meglumine IV to obtain post-contrast MRI. Total scanning time will take 45-60 minutes."
