This study will evaluate Next Generation Emulsion Preservative Free Eye Drops (NGE-UD) in adult participants with dry eye symptoms and who are high digital device users.\n\nNGE-UD is an over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug indicated for the temporary relief of symptoms of eye dryness. Participants will administer 1 drop of NGE-UD on Day 1 for the acute phase of the study, after Day 1 participants will administer 1-2 eye drops in each eye at least twice a day but as much as needed through Day 15. Around 50 adult participants will be enrolled at one site in the United States.\n\nThere is expected to be no additional burden for participants in this trial. Study visits may be conducted on-site as per standard of care."
