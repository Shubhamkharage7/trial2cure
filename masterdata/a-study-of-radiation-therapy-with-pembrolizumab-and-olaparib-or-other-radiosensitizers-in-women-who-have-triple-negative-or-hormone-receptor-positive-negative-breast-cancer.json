PDL-1 status is not used to determine eligibility among mER+BC patients\n* Note: PDL1-status may be determined on tissues from either primary or mTNBC. Determination of PD-L1 status by any prototype assays is acceptable. PD-L1 status is required or archival tissue must be readily available for testing during screening if status was not previously determined.\n* The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written informed consent for the trial.\n* Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.
