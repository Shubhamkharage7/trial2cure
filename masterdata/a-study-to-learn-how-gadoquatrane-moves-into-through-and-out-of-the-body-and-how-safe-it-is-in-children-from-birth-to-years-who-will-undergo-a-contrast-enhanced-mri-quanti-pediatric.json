            "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to help children under the age of 18 with any known or suspected problems scheduled for a \"contrast-enhanced\" Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nMRI is used by doctors to create detailed images of the inside of the body to identify health problems. Sometimes doctors need to inject a contrast agent into a patient's vein to perform a \"contrast-enhanced\" MRI (CE-MRI). Such CE-MRI examinations may support doctors to identify certain health problems or improve their evaluation.\n\nThe contrast agents commonly used in MRI are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). GBCAs contain a \"rare earth\" element called gadolinium (Gd), which is needed for the increase in signal intensity and contrast in MRI. The gadolinium in these contrast agents is caged in a molecule (chelate complex). Researchers are developing new contrast agents with a lower amount of Gd needed per CE-MRI investigation. Gadoquatrane is one of these new contrast agents. It has been tested in several studies previously.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how gadoquatrane moves into, through, and out of the body and how safe it is in children. The researchers will measure the amount of gadoquatrane in the blood at different time points after a single injection.\n\nThe participants will undergo an MRI examination and receive gadoquatrane once at a dose of 0.04 mmol Gd/kg (corresponding to 0.1 mL/kg). It is injected into the participant's vein (also called an intravenous injection) during the MRI examination.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for between 8 and 38 days with up to 5 doctor visits, including the screening phase of up to 28 days with no more than 2 visits. Once a participant has received the injection of gadoquatrane, the remaining study duration is 7 (\u00b11) days.\n\nAt the start or during the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* check the weight and height of the participant,\n* ask for information including age and medical history,\n* take participants' blood samples,\n* ask participants and/or their guardians questions about medicines they are taking,\n* check blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature,\n* check the area where the participants had the intravenous injection,\n* do pregnancy tests in girls of childbearing age,\n* review the MRI scans obtained in the study and decide on the diagnosis\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments."
