The overarching goal is to prevent early life obesity and progression to metabolic syndrome in high-risk populations, starting with healthy toddler weights by age 2 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study seeks to intervene just in time for families at highest risk of early life obesity and obesity-related comorbidities (such as Type 2 diabetes), to prevent intergenerational obesity and metabolic syndrome for Hispanic families. For those children exposed to gestational diabetes (GDM) or maternal overweight/obesity in utero, there is a critical need for effective early life strategies for secondary prevention of obesity, to interrupt intergenerational transmission. This study will offer community-embedded coaching to families learn how to responsively feed their babies using 2 models: group visits and text-based. The investigators will also assess responsive sleep practices; i.e. paying attention to an infant's sleep cues as well as hunger cues, breaking the feeding to sleep association, and not overfeeding at night. Infant and toddler sleep, both duration and quality, has not been well studied in this population for early life obesity prevention. This study is specifically exploring pathways from prenatal gestational diabetes and maternal overweight/obesity to dysregulated infant feeding and sleep. Few interventions around infant sleep exist for the Hispanic population, or resources in Spanish-language around sleep coaching; let alone analyses on parents' self-efficacy and behavior change. In this study, the investigators aim to better understand the complex socioenvironmental drivers of infant sleep and feeding behaviors, and the prenatal risks related to infant rapid weight gain, in order to target modifiable factors in this population."

During each session, each mother-baby pair will be pulled out to a private medical room for a brief individual well child appointment with the pediatrician. During this appointment, infant measurements, physical exam, and discussion of unique concerns will take place before the pair returns to the session. There are 8 scheduled well child checks by the age of two, where regular parenting topics will be covered (i.e. discipline, safety, co-parenting, sibling relationships, childcare, development). Each Centering session is expected to last approximately 2 hours, for a total commitment of approximately 16 hours across 8 group sessions over the course of 22 months for each participant.
