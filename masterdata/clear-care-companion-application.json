In this study, Clinical and Engineering Approaches to Readmission (CLEAR) Care Companion Application, investigators aim to utilize a smartphone application that tracks concerning postoperative symptoms and provides educational interventions to determine if this can minimize delays in communication between patients and medical providers, increase patient satisfaction with the care received, and reduce or lessen the severity of readmissions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients complete clinically meaningful questions and validated questionnaires pertaining to physiological and psychological symptoms that serve as early indicators of readmission, with the aim to improve experience by empowering patient to be active participants in their recovery, identify complications early to minimize morbidity and reduce overall readmissions.\n\nThe study has the following three objectives: (1) Assess patient engagement with the CLEAR Care Companion application for patients that have undergone radical cystectomy (2) Measure patient experience with the application and its effect on satisfaction with overall care (3) Evaluate the effect of the application on case complexity (readmission intensity) and overall readmission rates."
