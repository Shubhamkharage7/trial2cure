A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied together for the first time.\n\nThis phase I study tests the safety of the drug duvelisib when used in combination with the drug venetoclax. Duvelisib is still being studied, but the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved the use of Duvelisib in patients with CLL/SLL with relapsed or refractory CLL after having received 2 or more prior therapies.\n\nDuvelisib is a drug that is given in capsule form and taken by mouth. This drug is designed to stop cancer growth by blocking a protein called phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is important for the survival of CLL cells. In laboratory studies and in other clinical trials that included participants with CLL, duvelisib was effective at killing CLL cells.\n\nVenetoclax is a tablet that is taken by mouth. Venetoclax targets a protein called BCL-2, which helps cancer cells survive. Venetoclax is an effective treatment for many participants with CLL who do not respond to chemotherapy or other approved drugs or who have relapsed after prior therapy.Venetoclax is FDA approved for participants with CLL who have never had therapy before or whose CLL has worsened after prior therapy.\n\nIn the phase I portion of this study, the investigators are looking to determine the dose of venetoclax that is safe to give with duvelisib and to see what the side effects are of this combination.\n\nIn the phase II portion of this study, we are looking to determine how effective thecombination of duvelisib and venetoclax is for patients with CLL or Richter's Syndrome"
