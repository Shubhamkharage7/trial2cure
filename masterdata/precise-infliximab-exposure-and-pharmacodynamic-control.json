There are limited treatment options approved for use in children and adults with Crohn's disease. Physicians need better ways to inform decisions on treatment.\n\nThe main reason for this research study is to determine if a computer program that calculates an individualized dose based on a patient's blood testing results (precision dosing) can better achieve the best possible response to infliximab compared to standard dosing (conventional dosing).",
