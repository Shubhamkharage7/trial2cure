            "briefSummary": "The broad long-term objective is to develop an objective biomarker for spinal health based on aberrant or abnormal movement patterns during functional activities to better target spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) and other conservative treatments. The central hypotheses are a) that aberrant spinal motions and their location (area and level) are indicative of underlying spinal dysfunction, and b) that quantified 3D cervical spine intersegmental and global motion patterns during functional tasks can be used as a biomarker for subsequent clinical studies aimed at normalizing cervical kinematics.\n\nSpecific Aim: Determine the extent to which SMT can modulate, or normalize, intersegmental motion in patients with neck pain. Rationale: SMT is a force-based biomechanical event whose hypothesized mechanism of action relies on moving the segment into the para-physiological zone, resulting in normalization of spinal kinematic function. Hypothesis: Severity of abnormal or aberrant motion, identified in those with NP, will improve following SMT. Approach: Participants with chronic mechanical neck pain will be recruited and randomized into one of three groups: 1) No Treatment, 2) Light Massage (pseudo- sham), and 3) Spinal Manipulative Therapy. Using a repeated measures study design, metrics of quality of spinal motion will be compared before and after the prescribed intervention."
