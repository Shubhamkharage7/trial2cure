This will be the first study that the investigators know of that will examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of augmenting a suicide-focused treatment (Dialectical Behavior Therapy, \\[DBT\\]) with an evidence-based treatment protocol for insomnia (a digital version of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia \\[CBT-I\\]). The goal of this clinical trial is to learn providing insomnia treatment in conjunction with suicide-focused treatment leads to greater reductions in suicidality and self-harm than suicide-focused treatment alone.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive 6 months of DBT plus CBT-I or to DBT alone and will complete research assessments measuring suicidal ideation, self-harm behavior and insomnia symptoms every four weeks over the course of the study, as well as one post-treatment follow-up assessment. Participants will also wear a device on their wrist (like a Fitbit or wristwatch) for 10 days following each assessment to collect data about their sleep."
