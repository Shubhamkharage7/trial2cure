            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the safety of psilocybin in adult patients with opioid use disorder concurrently taking buprenorphine-naloxone.\n\nEligible participants will be adults with active opioid use disorder (OUD) who are willing to begin and maintain a daily dose of buprenorphine-naloxone throughout study participation. Initiation, stabilization, and maintenance of buprenorphine-naloxone will be overseen by a qualified study medical provider. After psychological screening and at least 6 hours of preparatory counseling and preparation for the psilocybin dosing, set, and setting, each participant will ingest 1 oral dose of psilocybin. All dosing sessions will be attended by 2 specially trained facilitators, in a dedicated Clinical Research Facility. After eight hours of observation in the dosing room, the participant will be kept overnight in the hospital Clinical Research Unit, and complete an integration session with a psychologist before discharge to home. Approximately 4 weeks after the first dose, the participant will receive a second oral dose of psilocybin, with the same length of observation.\n\nParticipants who have been administered the first dose but decline to receive the second dose will remain evaluable. At study termination, their active study participation will end, but completion of the 28 day post-dose follow up will be requested.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the assessment of the safety of concurrent administration of a buprenorphine-naloxone formulation and psilocybin as determined by physiological measures (ECG, respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and blood oxygen saturation) and validated clinical and self-report measures (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Opioid Craving Scale (OCS), Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB)).\n\nIf you are interested in participating in this study, please fill out a brief 1-minute survey at the link in the \"More Information\" section at the bottom of this record."
