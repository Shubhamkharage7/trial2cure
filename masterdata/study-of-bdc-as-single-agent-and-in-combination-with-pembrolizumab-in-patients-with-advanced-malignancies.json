In Part 3, the selected dose will be administered as monotherapy to patients with selected advanced malignancies. Part 2 is a dose escalation of BDC-3042 in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), or maximum protocol dose (MPD) recommended for Part 4. In Part 4, the selected dose will be administered in combination with pembrolizumab to patients with selected advanced malignancies."
