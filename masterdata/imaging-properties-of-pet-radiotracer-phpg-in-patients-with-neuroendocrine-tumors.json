If so, the results of this study will be used to support further development of \\[18F\\]3F-PHPG as a clinical tool for neuroendocrine tumor localization and staging.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects enrolled in this study will be recruited from the population of adult patients with neuroendocrine tumors, including pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, being treated at the University of Michigan Hospital.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to obtain basic information on the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of \\[18F\\]3F-PHPG in cancer patients with neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nThe secondary objective of the study is to compare the diagnostic performance of \\[18F\\]3F-PHPG in cancer patients with neuroendocrine tumors with the FDA approved radiopharmaceuticals \\[123I\\]metaiodobenzylguanidine (\\[123I\\]MIBG) and \\[68Ga\\]DOTA-TATE in the same patients. A group of approximately 12 of the subjects scanned with \\[18F\\]3F-PHPG will be recruited to undergo a whole-body \\[123I\\]MIBG scan using planar scintigraphy with a gamma camera, following the standard clinical protocol used at the University of Michigan. In addition, a single SPECT/CT scan of the primary neuroendocrine tumor will be acquired after the whole-body scan to provide a tomographic image for comparison with the positron emission tomography (PET) image acquired using \\[18F\\]3F-PHPG. Several subjects enrolled on this study will undergo \\[68Ga\\]DOTA-TATE scans off-study, as part of routine clinical management. Existing \\[68Ga\\]DOTA-TATE scans will be obtained from consenting subjects' medical records.\n\nThis is an exploratory study and thus all statistical data analyses will be exploratory in nature."
