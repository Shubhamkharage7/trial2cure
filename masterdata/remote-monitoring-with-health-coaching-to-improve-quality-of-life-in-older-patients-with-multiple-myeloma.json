            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests the effectiveness of a home-based mindfulness physical activity program with remote monitoring combined with structured telephone-based health coaching to decrease fatigue and improve quality of life in older patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Studies have shown that MM patients have the highest symptom burden among all blood cancers, with older patients experiencing more symptoms and problems, such as fatigue and decreased quality of life, compared to younger patients. There is some data to support that physical activity may have beneficial effects on fatigue, physical function, and quality of life in older cancer patients. Studies have also shown that older patients prefer activities that are gentle, holistic, and home-based. Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to have positive effects on sleep, depression, anxiety and cancer-related fatigue. Health coaching is a patient centered behavioral change intervention that is delivered by various healthcare professionals and involves goal-setting, self-discovery, and accountability. Health coaching interventions have been shown to increase physical activity levels and improve quality of life. A home-based mindfulness physical activity program with remote monitoring combined with structured telephone-based health coaching may decrease fatigue and improve the quality of life in older patients with MM.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the effect-size of a novel combined home-based mindfulness physical activity program with telephonic health coaching on 1) patient-reported fatigue assessed by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaires and 2) Health-related quality of life assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global-10 (PROMIS Global-10) questionnaire, and 3) physical activity levels measured by steps per day.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients participate in remote monitored home-based physical activity sessions including flexibility practice, slow walking and breathing exercises daily on 6 out of 7 days a week and receive telephone health coaching over 5-20 minutes once a week for 12 weeks. Patients also participate in a brief telephone interview at the end of 12 weeks. Additionally, patients wear a monitor on the wrist to monitor physical activity for 7 days during enrollment and at 3 months."
