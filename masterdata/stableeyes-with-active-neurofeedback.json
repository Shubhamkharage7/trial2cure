            "detailedDescription": "The rehabilitation device guides users to perform sinusoidal head rotations, matched to a metronome, about the yaw, pitch, and roll axes (60 sec epochs, 5 minutes per axis, 15 min total). The assessment for each axis consists of the number of completed epochs with each epoch requiring head rotations of a different amplitude. Subjects are instructed to begin with an 'easy' amplitude (i.e. small) and increase or decrease amplitude depending on the subject's perception of motion sickness - which is input from 0 (absent motion sick) to 11 (vomit) using a handheld controller. Video-oculography captures eye and head velocity as well as tracks the number of blinks and saccades, metrics that can indicate worsening nausea."
