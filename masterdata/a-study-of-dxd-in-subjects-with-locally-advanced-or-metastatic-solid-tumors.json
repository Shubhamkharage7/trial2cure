Adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology.\n   21. Surgically or medically castrated, with testosterone levels of \\<50 ng/dL.\n   22. Documented objective progression as determined by radiographic progression for subjects with measurable disease after androgen deprivation.\n   23. Relapsed or disease progression after having received treatment with \u22651 of the following novel hormonal agents: abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide.\n   24. Relapsed or disease progression after having received \u22651 cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen that included a taxane.\n4. Has \u22651 measurable lesion on CT or MRI as per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment. Prostate cancer participants with bone only disease may be eligible.\n5. Provides a pretreatment tumor tissue sample of sufficient quantity, as defined in the Study Laboratory Manual. The following tissue samples can be provided as the pretreatment tumor tissue sample:\n\n   1. Tissue collected from a biopsy (from \u22651 lesion not previously irradiated) performed since progression while on or after treatment with the most recent systemic cancer therapy regimen and prior to signing of the tissue ICF\n\n      OR\n   2. Pretreatment tumor biopsy from \u22651 lesion not previously irradiated and amenable to sampling after signing of the tissue ICF. The pretreatment tissue requirement may be waived after discussion and agreement with the Sponsor.\n6. Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1 at screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nParticipants who meet any of the following criteria will be disqualified from entering the study:\n\n1. Has HER2-positive gastric cancer as classified by ASCO-CAP guidelines and determined prior to enrollment by assessment in a local laboratory that is Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified (US sites) or accredited based on specific country regulations.\n2. Has nasopharyngeal cancer.\n3. Has mucosal or uveal melanoma.\n4. Has a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD), that required corticosteroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n5. Has clinically severe respiratory compromise (based on the investigator's assessment) resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses\n6. Is receiving chronic systemic corticosteroids dosed at \\>10 mg prednisone or equivalent anti-inflammatory activity or any form of immunosuppressive therapy prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\n   Participants who require use of bronchodilators, inhaled or topical steroids, or local steroid injections may be included in the study.\n7. Had prior treatment with an anti-HER3 antibody and/or antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of an exatecan derivative that is a topoisomerase I inhibitor (eg, trastuzumab deruxtecan).\n8. Has history of other active malignancy within 3 years prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, except the following:\n\n   1. Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer\n   2. Adequately treated intraepithelial carcinoma of the cervix\n   3. Any other curatively treated in situ disease\n9. Has any evidence of severe or uncontrolled diseases (eg, active bleeding diatheses, active serious infection) psychiatric illness/social situations, geographical factors, substance abuse, or other factors that, in the investigator's opinion, make it high risk for the subject to participate in the study or that would jeopardize compliance with the protocol\n10. Has previously received irinotecan treatment in the advanced or metastatic disease setting.",
