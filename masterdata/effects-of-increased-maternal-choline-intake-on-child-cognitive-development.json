However \\>90% of pregnant women in the U.S. consume less than the recommended amount, and choline is typically absent from most prenatal vitamins. Moreover, current choline recommendations for pregnant women may be inadequate for optimal fetal development and lifelong health. Animal studies clearly show that maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves offspring memory, attention, and emotion regulation. The purpose of this study is to examine cognitive and affective outcomes in the offspring of women supplemented with choline vs. control during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy."
