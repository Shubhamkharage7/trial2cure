A recent study showed that fractionated CO2 laser treatment is non inferior and actually may improve subjective symptoms compared to topical steroids with no serious safety or adverse events. Because steroids reduce risk of vulvar cancer in patients with lichen sclerosus, the investigators hypothesize that steroids in addition to the fractionated laser will provide greater symptom relief while still allowing patient the benefits of steroid treatment."
