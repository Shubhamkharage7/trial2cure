Benefits of participating in a 6-week virtual MTTP will be evaluated using validated assessments to measure social-emotional competencies.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study will employ a RCT to test the two hypotheses. The design of the MTTP is based on the SEL framework. The study will incorporate a 2 x 3 two-way factorial design with repeated measures at three time points. The two between-subject factor conditions will be participation in a MTTP versus a waitlist control condition that will be evaluated at baseline, immediately post-program, and at 6-week follow-up (within-subject factor conditions). Sixty adolescents with autism will be recruited for this study.\n\nAim 1. Evaluate the therapeutic benefits of a 6-week virtual MTTP on social-emotional functioning, and emotional stress among adolescents with autism.\n\nHypothesis #1: Adolescents with autism who participate in a virtual MTTP will demonstrate better social-emotional functioning, and a reduction in emotional stress compared to waitlist controls at the conclusion of a 6-week MTTP.\n\nHypothesis #2: The positive impact of the virtual MTTP on the participants' improved social-emotional functioning, and reduction in emotional stress will be maintained at 6-week follow-up."
