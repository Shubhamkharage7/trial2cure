The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the antiseizure medication reduce the functional connectivity of seizure networks, as identified by resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), within this specific target population?\n* What is the prevalence of seizure networks in patients from the target population, both with EEG suggestive and not suggestive of epileptogenic activity?\n\nParticipants will have a rs-fMRI and those with seizure networks will receive treatment with two antiseizure medications and a post-treatment rs-fMRI. Researchers will compare the pretreatment and post-treatment rs-fMRIs to see if there are changes in the participant's functional connectivity including seizure networks and typical resting state networks."

SzNET- participants will not undergo further interventions or tests, while SzNET+ subjects will be assigned to the intervention arm and will receive follow-up rsfMRI and EEG.\n\nThe study aims to fill 2 quotas in its intervention arm: Participants who are both SzNET+ and EEG+, and another for those SzNET+ but EEG-. Once either of these quotas is complete, the study will cease screening subjects with EEG results falling into that quota. The subjects discharged from hospital on antiseizure medications for medical reasons will be followed up at 3 months post-discharge to collect exploratory data",
