People can join the study if they have heart failure symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% or more. The purpose of this study is to find out whether BI 690517 in combination with empagliflozin helps people with heart failure.\n\nParticipants are put into 2 groups by chance. Every participant has an equal chance of being in each group. The groups are:\n\n* BI 690517 and empagliflozin group: participants take BI 690517 and empagliflozin as tablets once a day.\n* Placebo and empagliflozin group: participants take placebo and empagliflozin as tablets once a day.\n\nParticipants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. During this time, they visit their doctors regularly. The doctors regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. The study staff may also contact the participants by phone. Participants also regularly answer questions about their well-being.\n\nThe study does not have a fixed duration. It continues until we have enough data to see if the treatment is working."
