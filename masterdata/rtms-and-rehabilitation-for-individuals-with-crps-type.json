Treatment will last for 4 weeks, with the first week including 4 rTMS treatments and 2 rehabilitation treatments. Subsequent weeks will include 2 rTMS treatments followed by 2 rehabilitation treatments. Outcome measures will include pain ratings, PROMIS questionnaires, global rating of change, and grip strength or 1 repetition maximum leg press.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects will be randomized to receive either real or sham rTMS, combined with rehabilitation. Subjects will attend 10 sessions over 4 weeks.\n\nrTMS will be delivered at 10Hz using an intensity of 80% of the motor threshold. Pulse trains will be delivered for 10 seconds, with a 30-second rest for 20 repetitions. This will result in a total of 2,000 pulses of magnetic stimulation and will take approximately 20 minutes. There will be 10 rTMS sessions over the 4 weeks.\n\nSham rTMS will be delivered using the same method as rTMS, but a sham coil, that does not deliver magnetic stimulation, will be used.\n\nRehabilitation will include graded motor imagery, education, and graded functional activity. There will be 8 rehabilitation sessions over 4 weeks.\n\nOutcomes will include questionnaires asking about pain and function, and either grip strength or leg press strength measurements."

Coil orientation will be optimized for stimulation of the abductor pollicis brevis. Stimulation targeting will be identified using motor-evoked potentials (MEP) of the first dorsal interossei that will be monitored using electromyography (EMG) (Motion Lab Systems Inc., Baton Rouge, LA). The motor threshold (MT) of the muscle will then be identified by systematically adjusting the pulse intensity. The MT will be considered the lowest stimulation intensity at which 5 out of 10 MEPs have a peak-to-peak amplitude of at least 50 microvolts. rTMS will be performed at the identified optimal location at 10Hz using an intensity that is 80% of the MT. Pulse trains will be delivered for 10 seconds, with a 30-second rest for 20 repetitions.",
