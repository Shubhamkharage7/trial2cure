            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to conduct a prospective, longitudinal assessment of the natural clinical progression of children and adults with Synaptotagmin1-Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorder also known as Baker Gordon Syndrome (BAGOS). This will be performed by acquiring baseline measurements and developing effective outcome measures and diagnostic tools for the disorder, to prepare the healthcare system for future clinical trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "The current natural history study is being conducted in anticipation of future treatments for patients with confirmed BAGOS. The study is an important avenue of investigation that will increase our understanding of the disorder and lead to important diagnostic and therapeutic advances. Its purpose is to identify demographic, genetic, environmental, and treatment modalities and concomitant medications that correlate with the disease's development and outcomes. This study will use standard scales and questionnaires for the assessment of global development, language, memory, and motor function, and by collecting sleep and seizure diaries. A small blood sample will be collected for whole genome sequencing and proteomic analysis. Brain imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings will be collected to identify disease biomarkers. We will also be asking participants to provide a small skin sample for the development of patient specific stem cells which will be used to further understand the impact of Synaptotagmin1 mutations on neurodevelopment and as a potential screen for future therapies."
