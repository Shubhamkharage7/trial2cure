The purpose of the study is to characterize the impact of alpelisib on glucose control in patients with breast cancer using continuous glucose monitoring to measure glucose levels throughout the day and night. Patients will follow a hyperglycemia prevention and management regimen aimed to diminish hyperglycemia known to occur in most oncology patients starting alpelisib.\n\nAll patients will wear an Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 system to obtain continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data (glucose measured every minute for 14 days). CGM will be placed at least 10 days prior to starting alpelisib and continue for at least 3 months while taking alpelisib."
