            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nTime restricted eating (TRE) is a form of fasting in which a person eats only during a set window of time, which is usually between 4 and 10 hours each day. Researchers want to know more about how TRE may affect health.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn how TRE affects women with different body sizes.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy women aged 18 to 50 years.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 2 visits: 1 screening visit and one 5-day stay in the clinic.\n\nParticipants will fast before both visits. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. They will talk to a nutritionist about the foods they eat. They will lay under a clear hood for up to 45 minutes during a test that measures how many calories they burn while resting.\n\nParticipants will keep a food diary for up to 7 days before their clinic stay. They will apply a continuous glucose monitor the day before they go to the clinic. This is a device that attaches to the skin of the stomach. They will wear this device throughout their clinic stay.\n\nAll meals will be provided during the clinic stay. Participants will follow TRE on 3 days. They will answer survey questions and have tests during their stay, including:\n\n* DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan. Participants will lie on a padded table. Their body will be scanned to measure how much muscle, bone, fat, and other tissues they have.\n* Stable isotope tracer study. Small amounts of sugar and other substances will be given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm. Blood samples will be collected.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nIntermittent fasting confers anti-inflammatory effects, although underlying metabolic mechanisms are poorly defined. This pilot study will explore ketone bodies as a mediator of inflammation in response to time restricted eating (TRE-6-hr feeding/18-hr fast) without caloric restriction compared to a more conventional dietary regimen (12-hr feeding/12-hr fast) in women classified as obese and lean.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Aim 1: Quantify ketone body (beta-OHB) whole-body turnover after short-term early 6-hr TRE compared to a conventional 12-hr dietary regimen in women.\n\nPrimary Aim 2: Quantify CD4+ T cell responses after short-term early 6-hr TRE compared to a conventional 12-hr dietary regimen in women.\n\nSecondary Aim 1: Determine metabolic response to short-term early 6-hr TRE in lean women vs women with obesity.\n\nSecondary Aim 2: Determine immunomodulatory effects of short-term early 6-hr TRE in lean women vs women with obesity.\n\nExploratory Aim 1: Evaluate ketone body, hormonal, and cardiometabolic responses after short-term early 6-hr TRE compared to a conventional 12-hr dietary regimen in women classified as lean and with obesity.\n\nExploratory Aim 2: Evaluate effects of short-term early 6-hr TRE on perceived appetite, stress, and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary:\n\n1. Change from admission day 0 in ketone body (beta-OHB) rate of appearance (Ra) after three days of 6-hr TRE\n2. Change from admission in CD4+ T cell responsiveness (Th17 polarization) after three days of 6-hr TRE\n\nSecondary:\n\n1. Change from admission day 0 in post-absorptive glucose Ra quantified using \\[6,6-2H2\\]glucose (intravenous) after three days 6- hr TRE\n2. Change from admission day 0 in ketone body Ra in lean vs. obese women after three days 6-hr TRE\n3. CD4+ T cell responsiveness (Th17 polarization) in lean vs. obese women after three days 6-hr TRE\n4. Evaluation of ketone biology in isolated CD4+ T cells, using biochemical analysis and analysis of metabolic reprograming at the gene regulatory level\n\nExploratory:\n\n1. Circulating ketone body concentrations at admission day 0 and after 3 days of TRE\n2. Hormonal mediators of metabolic status (morning cortisol, fasting insulin and glucagon/incretins, thyroid hormones, sex hormone binding globulin, anti-mullerian hormone)\n3. Cardiometabolic biomarkers (glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory; trimethylamine N-oxide\\[TMAO\\])\n4. Perceived appetite, stress, and gastrointestinal symptom scores"

Caffeine consumption in excess of approximately 300 mg (approximately three 8-oz cups of coffee) daily\n4. Factors that affect circadian rhythms including individuals who perform overnight shift work, report irregular sleep and/or eating schedules, and who regularly fast for more than 15 hours/day\n5. History of an eating disorder by self-report or medical history\n6. Food allergies/intolerances or dietary patterns that would prohibit consumption of metabolic diet\n7. Inability to provide informed consent\n8. Pregnancy or lactation\n9. Unstable weight with more than 5% body weight change in last previous 3 months\n10.

The study design was informed by our Protocol NCT04728165 which investigates an identical 6:18h TRE intervention in males who are healthy and those with psoriasis.
