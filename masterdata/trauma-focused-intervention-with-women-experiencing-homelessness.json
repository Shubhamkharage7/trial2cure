            "detailedDescription": "Homelessness and associated traumas disproportionately affect women. The biopsychosocial health consequences of untreated trauma are profound. PTSD frequently co-occurs with other chronic health conditions, including substance use disorders (SUD). Co-morbid PTSD and SUD (PTSD+SUD) is common and difficult to treat, resulting in severe morbidity and premature mortality among women experiencing homelessness. We have systematically adapted a trauma-focused intervention protocol (Narrative Exposure Therapy \\[NET\\]) to the self-identified needs and preferences of trauma-affected women experiencing homelessness. This adapted intervention, \"NET+\", incorporates strengths and preferences identified by women themselves, embedding principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) into conventional NET. NET+ aims to both employ core NET principles to re-process past trauma in parallel with building present-centered skills to address avoidant coping motives in PTSD+SUD. Via a pragmatic, waitlist randomized controlled trial, we will further assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a 3-week NET+ intervention protocol with up to 100 women experiencing homelessness. We will determine pre- and post-NET+ intervention PTSD and trauma-related symptom scores (depression, anxiety, somatization, sleep), substance use behaviors, and effect sizes. Executing this study will help to address the disproportionate PTSD+SUD comorbidity burden, which drives health inequities in the growing population of women experiencing homelessness within and beyond Chicago."
