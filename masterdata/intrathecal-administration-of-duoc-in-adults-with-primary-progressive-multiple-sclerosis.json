            "briefSummary": "This study is a prospective Phase 1a open-label single- center trial. It will assess the safety of intrathecal administration of DUOC-01 cells to adults with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS). DUOC-01 is a population of cells expanded from donated human umbilical cord blood cells and is intended for treatment of neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases. There will be approximately 20 participants enrolled. Exploratory objectives include changes in MS assessment scores, changes in brain MRI findings, and changes in blood biomarkers.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective phase 1a open-label, single center trial. It is designed to assess the safety of administration of escalating doses of DUOC-01 intrathecally to adults with PPMS. DUOC-01 is a population of cells expanded from donated human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells. Immunodepletion and selection studies demonstrated that DUOC-01 cells are derived from CB CD14+ monocytes. Based on pre-clinical rodent models, this cell product is considered a candidate for the treatment of injury-induced Central Nervous System (CNS) demyelination and modulation of neuroinflammation.\n\nApproximately 20 participants will be enrolled. DUOC-01 will be infused into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal infusion). The first 3 subjects will receive a single dose of 10 million cells (cohort 1). The next 3 subjects will receive a single intrathecal dose of \\>10 to 25 million cells (cohort 2), if manufacturing of this yield is reliable. The final 14 patients will receive a single intrathecal dose of \\>25 to 50 million cells (cohort 3), if manufacturing of this yield is reliable. Subjects will be followed for 12 months post administration.\n\nParticipants will be identified and screened for eligibility for the study. HLA typing will be performed on the participant, and once results become available, several \\>4/6 matched cord blood units (CBUs) will be selected from the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank (CCBB), an FDA licensed public cord blood bank at Duke University in Durham, NC. Cord blood units will have complete donor screening and testing per banking regulations.\n\nThe frozen CBU will be transferred to the GMP manufacturing facility at Duke University Medical Center per standard practice. Production, testing and release of DUOC-01 will take 19-21 days. Within 14 days prior to planned administration, subjects will receive a baseline brain MRI and be re-screened on MS assessments. Subjects will not be infused with DUOC-01 cells if they no longer meet inclusion criteria or if no qualifying DUOC-01 cells are available. If there is a failure of DUOC-01 manufacturing, a second cord blood unit, if available, will be utilized for repeat manufacturing.\n\nDUOC-01 administration will occur by a trained clinician. A lumbar puncture (insertion of a needle into the lower back, into the cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF)) will be performed and baseline CSF samples will be obtained. The DUOC-01 product will be injected into the CSF (intrathecally) and appropriate monitoring will be performed.\n\nPost administration, all subjects will remain in the hospital for 24-hour observation. At 2 weeks post administration subjects will participate in a virtual visit to evaluate for adverse events. Subjects will receive follow up visits with functional evaluation, biomarker sampling and brain MRI at 3, 6 and 12 months."
