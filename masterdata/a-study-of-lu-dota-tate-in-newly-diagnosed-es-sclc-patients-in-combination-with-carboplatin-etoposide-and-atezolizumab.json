            "detailedDescription": "The study for each participant consists of a Screening period, a Treatment period that includes an Induction treatment period and a Maintenance treatment period, and a Follow-up period.\n\nThe study will consist of a Phase Ib dose escalation with concurrent backfill part and a randomised controlled Phase II part.\n\nDuring the screening period of up to 28 days before starting SCLC treatment, each participant will be assessed for somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression by \\[68Ga\\]Ga-DOTA-TATE imaging PET/scan.\n\nThe dose escalation part in this study will be guided by the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate observed during the DLT period. To achieve a more robust dataset and to aid dose decisions, additional participants may be backfilled in each dose level.\n\nUpon dedclaring RD, a 1:1 randomised Phase II with approximately 140 participants with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC will be enrolled and receive either \\[177Lu\\]Lu-DOTA-TATE at the RD in combination with carboplatin, etoposide and atezolizumab (experimental arm) or carboplatin, etoposide and atezolizumab alone (control arm)."
