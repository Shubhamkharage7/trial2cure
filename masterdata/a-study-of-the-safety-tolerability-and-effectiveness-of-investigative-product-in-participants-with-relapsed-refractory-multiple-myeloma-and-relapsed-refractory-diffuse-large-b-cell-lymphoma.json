This study will also include participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).\n\nDLBCL is also a type of cancer of the blood. They are referred to as 'relapsed' when the disease has come back after treatment and 'refractory' when treatment no longer works. The study has 2 main parts, called phase 1 and phase 1b. The main objective of both parts will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug, called EZM0414.\n\nThe main objective of phase 1b will also be to determine the effectiveness of EZM0414. During phase 1 six dose levels will be tested to obtain the most tolerated dose. Participants will receive study drug at the assigned dose level every 28 days. During phase 1b participants will receive study drug at the maximum tolerated dose in 28-day cycles.",
            "detailedDescription": "The first part of the study will be a Phase 1 dose-escalation designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of EZM0414 in subjects with R/R MM and R/R DLBCL.\n\nSix dose levels starting at 100 mg, then 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg as well as an optional step-down dose of 75 mg (if needed) will be tested. The second part of the study is the Phase 1b dose expansion at the MTD designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in subjects with R/R DLBCL and R/R MM with or without select genetic translocation.\n\nDose expansion will enroll subjects in 3 cohorts: Cohort 1 for R/R MM subjects with t(4;14), Cohort 2 for R/R MM subjects without t(4;14), and Cohort 3 for subjects with R/R DLBCL."
