Specifically, user-centered design methodologies and an implementation science framework will be used to guide the development and implementation of the Teen Assess, Check, and Heal (TeACH) System into a pediatric primary care clinic serving teens and families from underserved communities.\n\nStudy objectives include:\n\n1. Collaborating with underserved teens and their parents to identify strategies to target top barriers to engagement as well as top ethical concerns and requirements for cultural relevance, usability, and usefulness of the TeACH System (Phase 1)\n2. Refining the plan for implementing the TeACH System through observations, interviews, and co-design workshops with pediatric primary care pediatricians and staff (Phase 2), and\n3. Implementing the TeACH System into a primary care clinics and evaluating it in a randomized trial. (Phase 3)\n\nThe team will measure engagement outcomes and satisfaction with the TeACH System."
