The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 If the integrated intervention increase PrEP uptake and adherence compared to standard treatment\n\nParticipants will\n\n* receive provision of PrEP information through 4 counseling sessions\n* prevention navigation\n* receive nurse practitioner prescribed PrEP in an addiction treatment setting\n\nResearchers will compare intervention group with standard treatment to see if the integrated intervention help increase PrEP uptake and adherence"
