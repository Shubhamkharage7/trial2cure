The two different materials of crowns are esthetic crowns with retentive grooves and without retentive crowns. These crowns are placed on the teeth to restore function, esthetics and prevent further caries and infection.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are many treatment options available for restoring primary anterior teeth. A clinician's decision to opt for any specific treatment option is based on multiple factors such as the clinician's liking of a specific material or method, esthetic demands by parents, the child's behavior, and moisture and hemorrhage control. Out of many treatment options, preformed zirconia crowns for primary teeth have been available for over a decade. There is insufficient research that compares the success of anterior pediatric zirconia crowns with and without retentive grooves."
