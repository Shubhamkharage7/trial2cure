The treatment group involved in the study received OviTex PRS during implant-based breast reconstruction. The reconstruction procedure was an immediate or two-stage unilateral or bilateral implant in either the sub-pectoral or pre-pectoral position. Results from this study are aimed to demonstrate an acceptable safety profile and to inform the study design and effectiveness endpoints of a future prospective study."
