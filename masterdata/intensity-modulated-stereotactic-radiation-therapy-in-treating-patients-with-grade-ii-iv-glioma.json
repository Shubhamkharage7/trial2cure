To determine the effect of intensity-modulated (IM)-stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) on the incidence of wound infection (requiring oral/intravenous \\[IV\\] antibiotics or surgery), or wound dehiscence.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the effect of IM-SRT on the incidence of titanium implants as palpable cranial defects due to scalp thinning.\n\nII. To determine the effect of IM-SRT on the incidence of hair loss and recovery rate.\n\nIII. To determine the effect on quality of life (QoL) using European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if treatment of Intensity-modulated stereotactic radiotherapy (IM-SRT) in patients with newly diagnosed grade II-IV gliomas can decrease the loss of scalp thickness in the coronal plane in T-1W magnetic resonance (MR) images."
