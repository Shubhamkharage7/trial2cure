The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REM-422 in patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC. The purpose of Dose Expansion is to further evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of the RP2D carried forward from Dose Escalation.\n\nParticipation in this study will continue until disease progression, therapy intolerance, or participant withdrawal."

Participants with malabsorption syndrome, a disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or bowel.\n12. Current use of prohibited medication \u2264 1 week before starting REM-422.\n13. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease:\n14. Participants who have undergone major surgery (opening a mesenchymal barrier such as the pleural cavity, peritoneum, meninges, or surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia) \\< 4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n15. History of organ transplant that requires use of immunosuppressive agents.\n16. History or current autoimmune disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus).\n17. Radiation therapy \u2264 7 days prior to the start of REM-422.\n18. Concurrent or previous other malignancy (other than adenoid cystic carcinoma, hematologic malignancies, or primary central nervous system \\[CNS\\] malignancies) \u2264 2 years of enrollment, except curatively treated malignancies including basal or squamous cell skin cancer, prostate intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n19. Participants receiving any other investigational treatment for any indication \u2264 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n20. Unwillingness or inability to follow protocol requirements.\n21.
