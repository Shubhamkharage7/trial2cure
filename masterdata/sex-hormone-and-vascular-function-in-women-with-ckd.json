            "briefSummary": "The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is significantly elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Notably, women with CKD commonly experience menstrual disturbances induced by CKD, which may contribute to impaired vascular function and elevated CVD risk. However, most of the literature in the field of nephrology focuses on male patients, and studies on women's vascular health are limited. Moreover, endogenous sex hormones, particularly estradiol, are well-documented to be cardioprotective in women without CKD; however, the role of sex hormones on vascular function in women with CKD remains unclear. The goals of the proposed project are: 1) to evaluate vasuclar function in pre- and post-menopausal women with CKD vs. age-matched healthy women; 2) to evaluate sex hormone concentrations and determine whether they associate with vascular function in the proposed cohort; and 3) to gain mechanistic insight on the association between sex hormones and vascular dysfunction in the proposed cohort."
