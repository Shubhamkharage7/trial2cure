Epidiolex\u00ae, an oral cannabidiol (CBD) solution, is the first ever cannabis-derived medication to be approved by the Food \\& Drug Administration. Our aim is to conduct a pilot study using a placebo oral solution, 400mg and 800mg Epidiolex\u00ae to gather data on its effects on patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty (BTKA). We will be estimating whether Epidiolex\u00ae is associated with minimal opioid use and adequate analgesia. We will also assess its tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on inflammatory markers in the perioperative setting."
