It is important to understand disease progression in CLN6 disease to be able to judge therapeutic efficacy as emerging therapies like gene therapy become available.",
            "detailedDescription": "Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) is the most common childhood neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent waxy lipopigments in the brain and other tissues. The symptoms manifest as blindness, seizures, ataxia, myoclonus and loss of milestones or dementia. This group of disorders caused by an intracellular accumulation of lipopigment (ceroid lipofuscin) material leads to neuronal death and is the most prevalent class of childhood neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThere are 14 types of NCL with 13 genotypes. Most of these are autosomal recessive. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, type 6 usually present like a late infantile NCL (CLN2) but can also present at as a juvenile onset (Mole). The natural history is not well established and the presentation maybe variable. There are currently no published data on the disease progression of children with CLN6 disease\n\nCLN6 is a rare, neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive loss of acquired skills with motor delay, visual loss, seizures and ataxia. The investigators propose a natural history study of this rare disorder since it is currently unknown. Although there are descriptions of the clinical spectrum, the natural history has not been well described. It is important to understand disease progression in CLN6 disease to be able to judge therapeutic efficacy for as emerging therapies like gene therapy become available. The investigators will identify children with a genotypic diagnosis of CLN6 who are consulting Nationwide Children's hospital. The investigators will also recruit patients through family conferences of Batten's disease Support and Research association. The investigators propose a retro prospective chart review and longitudinal phone follow-up of with diagnosis of CLN6 to understand the onset and progression of this disease.\n\nCLN6 is a rare, neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive loss of acquired skills with motor delay, visual loss, seizures and ataxia.

Assess the natural history of CLN6 by performing a prospective, longitudinal chart review and phone follow-up of patients who have a diagnosis of Batten's disease, with a specific genotype of CLN6.\n2. To promote better understanding of this disease to compare therapeutic efficacy with emerging therapies"
