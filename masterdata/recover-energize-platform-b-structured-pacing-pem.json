Each appendix will leverage all elements of the platform protocol, with additional elements described in the individual appendix. Study intervention appendices may be added or removed according to adaptive design and/or emerging evidence.\n\nThe platform protocol enrolls participants who meet study eligibility criteria. After completing initial screening assessments, eligible participants are assigned to one of the study intervention appendices that are actively enrolling. Participants must meet certain criteria within a specific appendix in order to be included in that appendix. Once assigned to an appendix, eligible participants are randomized to either the study intervention group or a control group."
