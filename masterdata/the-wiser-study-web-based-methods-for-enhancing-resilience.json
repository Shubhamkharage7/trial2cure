The tools ask participants to reflect on positive experiences or to do an activity (e.g., write a letter of gratitude). The study is entirely online and participants will be prompted to participate via email or text messages.\n\nThe study team is interested in the effects of the tools on stress, depression, and burnout in adults. A set of brief surveys are administered before and after using the tool, and again at follow-up periods (e.g., 1, 3, 6 and 12 months). Surveys are collected electronically using the secure, HIPAA-compliant survey software.\n\nThere is no direct benefit to participants for participating in this research study aside from the potential to experience improvements in well-being. Risks are minimal and include the potential to feel emotional or psychological distress when asked questions related to burnout."

The investigators are targeting healthcare workers for recruitment in the study, but adults 18+ are eligible to participate in any of these tools. Identification as a healthcare worker or not is part of data collection in every tool.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults who are not proficient in English, do not have basic computer skills, or who have prohibitive vision or hearing disabilities will be excluded from this study as they will be incapable of full participation in the intervention and/or the survey process.",
