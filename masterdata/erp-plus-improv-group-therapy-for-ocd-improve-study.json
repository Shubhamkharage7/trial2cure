ERP is the gold-standard treatment for OCD. Improv comedy is a type of theater in which actors perform without a script. This study aims to evaluate whether the intervention is helpful for reducing OCD symptoms and intolerance of uncertainty (a mechanism maintaining OCD). It will also explore whether the intervention is feasible and acceptable.\n\nDuring the group therapy sessions, participants will engage with improv comedy exercises that have been adapted to function as exposures for different types of OCD. Participants will:\n\n* attend an ERP + improv group therapy intervention (90-minute sessions for 12 weeks)\n* complete homework in-between sessions\n* answer questions\n* complete questionnaires."
