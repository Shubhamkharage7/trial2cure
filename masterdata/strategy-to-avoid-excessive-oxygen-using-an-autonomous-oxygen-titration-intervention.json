            "briefSummary": "This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a closed loop/autonomous oxygen titration system (O2matic PRO100) to maintain normoxemia (goal range SpO2 90-96%, target 93%) during the first 72 hours of acute injury or illness, compared to standard provider-driven methods (manual titration with SpO2 target of 90-96%).",
            "detailedDescription": "Ensuring adequate oxygenation is a primary goal in surgical and medical patients to treat and prevent morbidity associated with hypoxemia. However, excessive oxygen administration resulting in hyperoxemia is common, leading to unnecessary utilization of supplemental oxygen, which is a particularly limited resource in austere settings. Building on the previous Strategy to Avoid Excessive Oxygen (SAVE-O2) clinical trials1 (Trauma: NCT045349559; Burn: NCT04534972), the investigators seek to determine effective strategies to implement a targeted normoxemia approach to avoid both hyperoxemia and hypoxemia and reduce supplemental oxygen use, using the PRO100 closed loop/autonomous oxygen system. This research is critical for both military and civilian care settings in determining the effectiveness of an autonomous oxygen system to use to 1) reduce harm associated with both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia and 2) reduce excess use of oxygen.\n\nObjectives: the investigators propose the following two objectives:\n\nDetermine the effectiveness of an autonomous oxygen titration system to improve normoxemia and reduce hypoxemia and hyperoxemia in acutely injured and ill patients receiving supplemental oxygen. The investigators will compare patient-hours spent in normoxemia (SpO2 90-96%), hypoxemia (SpO2 \\<88%), and hyperoxemia (SpO2 \\>96%) among patients randomized to autonomous vs manual oxygen titration.\n\nDetermine the impact of an autonomous oxygen titration system on overall utilization of supplemental oxygen. The investigators will compare the total volume of supplemental oxygen administered to patients randomized to autonomous vs manual oxygen titration during the 72-hour intervention period.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the use of an autonomous oxygen titration system will be more effective at maintaining normoxemia and reducing time spent in hypoxemia/hyperoxemia than standard manual titration in non-mechanically ventilated patients and will reduce the overall use of supplemental oxygen."

The SpO2 range programmed into the PRO100 is 92-94%. The acceptable SpO2 range for the protocol is 90-96%. If a patient requires \\>15lpm or other signs of advancing respiratory failure, they will be taken off the autonomous oxygen and transitioned to higher flow oxygen devices or mechanical ventilation per usual clinical care. If the patient is not receiving any supplemental oxygen per the autonomous titration, the clinical team may remove the oxygen delivery device from the patient, but the patient should remain connected to the PRO100 for the duration of the intervention period for data collection and to monitor for new supplemental oxygen needs.",
