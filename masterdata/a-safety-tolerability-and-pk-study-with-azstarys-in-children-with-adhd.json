The starting dose of Azstarys\u00ae in the Treatment Phase will be the same as the optimized dose of Azstarys\u00ae at the end of the Dose Optimization Phase, either 13.1 mg/2.6 mg, 26.1/5.2 mg, or 39.2 mg/7.8 mg per day. The daily dose may be changed at any time to any of the allowed dose levels (13.1 mg/2.6 mg, 26.1/5.2 mg, or 39.2 mg/7.8 mg per day) at the Investigator' discretion, based on individual tolerability and dose response."
