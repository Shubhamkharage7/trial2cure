            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to discover brain-based subtypes of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and examine treatment response to two different repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targets in the brain: the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC).",
            "detailedDescription": "New interventions are urgently needed to treat obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), as more than 25% of patients show no improvement with the standard of care. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising alternative treatment, as it uses focused magnetic field pulses to stimulate specific brain areas. So far, medial and right prefrontal cortex stimulation targets have consistent evidence of efficacy in OCD. Patients often show a strong response to one target but not the other. It is not well understood why some patients respond, while others do not. So far, there are no biomarkers for predicting treatment response, identifying the optimal neuroanatomical target, or choosing between treatments.\n\nThe goal of this clinical trial is OCD subtype discovery and treatment optimization. Using MRI scans of OCD patients before and after rTMS treatment we aim to:\n\n* Define novel network-based subtypes of OCD that can be diagnosed in individual patients and differentiated from healthy controls;\n* Identify characteristic functional connectivity profiles predictive of response to MPFC-rTMS versus rPFC-rTMS;\n* Identify characteristic changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) associated with symptom improvement for OCD patients undergoing MPFC- and rPFC-rTMS."
