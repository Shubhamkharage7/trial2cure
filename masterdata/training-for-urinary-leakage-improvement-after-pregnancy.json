Arm 1 consists of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). Arm 2 uses a home biofeedback device (leva\u00ae).\n\nThe primary outcome will be assessed at 6 months postpartum by blinded outcomes assessors, and follow-up will continue until 12 months postpartum.",

Arm 1 consists of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) sessions with a skilled interventionist. Arm 2 uses a home biofeedback device (leva\u00ae).\n\nAll groups will have access to basic education on stress urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, pelvic floor muscle function and continence mechanisms.\n\nArm 1 will consist of interventionist-guided training at baseline (approximately 6 weeks postpartum), followed by a Home Exercise Prescription (HEP), a second interventionist-guided training session (approximately 4 weeks later), and then continued HEP until 12 months postpartum. Home exercises will be encouraged using a PFDN research smartphone app, resources to help participants with home exercises and prompts for participants to confirm the number of exercise sets completed.\n\nArm 2 will consist of home pelvic floor exercises guided by the leva\u00ae device and its accompanying app/software for gradually increasing strength and duration of pelvic floor contractions until 12 months postpartum. As in Arm 1, the PFDN research smartphone app resources to help participants with home exercises and prompts for participants to confirm the number of exercise sets completed.\n\nArm 3 participants will only be provided basic education materials. No specific prescription or verbal direction will be given regarding the suggested number and frequency of home pelvic floor muscle exercises.\n\nThe primary outcome is change in UI as measured by the ICIQ-SF, comparing scores from baseline to 6 months postpartum. The questionnaire will be sent to participants monthly from baseline through 12 months postpartum.\n\nSecondary outcomes include assessments of 1) a broader spectrum of lower urinary tract symptoms, particularly incontinence, bladder pain, and post-micturition symptoms (LURN-SI-10), 2) The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), 3) anal incontinence will be assessment using the St. Mark's questionnaire, 4) Sexual function/dysfunction using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), 5) a Health Utility Measure: EuroQOL 5D (EQ-5D), 6) changes in physical examination findings: POP-Q, PFM integrity, strength, and pain and 7) adherence to Interventionist PFMT (Arm 1) or Home Biofeedback (Arm 2)."
