            "briefSummary": "A Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in patients who are hospitalized with presumed pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AV-001 Injection administration daily to the earlier of day 28 or EOT (day prior to hospital discharge). A total of 120 eligible patients (20 patients in each of cohort 1, 2 and 3 and 60 patients in cohort 4) will be recruited from up to 25 participating institutions/hospitals. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either AV-001 Injection or AV-001 placebo Injection, together with standard of care (SOC).",
            "detailedDescription": "Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization among adults and children in the United States and has ranked among the top 10 causes of death according to the CDC. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia including respiratory viruses, bacteria and fungi and there are great geographic variations in their prevalence. In the United States, common causes of viral pneumonia are SARS-CoV-2, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and bacterial pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with typical ARDS, with or without COVID-19 are broadly similar in contrast to earlier reports that suggested COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features. SOC for patients with ARDS remains limited with current interventions that focus primarily on supportive therapy, including fluid management strategies and further injury prevention via lung protective ventilation. Ventilation approaches remain the cornerstone in the treatment of ARDS and approaches to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) resulting from the imposition of stretch-trauma to the lung, continue to be a major focus of clinical importance. Several techniques may be utilized to accomplish this objective. Clinical guidelines strongly recommend volume-limited or pressure-limited ventilator approaches for patients with severe ARDS and high positive-end expiratory pressure strategies for patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Despite decades of improving supportive care, mortality remains high, ranging from 34.9% of patients with mild ARDS to 46.1% of patients with severe ARDS.\n\nWhatever the causative organism it is increasingly apparent that their impact on lung microvasculature is a major contributing factor to morbidity and mortality associated with those infections. Most deaths from influenza virus infections occur due to pulmonary complications, in particular the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), that is due to increased permeability of the lung microvasculature. Emerging evidence in COVID-19 infections suggest a similar pathophysiology where pulmonary endothelial cells and vascular dysfunction contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering blood vessel integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing endotheliitis and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a therapeutic intervention that could modulate the course of pulmonary disease not by treating the causative organism but by reducing the deleterious inflammatory sequalae of those infections may have a significant positive impact\n\nAV-001 is a synthetic Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) mimetic that has been shown to activate the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase; a transmembrane protein target most highly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in the vasculature. The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals, Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation. As such, homeostatic activation results in the promotion of barrier defense against vascular leakage.\n\nA total of 120 eligible patients (20 patients each in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 and 60 patients in cohort 4) will be recruited from participating institutions / hospitals. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either AV-001 Injection or AV-001 placebo Injection, together with SOC. All patients will receive supportive care according to the SOC for the trial site hospital likely to include remdesivir and or dexamethasone. Study drug will be administered by bolus IV injection (\\< 60 seconds). Doses of AV-001 Injection to be administered will start with the lowest proposed dose of 12.5 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 1 (DL1) and are anticipated to increase to 25 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 2 (DL2), 56 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 3 (DL3) and to be determined (TBD) based on recommendation from the DSMB for cohort 4 (DL4). The dose for cohort 4 will be chosen based on available safety and efficacy data obtained from all patients completing DL1, DL2 and DL3. DL4 may be an intermediate dose level, repeat of an earlier dose level (DL1, DL2, or DL3) or expansion of earlier dose level cohort (DL1, DL2, or DL3). Based on emerging data, a decision to enroll a fifth cohort (n=20 to increase the sample size to n=140) may also be made for the purpose of investigating an intermediate dose level, evaluating effects in patients with a different baseline Clinical Progression Scale (CPS) score or to provide comparative data regarding AV-001 Injection in patients with other respiratory viruses.\n\nThe study population for this Phase 2a study will consist of male and non-pregnant female patients, \u2265 18 years of age, hospitalized with presumed pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial infection with acute onset to a respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen therapy."
