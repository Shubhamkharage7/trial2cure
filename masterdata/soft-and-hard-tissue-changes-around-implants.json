            "briefSummary": "Our long-term goal is to generate evidence for the creation of successful implant restorations and ideal supporting tissues in adequate health by utilizing patient-tailored implant protocols such as the use of customized computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) healing abutments. With this study, the investigators intend to recruit patients requiring a single implant placement and implant crown in molar areas. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the control group that will receive standard healing abutments or the test control group that will receive customized CAD/CAM healing abutments. Patients will be followed for six months after the delivery of the implant crowns. The central hypothesis is that the use of customized CAD/CAM healing abutments will demonstrate improved outcomes in terms of hard and soft tissue volume stability and clinical parameters as compared to the use of standard healing abutments.\n\nAim 1 will measure soft and hard tissue changes around dental implants when customized CAD/CAM healing abutments are utilized as compared to standard healing abutments. Soft tissue stability will be measured utilizing intraoral digital scans, while osseous levels will be measured utilizing CBCT scans. Soft and hard tissue volumetric and linear changes will be measured by digital scan superimposition at the time of crown delivery and 6 months thereafter. Volumetric and linear changes will be compared within each group at different time points and between the test and control group to determine if the use of customized CAD/CAM healing abutments is advantageous in terms of maintaining peri-implant soft and hard tissue stability.\n\nAim 2 will assess different clinical measurements around dental implants to analyze if the use of customized CAD/CAM healing abutments will demonstrate improved plaque control and peri-implant health as compared to standard healing abutments. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depths (PD), and bleeding on probing (BOP) will be obtained at the time of crown delivery and at 3 and 6 months. Clinical measurements will be compared between the test and control group to determine if the use of customized CAD/CAM healing abutments will aid in obtaining a natural looking restoration that would result in improved clinical parameters that measure peri-implant health.\n\nAim 3 will compare the degree of patient satisfaction using a visual analogue scale (VAS) in patients that received an implant restoration following the use of a customized CAD/CAM healing abutment as compared to standard healing abutments. Patients will complete a VAS questionnaire that will evaluate patient perception of pain, esthetics, ability to chew, and ability to clean. Scores will be compared among groups to evaluate if there is a difference in patient-centered outcomes when customized healing abutments are used as compared to standard healing abutments."
