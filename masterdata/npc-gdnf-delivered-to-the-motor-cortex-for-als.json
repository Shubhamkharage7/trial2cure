            "briefSummary": "The investigator is examining the safety of transplanting cells, that have been engineered to produce a growth factor, into the motor cortex (brain) of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The cells are called neural progenitor cells, which are a type of stem cell that can become several different types of cells in the nervous system. These cells have been derived to specifically become astrocytes, which is a type of neural cell. The growth factor is called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF. GDNF is a protein that promotes the survival of many types of neural cells. Therefore, the cells are called \"CNS10-NPC-GDNF.\" The investigational treatment has been tested in people by delivering it to the spinal cord. However, it has only been delivered to the motor cortex of animals. In this study, we want to learn if CNS10-NPC-GDNF cells are safe to transplant into the motor cortex (brain) of people.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be the first to use a genetically modified progenitor cell line delivered to the motor cortex to treat a neurodegenerative disease. This is a Phase 1/2a, single-center, safety study of two escalating doses of human neural progenitor cells expressing GDNF (CNS10-NPC-GDNF) delivered unilaterally to the \"hand-knob\" area of the motor cortex of patients with ALS.\n\nSubjects meeting all Eligibility Criteria and providing Informed Consent will be enrolled in one of three sequential dosing groups. Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of one month interval between surgeries for the first three subjects in each dosing cohort. The remaining subjects in the cohort will be treated with a minimum interval of at least one week between surgeries.\n\nPrimary Outcome:\n\nSafety, as evaluated by:\n\n* Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events\n* Post-op MRI and/or CT (with contrast) and as clinically indicated"
