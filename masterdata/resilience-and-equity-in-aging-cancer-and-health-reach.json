            "detailedDescription": "This research study will be conducted in three phases:\n\n* Phase 1 - Needs assessment and implementation plan\n* Phase 2 - Pilot Intervention\n* Phase 3 - Expanded Clinical Trial\n\n  * Please note Phase 2 - Pilot Intervention and Phase 3 - Expanded Clinical Trial will be added to the clinicaltrials.gov record once Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved.\n\nPhase 1 is composed of three aims and will inform the subsequent two phases:.\n\n* Aim 1: To evaluate the perceived needs of Older Adults diagnosed with gastrointestinal malignancies, caregivers, staff, and faculty to characterize the implementation setting for a geriatric consultation.\n* Aim 2: To refine the proposed REACH program implementation plan based on qualitative feedback provided by Older Adult (OA) patients, their identified caregivers, staff, and faculty.\n* Aim 3: Determine the patient, demographic, social determinants, clinical and disease characteristics of Older Adults (OA) associated with ED visits/hospitalization following initial oncology consultation at DF/BWCC in year 2019.\n* Phase 2 intervention has started as of January 2022 following IRB approval. Study team has begun recruiting participants into Phase 2 intervention of REACH study starting in January 2022. Participants approached by REACH coordinator for consenting and enrollment after their initial consult visit at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center (DF/BWCC). Participants are then asked to complete an electronic fitness assessment (EFA) that is sent to them via Patient Gateway. Participants complete this questionnaire and receive a score of \"Robust\", \"Pre-frail\", or \"Frail\" - those who score \"Pre-frail\" or \"Frail\" will be randomized to meet with a study geriatrician for geriatric co-management intervention alongside their standard oncology care. All enrolled participants will be followed for a duration of 1 year as they are continuing care at DF/BWCC."
