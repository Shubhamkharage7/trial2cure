Eligible participants will be randomized to one of three experimental conditions that will vary based on cigarillo warning format.\n\nFor 4 weeks, participants will participate in an image-sorting task where they will be asked to sort a set of \\~18 cigarillo packages into flavor categories determined a priori by the research team (e.g., Mint, Fruit, Dessert).\n\nAt the end of the study, participants will be notified of the purpose of the study and provided links to resources with information about the harms of cigarillo smoking and cessation.\n\nThe study will be conducted in an online survey, working with Qualtrics research company, who will program the survey, recruit and screen participants, and administer the survey."
