            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to test the safety and effectiveness of the investigational combination of anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1 antibody therapy with or without LAG-3 inhibition (pembrolizumab or nivolumab+relatlimab) and infliximab in treating metastatic melanoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 clinical trial that combines anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1 antibody therapy with or without LAG-3 inhibition (pembrolizumab or nivolumab+relatlimab) with the anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-\u03b1 antibody infliximab as first line treatment for the management of patients with metastatic or recurrent melanoma.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved infliximab for metastatic melanoma but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved pembrolizumab as a treatment option for metastatic melanoma. The FDA has approved nivolumab+relatlimab as a treatment option for metastatic melanoma.\n\nPembrolizumab is a blocking antibody (a protein used in the immune system to identity and neutralize bacteria, viruses, and other foreign pathogens) that binds to PD-1 (a protein that helps regulate the immune system's response in the body) and blocks the interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 (proteins that inhibits the body's immune response). By blocking this interaction, it might lead to an anti-tumor immune response that may decrease tumor growth.\n\nRelatlimab is believed to work by attaching to and blocking a molecule called Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3 (LAG-3). LAG-3 is a protein that is present on different types of cells in the immune system and controls parts of the immune system by shutting it down. Scientists believe that one way cancers escape the immune system is by shutting it down. Antibodies that block LAG-3 can potentially prevent LAG-3 from shutting down the immune system, thus allowing it to recognize and help the body destroy the cancer cells.\n\nNivolumab is believed to work by attaching to and blocking a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a protein that is present on different types of cells in the immune system and controls parts of the immune system by shutting it down. Antibodies that block PD-1 can potentially prevent PD-1 from shutting down the immune system, thus allowing it to recognize and help the body destroy the cancer cells.\n\nInfliximab is an anti-TNF\u03b1 agent (an antibody that blocks certain inflammatory hormones) that may interact with irEC (immune related (entero)colitis - inflammation that occurs in the digestive tract) which can develop among people with advanced melanoma. Anti- TNF\u03b1 agents have shown to lead to rapid symptomatic improvement. By combining anti-PD-1 antibody therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab+relatlimab) and infliximab we believe it may lead to reduced immune related side effects while increasing effective anti-tumor immune response.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits. Participants will be randomized to receive either a) anti-PD-1 antibody therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab+relatlimab) plus infliximab or b) anti-PD-1 antibody therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab+relatlimab) plus placebo (an intravenous solution without medication). Participants will receive study treatment for as long as their disease does not worsen, they do not experience any unacceptable side effects, or they have completed the two years of anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. Participants will then be followed until the study doctor determines follow-up is no longer needed or until participant withdrawal. It is expected that about 36 people will take part in this research study A research grant, The Bridge Project, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the study."

Ongoing or active infection\n  * B. Edema \\> Grade 1\n  * C. Documented myocardial infarction or unstable/uncontrolled cardiac disease (eg, unstable angina, severe arrhythmias, congestive heart failure \\[New York Heart Association (NYHA) \\> Class II\\]) within 6 months of study entry\n  * D. Arterial thrombosis or vascular ischemic events, such as transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, within 6 months prior to study entry\n  * E. Serious or non-healing wound\n  * F. History of any medical condition including cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), that in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risks associated with study participation or study treatments or may interfere with the conduct of the study or interpretation of study results\n  * G. Psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements\n  * H. An elevated high-sensitivity troponin T level at baseline will be allowable as long as the patient has no evidence of active, clinically relevant cardiac disease.\n* Patients with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances:\n\n  * A. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy\n  * B. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer in situ and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n* Patients with a history of Hepatitis B infection (HBsAg reactive or HBCAB reactive) or Hepatitis C (HCV RNA is detected). Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may be enrolled if they have been treated and cured\n* Patients with a history of latent or active granulomatous infection, including tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or coccidiomycosis\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy\n* Current bacterial infection requiring antibiotic treatment, or systemic fungal infection\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or relatlimab or any of its excipients\n* Previous adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to infliximab\n* Any prior immune-related adverse event while on adjuvant anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy with the following exceptions: any endocrine toxicity, any grade 1 or 2 toxicity that completely resolved; if there is uncertainty about the grade of prior toxicity, this will be adjudicated by the PI.",
