Current physical stats like height and weight.\n  2. Reproductive history, including pregnancies and childbirths in recent years.\n  3. Details about any IVF treatments.\n  4. Current status of conditions such as PCOS, Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.\n* Be invited for a physical examination that includes:\n\n  1. Measurements such as height, weight, blood pressure, and body circumferences.\n  2. Laboratory tests for endocrine and metabolic conditions.\n  3. Ultrasound scans of the ovaries and liver."
