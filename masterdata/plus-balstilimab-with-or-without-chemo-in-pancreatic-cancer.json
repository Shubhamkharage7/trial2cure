            "detailedDescription": "The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\n* Participants will receive study treatment for about 2 years and will be followed for 1 year. If the combination is considered to be safe and tolerable, and objective response is achieved in at least 2 patients, the study will proceed to Cohort 2.\n* This research study involves immunotherapy. The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n* AGEN1423\n* Balstilimab\n\nIt is expected that about 24 people will take part in this part of this research\n\nThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AGEN1423 as a treatment for any disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Balstilimab as a treatment for any disease.\n\nAgenus, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding and study drug for the research study."

Note: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging using the identical imaging modality for each assessment, either MRI or computerized tomography (CT) scan, for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 14 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of the planned start of study therapy. Seasonal flu vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.\n* Drainage of ascitic or pleural fluid 2 or more times in the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug or permanent drain in place (eg, PleurX\u00ae) for ascites or pleural effusion symptom management.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition of AGEN1423 or balstilimab.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.",
