Patients with tumors demonstrating a positive PK Response (in Arm A) or a positive PD Response (in Arm B) of the Phase 0 component of the study will graduate to a therapeutic expansion phase that combines therapeutic dosing of niraparib plus standard-of-care fractionated radiotherapy (in Arm A) or niraparib monotherapy (in Arm B) until progression of disease."
