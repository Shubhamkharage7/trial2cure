Eligible injection sites must also have intact lymphoid drainage and be free from tattoos, hypertrophic skin patches, keloids or other skin conditions which could interfere with the administration procedure or subsequent assessment of local reactogenicity. Note: In order to ensure adequate muscle mass for administrations for participants with a weight \\<65 kg, potentially eligible administration sites are confined to the outer aspect of the upper thigh (left or right vastus lateralis muscle). The left and right medial deltoid are not eligible administration sites for those participants.\n* Is an individual in whom the ability to observe possible local site reactions at \\>2 eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid or left and right vastus lateralis muscles) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably obscured due to a physical condition.\n* Has a metal implant or implantable device within the area of the electroporation injection site at \\>2 of the eligible injection sites.\n* Contraindication to intramuscular injections and/or blood draws.\n* Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including seizures and epilepsy, excluding a single febrile seizure as a child.\n* Current use of any non-removable electronic stimulation device, such as cardiac demand pacemakers, automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator, nerve stimulators, or deep brain stimulators.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease \\[e.g. colitis or Crohn's disease\\], diverticulitis \\[with the exception of diverticulosis\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome or Wegener syndrome \\[granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.\\].
