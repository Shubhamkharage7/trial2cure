These interventions and assessments will be performed in individuals 18 years of age and older who are implanted with a VNS device, which consists of patients who have been diagnosed with drug resistant epilepsy or major depressive disorder. The REVEAL study is not a treatment study; its primary objective is to scientifically investigate the contributing roles of efferent versus afferent vagus nerve modulation of multiple peripheral organs and their dependence on stimulation parameters, in which participants are those who have been implanted with a VNS device be receive standard of care treatment for their epilepsy or depressive disorder."

At Visit 2 the participant will receive whichever duty cycle they were not randomly assigned at Visit 1. Therefore, by completing the combination of three frequencies at two duty cycles, each participant will have received all six possible VNS parameter combinations over the two study visits. Chronic period: The VNS setting for the Chronic Period in between Visit 1 and Visit 2 will be the same settings as tested during Visit 1 Period 3.
