            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe drug PEN-866 can remain in tumor cells longer than it does in normal cells. It also may be more effective than other drugs at treating Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Researchers want to learn if combining PEN-866 with other drugs can treat certain cancers in adolescents and young adults.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if the combination of PEN-866 with vincristine and temozolomide can be used to treat adolescents and young adults with solid tumors that have returned after or did not respond to standard treatments, or for which there are no standard treatments.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 12-39 years who have solid tumors, Ewing sarcoma, or rhabdomyosarcoma that returned after or did not respond to standard treatments.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and eye exam. They will have heart function tests. They may have imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They will give blood and urine samples. They may have a tumor biopsy. Some samples will be used for genetic testing. Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.\n\nParticipants will get 3 drugs for up to 18 cycles. Each cycle lasts 21 days. They will get PEN-866 and vincristine by IV infusion (a tube in their vein) on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle. They will take temozolomide by mouth on Days 1-5 of each cycle.\n\nParticipants will complete questionnaires about their physical, mental, and social health.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. They may be contacted by phone or email for the rest of their life.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nIrinotecan is a prodrug of an inhibitor of topoisomerase 1 (active metabolite is SN-38) with known activity in sarcomas, however it has limitations including suboptimal bioavailability and systemic side effects including severe diarrhea and bone marrow suppression.\n\nPreclinical and clinical evidence has demonstrated that prolonged exposure to topoisomerase 1 inhibition produces superior responses in pediatric-type sarcomas, compared to shorter exposures of irinotecan.\n\nPEN-866 is a novel molecule consisting of SN-38 conjugated to a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor that has been shown to have a pharmacokinetic (PK) advantage over irinotecan in preclinical models.\n\nPreclinical and clinical data have shown that PEN-866 acts as a tumor delivery agent for SN-38, allowing SN-38 to remain in tumor cells substantially longer than it remains in normal cells.\n\nIn preclinical models of Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, PEN-866 has superior efficacy and pharmacodynamics compared to irinotecan.\n\nPEN-866 has completed phase 1 testing in adults as a single agent but has yet to be tested in any combinations.\n\nVincristine/irinotecan/temozolomide (VIT) is a standard relapse regimen for several pediatric sarcomas, with objective responses reported in a subset of participants with Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPhase 1: Determine the maximum tolerated/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of PEN-866 that can be combined with vincristine and temozolomide in adolescent and young adult (AYA) participants (12-39 years) with relapsed or refractory solid tumors\n\nPhase 2: Determine the objective response rate (CR + PR by RECIST v1.1) of the combination of vincristine, temozolomide and PEN-866 at the RP2D in AYA participants (12-39 years) with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma after a maximum of 18 cycles of the combination\n\nEligibility:\n\nPhase 1\n\nAge \\>= 12 and \\<= 39 years of age\n\nDiagnosis of a relapsed or refractory solid tumor and have archival tissue available.\n\nAdequate performance status and adequate major organ function and have recovered from acute toxicity of all prior therapies.\n\nPhase 2\n\nAge \\>= 12 and \\<= 39 years of age\n\nDiagnosis of relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma and have archival tissue available\n\nParticipants must not have received prior combination therapy with irinotecan and temozolomide\n\nAdequate performance status and adequate major organ function and have recovered from acute toxicity of all prior therapies.\n\nDesign:\n\nOpen label phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of PEN-866 given in combination with vincristine and temozolomide in adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid tumors\n\nPhase 1 portion will use a standard 3 + 3 design with limited dose escalations to define the MTD or the highest safe dose tested of PEN-866 when given in combination with standard dosing of vincristine (1.5 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8) and temozolomide (100 mg/m2 orally on days 1-5) given in 21 day cycles\n\nPhase 2 component will use Simon minimax two-stage phase II trial design and will enroll two expansion cohorts of participants (Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma)\n\nFor the Ewing sarcoma cohort, up to a total of 25 evaluable participants will be accrued.\n\nFor the rhabdomyosarcoma cohort, up to a total of 17 evaluable participants will be accrued.\n\nA potential additional phase 2 expansion cohort may open for enrollment with an amendment if there are participants with diagnoses other than rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma who have demonstrated possible benefit from this combination by experiencing a response in the phase 1 portion of the trial.\n\nMaximum number of treatment cycles is 18.\n\nA maximum of 12 participants will be required to determine the MTD during phase 1, and a maximum of 42 (25+17) evaluable participants will be accrued for the phase 2 cohorts. To allow for a small number of inevaluable participants and to accommodate screen failures, the accrual ceiling will be set at 64."

NOTE: Adult values will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity and determining eligibility.\n\nCardiac Function:\n\n* Shortening fraction of \\>=27% or ejection fraction of \\>= 50% by echocardiogram.\n* QTc interval \\< 470 msec\n\n  * Participants with toxicities from prior therapies must have resolution of these toxicities to \\<= Grade 1, with the exception of peripheral neuropathy and alopecia which must resolve to \\<=Grade 2.\n  * Participants with treated brain metastases (CNS as primary tumor not eligible) are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression. Participants must be asymptomatic from their brain metastasis and not require corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to start of therapy (C1D1). Participants with remote history of spinal cord compression are eligible.\n  * Participants with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate t is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy. Participants must be asymptomatic or have disease controlled with surgery and radiation and should not require steroids within 4 weeks prior to start of therapy (C1D1).\n  * Participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants on effective anti- retroviral therapy with no detectable viral load on any tests within the last 6 months are eligible for this trial\n  * For participants with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy within the last 6 months.\n  * Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load within the last 6 months.\n  * If 18 years old or older, must be willing to undergo tumor biopsy before treatment and have available archival tissue. If biopsy is contraindicated, enrollment must be approved by the Study Chair.\n  * Participants ages 12-17 years old without archival tissue available may opt to undergo pre- treatment biopsy if it can be performed with minimal morbidity. In the event that a participant 12-17 cannot safely undergo biopsy and does not have adequate archival tissue available, enrollment will be at the discretion of the Study Chair.\n  * For women of childbearing potential (WCBP): negative serum Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Beta hCG) pregnancy test during screening. A negative pregnancy test is also required within 8 days before first treatment; screening results may be used for treatment if they fall within the required window.\n  * Male and female participants of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the time of consent, for the duration of therapy, and for 6 months after the last dose of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n  * Ability of participant to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents or other anticancer agents.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to PEN-866 (which includes ganetespib or other HSP90 inhibitors, irinotecan, SN-38, or other agents containing irinotecan, SN-38 or its derivatives) or other agents used in study (vincristine and temozolomide).\n* Participants who have previously discontinued vincristine, temozolomide, or irinotecan due to severe toxicity.\n* Participants with a history of grade 4 vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy of constipation.\n* Participants who require medication with any of the inhibitors of UGT1A1, substrates of CYP1A2 or substrates of the P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1 transporters, or any prohibited medications. Participants discontinuing these drugs must undergo a washout of 2-weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to C1D1.\n* Participants with known bone marrow metastatic disease causing decreased blood counts below the hematologic parameters are excluded from the phase 1 component due to the in ability to be evaluable for hematologic toxicity, however they are eligible for phase 2, with transfusion support.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness as listed below:\n\n  * Unstable angina within 6 months prior to start of treatment\n  * Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to start of treatment\n  * New York Heart Association Class III - IV heart failure\n  * Clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block)\n  * Congenital long QT syndrome\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension despite use of antihypertensives for management of hypertension\n  * Stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to start of treatment\n  * As judged by the investigator, evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, active bleeding diatheses, renal or liver transplant, or Grade \\>2 active infection\n  * Any medical, psychological, or social condition that would interfere with the participant s participation in the study.\n  * Any other uncontrolled intercurrent systemic illness that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of PEN-866 on the developing human fetus are unknown, and vincristine and temozolomide are cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents which are known to be teratogenic. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with PEN866, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with PEN866. These risks also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* Major surgery within 28 days prior to start of therapy (C1D1)\n* UGT1A1 Status\n\nParticipants identified with a UGT1A1 28/28 genotype will be excluded from the phase 1 component of the study. In phase 2, they may receive PEN-866 with altered dosing- see Section. Participants who are known to not be homozygous for UGT1A128/28 genotype (i.e., 1/1 or 1/28) may receive the enrolling cohort dose level of PEN-866 on C1D1 during phase 1 and the RP2D of PEN-866 during phase 2.",
