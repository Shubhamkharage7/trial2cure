            "detailedDescription": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare blood disorder. Though affecting all ages, LCH occurs more often in children, with an increased incidence in children less than 1 year of age. The disease presents in various ways, with most children suffering bony lesions, and skin rashes. In some patients, LCH affects vital organs such as liver, spleen, bone marrow, and the central nervous system. This group of patients are at significant risk of serious illness and death and are thus said to have risk-organ-positive (RO+) LCH. Current treatments for LCH consist of chemotherapy combined with other medications. However, many patients, especially those with RO+ disease, do not respond to therapy. Of the patients that do respond, many suffer progression of disease after an initial response to therapy, or recurrence of disease after completion of therapy.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if treatment with mirdametinib in patients with LCH or other histiocytic disorders will be better than current treatments and with fewer side effects."

Chronic treatment with systemic steroids or another immunosuppressive agent. Subjects with endocrine deficiencies are allowed to receive physiologic or stress doses of steroids if necessary.\n2. Subjects who have received radiation within 14 days of study enrollment.\n3. Subjects who have received radiation to the orbit at any time previously.\n4. Subjects requiring glucocorticoids. Due to the increased risk of an ocular event, the use of systemic, inhaled, or ocular glucocorticoid therapy is prohibited within the 14 days prior to first dose of mirdametinib and throughout the treatment period.\n5. Subjects with glaucoma, or any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination classified as \u2265 grade 2, and uncontrolled with intervention (evaluation/management by an ophthalmologist).\n6. Participant has a history of, or evidence of, retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is considered a risk factor for central serous retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular degeneration. Participants will be excluded from study participation if they have any of the following risk factors for RVO at Screening:\n\n   * Intraocular pressure \\> 21 mmHg;\n   * Serum cholesterol \\> 300 mg/dL;\n   * Serum triglycerides \\> 300 mg/dL;\n   * Hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose \\> 125 mg/dL or random blood glucose \\> 200 mg/dL);\n   * Age specific hypertension\n\n     * Participants \u2265 13 years of age with a blood pressure \u2265 140/90 mm Hg\n     * Participants \u2264 12 years of age with a blood pressure \u2265 95th percentile for age +12 mmHg;\n7. Participant has recorded a LVEF \\< 55% at Screening or within 3 years of signing informed consent/assent, OR has a history of congestive heart failure;\n8. History (within 6 months before the start of the study treatments) of clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, clinically significant transient ischemic attack, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, unexplained syncope, or long QT syndrome\n9. History or current evidence of an active parathyroid disorder, or of malignancy-associated Grade \u22652 hypercalcemia despite optimal remedial therapy.\n10. Absence of measurable disease (clinical or radiologic)\n11. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease, which could compromise participation in the study (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia, uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia, uncontrolled or severe infection, severe malnutrition, chronic liver or renal disease unrelated to histiocytosis, congestive heart failure, etc.)\n12. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.\n13. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the period they are receiving the study drug and for 6 months thereafter. Abstinence, barrier (use of condom by male partner of female patient), implantable and oral forms of contraception are acceptable methods of birth control. Women of childbearing potential will be given a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to administration of mirdametinib and must have a negative serum pregnancy test.\n14. Subjects unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol, or who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study\n15. Previously treated with a MEK inhibitor including mirdametinib (PD-0325901) and had to stop treatment due to disease progression.\n16. Currently receiving therapy with a MEK inhibitor including mirdametinib (PD-0325901) or treated with a MEK inhibitor within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is greater) prior to first dose of study treatment\n17. Patients who have a MAP2KI mutation that is known to not be responsive to MEK inhibitors, such as mutations affecting amino acid residues 98-104 of the MEK protein\n18. Patients that enroll in the study who do not have mutation analysis prior to study entry may still enroll in study if tissue available for mutational analysis. If they are found to have a mutation known to be resistant to MEK inhibitors such as mutations involving amino acid residues 98-104 of the MEK protein, known to be unresponsive to MEK inhibitors, they will be taken off study, and replacement patients added. These mutations have been reported in the literature and believed to be exceedingly rare. The potential benefit of mirdametinib outweighs the risk of starting therapy in a patient prior to knowledge of mutation data. In the unlikely event a patient is found to have this specific, unresponsive mutation, therapy would be discontinued.",
