However, based on available data, an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically miscarriage or congenital anomalies, has not been observed following inadvertent administration of the papillomavirus vaccine during pregnancy. Individuals who are able to become pregnant are advised to contact us immediately and will not receive any further intralesional vaccine.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants will be asked about pregnancy at time of recruitments. Individuals who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant will not be permitted to participate in the study, as ACOG does not recommend Gardasil 9 during pregnancy. Participants will be encouraged not to participate in the study if they believe they may become pregnant during the study.\n* Participants will be asked about allergic reaction to yeast and vaccine components at time of recruitment. Subjects with severe allergic reactions to baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a vaccine component), or other vaccine components (ie polysorbate 80, Merck amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate) will not be permitted to participate in this study.\n* Participants' vaccination history will be reviewed at time of recruitment. Patients who have previously received any prior human papillomavirus vaccine will not be permitted to participate in this study.\n* Subjects' medical history and current medications will be reviewed at time of recruitment. Subjects taking immune suppressive medications (steroids such as prednisone or dexamethasone, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, immunomodulatory agents such as apremilast, or immunomodulatory biologic agents such as adalimumab, guselkumab or ustekinumab) will be excluded.
