            "briefSummary": "This study will use a between-person design. Participants will be treatment-seeking patients with chronic masticatory muscle pain. Participants who are eligible for the study and consent to participate will be randomly assigned to receive a brief behavioral intervention for chronic orofacial pain called Physical Self-Regulation or a control intervention. Interventions will be administered via telehealth in both arms. Both interventions will consist of 2 50-minute sessions scheduled approximately two weeks apart. Participants will be contacted two weeks and three months after completing the interventions to provide additional follow-up data. Investigators hypothesize that both PSR-TH and the control intervention will demonstrate strong feasibility (i.e., recruitment of at least 1 participant per week, \\>75% retention, \\>95% interventionist fidelity, and adequate acceptability, credibility, and burden). Investigators also hypothesize that specific biopsychosocial variables will moderate PSR-TH-related changes in outcomes, and that PSR-TH-related changes in perceived control over pain, self-efficacy, coping, parafunctional habits, and relaxation will mediate treatment effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic masticatory muscle pain disorders (MMPD) consist of several conditions (e.g., myofascial pain, local myalgia) characterized by pain in the muscles of the temporomandibular area lasting longer than three months. MMPD affects 5-12% of adults, is the most common cause of chronic non-odontogenic facial pain, and the second most common musculoskeletal pain condition after chronic low back pain. MMPD is associated with pain-related interference with daily activities, diminished quality of life (QoL) and costs of \\> $4 billion/year in the US, representing a serious public health issue. Chronic MMPD is most effectively managed with multidisciplinary treatment. One brief psychological intervention that has been particularly promising for improving orofacial pain outcomes and QoL in MMPD is physical self-regulation (PSR). Relative to standard dental care (SDC) alone, those who received SDC+PSR experienced reduced pain intensity up to 6.5 months later (Cohen's D = 0.67). These data suggest that PSR may be a promising intervention for improving pain outcomes in MMPD. Despite the promise of PSR, one of its major shortcomings is that treatment utilization is low, with less than 50% of eligible patients beginning PSR when offered in person. Offering PSR via telehealth may be a solution. Telehealth interventions improve access to care and are preferred by patients over in-person interventions. Preliminary data of treatment utilization for PSR-TH are promising, with over 80% of eligible patients beginning the intervention when offered via telehealth. However, it is not known if PSR-TH is efficacious above and beyond nonspecific treatment effects (e.g., people having more contact with a therapist, people inadvertently modifying their behavior to please their therapist, natural regression to the mean of pain symptoms, etc.). The efficacy of PSR-TH to treat MMPD needs to be formally tested; however, additional data regarding feasibility and moderating/mediating factors of PSRTH are needed to support such a trial. First, PSR-TH and a control intervention need to be formally piloted in patients with MMPD to 1) determine how willing patients are to participate in research (i.e., recruitment), 2) determine the completion rates for both interventions (i.e., retention), 3) quantify how well interventionists are able to deliver the interventions in a standardized way (i.e., fidelity), and 4) establish patients' perceived acceptability, credibility, and burden of both interventions. Second, a body of work has examined biopsychosocial moderators and mediators of responses to psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, \\[CBT\\]) in MMPD, but never of PSR-TH specifically. Identifying relevant moderators and mediators in this project will allow for more thorough assessment of those specific relationships in a future Phase II trial, advancing understanding of how PSR-TH works, and for whom. To accomplish these aims, treatment-seeking patients with chronic MMPD will be randomly assigned to two 50-min telehealth sessions of PSR or a control intervention (N=52/group) and will provide biopsychosocial moderator, mediator, and outcome data at baseline, after each intervention sessions, two weeks following the intervention, and three months following the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that both PSR-TH and the control intervention will demonstrate strong feasibility (i.e., recruitment of at least 1 participant per week, \\>75% retention, \\>95% interventionist fidelity, and adequate acceptability, credibility, and burden). The investigators also hypothesize that specific biopsychosocial variables will moderate PSR-TH-related changes in outcomes, and that PSR-TH-related changes in perceived control over pain, self-efficacy, coping, parafunctional habits, and relaxation will mediate treatment effects."
