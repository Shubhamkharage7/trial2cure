            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a randomized controlled trial that will compare an exercise group to a control group on lower extremity function, CIPN, and inflammatory markers in ovarian or endometrial cancer patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy after surgery.\n\nThe names of the study interventions involved in this study are/is:\n\n* Aerobic and resistance exercise; virtually supervised 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise performed at home via Zoom\n* Attention control for 16 weeks, home-based stretching\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study interventions including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nIt is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study."
