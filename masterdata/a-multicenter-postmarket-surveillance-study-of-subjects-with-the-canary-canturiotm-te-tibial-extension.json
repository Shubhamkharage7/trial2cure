Additionally, the reliability, precision and accuracy of all 7 gait parameters (walking speed, cadence, stride length, functional knee ROM, tibia ROM, step count and distance) using measurements at 1 year with 3 different walking speeds, will be assessed with a consecutive cohort of 25 patients from Group 1 in a gait lab."
