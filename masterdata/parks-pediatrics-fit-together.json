Persistence of this gap represents a large-scale public health threat, as the earliest generation of children living through the obesity epidemic now enters adulthood, they are the first in US history to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents, mainly due to rising rates of obesity-related cancers and cardiovascular disease. A central challenge in delivering recommended treatment is the intensity; \u226526 hours of face-to-face contact are necessary to achieve health benefits and risk reduction. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an implementation strategy that pairs primary care pediatric clinics with the municipal Parks and Recreation (P\\&R) centers to deliver the current treatment recommendations with high fidelity, while allowing"
