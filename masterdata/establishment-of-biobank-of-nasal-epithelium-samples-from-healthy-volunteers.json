            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nInfections in the lower respiratory tract (lungs) are the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. This was true even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Respiratory viruses are still a major health threat. Many of these viruses infect people by penetrating the thin skin that lines the nose. These viruses can also spread easily to other people when they multiply in the tissues that line the nose. Researchers want to learn more about what these viruses do inside the nose, how they get from the nose to the lungs, and how they spread from person to person.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo collect cell samples from inside the noses of healthy people. These cells will be stored for use in future research on respiratory diseases.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy volunteers aged 18 years and older.\n\nDesign:\n\nMost participants will have 1 visit on 1 day. They will be asked questions. Those who have a runny nose, coughing, congestion, or fever will be asked to wait up to 21 days before participating.\n\nParticipants will be given a slender swab with small bristles at the end. They will rub the inside of their nose with the swab. A clinic staff member will be present to help, if needed.\n\nParticipants will provide their name, age, and sex. This information will be encoded so that only certain researchers will know the participants identities.\n\nParticipants will not be contacted again....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is a repository protocol with prospective sample collection to provide samples needed for future studies of the pathogenesis of emerging respiratory viruses. Nasal brushings will be collected from approximately 100 healthy volunteers at RML and stored in the LV to be made available for future research studies that will be conducted under separate protocols, as applicable.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo obtain nasal epithelium brushes from healthy volunteers for 1) establishment of upper respiratory tract organoids, 2) assay validation, and 3) use for research into the pathogenesis of emerging respiratory viruses."
