Have abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG that in the opinion of the Investigator increase the risk of participating in the study (e.g., sinus rhythm with PR interval \\> 240 ms or second degree or higher AV block, confirmed by a repeat ECG);\n5. Have ECG evidence of complete left bundle branch block or ventricular pacing;\n6. Have a history of long QT syndrome or prolonged QT interval corrected based on Fridericia's method (QTcF) \\>450 ms at screening;\n7. Require treatment with drugs known to be associated with Torsade de Pointes;\n8. Have experienced any of the following within the 6-month period prior to screening that would interfere with the subject's participation in the opinion of the treating investigator: unstable angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, cardiac failure with known ejection fraction less than 40%;\n9. Have other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormality that would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study;\n10. Have any mental or medical condition that prevents the subject from giving informed consent or participating in the trial;\n11. Have received anti-tumor therapies such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks or 4 half-lives (whichever is shorter or as agreed between the site PI and Medical Monitor) prior to starting the study drug;\n12. Have received systemic corticosteroids (either oral or intravenous steroids, excluding inhalers or topicals) for a duration \u2265 4 weeks at the daily dose equivalent to \u22657.5 mg of oral prednisone within the 12 weeks prior to starting study drug;\n13. Are currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 28 days or four half-lives (whichever is shorter, or as agreed between the site PI and Medical Monitor) prior to first study drug administration;\n14. Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Note: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability;\n15. Require treatment with strong inhibitors, strong inducers, and/or sensitive substrates of CYP1A2 and/or CYP3A4, and/or sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 or major drug transporters; This medication can be stopped and the patient enrolled after 4 half- lives of that drug, as determined by the PI.\n16. Are unwilling to or unable to comply with the requirement of the protocol; and\n17. Are pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or have children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through the duration of study participation.",
