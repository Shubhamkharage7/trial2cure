            "briefSummary": "Low income women of childbearing age are at increased risk for depression and often do not receive needed treatment. Investigators developed Mom-Net, an on-line cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for depression to address the needs of low income women of childbearing age. The intervention program also includes live coaching to help the mothers engage and learn the CBT material. Mom-Net has been shown to be highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving parenting behavior and child adjustment, in earlier controlled trials. In this project the investigators are examining whether access to Mom-Net can be expanded by delivering it in Head Starts (HS).\n\nTo address that broad question, the investigators will focus on two sets of scientific questions:\n\n1. Implementation Questions: e.g., Can HS agencies deliver the program successfully; do HSs choose to sustain the program after the research project ends; what agency characteristics are associated with successful delivery of Mom-Net);\n2. Effectiveness Questions: e.g., Does Mom-Net reduce maternal depression when delivered by Head Start agencies, with HS staff doing the coaching?\n\nHead Start agencies will be randomized to deliver either Mom-Net with the usual high-intensity coaching or with a low-intensity coaching alternative. Within each agency, depressed mothers will be randomized to receive either: 1) Mom-Net program; or 2) Treatment as Usual (TAU;) referral to community mental health providers). Mothers initially assigned to the TAU condition, will have the option of receiving Mom-Net at a later date. Mothers will participate in assessments of depressive symptoms, parenting behavior, and child adjustment at Time 1 (T1; prior to randomization); and Time 2 (T2; after the intervention period) and Time 3 (T3; one year after T1).",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nLow income women of childbearing age are at disproportionate risk for depressive syndromes and, despite the availability of efficacious interventions, often do not receive needed treatment. The investigators developed Mom-Net, a remote, coach-facilitated, Internet-based intervention adapted from an empirically-supported cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for depression to address the needs of depressed mothers. Two randomized control trials demonstrated Mom-Net to be highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving parenting behavior and child adjustment. In this project investigators seek to examine whether the reach of the Mom-Net intervention can be expanded by implementing within the Head Start Environment.\n\nInvestigators are using a hybrid type 2, Effectiveness-Implementation design to compare two implementation approaches for the delivery of Mom-Net, one with its existing high-intensity coaching approach, and one making use of a low-intensity coaching, designed to provide supportive accountability, but not psychoeducational support. Investigators will follow the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment process model (EPIS) to guide the evaluation, with the Clinical Trial component primarily constituting the Implementation phase.\n\nClinical Trial Aims:\n\n1. Examine effectiveness and Implementation outcomes of Mom-Net within Head-Start, randomizing agencies to implementation approach (i.e., high- vs low-intensity coaching) and mothers within agency, to either Mom-Net or Treatment as Usual (TAU)/waitlist conditions.\n\n   1. Compare the two Mom-Net implementation approaches on: 1) implementation outcomes including reach, acceptability, fidelity, and cost; and 2) effectiveness outcomes including self-reported maternal depressive symptoms (primary outcome), parenting behavior, and child emotional and behavioral functioning (secondary outcomes).\n   2. Examine the effectiveness of each Mom-Net implementation approach relative to TAU on the primary and secondary outcomes listed above.\n2. Consistent with an experimental therapeutic approach, investigators will examine the mediating influence of changes in maternal functioning associated with core Mom-Net skills on maternal depressive symptoms. Mediators to be examined include behavior activation, negative cognitive styles, social support, and belief that mood can be regulated. Investigators will also examine the mediating influence of change in maternal depressive symptoms on parenting behavior and child outcomes.\n\nClinical Trial Protocol\n\n1. Prior to the Implementation Phase (i.e., clinical trial), participating agencies will be randomized to either high- or low-intensity coaching conditions."
