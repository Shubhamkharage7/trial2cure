            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies wide-field and high resolution in vivo imaging in visualizing lesions in patients with abnormal or uncontrolled oral cell growth (neoplasia) undergoing surgery. Diagnostic procedures, such as wide-field and high resolution in vivo imaging, are devices that let researchers look at a wide area of the lining of the mouth by shining different colors inside the mouth and taking pictures and this may help doctors to decide if a mouth lesion has a high risk of being pre-cancerous or cancerous.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the feasibility for assessing oral mucosa in vivo with wide-field and high resolution images obtained using new optical imaging devices composed of cameras and microscopes, and with a topically administered contrast agent.\n\nII. To develop and evaluate algorithms to classify tissue as normal (including hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia, and inflammation) or abnormal (any grade of dysplasia or cancer) based on quantitative parameters extracted from the optical images.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the percentage of subjects and lesions that can be successfully imaged with wide-field and high-resolution optical microscopes after topical application of contrast dye.\n\nII. To identify qualitative and quantitative features within images that differ between pathologically normal, dysplastic, cancerous and inflammatory lesions.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo evaluation of oral cavity using a widefield multispectral imaging device and a high-resolution optical system (high-resolution microendoscope \\[HRME\\]) at baseline, after induction of general anesthesia, and prior to surgery.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 months."
