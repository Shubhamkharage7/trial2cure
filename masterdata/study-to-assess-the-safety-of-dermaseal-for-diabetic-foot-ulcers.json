            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the safety of DERMASEAL for the treatment of non-healing, neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. The main outcome measure is safety. A total of twenty-four (24) participants will be randomized to receive up to four (4) consecutive weeks of treatment with either standard of care (SOC), plasma film + SOC, or plasma film containing silver microparticles (DERMASEAL) + SOC, with a final follow-up visit 12 weeks after the last treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase 1 study to evaluate the safety of the DERMASEAL advanced wound care dressing in the treatment of non-healing diabetic foot ulcers located distal to the malleolus in subjects with controlled diabetes mellitus and without significantly compromised arterial circulation. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to one of 3 treatment groups:\n\n* SOC alone (n=6)\n* SOC + plasma film (n=6)\n* SOC + DERMASEAL (n=12)\n\nA subject's study duration will be up to a total of 18 weeks from screening to end of study. This includes a two-week active run-in followed by up to 4 weeks of treatment, plus a final follow-up visit 12 weeks after the last treatment.\n\nThe primary endpoint is safety of topically applying a plasma film containing metallic silver microparticles plus fibrin in patients with chronic, non-healing neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. Secondary endpoints to be assessed in each group include:\n\n1. Percent of study wounds healed during the post-treatment weeks 1 through 4,\n2. Time to complete wound closure,\n3. Percent area reduction during the post-treatment weeks 2, 4, 6 and 16, and\n4. Cost of treatment"

Excessive lymphedema that in the opinion of the investigator will interfere with wound healing.\n7. A cognitive, physical, or psychological condition interfering with subject's ability to comply with the treatment regimen.\n8. Active Charcot foot or unstable Charcot that in the opinion of the investigator will inhibit wound healing.\n9. Wounds secondary to vasculitis, neoplasms, or hematological disorders.

An ulcer that in the opinion of the investigator is not associated with the subject's diabetic neuropathic condition.\n11. Subjects is on dialysis.\n12. History of radiation to the target foot.\n13. Patients with uncontrolled autoimmune connective tissue diseases.\n14. Patients who are pregnant, breast feeding, or unwilling to practice contraceptive methods during participation in the study, if applicable. Effective methods of contraception include:\n\n    i. oral, injectable, or implanted hormonal contraceptives ii. intrauterine device or system, iii. barrier method with spermicide, or iv. bilateral tubal occlusion.\n15. Patients with uncontrolled anemia (Hgb\\<10 g/dL in women; \\<12 g/dL in men) at Screening.\n16. Severe malnutrition (serum albumin \u22642.0 with a normal C-reactive protein).\n17. Wounds healed by \\>30% in area following the 2-week, active run-in period as measured during Visit 3.\n18. Use of hyperbaric oxygen, and active dressings that include growth factors, engineered tissues, or skin substitutes (e.g., Regranex, Dermagraft, Apligraf, etc.) within 30 days of study screening.\n19. Wounds \\>5 mm deep after sharp debridement.\n20. Clinical suspicion of skin cancer at or near the ulcer location which has not been ruled out by biopsy.",
