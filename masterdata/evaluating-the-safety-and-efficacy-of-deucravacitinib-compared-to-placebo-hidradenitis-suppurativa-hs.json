Dosage of deucravacitinib will be given according to the investigational regimen as follows: 6 mg po bid for 16 weeks. The study compromises a 4-week screening period, a 16-week study period, and a 4-week follow-up period. The follow-up period consists of a follow-up phone call 4 weeks after the last study drug dose.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Deucravacitinib (BMS- 986165) in the treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Deucravacitinib (6 mg twice daily) or placebo for 16 weeks. Assessments will be performed at Baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 by a blinded investigator. During this visits, subjects will also be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire (DLQI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain.\n\nA total enrollment of 30 subjects (20 study drug, 10 placebo) is anticipated in this single- center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. This study powered to show a significant difference in efficacy of treatment using the following assumptions based on other clinical trials: baseline average inflammatory lesion count of 12, improvement of 7 in the treatment group and 3 in the placebo group, with a power of 0.87, SD of 3.25 and alpha level of 0.05. The HiSCR will be a secondary endpoint (reduction of inflammatory lesions by 50% with no increase in fistulas or abscesses)."
