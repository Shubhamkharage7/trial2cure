This study is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AUTO1.\n\nThe safety and tolerability of AUTO1 in pediatric patients will be continually monitored by the Sponsor. Additionally, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review the rolling safety data generated after 6 and 12 treated patients have been monitored for at least 28 days and in the event any protocol defined safety stopping criteria are met. If no pre-defined safety events related to AUTO1 are met, and the safety data are consistent with what has previously been observed with AUTO1, the IDMC can recommend continuing the study without or with modifications. Based on emerging data, the study may be stopped early due to excessive toxicity, i.e. certain pre-defined AUTO1-related safety events or deaths.\n\nThe study will involve consented patients going through the following sequential study periods: screening, leukapheresis, bridging as necessary, lymphodepletion, treatment evaluation, and follow-up."
