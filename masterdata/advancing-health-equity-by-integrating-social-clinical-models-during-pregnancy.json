Women aged 18 or older who get healthcare at Geisinger, are pregnant, and are eligible to be referred to the WIC program will be recruited. These women need to consent to join this study. There are four groups in this study. Group 1 will get usual care with details about WIC from their clinical team. Group 2 will be sent to WIC by their clinical team. Group 3 will get details about WIC from their clinical team and a dietitian will talk to them about heart-healthy diets and food management. Group 4 will be sent to WIC by their clinical team and a dietitian will talk to them about heart-healthy diets and food management. This study will last about 18 months and will have 200 total subjects joining at about 50 per month. Each subject will be in the study for about 6 months. Subjects will be asked to complete surveys at the start and end of the study. Some subjects will also be asked about their experience in the study team after they are done."
