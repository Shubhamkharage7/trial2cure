            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose a longitudinal home study of ALS patients to measure the severity of speech and swallowing (bulbar) impairment via a smartphone-based, remote speech and swallow assessment (rSSA). The study is designed to assess the feasibility and validity of such a monitoring intervention. Furthermore, it is proposed that regular monitoring of these two bulbar processes may shed light on their co-evolution over the course of ALS.",
            "detailedDescription": "Most individuals with ALS experience bulbar function deterioration over the course of the disease which impacts their quality of life significantly. Furthermore, in some patients, bulbar symptoms are an initial presenting symptom of ALS. Identifying these changes, which may be rapid in some individuals, is complicated by the recent acceleration of virtual care delivery.\n\nThe investigators propose a longitudinal home study of ALS patients to assess bulbar progression via a smartphone-based, self-administered remote speech and swallow assessment (rSSA). The overall hypothesis is that this monitoring protocol can be used in a way that, 1) is satisfactory to the patient, 2) performs at least as well as standard clinical measures of dysarthria and dysphagia, and 3) resolves the development of emergence of speech and swallowing pathologies in ALS."
