Be a woman of childbearing potential who is not using an acceptable means of birth control; acceptable methods of contraception includes: hormonal - oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives for at least one month prior to first visit; Use two of the following effective methods of contraception: intrauterine device (IUD without local hormone release), diaphragm, cervical cap, and/or condoms; or surgical sterilization of partner (i.e., a female participant's male partner has undergone effective surgical sterilization such as vasectomy before the female participant entered the clinical trial) who has obtained documentation of absence of sperm in his ejaculate and is the sole sexual partner of the female participant during the clinical trial. For non-sexually active females, abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of birth control; however, if the subject becomes sexually active during the study, she must agree to use adequate birth control as defined above for the remainder of the study;\n16. Have a known allergy and/or sensitivity to the Study Drug or its components;\n17. Have a condition or be in a situation that the investigator feels may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study;\n18. Be currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or have used an investigational drug or device within 30 days of Visit 1;\n19. Be currently using any medication known to cause ocular drying that is not used on a stable dosing regimen for the least 30 dats prior to Visit 1;\n20. Have a known history of meibomian gland procedures (e.g. LipiFlow, laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI), probing, etc.) within 6 months of study enrollment;\n21. Be unable or unwilling to follow instructions, including participation in all study assessments and visits;\n22. Has participated in any other clinical trials of ophthalmologic drugs for 30 days before or during participation in this Study.",
