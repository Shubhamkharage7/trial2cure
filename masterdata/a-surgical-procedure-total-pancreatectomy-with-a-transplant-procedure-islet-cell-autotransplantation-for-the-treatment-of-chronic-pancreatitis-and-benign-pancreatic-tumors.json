            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial assesses the safety and effectiveness of total pancreatectomy with islet cell autotransplantation for the treatment of patients with long-term pancreatic inflammation (chronic pancreatitis) and non-cancerous (benign) pancreatic tumors. Total removal of the pancreas (pancreatectomy) can be used to treat chronic pancreatitis, but it may result in diabetes. An islet cell autotransplantation involves removing cells from a patient's pancreas (the islet cells) and infusing them into the liver. Islet cells are responsible for producing hormones like insulin, reducing the occurrence of diabetes in patients undergoing total pancreatectomy. Total pancreatectomy with autologous islet cell transplant is an accepted and Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for patients with chronic pancreatitis. However, patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors have historically not been candidates for this procedure due to concerns of spreading potentially cancerous cells to other parts of the body. This clinical trial evaluates the safety and effectiveness of this treatment in patients with chronic pancreatitis and benign pancreatic tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the oncologic safety of total pancreatectomy with islet cell autotransplantation (TPIAT) in chronic pancreatitis patients with benign pancreatic neoplasms.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate postoperative insulin requirements in patients with presumed benign pancreatic neoplasms undergoing TPIAT.\n\nII. To evaluate postoperative opiate requirements in patients with presumed benign pancreatic neoplasms undergoing TPIAT.\n\nIII. To evaluate the postoperative survival of patients with presumed benign pancreatic neoplasms undergoing TPIAT.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate quality of life outcomes in patients undergoing TPIAT with presumed benign pancreatic neoplasms.\n\nII. To evaluate subjective pain-related outcomes in patients undergoing TPIAT with presumed benign pancreatic neoplasms.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo total pancreatectomy and autologous islet cell transplant intravenously (IV) over 15-60 minutes on day 1.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years."
