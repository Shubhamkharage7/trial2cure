            "briefSummary": "The over-arching goal of the Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography Imaging Screening Trial (CMIST) is to determine if dual-energy contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) can detect more cancers with fewer false positives than digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in women with dense breasts.\n\nAim 1: To evaluate the performance of CESM compared to DBT at baseline for breast-cancer screening in women with dense breasts.\n\nAim 2: To evaluate the performance of CESM compared to DBT at the 1-year follow up for breast-cancer screening in women with dense breasts.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography Imaging Screening Trial (CMIST), which will be managed by the American College of Radiology (ACR), Center for Research and Innovation (CRI), seeks to determine if dual-energy contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) screening provides more accurate cancer detection compared to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in women with dense breasts.\n\nYear 0 Visit:\n\nAll women aged 45 to 74 years of age known mammographically dense breasts, as reported on their most recent prior mammogram who are scheduled for a routine annual screening DBT will be offered CESM in addition to DBT. Baseline imaging (Year 0) will be performed within 30 days after participant registration. Standard DBT screening views followed by standard CESM screening views will be performed on the same day and prior to any additional workup.\n\nYear 1 Visit (12 Months \u00b12 Months After Year 0 Imaging):\n\nStandard DBT screening views followed by standard CESM screening views will be performed on the same day and prior to any additional workup.\n\nYear 2 Visit: Follow-Up - Return for Standard Mammography Screening (12 Months \u00b12 Months After Year 1 Imaging):\n\nThe 2-year participant follow-up contact (email, text, or phone calls) should be performed 12 months (\u00b12 months) after the Year 1 imaging to confirm the participant has not been diagnosed with an interval breast cancer. If 2-year imaging has not been scheduled, the 2-year participant follow-up contact should be performed prior to 14 months post year 1 visit. Participants diagnosed with breast cancer in the interval between the Year 1 and Year 2 imaging studies will have no subsequent follow-up and will not undergo the Year 2 study imaging in the scope of the study. The participant will be asked for AEs/SAEs with a non-leading question."

Women currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer, or planning surgery for a high-risk lesion (ADH, ALH, LCIS, papilloma, radial scar).\n* 2. Women who have had the following are not eligible:\n\n  1. a mammogram less than 11 months prior to study entry.\n  2. screening breast ultrasound within 11 months prior to study entry.\n  3. breast MRI less than 36 months prior to study entry.\n  4. contrast-enhanced spectral mammography less than 36 months prior to study entry.\n  5. molecular breast imaging (MBI) less than 36 months prior to study entry.\n  6. breast prosthetic implants (silicone or saline).\n  7. suspected of being at high-risk for breast cancer, as defined by the ACS breast MR screening recommendations (lifetime risk of \u226520%-25%) unless they are unable to undergo an MRI. (Reference Appendix I)\n  8. a history of sickle cell disease.\n* 3. Women with known or suspected renal impairment. Requirements for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determination prior to IV iodinated contrast administration are determined by local site standard practice. Criteria that should be considered include, but are not limited to, the following:\n* Age \\>60 years old\n* History of renal disease, including dialysis, kidney transplant, single kidney, renal cancer, and renal surgery\n* History of hypertension requiring medical therapy\n* History of diabetes mellitus\n* Use of metformin or metformin-containing drug combinations\n* 4. Women who are pregnant, breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant from screening until 30 days after the last administration of Omnipaque (iohexol).\n* 5.
