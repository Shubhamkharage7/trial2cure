Patients will be asked their opinions about the design, accessibility, and content of the tool. Researchers will use the information collected to improve the educational materials that will help patients make future decisions about their treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the acceptability (e.g., ease of use, design, accessibility, content) of the educational tool that will be developed for patients with melanoma and pre-existing autoimmune conditions considering or undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nII. To test the usability in real world-settings of the educational tool (to be developed) and assess feasibility of patient recruitment (i.e., ability to identify enough patients and consent at least 50% of the identified patients) in a pilot study.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPART A: Participants navigate the educational tool over 30-45 minutes then participate in an interview about their thoughts and opinions about the content, ease of use, and format of the tool over 45 minutes.\n\nPART B: 2 group of patients will be assessd sequentially (Participants in group II will be enrolled after all the patients in group I have been assessed).\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive standard educational information during their clinician encounter. Patients also complete questionnaires over 30-45 minutes at baseline within a week prior to their clinician encounter, immediately after the encounter, and at 3 months.\n\nGROUP II: Patients navigate educational tool over 20 minutes during their clinician encounter. Patients also complete questionnaires over 30-45 minutes at baseline within a week prior to their clinician encounter, immediately after the encounter, and at 3 months."
