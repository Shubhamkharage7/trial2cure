            "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, participant- and investigator-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intra-individual dose escalation of DFV890 for inflammatory marker reduction in participants with coronary heart disease and elevated hsCRP. The study consists of a screening period of up to 60 days, a treatment period of approximately 12 weeks, an end of treatment (EOT) visit on Day 85, which is one day after the last dose on Day 84, a follow-up period of approximately 1 week and a standard safety-follow-up call approximately 30 days following the last dose. The overall study duration is approximately 24 weeks and approximately 24 participants will be enrolled into the trial.\n\nParticipants meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 5:5:1:1 ratio to one of four treatment sequences (three DFV890 treatment sequences or a placebo-only sequence). The dose of DFV890 will be uptitrated (according to the specific treatment sequence that the participant is assigned to) approximately every three weeks at the scheduled visits on Days 22, 43 and 64."
