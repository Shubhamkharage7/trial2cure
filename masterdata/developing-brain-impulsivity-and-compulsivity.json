            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nImpulsivity is acting 'without thinking.' Compulsivity is being overly inflexible. People vary in how impulsive or compulsive they are. Extreme versions of these behaviors play a role in mental disorders. Researchers want to study changes in the brain to learn more about these behaviors. Differences in genes may also play a role.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn about genetic and brain features that explain why levels of impulsivity and compulsivity vary across people.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 6-80\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history and medical record review.\n\nParticipants will talk about their mental and behavioral development. They may discuss topics like drug use and sexual activity. They will complete surveys about their compulsivity and impulsivity. Parents of child participants may also complete these surveys.\n\nParticipants may take memory, attention, and thinking tests. They may give blood or saliva samples for gene studies.\n\nParticipants may have a magnetic resonance imaging scan. It will take pictures of their brain. The scanner is shaped like a cylinder. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner. A coil will be placed over their head. They will lie still, watch a movie, and play a game.\n\nParticipants may have a magnetoencephalography scan. It records brain activity. Participants will sit in a room. A 'cone' of magnetic field detectors will be lowered around their head. They will rest and play a game.\n\nParticipants may ask family members to join the study.\n\nParticipants under age 25 may repeat these tests every 1-2 years until they turn 25 or until the study ends. For those over age 25, participation will last less than 1 month.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nMany neuropsychiatric disorders have extreme impairing impulsivity and compulsivity behaviors at their core. We hypothesized that the development of symptoms of impulsivity and compulsivity during childhood/adolescence and early adulthood will be associated with atypical trajectories of brain features including cortical glutamate (the main excitatory neurotransmitter) and functional/structural brain connectivity. Additionally, we hypothesize that cortical glutamate will be under genetic control (i.e., heritable) and that common genetic variant risk for disorders characterized by extreme impulsivity (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and by extreme compulsivity (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder) will also be associated with atypical cortical glutamate trajectories. To elucidate the relationships between the developing brain, compulsivity/impulsivity and genomics, we will collect clinical assessments including clinician-led interviews, neurobehavioral assessments, neuroimaging data, and genomic samples using 1) a prospective longitudinal design to answer developmental hypotheses; 2) an extended multigenerational family design to assess genomic hypotheses.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nA) To assess the effects of impulsivity and compulsivity on the developmental trajectories of cortical glutamate.\n\nB) To determine the heritability of cortical glutamate.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nA) To establish the reliability of glutamate measurements.\n\nB) To examine the impact of atypical glutamate levels on developing structural and functional connections within the fronto-striatal circuits.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nA) Age-related change in cortical glutamate levels and its moderation by individual differences in levels of impulsivity and compulsivity.\n\nB) Heritability of cortical glutamate (proportion of variance explained by additive genetic factors).\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nA) 1. Glutamate levels estimated at 3 Tesla at short intervals to establish test-retest reliability.\n\n2. Glutamate levels estimated at both 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla (cross scanner validation).\n\nB) Measures of the brain s structural and functional connectivity.\n\nStudy Population:\n\nWe aim to recruit 1100 participants over the next 7 years. Individuals between 6 and 80 years of age with a wide range of impulsivity/compulsivity behaviors - ranging from normal to mildly/extremely impaired - will be recruited. No specific demographic groups will be targeted. Recruitment will be mainly done in the District of Columbia/Maryland/Virginia area, however some participants needed for primary aim B (heritability) might travel from elsewhere.\n\nDescription of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:\n\nThe National Institute of Health is the sole site for enrollment of participant.\n\nStudy Duration:\n\nThe estimated study duration from the beginning of the study (study opens to enrollment) to the end (completion of data analyses) is 10 years.\n\nParticipant Duration:\n\nPrimary Objective A: Participants may complete follow-up visits for as long as the study is open; thus, they might complete visits over a 7 to 10-year period.\n\nPrimary Objective B: Participants will complete the study after one visit and may complete forms at home; thus, the estimated time for participation is less than a month."
