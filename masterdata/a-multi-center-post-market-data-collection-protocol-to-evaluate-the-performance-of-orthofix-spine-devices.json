Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores corresponding to greater disability. A total NDI score is determined by adding the scores of the individual questions and dividing that total by the maximum possible score (i.e., 50 if all questions are answered) to yield a percentage. Therefore, the NDI score ranges from 0 to 100. The ODI was developed as a specific outcomes tool for subjects suffering from back pain. The questionnaire scores 10 aspects of the subject's home and work life and analgesic use.
