For SCLC and NEPC: must be available for shipment prior to enrollment but confirmation of DLL3 expression is not required prior to enrollment.\n   2. For high-grade neuroendocrine tumor types other than SCLC and NEPC: demonstration of DLL3 expression in a tumor sample is required and must be confirmed prior to treatment.\n3. Adequate hematologic status, including:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651500 cells/\u03bcL\n   * Platelet count \u2265100,000/\u03bcL\n   * Hemoglobin \u22659 g/dL (no transfusions allowed within 2 weeks prior to screening)\n4.

History of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage.\n5. Active neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome.\n6. Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (e.g., biweekly or more frequently).\n7. Active or history of autoimmune disease or immune deficiency, including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or multiple sclerosis. Exceptions apply.\n8. Ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, systemic corticosteroids \\[prednisone dose \\>10mg per day or equivalent\\], cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor \\[TNF\\] alpha agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment (except protocol-required pre-medications). Exceptions apply.\n9. History of allogeneic stem cell transplant or solid-organ transplant.\n10. For patients enrolled in the HPN328/Atezolizumab combination cohorts:\n\n    * Known hypersensitivity to biopharmaceuticals produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells or any component of the atezolizumab formulation, or other anti-PD-(L)1 agents.\n    * Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and IL-2) within 4 weeks or 5 drug-elimination half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.\n    * History of severe anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n11. History of interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT). History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field is permitted.\n12.
