            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to compare two approaches to addressing obesity and food insecurity among Latina women in primary care to provide evidence for community health centers who serve this high-priority group. The project team will recruit 412 low-income Latina women with obesity (body mass index 30) and food insecurity from two community health centers with whom the team has longstanding partnerships. Patients will be randomized to Vida Sana y Completa (an obesity intervention with integrated treatment for food insecurity) or Vida Sana alone. Vida Sana is a state-of-the-art cultural adaptation of Group Lifestyle Balance, a 12-month program that targets at least 5 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. For food insecurity, the team will provide boxes of healthy foods (e.g., fresh produce, lean protein, low-fat dairy, and whole grains) that give women the foods they need to adopt a healthy diet."
