            "briefSummary": "This is a phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and preliminary evidence of effectiveness of azeliragon, in combination with radiation therapy, as an initial treatment of a form of glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer that grows quickly and can invade and destroy healthy tissue. There's no cure for glioblastoma, which is also known as glioblastoma multiforme. Treatments, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy might slow cancer growth and reduce symptoms. New treatments of glioblastoma are needed.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study to be conducted is a phase 2 study in newly diagnosed \"unmethylated\" glioblastoma.\n\nAs compared to \"methylated\" glioblastoma \"unmethylated\" glioblastoma carries a worse prognosis, as it is resistant to temozolomide, the most commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic treatment. Based upon pre-clinical evidence suggesting that azeliragon may enhance the effectiveness of radiation, as well as have a delaying effect on disease progression, this study will combine daily oral azeliragon with radiation treatment, followed by continued administration of azeliragon after completion of radiation therapy.\n\nAzeliragon is administered once daily as an oral capsule. In previous studies in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in normal volunteers, azeliragon was well tolerated for up to 18 months."
