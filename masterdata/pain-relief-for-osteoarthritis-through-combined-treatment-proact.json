We will exclude patients using opioids daily as both continued use and temporary withdrawal from these medications this could affect pain perception and response to interventions. Other medications being used will be recorded and controlled in statistical analyses as needed.\n* Use of some centrally acting sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers and NMDA receptor antagonists, because some of these medications can block tDCS effects. Other medications can potentially influence response to tDCS (e.g. SSRIs, beta-blockers); therefore, consistent with recent recommendations (2), we will assess use of these medications and include them as covariates in our statistical models.\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. SBP/DBP of \\> 150/95) or unstable or activity limiting cardiovascular or peripheral arterial disease. These exclusions are in place primarily for safety reasons, because the cold pressor task represents a cardiovascular challenge. However, uncontrolled hypertension can also affect pain perception, which is another reason for excluding these individuals.\n* Neurological disease (e.g. Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy) or evidence of previous brain injury, including stroke and traumatic brain injury.\n* Serious psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization within the past 12 months or characterized by active suicidal ideation.\n* Current substance use disorder or history of hospitalization for treatment of substance use disorder.\n* Diminished cognitive function that would interfere with understanding of study procedures.",
