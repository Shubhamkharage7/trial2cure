            "briefSummary": "This is a 12 month study of up to 500 people with COPD to determine if the NuvoAir clinical service leads to lower rates of severe COPD exacerbations, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and total cost of care compared to a similar group that doesn't receive care from the NuvoAir clinical service.",
            "detailedDescription": "Description: The program will be a virtual (decentralized), pragmatic evaluation of an implementation of the NuvoAir Clinical service for patients with COPD residing in the United States of America and who are enrolled with one or more health insurers or providers supporting the program. The evaluation will be organized around two cohorts; Patients with an ICD10 code for COPD (in the health insurer's or provider's database);\n\n* Who use the NuvoAir Clinical service vs those\n* Who undergo standard care (matched control - no intervention)\n\nEach patient in the NuvoAir cohort will receive their routine clinical care from their primary care provider with the addition of the NuvoAir Clinical service. The NuvoAir Clinical service offers comprehensive monitoring of health parameters and patient-reported outcomes as well as personalized clinical and behavioral interventions tailored to the patients' unique needs and their clinical risk. Furthermore, it involves virtual interaction with a NuvoAir Coach who provides guidance and assistance in navigating and utilizing the service. A dedicated NuvoAir care coordinator is available to offer self-management support and educational resources, aiming to enhance the management of COPD and other comorbidities. In situations where patients encounter new or worsening symptoms, the NuvoAir clinical team is accessible to provide medical intervention, advice and triage as required.\n\nEach patient in the standard care cohorts will receive their routine clinical care from their healthcare provider as usual. Only anonymized data that is usually collected by their health insurer or provider will be subject to analysis, no additional data will be collected for the standard care cohort.\n\nNuvoAir and standard care cohorts will be matched on the basis of age, gender, disease severity (ICD10 code for COPD with a severe exacerbation of COPD in the previous 12 months), geographic place and period of entry into the program. The program period will include 1 year of active participation (for NuvoAir users) followed by 1 year of follow-up using health insurer or provider records.\n\nObjectives: To determine if use of the NuvoAir clinical service results in a lower rate and number of moderate and severe exacerbations of COPD, lower readmissions due to COPD exacerbation within a 30-day period following a COPD exacerbation, lower days in hospital and lower healthcare costs compared with the matched cohorts of standard care patients who do not use the NuvoAir clinical service. To determine if use of the NuvoAir results in reduced readmissions due to COPD during the 30-day period following an exacerbation, improved health status and improved adherence compared with prior to the program/baseline."
