            "briefSummary": "This study aims to develop and test a brief, digital, suicide prevention intervention for sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth who have experienced cyberbullying. Leading up to this phase, the study team completed two prior study aims, focused on identifying perspectives of SGM youth's regarding their experiences with cyberbullying and priorities for an intervention, and a phase in which SGM youth codesigned the study's intervention with the study team. This resulted in the development of study's intervention, Flourish, which leverages a text messaging-based chatbot to reduce suicide risk following cyberbullying among SGM youth through improving distress tolerance, motivation for help-seeking, and social problem-solving.\n\nCurrent Study Aim:\n\nConduct an open trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Flourish among cyberbullied SGM youth, ages 12-17 (N=10).\n\nHypotheses:\n\nFeasibility will be evidenced by recruitment/retention rates \\> 80% and use of Flourish among \\> 70% of SGM youth.\n\nAt follow-up, adolescents will report improved problem-solving capacity, distress tolerance, and motivation for help-seeking and reduced psychological distress and suicidal ideation compared to baseline.",
            "detailedDescription": "FLOURISH:\n\nFlourish is a chatbot that will aim to improve adolescents' capacity to cope following cyberbullying and reduce their suicidal risk. The duration of Flourish is 4 weeks. Flourish is designed to be self-paced with branching logic, aiming to provide the right type of support at the right time youth need it. Therefore, the frequency with which youth interact with Flourish will differ from person to person. However, participants are expected to interact with Flourish no less than 2-3 times per week.\n\nOnboarding. Prior to initiating Flourish, adolescents and their caregivers will participate in a session of approximately 30 minutes with a study clinician in which they will onboard to Flourish. During onboarding, the clinician will orient the adolescent to Flourish and load information onto Flourish that will be available to the adolescent throughout their use of the intervention. This will include personal crisis contacts, such as trusted adults and crisis hotlines they could contact in the event of a crisis, as well as contacts for people they could reach out to for support or distraction outside of a crisis situation, such as a close friend or a family member. Adolescents will additionally enter information to personalize their experience with Flourish, such as entering preferences for coping skills that work best for them. During the onboarding process, caregivers will be provided with resources to respond to cyberbullying s as well as information on their child's personal crisis resources.\n\nLaunch. The research team will administer brief questionnaires to adolescents 2-3 times per week during the 4-week intervention period that assess positive/supportive and negative/bullying interactions on social media. If adolescents indicate negative interactions, Flourish will automatically launch. If adolescents indicate supportive interactions (or no interactions), they will be given the option to launch Flourish to practice their coping skills, so they are prepared to respond to future cyberbullying events.\n\nResource Website:\n\nParticipants receiving Flourish will also have access to an accompanying website. The website will not collect or store any private information from the participant, and the participant will not interact with the website. It is a publicly available website that provides a list of resources participants may use, if needed. For example, this will include SGM mental health organizations and organizations that provide education, support, and advocacy for youth who have experienced cyberbullying.\n\nTreatment Targets:\n\nTo reduce psychological distress and suicidal ideation, Flourish will deploy distress tolerance skills and utilize principles of problem-solving therapy and motivational interviewing.\n\nProblem-Solving. Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention that aims to improve coping with stressful life events. PST has shown efficacy in reducing suicide risk among youth and has been successfully delivered in a self-guided online format. Flourish will target: problem identification by aiding youth in appraising the threat of the cyberbullying event they experienced and their socioemotional consequences, generation of potential solutions based on available resources for response, and decision-making through considering barriers and facilitators to putting solutions into action.\n\nMotivation. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered approach that provides a framework for enhancing intrinsic motivation for change that has shown efficacy for improving help-seeking among youth at suicidal risk and has been used in digital mental health interventions. Flourish will incorporate the spirit of MI through its clinical style (i.e., collaborative, empowering language) and MI techniques through responses that are affirming, reflections to demonstrate the chatbot is listening, and offer simple summaries to evoke a change mindset. Flourish will engage strategies to support self-efficacy by focusing on confidence in help-seeking. Through a library of messages, refined to assure fidelity with MI principles, Flourish will elicit thoughts about seeking help following cyberbullying, assess readiness for behavior change through rulers that assess importance and confidence in change, and make a plan for help-seeking. Youth will be offered individualized feedback through stories of SGM adolescents' help-seeking experiences. Developed by writers in partnership with SGM youth, stories will target key motivational barriers to help-seeking following cyberbullying identified in the investigators' pilot data: trust, confidentiality, fear of negative appraisal, and disbelief that help will be effective. Stories will be tailored, i.e., offering examples for youth of differing ages, genders, and identities, and will consider experiences specific to SGM youth of color.\n\nDistress Tolerance. Flourish will be designed to support adolescents' tolerance of distress in recognition that sustained distress experiences contribute to suicidal ideation and interfere with adaptive problem-solving. Flourish will lead youth in monitoring distress levels and respond with a coping skills library that leverages existing online content, focusing on distraction and self-soothing (e.g., guided meditation, breathing exercises, and savoring positive memories)."
