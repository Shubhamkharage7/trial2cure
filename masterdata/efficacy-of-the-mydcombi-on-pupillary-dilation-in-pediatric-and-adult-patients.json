            "briefSummary": "To raise the standard of care, improve the overall patient experience and streamline practice flow, Eyenovia has developed an innovative mydriatic to be delivered as a microdose by a specialized dispenser. While still achieving effective pupil dilation, MydCombi has the potential to increase patient throughput at practicing offices by decreasing time spent eye dropping patients, eliminating time wasted waiting between drop instillations and ensuring more accurate drug delivery. The proposed study hopes to demonstrate the non-inferiority of using MydCombi to achieve pupillary dilation in patients compared to standard of care eye drops.",
