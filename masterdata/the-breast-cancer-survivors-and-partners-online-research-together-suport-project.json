            "briefSummary": "Many breast cancer survivors (estimated 70% in some studies) experience clinically significant depression and/or anxiety in the months and years after finishing cancer treatments. This research will build on the rigor of prior research to reduce breast cancer survivor depression and anxiety with a compassion meditation intervention called CBCT (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) for online synchronous delivery that is also inclusive of informal caregivers (i.e., adult family members who live with and typically provide half the care for survivors, aka supportive partners).",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this project is to determine if CBCT (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) can reduce distress for survivors compared to an attention control (Health Education; HE) when delivered by Zoom to both survivors and caregivers/ supportive partners as a dyad (i.e., CBCT for dyads; CBCT-D). We will also test whether instructing survivors and caregivers/ supportive partners together in CBCT (CBCT-D) reduces distress more than when survivors receive CBCT instruction by themselves, without caregivers/ supportive partners (i.e., CBCT for survivors; CBCT-S). The following specific aims address these questions:\n\nAim 1: Determine if survivors and caregivers/ supportive partners exhibit less depression and anxiety (primary outcomes) when survivors receive online CBCT along with their informal caregiver// supportive partner (CBCT-D), compared to when survivors receive online CBCT alone (CBCT-S) or when survivors and informal caregivers// supportive partners receive online HE. We will recruit dyads (N=226) consisting of survivors (between 3 months and 5 years post treatments with curative intent, i.e., chemotherapy, radiation, surgery) and their caregivers/ supportive partners. H1: Survivors and caregivers randomized to CBCT-D will exhibit greater improvements in distress (i.e., depression, anxiety; primary outcomes in survivors) at months 2, 3, and 8 versus those randomized to CBCT-S or HE.\n\nAim 2: Test the extent to which reductions in survivor's depression and anxiety from online CBCT-D are mediated by social connection, dyadic function, and caregiver/ supportive partner distress. H2a: Survivor's social connection and dyadic function will mediate the effects of online CBCT-D versus HE on survivor's distress at months 2, 3 and 8. H2b: Caregiver's social connection, dyadic function, and distress will mediate the effects of CBCT-D versus CBCT-S or HE on survivor's distress.\n\nAim 3: Explore the effects of online CBCT-D versus CBCT-S and HE on survivor diurnal cortisol rhythm at months 2, 3 and 8, and the extent to which cortisol rhythm is a marker versus mediator of improvements in survivor's distress at month 2, 3, and 8."
