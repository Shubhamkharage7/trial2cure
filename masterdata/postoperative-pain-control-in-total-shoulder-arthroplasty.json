            "briefSummary": "A double blind, prospective, randomized trial to evaluate postoperative pain, narcotic use, patient satisfaction, and function among shoulder arthroplasty patients receiving interscalene block with and without the addition of liposomal bupivacaine.",
            "detailedDescription": "In order to reduce narcotic abuse potential, orthopaedic surgeons have explored multimodal pain regimens in addition to regional anesthesia to improve postoperative pain control. One commonly used intervention to reduce postoperative shoulder pain has been the interscalene brachial plexus block. This block provides significant pain relief for shoulder procedures, but has been limited to less than 24 hours even with long acting anesthetics. In the setting of shoulder arthroplasty, this short-term pain control often leads to the need for increased narcotic pain medication. Since shoulder arthroplasty has been steadily increasing in the United States with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, it is imperative to control patients' postoperative pain without increasing their risk for opiate abuse. A potential method for achieving this is by using liposomal bupivacaine in the interscalene blocks.\n\nThis study is a double blind, prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the postoperative pain profiles among shoulder arthroplasty patients receiving interscalene block with and without the addition of liposomal bupivacaine. The purpose of this study is to determine if patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty with an interscalene brachial plexus block with liposomal bupivacaine (study group) or without liposomal bupivacaine (control group) will have differences in postoperative opiate consumption, patient-reported pain, satisfaction with surgery, and shoulder function."
