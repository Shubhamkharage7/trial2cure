            "briefSummary": "Chronic pain, including spinal pain and osteoarthritis, is the leading cause of years lived with disability world-wide and the costliest health condition in the U.S. today. Compounding these concerns, opioid analgesics remain the primary pharmacological treatment for chronic pain. An estimated 21-29% of chronic pain patients receiving long-term opioid therapy develop opioid misuse, and opioid misuse portends addiction and overdose. Clearly, chronic pain patients need better, non-addictive treatment options designed to reverse the downward spiral of chronic pain.",

Jazz Group 1: Participants in this group will watch an introduction to jazz appreciation video prior to the 4-week intervention.\n2. Jazz Group 2 (Mindful Jazz) Group: Participants in this group will watch a video on mindful listening to jazz.\n3. Music Waitlist Group: Participants in this group will serve as a control and will not receive any intervention until the study is completed. They will complete a baseline survey and a follow-up survey at four weeks. Some videos will be sent to this group after the study is completed, without tracking their usage.\n\nIntervention\n\nAll groups will complete a baseline and 4-week follow-up survey.\n\nParticipants in Jazz Group 1 and Jazz Group 2 will engage in daily listening 4-week intervention.They will have access to electronic audio recordings, with the order of listening labeled for each day.
