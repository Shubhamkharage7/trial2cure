            "detailedDescription": "Chronic pain is the most prevalent and disabling medical condition, and no single therapy has proven to be completely successful for alleviating pain, such as migraine headache. It is well documented, and recommended in the recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, that a multimodal approach is optimal for pain management. This study will evaluate a combination transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and stress reduction training for migraine.\n\nInvestigators will recruit participants who have migraines and randomize to one of four potential treatment arms (real or sham stimulation + real or sham stress reduction training). Brain imaging (MRI and PET) and clinical data will be collected before and after 8 weeks of the combination therapy.\n\nHealthy controls will also be recruited for collection of the same baseline brain imaging and clinical data, but with no treatment or second data collection phase.\n\nFindings from this research will help elucidate brain activity and inflammation associated with migraines and evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy in reducing migraine."
