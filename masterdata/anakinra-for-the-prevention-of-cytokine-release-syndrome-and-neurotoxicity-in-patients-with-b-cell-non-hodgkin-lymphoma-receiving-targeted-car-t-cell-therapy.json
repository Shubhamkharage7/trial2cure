CAR-T cell therapy may be complicated by two potentially life-threatening side effects: CRS and neurotoxicity. Anakinra is a drug typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but may also help in preventing CAR-T cell-related cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.",

Patients should also undergo at screening an x-ray, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) or CT, bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and biopsy (if clinically indicated), and lumbar puncture (if clinically indicated), and at follow-up as clinically indicated. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.\n\nAfter completion of lisocabtagene maraleucel infusion, patients are followed up periodically for up to 90 days."
