            "briefSummary": "Several studies have shown that operator exposure via left transradial catheterization has yielded less operator exposure compared to standard right transradial procedure. However, in light of new data, the investigators hypothesize a hyperadducted right arm during right transradial cardiac catheterization will yield comparable, or the same operator radiation exposure.",
            "detailedDescription": "Few studies have examined operator's radiation exposure tor transradial cardiac catheterization between the left vs right radial artery approach. In light of recent studies (Schiabasi et al) demonstrating adduction of the right arm yields lower operator exposure than that of the right arm positioned away from the body to the operators. The investigators seek to examine if hyper adduction of the right arm yields similar operator exposure to that of the left radial approach.\n\nHistorically the left radial approach has been more favorable in terms of operator exposure. However, the primary access site for interventional cardiologists has been the right radial artery due to cardiac catheterization laboratories set up for operators to work on the right side of the table. This study seeks to find if a hyperadducted right arm yields less, more, or similar radiation exposure to the operator in cardiac catheterization laboratory than the left radial artery approach.\n\nThis study's primary outcome is to measure the radiation exposure to the primary operator during diagnostic cardiac catheterization at four different anatomical locations (these are Maimonides Medical Center employees -attending physicians in the catheterization lab). Study's secondary outcomes aim to measure Dose Area Product, mGy of radiation dose, \\& contrast administration to the patients undergoing the procedure and presence/absence of subclavian artery tortuosity which are recorded automatically and regardless during the diagnostic procedure."
