This will provide prospectively collected data on the safety and efficacy of a three-fraction regimen in the previously defined \"No Fly Zone\" for both primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for lung metastases of any histology. This registration describes the design and eligibility criteria for the 36 NSCLC subjects the investigators plan to enroll. Local control, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival results from the NSCLC patients will be compared to both 3- and 5-fraction historical controls, specifically RTOG 0236 and 0813 results.\n\nThe outcomes of the metastatic patients will also be reported.\n\nThere will also be a quality-of-life component to the study to assess the impact of a shorter overall treatment time and the clinical impact of radiation side effects."
