            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nAs people age, the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin begin to release less of this hormone, and levels of blood glucose (sugar) rise. This can lead to illnesses such as diabetes. Urolithin A (UA) is a natural nutritional supplement that may improve how the body controls blood glucose.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if UA improves levels of insulin and other hormones that help control blood glucose.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 55 years and older with a body mass index of 27 or higher.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 6 clinic visits over 8 weeks.\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood and urine tests and a test of their heart function.\n\nUA gelcaps are taken by mouth every morning at home. Half of participants will take UA. The other half will take a placebo. The placebo looks like the study drug but does not contain any medicine. Participants will not know which they are taking.\n\nParticipants will have tests during the study including:\n\nOral glucose tolerance: Participants will drink a sweet liquid. Blood will be drawn at intervals over the next 3 hours.\n\nContinuous glucose monitor: A sensor with a needle that goes just under the skin will be placed on the upper arm. Participants will wear this sensor throughout the study.\n\nExercise. Participants will walk on a treadmill while their heart rate, hearth rhythm, and blood pressure are monitored. They will walk in a hallway at normal and fast paces.\n\nImaging scans of the thigh; scans of the brain are optional.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nWe hypothesize that supplementation with the nutritional supplement urolithin A (UA) in healthy adults \\>= 55 years old will; (i) increase insulin secretion by boosting beta cell metabolism of glucose, resulting in increased ATP generation as pyruvate enters the TCA cycle after glycolysis, thereby enhancing early, acute insulin secretion and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle -both of which will lower circulating levels of blood glucose, (ii) boost production and secretion of incretin hormones because their secretion is also dependent on cellular depolarization, (iii) boost mitochondrial function in brain and muscle tissues. (iv) alter gut microbiome. These effects will be examined over an 8-week period. The study will include a Screening Visit and 5 additional study visits.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine if UA supplementation will increase the rate at which beta cells respond to glucose.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nInvestigate if UA alters incretin secretion in response to oral glucose (incretins are secreted only in response to nutrients) and uncover if UA increases brain and skeletal muscle metabolism.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nTo determine if urolithin A supplementation will influence insulin secretion in response to oral glucose at 4 and 8 weeks after supplementation.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n* To determine if UA supplementation will increase incretin secretion in response to oral glucose at 4 and 8 weeks after the supplementation.\n* To determine if UA supplementation will enhance mitochondria respiration, based on p31 spectroscopy by thigh MRI/MRS at baseline and 8 weeks after supplementation.\n* To determine if UA will increase brain oxidative metabolism, based on brain MRS at baseline and 8 weeks after supplementation.\n* To determine if UA supplementation will alter gut microbiome composition.\n* To determine if Uroltihin A supplementation alters the percentage of immune cell types."
