            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nChimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy is a form of immunotherapy which can be used to treat people with relapsed B-ALL. For those who achieve remission after CART alone, it may cure up to 50% of people who receive this therapy. However, for people who relapse after CART, it can be hard to achieve remission again. In patients where CART fails, stem cell transplant (HCT) can be used to prevent relapse and achieve cure. But HCT can cause serious side effects. Better testing is needed to distinguish people who can be cured with CART alone from people who may also need to have HCT.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if the use of a series of blood and bone marrow tests at regular intervals can help monitor for B-ALL relapse after CART therapy.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 1 to 25 years with B-ALL who have had CART therapy within the past 42 days. They must never have had a blood stem cell transplant; they must also have no measurable blood cancer cells.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will visit the clinic every 2 weeks starting 42 days after they receive CART therapy. Each visit will be about the same amount of time as a regular clinic visit. about 8 hours.\n\nParticipants will have blood drawn for testing on each visit.\n\nBone marrow biopsy/aspirate will be done during 4 of the visits at routine timepoints after CART. A needle will be inserted to draw a sample of tissue from inside the bone in the hip.\n\nA small amount of blood and tissue will be tested with ClonoSEQ and to evaluate for normal B-cells side by side with the standard tests.\n\nThe combined testing may help determine whether participants are eligible for HCT and/or at risk of relapse after CART.\n\nParticipants will be in the study for 1 year",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Given the dismal outcomes for patients who experience a relapse following CD19 CART and the potential for using Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for post-CART remission consolidation for relapse prevention, there is a clear opportunity to improve outcomes for patients with B-ALL who proceed to CART. With a goal of improving overall survival, it remains critically important to be able to predict which patients are at high risk of relapse in whom an HCT would be indicated for remission consolidation. Distinguishing this high-risk cohort from low-risk patients who are able to maintain durable remission following CART and in whom HCT-associated toxicities could be avoided is equally important.\n* Thus, in the context of this biomarker-based study, we propose a systematic approach utilizing the best-known biomarkers for remission monitoring which assess both functional CART persistence and incorporates antigen immunophenotype agnostic approach for disease detection will improve LFS post CD19 CART.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To assess efficacy of a novel biomarker-guided risk-based strategy to monitor remission, both by assessing functional CART persistence and incorporating antigen immunophenotype agnostic approach (NGS monitoring) for disease detection, to inform decisions regarding post-CART HCT needed intervention, and to successfully collect biomarker samples at the scheduled times in enrolled HCT naive B-ALL participants receiving CD19 CART.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Age \\>=1 year and \\<= 25 years old at the time of CD19 CART infusion\n* Diagnosis of CD19+ B-ALL in a bone marrow morphologic complete remission and are flow cytometry measurable residual disease (MRD) negative within 42 days post CD19 CART infusion.\n* Unsupported neutrophil count \\> 500 cell/mm\\^3\n* Must have an allogeneic HCT donor identified for potential HCT\n* B-cell aplasia post CD19 CART persisting until the time of the first on-study intervention\n\nDesign:\n\n-This single-arm multicenter study will enroll pediatric and young adult participants to evaluate the feasibility, and potential efficacy, of a risk-based, biomarker-driven, consolidation HCT strategy following CD19 CART."

Note: Determination of uncontrolled, symptomatic illness or social situation that would limit compliance with the study requirements will be made by the site-PI and documented in the research record.",
