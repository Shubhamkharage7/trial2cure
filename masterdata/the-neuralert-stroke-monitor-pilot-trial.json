Each patient will be monitored for up to five days, depending on device connectivity or battery duration. Each monitoring session will consist of wearing a Neuralert device on each arm. For this pilot trial, we are interested in learning about Wi-Fi connectivity, successful data transmission, clinical usability, and tolerability."
