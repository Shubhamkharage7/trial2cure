Movement and fitness trackers record movement and a number of different metrics such as steps, heart rate, and calories burned. The use of movement and fitness trackers can provide a more objective and precise estimate of patient performance status and help identify those most at risk for adverse events and hospitalization.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if in-office movement trackers identify those patients who are at highest risk for serious adverse events (SAEs) on early and developmental therapeutics (EDT) cancer trials.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nSecondary objectives are related to outpatient activity trackers. I. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination, with baseline measurement of activity classification using outpatient activity trackers in the 7 days after screening visit.\n\nII. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination, with the change in activity level classification between the week after screening visit and the week after the start of EDT.\n\nIII. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination, with averaged activity level classification in the first 4 weeks of the EDT.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients participant in movement assessment during 2 clinical trial visits. Patients also wear a Fitbit to track movements and complete a smartphone based Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) diary over 5-10 minutes to measure physical function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social isolation, appetite, and body weight for up to 180 days."
