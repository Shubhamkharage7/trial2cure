            "detailedDescription": "Effective treatment for symptoms associated with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of insight into disease etiology/pathophysiology, costly and potentially invasive procedures, and a lack of research into potential therapeutics. The primary objective of this study is to determine if a supervised exercise program by a trained exercise physiologist can relieve pain and improve urinary and bladder symptoms in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. This has the potential to open enormous future avenues of research, save both patients and the healthcare system cost, and most importantly improve patients' lives. A second objective of this study is to determine if exercise alters depressive symptoms, often a comorbid diagnosis, in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. A third objective of this study is to examine urinary markers of inflammation before and after exercise in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome."

Muscle strength and endurance training will begin using no weight and performing one set of 6 repetitions. Progression using added resistance in the form of dumbbell weights (1-6 lbs.) and increased sets and repetitions will be applied as Subjects become increasingly fit. For static range of motion exercise, positions will be held for 10-15 seconds in the beginning and increased over time. Exercise will be kept at a moderate level of intensity. Each session will then end with relaxation training.",
