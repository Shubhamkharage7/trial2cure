The objective is to compare differences in engagement and retention in treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder. The investigators also intend to understand the prevalence of opioid overdoses and OUD among youth in Houston.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Houston Emergency Response Opioid Engagement System for Youths and Adolescents (Young HEROES) is a non-randomized cohort study based at the University of Texas Health Science Center of Houston. This study recruits participants through three avenues: assertive community outreach with a peer coach and paramedic following and opioid overdose, community referrals, and emergency department referrals. The study explores the effect of the combination of assertive outreach, same-day induction into medication for opioid use disorder, ongoing maintenance treatment, behavioral counseling, peer recovery support, and paramedic follow-up on patient outcomes. The primary outcome is engagement and retention in outpatient treatment. Secondary outcomes include quality of life assessment as well as subsequent relapses and overdoses. The hypothesis is that patients with earlier induction into MOUD treatment who receive routine follow-up, are more likely to engage and remain in treatment long-term."
