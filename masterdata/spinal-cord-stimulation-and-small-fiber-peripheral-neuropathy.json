Participants enrolled into the study will be randomized into one of three groups, two of which are treatment groups and the third is a control group. A time course of measurements before and after spinal cord stimulation (SCS) treatment (where applicable) will assess pain, DPN severity, small fiber nerve activity, and metabolic health markers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is caused by diabetes, aging, chemotherapy, and over 30 other conditions, and impacts more than 30 million patients in the US alone. Diabetes is the number one cause of peripheral neuropathy, and more than half of patients with diabetes will eventually develop diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a complex set of symptoms including pain, numbness, tingling, and burning. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an approved intervention for the treatment of chronic pain, including DPN. Spinal cord stimulation has had FDA approval for the treatment of painful DPN since 2015. This study is being done to learn more about the diagnosis of DPN and treatment of DPN with SCS."
