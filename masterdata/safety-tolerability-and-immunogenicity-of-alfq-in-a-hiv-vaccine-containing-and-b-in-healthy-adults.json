The purpose of this phase I randomized, double-blind clinical trial is to optimize vaccine adjuvant ALFQ dosing by assessing safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Safety and tolerability will be assessed with both clinical and laboratory monitoring. Sixty human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative participants will be enrolled to one of three arms. Vaccinations via intramuscular (IM) injection will occur at months 0, 1, and 2. All participants will receive A244 and B.63521 (300 micrograms of each). In addition, Arm 1 will receive 200 micrograms of ALFQ. Arm 2 will receive 100 micrograms of ALFQ. Arm 3 will receive 50 micrograms of ALFQ.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this Phase I randomized, double-blind clinical trial is to optimize ALFQ dosing. Safety will be assessed through the frequency of the overall and specific post-vaccination reactions. Blood will be collected to assess humoral, cell-mediated, and innate immune responses.\n\nHealthy adults not living with HIV who are available for 14 months will be enrolled. A total of 60 participants will be enrolled to one of three arms, each comprised of 20 candidate vaccine recipients. Each arm will receive identical doses of A244 and B.63521 (300 micrograms of each). In addition, Arm 1 will receive 200 micrograms of ALFQ. Arm 2 will receive 100 micrograms of ALFQ. Arm 3 will receive 50 micrograms of ALFQ. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity will then be compared among the three arms to determine the optimal dose of ALFQ.\n\nAll vaccinations will be split into 2 half doses which will both be administered intramuscularly (IM) into the same deltoid muscle. Vaccinations will occur at months 0, 1, and 2. The second vaccination will be administered into the contralateral deltoid at study month 1 compared to the first vaccination at study month 0. The third vaccination at study month 2 will be administered into the same deltoid as the first vaccination at study month 0. Participants will be followed for 12 months following the last study vaccination. Safety and tolerability will be assessed with both clinical and laboratory monitoring. Vaccine- related reactions will be observed and solicited for 30 minutes post-vaccination and with the aid of a diary card and interview of participants during the 14 days post vaccination.\n\nThe information gained from the review of the diary card and the interview with the participants will be documented in the clinical study chart. In addition, adverse events (AEs) will be documented at each clinical encounter. AEs will be graded for seriousness, severity, and relationship to the investigational product."

Able and willing to comply with all research requirements, in the opinion of the Investigator\n5. Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study\n6. Minimum body weight of 110 pounds (lbs) (50kg)\n7. Laboratory Criteria within 30 days before enrollment:\n\n   1. Hemoglobin \u2265 12.0 g/dL for women; \u2265 12.5 g/dL for men\n   2.

No reproductive potential due to post-menopausal status (12 months of natural \\[spontaneous\\] amenorrhea) or hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation\n   2. People of childbearing potential should agree to practice highly effective contraception at least 30 days before enrollment and through 3 months post-last vaccination, using one of the following methods: condoms (male or female) with spermicide; diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicide; intrauterine device; contraceptive pills, patch, injection, intravaginal ring or other FDA-approved contraceptive method; male partner has previously undergone a vasectomy; abstinence\n   3.

For all participants assigned female at birth, except those with a history of hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, a negative \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test (urine) on the day of enrollment and each vaccination day is required.

Received an investigational product in the 30 days before enrollment, or planned to receive during the study period. This does not include products with emergency use authorization.\n3. Concurrent participation in another clinical research study\n4. Any serious medical illness or condition\n5. Receipt of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months before enrollment\n6. Any history of anaphylaxis or allergy to study product\n7. History of sickle cell trait or disease\n8. Pregnancy, lactation, or intention to become pregnant during the study\n9.

History of chronic or active neurologic disease to include seizure disorder and chronic migraine headaches. Exceptions are: i) childhood febrile seizures, or ii) seizures secondary to alcohol withdrawal more than 3 years ago\n24. Subjects receiving any of the following substances:\n\n    1. Systemic immunosuppressive medications or cytotoxic medications within 12 weeks before enrollment \\[with the exception of a short course of corticosteroids (\u2264 14 days duration or a single injection) for a self-limited condition at least 2 weeks before enrollment; inhaled, intranasal or topical steroids are not considered exclusionary\n    2. Treatment with known immunomodulators including allergy immunotherapy (other than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \\[NSAIDs\\] or stable maintenance immunotherapy (doses not in the process of being increased), at the discretion of the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT)) for any reason\n    3. Live attenuated vaccines within 30 days before initial study vaccine administration\n    4. Medically indicated subunit, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), or killed vaccines, e.g., influenza, pneumococcal, vaccines with Quillaja saponaria-21 (QS-21) as an adjuvant, or allergy treatment with antigen injections, planned for administration 14 days before or after study vaccine administration\n25. History of arthritis diagnosis other than osteoarthritis\n26. History of other diagnosed rheumatoid disorders\n27. Has an acute illness or temperature \u226538.0 degrees Celsius (C)/100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (F) on any study injection day or within 48 hours of planned study injection.\n\nNote: Participants will not be excluded from further consideration for enrollment and study injections. Volunteers with fever or an acute illness on the day of study injection or in the 2 days before the study injection may be re-assessed by a study physician for resolution of the condition and enrolled and receive the study injection so long as the injection is within allowable windows. Military personnel will be excluded from participation in this study, regardless of leave status due to the potential for a false-positive HIV test result on mandatory HIV testing. This could have adverse effects on deployment status.\n\nFinal evaluation of eligibility will be based on the medical judgment of the investigator based on his/her medical and research experience.",
