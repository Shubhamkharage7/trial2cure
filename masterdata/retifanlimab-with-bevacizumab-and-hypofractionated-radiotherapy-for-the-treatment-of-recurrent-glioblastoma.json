            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well retifanlimab with bevacizumab and hypofractionated radiotherapy, compared to bevacizumab and hypofractionated radiotherapy alone, works in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as retifanlimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving retifanlimab with bevacizumab and hypofractionated radiotherapy may work better in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma than bevacizumab and hypofractionated radiotherapy alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate the overall survival at 9 months (OS-9) of the combination of retifanlimab, bevacizumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) vs. the control group treated with bevacizumab and HFRT.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the overall survival (OS) in this patient population for each regimen.\n\nII. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) in this patient population for each regimen.\n\nIII. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) in this patient population for each regimen.\n\nIV. To assess the neurologic function by Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) in this patient population for each regimen.\n\nV. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events in this patient population for each regimen.\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the anti-glioma immune response before and after retifanlimab including assessment of immune cells phenotyping, function and activation in the pre-/post-treatment blood, and changes in cytokine levels over time.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms\n\nARM A: Patients receive retifanlimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and bevacizumab IV on day 1 and 15 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo HFRT once daily (QD), starting in cycle 1 on day 15 for 10 treatments. Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), as well as blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nARM B: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on day 1 and 15 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo HFRT QD, starting in cycle 1 on day 15 for 10 treatments. Patients undergo MRI or CT, as well as blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days. Survival follow-up is every 2 months for the first year, and then every 6 months for up to 4 years from registration."
