Firearm-related events have become more prevalent in the past few years . Active shooter events, mass casualties, assaults, and homicide are more commonplace which leads to an increase of trauma patients needing management of penetrating injuries. On average, penetrating traumas only make up 14% of comparable center patient volumes. In spring 2022, we also were ranked 3/10 for our penetrating trauma outcomes with lower than expected mortality (TQIP Benchmarking Report). Together, as a Level 1 trauma center with above average penetrating injury volume we must take efforts to best understand the opportunities for our patients and disseminate those observations to the trauma community"
