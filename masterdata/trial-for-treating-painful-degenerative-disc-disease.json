Randomization is 2:1, with 28 in the treatment group and 14 in the sham control group.\n\nA pretreatment visit will occur at or before the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the clinical site at 3- and 12 months post injection. Target enrollment is 42 subjects. Patients in the control group can crossover to the treatment group after 3-month follow-up. Crossover patients then follow the treatment group follow-up timeline based on their second real treatment. Subjects will complete the study following the 1-year follow-up visit.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to observe the improvement in subject-reported clinical outcomes from baseline to 3 months after 2nd treatment and between groups at 3 months, with continued evaluation of efficacy and durability up to 12 months. Questionnaires are completed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months."

Once the lamina is reached the physician injects 2.5 cc of PPP into the multifidus muscle on one side and then repeat this on the opposite side for each level. The physician guides a needle into the supraneural transforaminal space to perform an epidural injection with 2cc of 4x PL and 1 cc of 0.5% ropivacaine. Next, a needle will then be guided into the facet joint to perform an intra-articular injection with 1cc of 14x PRP. Any tendon insertion areas will be injected using ultrasound guidance with platelet lysate dextrose. The supraspinous/interspinous, SI ligaments at the involved degenerative levels will be injected with 4x PL/12.5% dextrose/0.125% ropivacaine.
