            "detailedDescription": "Resorbable oxidized cellulose materials are commonly used as hemostatic agents in medicine and dentistry. Surgicel and ActCel are used daily in surgical practice. When these products come in contact with blood, they convert to a gel that expands to cause direct pressure on blood vessels and control bleeding. ActCel is water-soluble and dissolves over a short time period. It can be removed easily when water, saline or hydrogen peroxide is applied.The study team will examine the effects of ACM as a wound dressing for the donor area and compare the rate of epithelialization with and without its use."
