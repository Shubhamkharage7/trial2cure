The researchers will do research tests to look for genetic differences between HER2+ breast cancer that has spread to the brain and progressed during treatment with tucatinib and cancers that are being treated with tucatinib for the first time.",
            "detailedDescription": "All patients will receive tucatinib per-protocol at standard dose of 300 mg orally twice daily on days - 4, -3, -2, -1 and day 0 (in AM). The post-surgery treatment (systemic and/or local) will be decided according to treating physician discretion and is not a study intervention. Tissue samples of brain metastases along with blood/plasma and CSF samples will be analyzed to evaluate brain tumor penetration of tucatinib as well as biologic response to tucatinib in patients with brain metastases from HER2+/mutant breast cancer who are undergoing clinically indicated brain surgery."
