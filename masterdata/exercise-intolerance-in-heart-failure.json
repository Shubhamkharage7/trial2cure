Heart muscle and skeletal muscle (in the legs and arms) depend on normal metabolism (the conversion of foods to chemical fuel) to function properly. Investigators will measure metabolites in the heart and leg muscles, including the levels of high energy phosphates and lipids (fats) using magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. High-energy phosphates serve as a source of energy, which is used by the heart and skeletal muscle for contraction. Magnetic resonance uses magnetic fields to measure the levels of these substances."
