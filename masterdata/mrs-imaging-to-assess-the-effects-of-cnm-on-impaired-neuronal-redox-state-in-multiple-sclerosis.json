The primary endpoint for this study changes from baseline to week 12 in CNS metabolic changes, based on 31P-MRSimaging.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-center open-label, sequential group, investigator blinded study of the CNS metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) within fifteen (15) years of Screening. Patients will be screened over up to a 6-week period.Patients who meet inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria may be enrolled into the clinical study. The initial cohort of patients (Cohort 1) will begin treatment at a dose of 15mg or 30mg CNM-Au8. Upon completion of the first Treatment Period, dose(s) will be selected for the subsequent cohort (Cohort 2), based on the results of the 31P-MRS change versus baseline from the first cohort. A total of two treatment cohorts may be studied. Investigators and patients will remain blinded to study dose until the study database is formally locked. All patients will receive daily oral treatment over twelve (12) consecutive weeks during each cohort's Treatment Period.\n\nThere will be three study periods per treatment cohort:\n\n1. A (6) six week screening period (Screening Period);\n2. A (12) twelve-week treatment period (Treatment Period);\n3. A (6) six-week follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment).\n\nPatients will be contacted by phone to assess safety and tolerability at Week 2. At Weeks 4, 8, and 12 patients will return to the clinic to complete PK, PD, visual acuity testing, and safety assessments. At the Baseline and Week 12 visits patients will complete 31P-MRS, MRI, and OCT imaging assessments, the 9-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, Visual Acuity (high and low contrast letter/visual acuity) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Following treatment discontinuation at Week 12, patients will complete an end-of-study (EOS) visit at Week 18. All patients who are prematurely discontinued from treatment will complete the end-of-study visit 4-weeks after discontinuation."
