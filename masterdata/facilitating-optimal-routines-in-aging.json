            "briefSummary": "Loss of cognitive abilities leading to Alzheimer's disease is progressive and destructive, leaving older adults disabled and unable to recall their past. The number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease is expected to triple by the year 2050, yet little research examines amyloid beta deposition, executive function, and progression of disability. This study will test the influence of a novel and promising non-pharmacological intervention, Strategy Training, on the progression of disability in a sample of 150 older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment who have the option to complete a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB).",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial will test the effect of Strategy Training compared to Enhanced Usual Care on change in disability among older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and assess the extent to which Central Nervous System amyloid-beta deposition and neurocognitive function modify the relationship between Strategy Training and Enhanced Usual Care on change in disability. Assessments will be obtained at Baseline, 8 week short assessment, 6 and 12 months post intervention. Interventions, such as Strategy Training, focused on slowing emergence of disability despite underlying pathology may keep older adults as engaged in meaningful daily activities for as long as possible. This project tests a novel and promising non-pharmacological intervention and will inform our understanding of important effect modifiers- amyloid beta deposition and executive function- on change in performance of cognitively challenging daily activities. Enhancing our understanding of amyloid beta deposition, executive function, disability, and a promising non-pharmacological intervention could support aging for millions of older adults who, in the near future, will experience disability related to MCI."
