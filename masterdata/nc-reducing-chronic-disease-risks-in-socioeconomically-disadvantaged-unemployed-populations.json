            "briefSummary": "The proposed study, NC Works4Health (NCW4H), builds on the strengths of long-standing academic-community research partnerships between this UNC at Chapel Hill (UNC) team of investigators and key stakeholders across health, social service, employment, and economic development sectors. The overall goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention that can be readily adopted by communities to reduce chronic disease risks in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations by (a) embedding prevention efforts in DSS-E programs at the individual level, and (b) enhancing supervisor supports for DSS-E hires at the employer level. Interventions at each level, and their joint effects, are designed to mitigate the psychological, behavioral, and clinically relevant risks for chronic disease onset, morbidity, and comorbidity that accrue with unemployment and the employment-entry transition.",
            "detailedDescription": "Studies have shown that a single episode of unemployment can trigger a cascade of stress-related coping and behavioral processes that have deleterious effects on health. Notably, this cascade not only frequently results in psychological distress, but also accelerated weight gain (persisting up to 10 years regardless of re-employment), and elevated blood pressure. As such, individuals who experience unemployment are at a much higher risk for chronic disease development, comorbidity, and early mortality. Given inequities in the labor market, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups (i.e., those with less education, less income or wealth, and/or who are racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately, and more adversely affected by both unemployment and chronic disease, and feel this burden acutely in their everyday lives. Socioeconomically disadvantaged adults often receive public assistance benefits during unemployment episodes as well as job training and placement services through Department of Social Services Employment (DSS-E) programs; however, these programs do not include prevention-focused content to reduce the chronic disease risks that accrue during unemployment episodes. In addition, DSS-E efforts to help individuals succeed in securing and performing in a new job are often thwarted by implicit 'welfare'-related bias and insufficient supports in workplaces into which DSS-E clients are hired. Although the current absence of chronic disease prevention in DSS-E programs and lack of supports for DSS-E hires in workplaces compound chronic disease risks, it is also an area in which communities can address social determinants that are known to produce health inequities.\n\nThe proposed study, NC Works4Health (NCW4H), builds on the strengths of long-standing academic-community research partnerships between this UNC at Chapel Hill (UNC) team of investigators and key stakeholders across health, social service, employment, and economic development sectors. The overall goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention that can be readily adopted by communities to reduce chronic disease risks in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations by (a) embedding prevention efforts in DSS-E programs at the individual level, and (b) enhancing supervisor supports for DSS-E hires at the employer level. Interventions at each level, and their joint effects, are designed to mitigate the psychological, behavioral, and clinically relevant risks for chronic disease onset, morbidity, and comorbidity that accrue with unemployment and the employment-entry transition. By collaborating across sectors to reduce health inequities, the specific aims will be met in two phases:\n\nPhase I\n\nWith community partners and key stakeholders, make minor adaptations to two evidence-based interventions for use in a multilevel intervention that incorporates: (a) a chronic disease prevention program (CDPP) (individual level)into current DSS-E programs for unemployed adults, and (b) supervisor support in the workplace (employer level)into an existing network of employers with jobs that match the skill set of the DSS-E program population.\n\nPhase II\n\nAim 1. To test the main effects of (a) the individual-level NC Works4Health intervention (Usual DSS-E + CDPP) compared to Usual DSS-E Support, and (b) the employer-level NC Works4Health intervention compared to usual workplace supports on primary and secondary outcomes, over time (at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline), using a randomized, 2x2 factorial design.\n\nAim 2. To test the joint effect of the individual-level + employer-level NC Works4Health interventions on primary and secondary outcomes, over time (at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline).\n\nIn the primary outcomes, the investigators expect to see a decrease in psychological distress, weight gain, and blood pressure in groups receiving the intervention at each level, with the greatest decreases in the outcomes observed in the group receiving both the individual- and employer-level interventions.\n\nSecondary outcomes include situational stress, coping style, health behaviors, perceived workplace support, health-related employment functioning and employment duration."

UNC has had considerable experience with producing deidentified datasets, because it has prepared them for a number of the studies it is coordinating or has coordinated. De-identification will include removal of obvious identifiers such as names and addresses. It will also include examination of less obvious potentially identifying variables. Continuous variables with extreme values may have the extremes truncated. Height and weight are examples of such variables. Categorical variables with small numbers of participants in some categories may have these categories pooled with larger categories.",

            "accessCriteria": "The limited-access dataset will be made available at the end of the study. Data will be released in a .csv file. Researchers wishing to use the dataset will be required to obtain approval from UNC using an agreement form that clearly specifies the intended analyses as well as assurances that HIPAA regulations will be followed. If approval is granted, the dataset will be supplied on a CD, or shared using a secure, password-protected medium. It will also include documentation describing the variables in the dataset and copies of the data collection forms used to collect the data."
