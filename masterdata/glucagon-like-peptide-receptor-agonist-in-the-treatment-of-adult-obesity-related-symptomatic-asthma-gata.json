This study will test the central hypothesis that semaglutide will improve asthma control and reduce airway inflammation due to direct effects on the respiratory tract in adult asthma associated with obesity.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a proof-of-principal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site clinical trial of semaglutide in adult (age 18 or older, n=100), obesity-related (BMI\u226530), symptomatic asthma without type II diabetes. This study will monitor clinical asthma symptom and quality of life questionnaires and airway function to determine the effect of semaglutide on asthma control. Markers of respiratory tract and adipose tissue inflammation will be monitored to determine the effect of semaglutide on airway inflammation. Study participants will be monitored for 4 weeks before assignment to treatment with the study drug for 24 weeks followed by a 2 week final monitoring period."
