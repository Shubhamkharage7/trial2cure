            "briefSummary": "The goal of this open-label, pilot clinical trial is to test allopregnanolone as a regenerative treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is a large-scale clinical trial testing how well it works in patients with PD feasible?\n2. Is allopregnanolone safe and well-tolerated in patients with PD.\n3. Can we see any signals of changes in imaging and clinical scales?\n\nParticipants will receive a weekly infusion in their vein of allopregnanolone for a total of 12 weeks. There is no placebo so everyone receives allopregnanolone and \"Open-label\" means the study is not blinded so both the participant and investigators know the assigned treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, pilot clinical trial of allopregnanolone (Allo) as a regenerative treatment for Parkinson's disease. A total of 10 study participants will receive weekly infusions of Allo for 12 weeks. Participants will be male and female, age 40-80 years with a history of idiopathic, sporadic PD who have a Hoehn \\& Yahr stage 1-4. Allo is a potent neuroregenerative agent that promotes proliferation of human neural stem cells and has the potential to function as a regenerative therapeutic to restore motor function in persons with PD. Results from several preclinical studies in rodent models of PD confirm improved motor function after Allo treatment.\n\nPrimary Objective: To assess the feasibility of a large-scale trial to determine the efficacy of weekly infusions of Allo in in patients with Idiopathic sporadic PD.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of weekly infusions of Allo in participants with idiopathic sporadic PD, and assess single-dose pharmacokinetics of allopregnanolone.\n\nTertiary / Exploratory Objectives: To assess efficacy signals of weekly infusions of Allo in participants with idiopathic sporadic PD.\n\n* Determine target engagement of Allo using dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n* Evaluate effect of Allo on motor function tests.\n* Evaluate the effect of Allo on cognitive function tests and clinical ratings.\n* Compare response to Allo administration between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers."
