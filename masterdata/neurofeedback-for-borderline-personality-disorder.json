Clinician will access subjects' alcohol and substance use on a case-by-case to determine whether specific cases of mild alcohol or substance use would also interfere with the effects of the intervention.\n* have a history of traumatic brain injury\n* are unable to complete MRI scan due to claustrophobia or general MRI exclusions (e.g., shrapnel inside body)\n* are currently pregnant or breast feeding\n* are unable to complete questionnaires written in English\n* current (within 3 weeks of testing) use of any antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, or other medications (except SSRI antidepressants) likely to influence cerebral blood flow. Effective medications will not be discontinued for the purposes of the study.
