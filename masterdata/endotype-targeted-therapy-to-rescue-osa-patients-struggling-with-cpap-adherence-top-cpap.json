            "briefSummary": "More than 10% of the US population have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Standard of care is therapy with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) which virtually eliminates OSA. However, most patients use CPAP only for part of the night (4-5hours) and about 50% patients discontinue CPAP long-term. Alternative therapies are limited, thus many OSA patients remain at risk of OSA sequelae (e.g. sleepiness, memory issues, high blood pressure, etc.). Importantly, different patients get OSA for different reasons, and recent data show that some of the underlying causes of OSA (\"endotypes\") such as having a low arousal threshold (i.e. waking up easily) are associated with lower CPAP adherence. Using a randomized controlled trial design, this will be the first study using a targeted intervention to manipulate the underlying OSA causes (i.e., giving a safe hypnotic to patients with OSA to increase the arousal threshold) to test the hypothesis that endotype-targeted therapy increases CPAP-adherence in patients who have low but continued CPAP usage. Ultimately, this strategy may improve the care and outcomes of millions of undertreated OSA patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase II trial, will test if endotype-targeted drug therapy increases CPAP adherence. Patients with low CPAP adherence (i.e. CPAP use 0.5-4h/night) will be randomized in parallel to CPAP+Eszopiclone vs CPAP+Placebo for 2 weeks. The primary outcome is mean TimeOnCPAP/night on days 2-14 after initiation of study drugs.\n\nAim 1: To test the effect of eszopiclone on CPAP usage in unselected OSA patients with low CPAP adherence.\n\nHypothesis 1: Eszopiclone improves CPAP usage more than placebo.\n\nAim 2: To test the effect of eszopiclone on CPAP usage in OSA patients with a low vs a high arousal threshold (ArTH) endotype.\n\nHypothesis 2: Eszopiclone improves CPAP usage substantially more in OSA patients with a low vs a high ArTH.\n\nFurther, this study will explore the mechanisms through which eszopiclone may affect CPAP usage, the effect of eszopiclone on underlying sleep apnea severity, and if the intervention and its potential effects on adherence translate into changes in clinically important outcomes (i.e., vigilance and sleepiness)."
