The study will consist of a small, purposeful, non-randomized sample (N = 30) of clients enrolled into a 10-session Acceptance and Commitment Therapy group. The group will be offered as part of regular clinical care at the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine. Three consecutive groups will be run with approximately 8-10 participants in each group over the next year."
