A new mHealth application for clinical trial education and communication tailored to subject needs will be developed. It was hypothesized that a culturally tailored informational mobile application will increase the participation of Black subjects in clinical trial discussions with their care team among the target population.\n\nThis study focuses on Black pancreatic cancer subjects, who experience higher mortality rates and lower clinical trial participation than White subjects. Research shows that the disparity between clinical trial participation is in part due to inequitable recruitment practices. This study will use mobile application technology (mHealth app) as an educational, communication, audit, and feedback tool to promote patient-initiated clinical trial discussions among Black people with pancreatic cancer and their cancer care team."
