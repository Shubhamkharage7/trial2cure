            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination with cobimetinib in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cobimetinib attacks a protein called MEK that has been known to stimulate cells that promote the growth of cancer cells in the body. Calaspargase pegol-mknl is an enzyme that converts the amino acid L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. Many types of cancer cell rely on the amino acid L-asparagine, and depleting this amino acid with calaspargase pegol-mknl starves cancer cells of this nutrient. Attacking the MEK protein with cobimetinib is thought to further prevent cancer cells from using this amino acid, causing them to die. Giving calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination with cobimetinib may help control the disease in patients with pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination with cobimetinib.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety of calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination with cobimetinib.\n\nII. To assess preliminary response to treatment with calaspargase pegol-mknl and cobimetinib.\n\nIII. To monitor levels of plasma asparaginase.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate therapy induced changes in the tumor and tumor ecosystem.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients receive calaspargase pegol-mknl intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo a biopsy 14 days prior to starting therapy and on day 14 of cycle 2.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months."
