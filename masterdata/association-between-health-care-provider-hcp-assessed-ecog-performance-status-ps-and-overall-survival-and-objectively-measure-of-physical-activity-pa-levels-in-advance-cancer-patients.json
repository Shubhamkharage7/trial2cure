The purpose is to advance the evidence-base for incorporating objective assessment of Physical Activity (PA) in the context of performance status assessment in advanced cancer patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the feasibility and acceptability in diverse samples of cancer patients of wireless collection and transmission of data for transfer into the open-source cyberinfrastructure (CI) called Cyberinfrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CYCORE).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 arms.\n\nARM I (COLORECTAL CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use two accelerometers, a blood pressure monitor, a heart rate monitor, a global positioning system (GPS) device, and a smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions about exercise and health-related symptoms and feelings. The devices are used for 5 consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the devices for an additional 5 days.\n\nARM II (HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use two accelerometers, a blood pressure monitor, a weight scale, and a smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions about diet and health-related symptoms. The devices are used for 5 consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the devices for an additional 5 days.\n\nARM III (HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use a smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions about diet, health-related symptoms, and swallowing exercises. Patients also take video recordings of their neck while performing swallowing exercises. The device is used for 5 consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the device for an additional 5 days.\n\nARM IV (CANCER SURVIVORS THAT ARE CURRENT/FORMER SMOKERS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use a carbon monoxide (CO) monitor and a smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions about smoking. Patients also take video recordings of themselves while exhaling into the CO monitor. The devices are used for 5 consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the devices for an additional 5 days.\n\nPANCREATIC CANCER STUDY (PCS): Patients receive post-surgical wellness program consisting of physical activity, nutrition counseling, and daily monitoring (physical activity, weight, and self-reported data) for up to 7 months post-op.\n\nTechnological Approach to Performance Status (TAPS) Study: Patients use two Physical Activity monitor devices, the wrist-worn device (Fitbit) continuously and the Actigraph during waking hours. Patients use the devices for 7 consecutive days."
