The app will include pre-post module quizzes, a tracking component for participants to input self-monitored measures (medication adherence, diet, physical activity, etc.). The app sharing board will be a moderated discussion platform and feed for participant interaction by posting healthy lifestyle practices through text, photographs and video to foster discussion on HTN management barriers/facilitators.
