Some form of objective laboratory evidence must be present, including one or more of the following: negative direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test, reduced haptoglobin, elevated indirect bilirubin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, or compatible findings on peripheral blood film.

A known hereditary anemia (such as thalassemia trait) is not exclusionary if the patient's baseline hemoglobin has worsened significantly (in the opinion of the investigator) after development and diagnosis of MDS.\n* Cohort 2\n\n  * Have a known hereditary anemic disorder, such as thalassemia, sickle cell disease, or hereditary enzyme deficiency, with the exception of hereditary X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency known not to cause chronic baseline hemolysis.
