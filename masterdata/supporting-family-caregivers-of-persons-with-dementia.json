            "briefSummary": "Based on preliminary work, whereby investigators examined pain management challenges and needs of caregivers of hospice patients with dementia, this team designed a cognitive behavioral intervention informed by the relational model of stress, entitled ENCODE (Empowering Caregivers of Patients with Dementia) to assist caregivers in effectively identifying and communicating their pain management challenges and needs. The investigators propose a 5-year randomized clinical trial in which caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) will be randomly assigned to a group receiving standard hospice care with the addition of \"friendly video-calls\" providing social support (attention control group) or a group receiving standard hospice care with the addition of the ENCODE intervention (intervention group).",
            "detailedDescription": "According to a report by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization published in 2020, over 180,000 Americans with a primary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) received hospice care in the United States in 2018. Although many of these patients and their families receive high quality care, numerous health care professionals have observed shortfalls in hospice care for patients with dementia, especially in the area of pain management. Past studies have shown a mixed impact of hospice enrollment on pain management for patients with ADRD. Shega et al found that roughly half of caregivers reported moderate or severe pain for patients with dementia, irrespective of hospice enrollment.\n\nCore to the hospice philosophy is the goal to reduce or even eliminate suffering in patients and to support and address the needs of both patients and their families. Family caregivers, namely family and friends who provide informal, unpaid care to hospice patients, are essential to the delivery of hospice services; however, most lack formal healthcare training. A typical family caregiver of a hospice patient with ADRD will spend at least 46 hours per week assisting with activities of daily living, including personal hygiene, medication management, household chores, and transportation. Informal caregivers are 'on call' 24 hours a day and at high risk for chronic stress, deteriorating physical health, financial difficulties, and premature death. Informal caregivers suffer from high rates of depression and anxiety, and in the few studies that have focused on their experiences, pain management has been the most commonly expressed concern. Several studies have highlighted that challenges in communication about pain among patients, caregivers and clinicians is a major struggle for family caregivers; understanding the origin of this difficulty could lead to improvements in caregiver training and support. Many caregivers report feeling stressed about pain management and describe clinicians' strategies for pain management in ADRD care as \"mysterious\" or \"suspicious\".\n\nIn the general population of older adults with ADRD, attempts to precisely estimate the prevalence of pain and quality of pain management have met with varied success. One study of long-term dementia care units found that 18% to 30% of patients self reported pain, but prevalence of pain jumped to 50% when behavioral observation scales were used. Self-report of pain is limited in patients with advanced dementia, and the etiology of pain difficult to determine. In addition, patients may resist pain treatments due to their inability to understand the purpose of analgesia and may receive decreased benefit from analgesia due to the disruption of the placebo effect. Pharmaceutical pain treatments may also exacerbate symptoms of dementia such as agitation and confusion.\n\nBased on preliminary work, whereby the investigators examined pain management challenges and needs of caregivers of hospice patients with dementia, the team designed a cognitive behavioral intervention informed by the relational model of stress, entitled ENCODE (Empowering Caregivers of Patients with Dementia) to assist caregivers in effectively identifying and communicating their pain management challenges and needs. The investigators recently completed a single group pilot study of the ENCODE intervention that demonstrated feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy on improving caregiver quality of life and reducing anxiety. This study proposes a 5-year randomized clinical trial in which caregivers of patients with ADRD will be randomly assigned to a group receiving standard hospice care with the addition of \"friendly video-calls\" providing social support (attention control group) or a group receiving standard hospice care with the addition of the ENCODE intervention (intervention group). The specific aims are:\n\nAim 1: To assess the impact of the ENCODE intervention on caregiver quality of life (primary outcome) and caregiver anxiety, depression, health and caregiver's perception of patient pain (secondary outcomes).\n\nHypothesis 1a: Caregivers in the intervention group will report higher levels of (covariate-adjusted) post intervention quality of life compared to caregivers in the attention control group.\n\nHypothesis 1b: Caregivers in the intervention group will report higher levels of (covariate-adjusted) post intervention health, and lower levels of (covariate-adjusted) anxiety and depression and patient pain compared to caregivers in the attention control group.\n\nAim 2: To assess caregivers' perceptions of and satisfaction with the ENCODE intervention.\n\nAim 3: To facilitate the translation of the intervention into practice, and more specifically:\n\nAim 3a: conduct an analysis comparing costs associated with the control and the intervention groups.\n\nAim 3b: identify barriers and facilitators to adoption of a behavioral intervention aiming to facilitate pain management in hospice"
