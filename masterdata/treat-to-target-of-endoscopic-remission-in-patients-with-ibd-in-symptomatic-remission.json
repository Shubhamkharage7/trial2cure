            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of a strategy of switching to an alternative targeted immunomodulator (TIM) therapy to treat to a target of endoscopic remission, versus continuing index TIM in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis \\[UC\\]) in symptomatic remission with moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation despite optimization of index TIM in a real-world setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a pragmatic, open-label, multicenter randomized control trial (RCT) conducted in asymptomatic patients with IBD who have persistent moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation despite optimization of index TIM. This study plans to recruit approximately 250 participants in the United States, who will either switching to treatment with alternative TIM to treat to a target of endoscopic remission or continue index optimized TIM. After randomization, patients will be followed prospectively within routine clinical practice over 2 years (104 weeks). This trial will be conducted within select active sites in the United States and Canada\n\nThe primary outcome will be time from randomization to treatment failure, as a composite of:\n\n1. Moderate severe symptomatic relapse based on PRO2 (2-item patient reported outcome), with objective confirmation of inflammation within 2 months of event (fecal calprotectin \\[FC\\] \\>150 mcg/g, or C reactive protein \\[CRP\\] \\>5mg/L, or endoscopy showing moderate-severe inflammation, or magnetic resonance enterography (MRE)/computed tomography enterography (CTE)/intestinal ultrasound (IUS) showing active inflammation) with need for escalation of therapy;\n2. Need for rescue therapy with corticosteroids for a documented symptomatic IBD flare;\n3. IBD related hospitalization;\n4. IBD-related surgery;\n5. IBD-related structural complications (CD: symptomatic stricture, fistula or abscess; UC: symptomatic stricture);\n6. Treatment-emergent adverse event requiring drug discontinuation.\n\nSecondary outcomes will include time from randomization to each of the components in the primary outcome, quality of life (overall quality of life, fatigue, IBD-related disability), burden of treatment (financial burden, burden of monitoring, treatment side effects), treatment satisfaction, and safety.\n\nIn compliance with the pragmatic methodology of this study embedded in routine clinical care, there is no study visit mandated per study protocol. Participant visit schedules will follow local SOC with any additional visits at the treating physician's discretion. Data on all effectiveness, treatment burden and safety outcomes will be captured using a REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database hosted at CCF. Data for the study will be extracted from medical record information and entered into the EDC system at baseline and then approximately every 6 months (at a minimum) thereafter, up to a 2-year follow-up period. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures (self-assessment questionnaires) will be utilized in this study to determine primary (efficacy) and secondary (quality of life and treatment burden and satisfaction) outcomes. Participants will complete the PRO2 at baseline and approximately every 12 weeks during a 2-year follow-up period; additional questionnaires (IBD-Control, PROMIS-7, Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire \\[SIBDQ\\], IBD Disability Index \\[IBD-DI\\], Treatment Burden Questionnaire, and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) will be completed at baseline (following randomization) and up to 3 more additional times during a 2-year follow-up period."
