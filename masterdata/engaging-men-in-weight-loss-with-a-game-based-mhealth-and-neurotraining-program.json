            "briefSummary": "Men in the United States have an exceptionally high prevalence of overweight and obesity, i.e., 71.3%, and 42% of men are currently attempting weight loss. However, men are dramatically underrepresented in weight loss programs. Attempts to modestly adapt standard weight loss programs have seen only minimal success. Mobile applications (mHealth apps) have attractive features, but have low male enrollment and poor efficacy as conventionally delivered. A gamified mHealth program offers the possibility of engaging men and enhancing efficacy given that (1) video gaming is highly appealing to men; (2) gamification features (e.g., digital rewards for attaining \"streaks\" and milestones, competition) are known enhance enjoyment and motivation and facilitate desired behaviors; and (3) \"neurotraining\" video games featuring repetitive action mechanics, adaptive difficulty, and feedback can train inhibitory control, a basic brain capacity to inhibit intrinsically-generated approach responses that is strongly linked to body mass and the consumption of high-calorie foods. This project evaluates long-term engagement and outcomes of a professionally-designed, game-based weight loss program. As such, 228 overweight men will be randomized to: (1) a 12-month mHealth weight loss program that includes digital self-monitoring, simplified and self-selected dietary targets, physical activity and a control (sham) non-game neurotraining, or (2) a fully-gamified version of this same program, comprised of a behavior change program featuring team-based competition, digital reinforcers for attainment of streaks and milestones, and an integrated neurotraining video game. Aims include evaluating the efficacy of the gamified program in terms of weight loss, diet and physical activity at 12 months, as well as evaluating hypothesized mediators (inhibitory control and engagement), (enjoyment and compliance) and moderators (baseline frequency of video game play and implicit preferences for Inhibitory Control Training-targeted foods)."
