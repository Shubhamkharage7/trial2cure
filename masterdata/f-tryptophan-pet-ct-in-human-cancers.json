The purpose is to see if there can be a better differentiation of tumor and non-tumor tissue where the tumor tissue has a higher uptake of Tryptophan.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this research study, we will compare the uptake of the tracer on F-Tryp PET/CT in patients with cancers; specifically, to evaluate whether the tumors show increased tracer uptake as compared to non-tumor tissues, using F-Tryp PET/CT. Additionally, we will evaluate the biodistribution (i.e. track where the tracer has traveled in the body) and radiation dosimetry (i.e., absorbed dose of tracer in tissue). These changes may be compared with results of the physical examination and scans (CT and MRI or standard clinical PET) that are done as part of routine clinical care or as part of other studies. Pictures (images) from the PET scan will be made showing the distribution throughout the body of substances containing a small amount of radioactive material."
