Patients undergoing donor stem cell transplantation often develop oral and gastrointestinal damage from chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or graft-versus-host disease. Oral fiber nutrition support may improve overall nutrition, support a normal gut microbiome (bacteria that live in the gut) and/or improve gut function in patients undergoing stem cell transplants.",

Patients may undergo blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nPrevious study design: Before this study was amended in January 2024, patients were randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nPrevious Arm I: Patients received enteral nutrition via nasoenteric feeding tube starting on day 1 until hospital discharge.\n\nPrevious Arm II: Patients received standard of care nutritional support."
