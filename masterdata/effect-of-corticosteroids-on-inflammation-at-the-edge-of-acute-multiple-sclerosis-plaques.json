            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. MS lesions can appear on the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans in many ways. Sometimes they light up from the outer edge and fill inward. This is called ring enhancement. Researchers think this type of lesion may not heal as well as others. Corticosteroids are the standard treatment to reduce symptoms of MS relapse. But there is no standard treatment for people with enhancing MS lesions without signs of MS relapse. Researchers want to see if a short-term high-dose course of corticosteroids helps heal those lesions.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the effects of short-term high-dose corticosteroids on ring-enhancing MS.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 25 and older who:\n\n* Have MS and a rim-enhancing lesion on a prior brain MRI\n* Are enrolled in another NINDS protocol\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened under another protocol\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to get either no treatment or 3 days of treatment with a corticosteroid.\n\nParticipants will have:\n\n* 1 baseline visit\n* 3 days of high-dose steroids, intravenous or oral. If IV, participants will receive methylprednisolone by IV each day. Participants will also be prescribed medicine to protect their stomach.\n* Follow-up visits will be at week 13 and week 25 after randomization to treatment or no treatment.\n\nVisits include medical history and physical exam. Participants will have blood and urine tests. Participants will also have neurological exams and MRIs. Participants lie on a table that slides into a cylinder. They are in the scanner 1.5-2 hours. They get a dye through a catheter: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objectives. The primary aim of this pilot study is to assess the effects of short-term, high-dose corticosteroid administration on the 12-week evolution of multiple sclerosis lesions with centripetal enhancement pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in particular with respect to the development of a hypointense rim on 7-tesla phase images. In our prior work, the phase rim has been associated with persistent deleterious inflammation with poor repair and ongoing neurodegeneration within lesions.\n\nStudy population. Up to 30 multiple sclerosis patients with asymptomatic contrast-enhancing lesions will be enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to either 3 days of corticosteroids (intravenous methylprednisolone a 1000 mg/day or oral prednisone at 1250mg/day) or to no treatment.\n\nDesign. This is a multi-site study with Johns Hopkins University. Some analysis of identifiable data will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University JHU under a reliance agreement. Patients will not be consented to the study or participate in study interventions/procedures at JHU. Patients undergo serial brain MRIs with gadolinium-based contrast agent on both 3- and 7-tesla scanners over an approximate 25-week period. 3-tesla scans are obtained at baseline and week 25. 7-tesla scans are obtained at baseline and at weeks 13 and 25. Participants with one or more centripetal/rim-enhancing lesions at the baseline scan are randomized and followed. Clinical evaluation and blood testing are performed at baseline and weeks 13 and 25.\n\nOutcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the presence or absence, on the week-13 7-tesla scan, of a hypointense phase rim in each of the lesions followed over time. Secondary outcome measures include the presence or absence of a hypointense phase rim at week 25, as well as the lesion volume and intralesional median R1 relaxation rate at weeks 13 and 25. From 3-tesla scans, we will measure the change in normalized intralesional proton density-weighted and T1-weighted signal, as well as the R1 relaxation rate, between baseline and week 25. We will also assess for the presence or absence of a hypointense phase at 3T. Additional exploratory outcome measures, including clinical and immunological assessments, will also be collected."
