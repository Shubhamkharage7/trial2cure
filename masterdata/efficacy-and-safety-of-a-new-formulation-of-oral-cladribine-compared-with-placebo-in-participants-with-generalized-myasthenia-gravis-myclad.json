It will also investigate the sustained efficacy, the need for retreatment, and the long-term safety of oral cladribine in gMG. An additional component is included to characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of the new cladribine formulation in gMG participants. This study is divided into 3 periods: the double-blind placebo control (DBPC) pivotal period, and 2 extensions, the blinded extension (BE) and the retreatment (RT) period."
