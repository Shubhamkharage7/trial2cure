            "detailedDescription": "Adults living in New York City between the ages of 18-65 and experiencing elevated levels of worry, rumination, and/or self-criticism may be eligible to participate. After being informed about the study and potential risks, participants giving written informed consent will complete an online screening visit to determine full study eligibility. Eligible participant will then be randomized to complete 6-weeks of one of three self-directed, online skills training about coping with distress.\n\nThe present study is evaluating whether these skills trainings demonstrate efficacy in: 1) improving outcomes specific to an emotion regulation model of emotional distress (e.g., attentional control, decentering, reappraisal); 2) reducing symptoms of psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, worry, rumination). Primary assessment points will take place before and after the skills training, and will include self-report measures, brief surveys during daily life, as well as computer tasks and measures of brain and body activity (e.g., EEG)."
