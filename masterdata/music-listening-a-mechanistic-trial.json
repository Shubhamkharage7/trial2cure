The current standard of care for treating stress and pain is to provide analgesic and sedative medications, which are associated with increased risk of delirium and posttraumatic stress disorder. This randomized within-subject crossover trial will compare the effects of live and recorded music listening on biomarkers of stress and pain among children receiving mechanical ventilation in the pediatric intensive care unit, to identify the key components of a music listening intervention and explore its mechanism of action, i.e., the biological pathway through which music listening decreases stress and pain."

CHP provides weight-based guidelines to aid clinical decisions on medications for sedation and analgesia. Bedside nurses assess the child's sedation and pain scores once an hour and administered PRN medications as needed, based on clinical judgement, using CHP's PICU weight-based guidelines. For example, if a child has a pain score of \\>1-2 above goal, guidelines suggest providing a fentanyl dose of 0.5 mcg/kg and assessing again in 1 hour. We will include usual care as a third condition to explore how our selected biomarkers vary over 20 min. without the addition of any musical stimuli.
