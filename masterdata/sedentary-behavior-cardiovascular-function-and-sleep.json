To test the hypothesis that two weeks of sedentary behavior will progressively impair vascular endothelial function.\n\n2: To test the hypothesis that increasing sedentary behavior will decrease total sleep duration and sleep efficiency.\n\n3: To test the hypothesis that two-weeks of sedentary behavior will progressively increase 24-h blood pressure and reduce nocturnal blood pressure dipping.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nAfter a baseline period, participants will become more inactive and also come in for 4-h uninterrupted sitting visits. Cardiovascular, activity, and sleep measures will be taken throughout."
