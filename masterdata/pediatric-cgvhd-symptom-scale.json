            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSome children/adolescents who have had a stem cell transplant live with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD). cGVHD is a side effect of the transplant that can cause multiple bothersome symptoms and negatively affect a child/adolescent squality of daily life. The questionnaires that measure thesymptoms caused by cGVHD are designed for adults. Children/adolescents may not describe their symptoms in the same way. The goal of this research is to improve the way we measure how bothersome these symptoms are for children/adolescents living with cGVHD.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo develop a questionnaire (The Pediatric cGHVD Symptom Scale) for children/adolescents living with cGVHD to identify the symptoms they are experiencing and describe how bothersome those symptoms are to them. An additional goal is to design a parent/guardian companion questionnaire that can be used to capture the symptom experiences of very young children who may not be able to complete a questionnaire.\n\nEligibility:\n\nChildren/adolescents ages 5-17 who are receiving treatment for cGVHD after a stem cell transplant, and their parent/guardian..\n\nDesign:\n\nThis study consists of 2 projects.\n\nChildren/adolescents with cGVHD and their parent/guardianparticipants will be grouped by the child/adolescent s age: 5-7, 8-12, and 13-17.\n\nIn project 1, participants will complete an age-appropriate questionnaire about cGVHD symptoms. The questionnaire will ask about the child/adolescent s physical functioning and emotional well-being. The parent/guardian will out fill out a companion questionnaire online. The child/adolescent will then review their completed questionnaire during an interview with a researcher and will be asked whether the questions about their symptoms were difficult to understand. The parent/guardian and child/adolescent will then be interviewed together to further explore their responses to the questionnaires. Interviews will be done in person, by phone, and online. . Based on what is learned through these interviews, the wording of the questionnaire will be improved for better comprehension and ease of response.\n\nIn project 2, participants will complete this revised questionnairefor their age group along with some other questionnaires that ask about quality of life. Both the child/adolescent and parent/guardian will fill out the questionnaires online at three separate time points.\n\nIn both projects, children/adolescents with cGVHD and their parent/guardian participants will be grouped by the child/adolescent s age: 5-7, 8-12, and 13-17.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative option for many children with cancer and certain genetic disorders. However, recipients of stem cell transplant must deal with years of disfigurement and symptoms arising from an undesirable side effect of transplant, specifically chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD).\n* Children living with cGVHD often face many years of a disabling and painful chronic illness compounded by the side effects of prolonged immunosuppression, particularly long-term steroid use.\n* Chronic GVHD can involve almost every organ although it most commonly affects the skin, eyes, mouth, liver, intestines, lung and the musculoskeletal system.\n* There has been a large effort through the NIH cGVHD Consensus Consortium to standardize definitions, grading and response criteria for patients with cGVHD on clinical trials. Because of the absence of evidence suggesting which response criteria truly correlates with improvement, the NIH Consensus Panel has recommended following not only physical signs of chronic GVHD, but also symptoms of GVHD.\n* The Lee cGVHD Symptom Score has been recognized as a core cGVHD outcome measure in the adult population, however, the instrument has not been validated for use in children/adolescents younger than 18, and many of the symptom terms used in the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale may not be well understood by younger children.\n* There is currently no available pediatric patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of cGVHD symptom bother.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n-To develop a psychometrically valid Pediatric cGVHD Symptom Scale (PCSS) and a companion caregiver-proxy measure as counterparts to the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Children of 5 to 17 years of age, who have undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant\n* Clinical diagnosis of cGVHD\n* Currently receiving systemic treatment for cGVHD (including phototherapies), or has tapered systemic therapy for cGVHD to discontinuation within the past 12 months\n* No evidence of malignant disease relapse including molecular relapse and minimal residual disease. Patients with mixed chimerism are eligible to participate\n* Comprehend and speak English\n\nDesign:\n\n* This multicenter non-interventional psychosocial trial will address the study aims in two projects: 1) a qualitative project using cognitive interviewing to confirm the comprehension and ease of response to the PCSS, and 2) a quantitative project to evaluate test-retest reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of the PCSS, as well as to explore concordance of symptom ratings by patients and caregiver proxies.\n* In Project 1, we will conduct at least 20 cognitive interviews of patient and proxy dyads (caregiver) within each age group (5-7; 8-12; 13-17) for a sample of up to 90 pediatric transplant survivors with cGVHD to refine the symptom items and response choices to ensure that they resonate across the developmental spectrum. Cognitive interviews will evaluate the clarity and comprehension of the PCSS items, the ease and accuracy of judgement of the response choices, and any errors in understanding the response choices, and will refine the PCSS in accordance with study data, before proceeding to Project 2.\n* In Project 2, we will evaluate test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness of the PCSS, in association with the NIH Global cGVHD Symptom Severity Score, the Peds QL, clinician ratings of organ specific cGVHD severity scores and cGVHD severity using the NIH criteria, in a sample of 120 pediatric transplant survivors with cGVHD reflecting three age groups (5-7 years; 8-12 years; 13-17 years) of equal numbers. In subjects ages 13-17, we will also compare responses on the PCSS with those from the Lee Scale, to determine the youngest age at which adolescent respondents can comprehend the Lee Scale.\n* This study will include CCR investigators as well as extramural investigators at national and international study sites.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis multicenter non-interventional psychosocial trial will address the study aims in two projects: 1) a qualitative project using cognitive interviewing to confirm the comprehension and ease of response to the PCSS, and 2) a quantitative project to evaluate test-retest reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of the PCSS, as well as to explore concordance of symptom ratings by patients and caregiver proxies.\n\nIn Project 1, we will conduct at least 20 cognitive interviews of patient and proxy dyads (caregiver) within each age group (5-7; 8-12; 13-17) for a sample of up to 90 pediatric transplant survivors with cGVHD to refine the symptom items and response choices to ensure that they resonate across the developmental spectrum.
