Supplementary exposure to bright light has beneficial effects on sleep quality and daytime vigilance in healthy individuals and it has been increasingly applied in a variety of sleep and neuropsychiatric conditions. This study will explore the role of Bright Light Therapy (BLT), a well-established non-pharmacological intervention for circadian disturbances, for the treatment of residual daytime symptoms of OSA which do not respond to CPAP. BLT will be delivered via therapy glasses in a cross-over design, where each participant will be exposed to active treatment and sham treatment (4 weeks in each arm) in a randomized order. The hypothesis is that participants will demonstrate improvements in the variables of interest during the four-week active treatment portion of the eight-week crossover study, compared to the four-week sham treatment portion.",
