Eight participants with mild impairment and 8 participants with moderate impairment per CP classification and 8 to 12 participants with normal hepatic function matched on a group level regarding age, BMI, and sex to the impaired groups are planned for study intervention. All participants will receive a single dose of balcinrenone 50 mg on Day 1 following an overnight fast. Study intervention will be administered orally with approximately 240 mL of water.\n\nChild-Pugh scoring will be used to determine the level of hepatic impairment. Participants will be enrolled into the following groups based on their CP classification score as determined at screening:\n\n* Group 1: Participants with mild hepatic impairment (CP Class A, score of 5 or 6).\n* Group 2: Participants with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to 9).\n* Group 3: Participants with normal hepatic function matched on a group level regarding age, BMI, and sex to the impaired groups."
