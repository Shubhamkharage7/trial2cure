            "briefSummary": "This will be a (2 visit) double-blind, randomized, crossover design clinical study to assess the potential benefits of ER-CAFF versus IR-CAFF by assessing its impact on side effect profiles, mood states, alertness, and cognitive abilities following ingestion after a suboptimal night of sleep. This study will enroll 30 healthy men and women who will be recruited by word of mouth, email contact, and direct contact from the greater Tampa Bay Area. To account for potential dropouts, we aim to enroll approximately 20% over the desired sample size (total of 36 participants). The anticipated study period will last approximately 2 weeks.\n\nAfter initial pre-screening, participants will report to the laboratory on two separate occasions after an overnight fast (10 hours minimum). Participants will be required to have a night of partial sleep deprivation the night before (\\<5 hours sleep), which will be confirmed by self reported sleep logs and objective multisensor (triaxial accelerometry and cardiac data) wearable devices to accurately measure sleep deficit data. Upon arrival, participants will undergo baseline (BL) testing and then ingest a bolus of one study product with 4-8 ounces of water: 400 mg z\u00fcmXR extended-release caffeine (ER-CAFF), or 400 mg of immediate-release caffeine anhydrous (IR-CAFF) (2 group, crossover design). Thereafter, participants will undergo subsequent testing sessions at 45, 60, 90, 135, 240, 300, 360, and 420 minutes post-supplementation. After the 4-hour (240 min) measurements, a caffeine-free food bar will be provided. This same food bar will also be offered to participants following the final 7-hour (420 min) measurements. The precise measures and timepoints for the measures are further defined below. There will be a one-week minimum washout period between treatments in the crossover design.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pre-screening/enrollment (Day -30 to Day -1) The potential subject will present a health history / Caffeine Consumption / Morningness-Eveningness questionnaires to screen for study eligibility described in sections 5.2.1 (inclusion criteria) and 5.2.2 (exclusion criteria). The questionnaires will be reviewed by the Investigator or designee. If the subject is eligible, they will be contacted by phone to walk through the study requirements and answer any questions. If the subject qualifies and is amenable with the study requirements, we will obtain written consent via an IRB approved ICF. The potential subject will be given the opportunity to review the ICF, ask any questions they may have to the Investigator or designee. The potential subject will be required to sign the ICF for study enrollment and to proceed with study participation.\n\nBaseline assessment (Day 0, Visit 1) After initial pre-screening, participants will report to the laboratory on two separate occasions after an overnight fast (10 hours minimum). Participants will be required to have a night of partial sleep deprivation the night before (\u2264 5 hours sleep), which will be confirmed by self reported sleep logs and objective multisensor (triaxial accelerometry and cardiac data) wearable devices to accurately measure sleep deficit data (Roberts et al., 2020). Upon arrival, participants will undergo baseline (BL) testing (Heart rate, blood pressure, Caffeine VAS, Samn-Perilli/Thayer's, PANAS, PVT, RVIP). Immediately after, subjects will ingest a bolus of one study product (either ER-CAFF or IR-CAFF) with 4-8 ounces of water: 400 mg z\u00fcmXR extended-release caffeine (ER-CAFF), or 400 mg of immediate-release caffeine (IR-CAFF) (2 group, crossover design). Thereafter, participants will undergo subsequent testing sessions at 45, 60, 90, 135, 240, 300, 360, and 420 minutes post-supplementation. This testing will include the vitals listed above, a subset of the BL tests according to the time point (see below, Table 2), and queried about adverse events. At the 4-hour (240 min) measurement, a standardized caffeine-free food bar will be provided. This food bar will also be offered to participants following the final 7-hour (420 min) measurements. After the completion of Day 0, There will be a one-week minimum washout period between treatments in the crossover design.\n\nFinal Testing (Day 1, Visit 2):\n\nAfter the one-week minimum washout period, subjects will report back to the lab and will repeat Day 0 testing with the other supplement (either ER-CAFF or IR-CAFF). Following this testing, the subjects will have completed the study."
