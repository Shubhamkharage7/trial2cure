Using vibrational therapy, the Apollo System has been previously demonstrated to promote greater balance of the autonomic nervous system. Given the importance of the autonomic nervous system for modulating levels of physiological arousal and in-turn governing aspects of attention and self-regulation; a therapeutic approach to promote better balance of this system may be particularly beneficial for populations such as children with ADHD. Accordingly, using a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design this investigation will assess the extent to which the Apollo System is effective in reducing symptomatology associated with ADHD."
