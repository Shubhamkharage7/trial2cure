            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the safety and efficacy of total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) in combination with two chemotherapy drugs, etoposide and cyclophosphamide, as a preparative regimen before donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with high-risk acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have failed previous therapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses imaging to provide a three-dimensional view of the area to be irradiated. Doctors can then shape and direct the radiation beams at the area from multiple directions while avoiding, as much as possible, nearby organs. TMLI is a method of using IMRT to direct radiation to the bone marrow. Radiation therapy is given before transplant to suppress the immune system, prevent rejection of the transplanted cells, and wipe out any remaining cancer cells. TMLI may allow a greater radiation dose to be delivered to the bone marrow as a preparative regimen before transplant while causing fewer side effects than standard radiation therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Following a patient safety lead-in, evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) preparative regimen - TMLI, cyclophosphamide (Cy) and etoposide (VP-16), as assessed by 2-year progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.\n\nII. Evaluate early and late toxicities/complications by organ and severity, and characterize by organ dose/dose volume, including acute/chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), infection, and longer-term complications (via protocol #s 07173 and 00029).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients undergo image guided TMLI on days -9 to -5, receive etoposide intravenously (IV) on day -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2, and undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow transplant on day 0.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years."
