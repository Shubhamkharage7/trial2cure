Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) will be utilized to screen for early stage pancreatic cancer or precursor lesions. Participants will be asked to donate a blood sample at specific intervals for the creation of a bio-bank necessary for the development of a blood based screening test for pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "Individuals over 50 years of age who have developed new-onset diabetes mellitus (diagnosed within the past 12 months) or deteriorating diabetes will be recruited through the offices of primary care physicians and endocrinologists. Those meeting initial criteria will meet with a research APRN and will undergo a secondary screen to determine eligibility. Individuals enrolled in the study will undergo a five-minute psychological survey and donation of a blood sample for bio-bank analysis every 6 months for 3 years. MRI will be performed at baseline. Any abnormalities on MRI will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary tumor board and discussed with the participant. Additional MRI will be performed on case-by-case basis"
