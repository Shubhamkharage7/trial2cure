This phase II trial is studying how well TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody) and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1 binding antibody) work in combination in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic liver cancer.",

To assess the objective response rate (ORR) as determined by RECIST v1.1 of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) patients treated with TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody) and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1 binding antibody).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the ORR as determined by the immune related Response Criteria (irRC), duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response of study participants.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety profile of treated patients.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody) and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1 binding antibody) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed every 9 weeks."
