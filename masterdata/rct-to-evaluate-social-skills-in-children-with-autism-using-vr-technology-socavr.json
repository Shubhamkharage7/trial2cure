            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to find out if Floreo's VR clinical program can help with autism symptoms such as social communication skills in autistic children. Recent advances in VR technology offers a new way to improve these types of skills in children with autism in an immersive and controlled environment.\n\nQuestionnaires answered by adult caregivers will be used to assess the child's behaviors during the time of treatment.\n\nClinician observations will also be conducted as a part of this study."
