This is an exploratory trial of a limited sample size to confirm safety and to assess for pharmacodynamic signals of efficacy in each of three schedules of CUE-101. Safety assessments will be performed at baseline and after CUE-101 administration. To assess for efficacy, peripheral blood and tumor samples will be collected at baseline and after CUE-101 administration. Following CUE-101, patients will proceed with SOC therapy, as prescribed by the treating physician."
