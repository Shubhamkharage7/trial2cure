Also, the investigators hope to determine if the use of Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) during GETA impacts device success. Adult patients undergoing transfemoral approach TAVR for aortic valve stenosis may be eligible candidates for this study."

Grade of aortic regurgitation is measured as none, mild, moderate, or severe. None is best, severe is worst. For GETA cases, paravalvular regurgitation will be recorded after valve implantation by the anesthesiologist performing TEE, as is routine. For all cases, paravalvular regurgitation will be recorded from a TTE report that is completed on post-operative day 1 or 2 (the 1st post-operative TTE) during routine clinical care, and again by TTE report at 1 year during routine clinical follow-up.",
