            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nDiet is one of the most modifiable behaviors affecting health. But diet assessment measures that are based on self-report can be inaccurate. Researchers want better ways to address the role of diet in chronic disease. They want to see if stable isotopes can be used to better assess what people eat.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if stable isotopes can help scientists identify things people eat.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy adults ages 18 to 65\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests. These tests will be repeated during the study.\n\nParticipants will stay in the inpatient unit of the NIH in Phoenix, Arizona, for 13 weeks.\n\nFor 7 days, participants will eat a diet prepared by the NIH kitchen. They will get balanced meals that are 50% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 30% fat. Then participants will be randomly placed on one of 3 diets containing different percentages of carbohydrates from soda.\n\nParticipants height and weight will be measured. The amount of fat and muscle in their body will be measured by body scans that are similar to x-rays.\n\nParticipants will have oral glucose tolerance tests. They will consume a sugar drink and then give blood samples over 3 hours.\n\nParticipants will give hair and stool samples.\n\nParticipants will complete a diet questionnaire. It assesses their food intake over 24 hours.\n\nParticipants will complete behavioral questionnaires and computer performance tests.\n\nParticipants will have fat biopsies taken from their stomach and thigh.\n\nParticipants will have three 24-hour stays in a metabolic chamber. It is used to measure metabolism.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will be an inpatient study in which highly specific diets will be fed to volunteers for approximately 12 weeks and stable isotopes will be measured in blood, hair, and adipose. Ultimately, the goal is to develop biomarkers to be used to validate food intake patterns in outpatient clinical and epidemiological studies.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to validate the use of stable isotope biomarkers as representatives of specific dietary intake patterns.\n\nSecondary objectives include evaluation of the effect of the amount of soda on urinary sucrose and fructose excretion, extracellular vesicles levels and content, and gut microbiota.\n\nEndpoints (Outcomes):\n\nPrimary Endpoints: Primary Endpoints: Changes in the blood, hair, and adipose carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) stable isotope ratio from baseline to 12 weeks.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Changes in urinary sucrose and fructose excretion, extracellular vesicles levels and content, gut microbiota from baseline to 12 weeks."

Additionally, potential subjects might be excluded if they demonstrate a style of interpersonal relationships that would inhibit successful completion of the study.\n\nNon-English-speaking subjects as a population will be excluded from participation in this protocol. One of the secondary hypotheses of the protocol relates to a battery of psychological questionnaires and performances tests which are administered to the volunteers at the beginning and end of the study. There are currently no validated, translated forms of these questionnaires and tests available; therefore, we will restrict enrollment to English speaking subjects only.\n\nINCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:\n\nThis study will not include vulnerable participants, although NIH Staff may be invited to participate.\n\nParticipation of NIH Staff or family members of study team members\n\nNIH staff and family members of study team members may be enrolled in this study as this population meets the study entry criteria. Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a subject in the research will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at NIH.\n\nEvery effort will be made to protect participant information, but such information may be available in medical records and may be available to authorized users outside of the study team in both an identifiable an unidentifiable manner.\n\nINCLUSION OF PREGNANT WOMEN, FETUSES OR NEONATES:\n\nN/A",
