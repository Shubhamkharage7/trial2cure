            "briefSummary": "Sleep disruption is common among young adult cancer survivors for a variety of reasons. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to improve chronic sleep disorders. This project will test the feasibility and acceptability of a new voice-activated virtual assistant (VAVA) device to deliver CBT-I to improve sleep among young adult cancer survivors with chronic sleep disorders.",
            "detailedDescription": "Sleep is a complex biobehavioral event, impacted by interactions between the individual's physiology as well as their environment. Young adult cancer survivors (YACS; those between 18- 29 years of age) are a growing group of survivors, numbering close to 400,000 in the US. They are among those at highest risk for chronically insufficient sleep due to developmentally normative biological and social factors, compounded by their extensive medical treatment history. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended by the American College of Physicians as gold standard treatment for insomnia disorder and has been successfully adapted for YACS. Fundamental CBT-I strategies can be implemented to change the problematic sleep behaviors that result in insufficient sleep among young adults. However, it is essential that these evidence-based strategies be deployed to be responsive to the specific barriers to sleep for YACS. This feasibility/acceptability study will test the use of an integrated VAVA that offers the opportunity to implement intervention strategies in a way that repeatedly gives YACS the chance to make the right decision with respect to their sleep health in real time."
