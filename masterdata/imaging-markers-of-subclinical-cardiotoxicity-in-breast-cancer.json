This complication can lead to the following symptoms: shortness of breath on exertion, swollen ankles and feet, lack of energy and a reduced capacity to carry out day-to-day activities.\n\nThis research study is focused on identifying the early signs of such heart complications using CMR, which may allow preventative treatment options to be made available in future."
