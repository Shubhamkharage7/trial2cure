During the study, subjects will be evaluated for safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of DISC-3405. In the single ascending dose (SAD) phase, a sentinel group of two subjects will be dosed first: one with DISC-3405, and the other with placebo; the randomization and blinding will be maintained. The remaining subjects for the cohort will be dosed at least 24 hours after the last sentinel dosing following approval from the principal investigator.\n\nSubsequent multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts will only enroll after a sufficient safety observation period for the SAD cohort, accordingly there will be no sentinel participants for cohorts in MAD.\n\nDISC-3405 or placebo will be administered as an IV infusion or subcutaneous injection. Subjects will have end-of-study (EOS) follow-up visits on Day 99 after the last administration."
