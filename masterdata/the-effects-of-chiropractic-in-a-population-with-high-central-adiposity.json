            "briefSummary": "Since 1980, the global prevalence of obesity, commonly defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, has doubled. Importantly, high levels of central adiposity (i.e., abdominal fat) is associated with numerous PNI-related sequelae, including increased levels of psychological distress, cognitive deficits, ANS dysfunction, and immune marker abnormalities. To our knowledge, rigorous investigation of chiropractic's impact on psychoneuroimmunological (PNI)-related outcomes in people with high central adiposity is lacking. Based on limited evidence to date, it is plausible that clinically important PNI-related dysfunctions (e.g., heightened stress levels, executive function impairments, dysautonomia, immune dysregulation) common in this population could be ameliorated via chiropractic care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Up to twenty (20) obese individuals (18-65 yrs of age) will be recruited. For our trial, obesity will be indexed as a BMI \u226530 and an elevated waist circumference (i.e., \\>35 inches for women, \\>40 inches for men).\n\nSubjects will be asked to do the following...\n\n* Restrict certain behaviors prior to their lab visits which include 1) 3 hours prior abstain from caffeine, brushing your teeth, alcohol-based mouthwash, nicotine, food, \\& drinking large amounts of liquid very quickly (e.g., chugging a 16 oz bottle of water; sipping water is ok) and 2) 24 hours prior abstain from strenuous exercise, alcohol, \\& over the counter drugs (e.g., antihistamines, Tylenol, etc.)\n* Have their height, weight, and waist circumference measured.\n* Drool into a tube for subsequent testing of immune markers (i.e., salivary IgA)\n* Have electrodes placed on/around their chest \\& back to measure respiration, ECG, and impedance cardiography (ICG)\n* Perform a postural challenge whereby they lay supine (8 min), stand quickly (3 min), and return quickly to the supine position (3 min).\n* Have their cognitive function assessed while walking on a treadmill (dual task).\n* Answer questions about their mental, physical, and emotional health.\n* Receive 6-weeks of chiropractic adjustments from community-based clinicians.\n\nAssessments will take place at baseline, after 2 weeks of chiropractic, and after 6 weeks of chiropractic."
