            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this first-in-human study is to find out if BNT314 is safe when it is used alone and when it is used together with another antibody cancer drug (pembrolizumab) in patients with different types of cancer. Patients will receive either BNT314 alone or BNT314 combined with pembrolizumab.\n\nPhase 1 of the study consists of a dose escalation part, and a safety run-in (SRI) and expansion part:\n\nDose escalation: In this part of the study, patients will be assigned to multiple dose levels (DLs) of BNT314 given alone. By escalating the dose with a small group of patients, the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) which is the highest dose with acceptable safety and manageable side effects, or the maximum administered dose (MAD) will be investigated. At the end of this part, the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) which is the dose to be tested in Phase 2 will be decided.\n\nSafety Run-In: In this part of the study, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab. Before starting the expansion part, the combination will be tested in another small group of participants (12-28) to find out how safe this combination is.\n\nExpansion: In this part of the study, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab. After the SRI is completed, the study will continue with the expansion part where up to 199 participants with different types of cancer will be included.\n\nThe Phase 2 part of the study will be introduced via an amendment to the study protocol.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, multinational safety study in patients with metastatic or advanced malignant solid tumors for whom, at the discretion of the investigator, there is no available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, evaluating the safety, tolerability, preliminary antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of BNT314.\n\nIn the dose escalation part of the study, patients will periodically receive one infusion of BNT314. In the combination therapy SRI and expansion part, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab and administered intravenously in periodic cycles to patients with selected cancer indications.\n\nAdditional cohorts (backfill cohorts) administering BNT314 as monotherapy will assign patients to specific DLs, based on the emerging safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic data. This would allow for further assessment of dose- and exposure-response relationships for clinical activity, safety, and tolerability to support BNT314 dose optimization.\n\nThe treatment period will last until progressive disease (PD), confirmed PD (as per immune response evaluation criteria in solid tumors \\[iRECIST\\]), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever happens first.\n\nFor the combination therapy, the maximum treatment period will be 2 years. The maximum study duration is 3 years after the last participant's first treatment in the study."

Patients that have uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to:\n\n   * Ongoing or active infection requiring treatment with anti-infective therapy administered less than two weeks prior to first dose.\n   * Symptomatic congestive heart failure (Grade III or IV as classified by the New York Heart Association), unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic untreated cardiac arrhythmia. Treated and/or asymptomatic cardiac arrythmia/atrial fibrillation will be allowed.\n   * History of arterial thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment.\n   * History of myocardial infarction within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment.\n   * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure \u2265100 mm Hg, despite optimal medical management.\n   * Prolonged QTc interval at baseline of \u2265470 milliseconds using Fridericia's QT correction formula.\n   * Ongoing or recent (within one year of screening) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for immune-related adverse events (irAEs).\n   * History of Grade 3 or higher irAEs that led to treatment discontinuation of a checkpoint inhibitor. A patient with irAEs below Grade 3 that led to discontinuation should be discussed with the sponsor. Grade 3 irAEs that have fully recovered may also be discussed.\n   * History of chronic liver disease (e.g., alcoholic hepatitis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, drug-related or autoimmune hepatitis) or evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.\n   * History of non-treated intracerebral arteriovenous malformation (shunts), non-treated cerebral aneurysm, spinal cord compression (from disease), carcinomatous meningitis, or stroke will be excluded.\n   * History of acute or chronic pancreatitis of any etiology within 6 weeks prior to the start of study treatment.\n   * Evidence of interstitial lung disease.\n   * Ongoing pneumonitis or history of noninfectious pneumonitis that has required steroids.\n   * Transient ischemic attack less than one month prior to screening will be excluded.\n   * History of brain/central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal or pituitary replacement steroid \\>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n   * Patient has received granulocyte or granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (G-CSF/GM-CSF) support within 2 weeks prior to first BNT314 administration or is chronically transfusion dependent; G-CSF and other hematopoietic factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity (such as febrile neutropenia) or prophylactically, when clinically indicated at the investigator's discretion.\n   * Received any live vaccine within 30 days prior to the start of study treatment.\n3. Any positive test for hepatitis B (defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B virus DNA), indicating acute or chronic infection.\n4. Any positive test for hepatitis C (defined as positive for hepatitis C virus antibody or hepatitis C virus RNA), indicating acute or chronic infection.\n5. Known alcohol dependency within 6 months enrollment in this study.\n6. Planned enrollment in another study of an IMP, starting after Visit D1 and continuously until the last planned visit in this study.\n7. Have a medical, psychological, or social condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise their wellbeing if they participate in the study, or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol specified assessments or procedures, or that could impact adherence to protocol-described requirements.\n8. Are subject to exclusion periods from another investigational study.\n9. Are vulnerable individuals as per International Council for Harmonisation E6 definition, i.e., are individuals whose willingness to participate in a clinical study may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate.",
