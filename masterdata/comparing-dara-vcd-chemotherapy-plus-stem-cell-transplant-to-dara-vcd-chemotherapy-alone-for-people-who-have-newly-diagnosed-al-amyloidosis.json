            "briefSummary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of adding a stem cell transplant with melphalan after completing chemotherapy with daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (Dara-VCD) versus chemotherapy with Dara-VCD alone for treating patients with newly diagnosed amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Melphalan is a chemotherapy given prior to a stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. The stem cells are then returned to the patients to replace the blood forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Daratumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called CD38, which is found on some types of immune cells and cancer cells, including myeloma cells. Daratumumab may block CD38 and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and bortezomib, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Dexamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to lower the body's immune response to help stop the growth of cancer cells. Giving a stem cell transplant with melphalan after Dara-VCD may kill more cancer cells in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis.",
