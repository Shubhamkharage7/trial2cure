            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective:\n\nTo evaluate the safety of SEVENFACT\u00ae when used to treat bleeding episodes in participants with Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors either with or without prophylactic treatment\n\nStudy Design:\n\nPhase IV multi-center, US-centric, open-label, safety study enrolling participants with Hemophilia A and B with inhibitors12 years of age and older, who are either on long term prophylactic treatment (e.g., emicizumab) at risk of experiencing a breakthrough bleeding event (BE), or who are not on prophylactic treatment who may need to control a BE.\n\nStudy Duration:\n\nParticipants will be followed longitudinally from the time of enrollment to the end of their participation in the study. The maximal study duration for any participant in the study will be up to 2 years from the time of enrollment.\n\nTarget Accrual:\n\nThis is a multi-site study in which it is anticipated approximately 28 to 55 participants will be enrolled in order to achieve treatment of approximately 100 bleeding events. The study will target enrollment of a minimum of 23 participants on emicizumab prophylactic treatment and 5 participants on other treatments.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nSample Size Determination:\n\nResults from the Haven 1 study were used to calculate the annual bleeding rates (ABR) in individuals receiving prophylactic treatment. These were calculated at an ABR of three for participants receiving emicizumab prophylactic treatment and 20 for participants receiving other treatments.\n\nBased on these data, it was calculated that between 28 and 55 participants would be necessary to reach 100 BEs with a minimum of 23 participants on emicizumab prophylactic treatment and 5 participants on other treatments.\n\nAnalysis Populations:\n\nThe Safety Analysis Set is defined as all participants who received at least a single dose of SEVENFACT\u00ae. All analyses of safety will be performed based on the safety population, and participants will be analyzed according to the dose of SEVENFACT\u00ae that they actually received.\n\nBaseline Characteristics:\n\nBaseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.\n\nSafety Evaluations:\n\nAll Adverse Events (AEs) will be graded for severity utilizing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 and coded using Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 23.x. The number and percentage of participants with treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), serious AEs (SAEs), serious TEAEs and treatment related TEAEs (i.e., adverse drug reactions \\[ADRs\\]) will be presented for all participants.\n\nThe number of TEAEs, as well as the number and percentage of participants with TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and treatment-related TEAEs will be presented by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term for all participants.\n\nThe number and percentage of participants with treatment-emergent adverse event and/or allergic and anaphylactic reactions will be presented for all participants.\n\nEfficacy Evaluations:\n\nThere are no pre-specified efficacy endpoints."
