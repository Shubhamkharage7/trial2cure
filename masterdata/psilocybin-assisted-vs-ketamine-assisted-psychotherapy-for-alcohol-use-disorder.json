            "briefSummary": "This pilot study will collect preliminary data that measures the effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy vs ketamine-assisted psychotherapy on patients struggling with alcohol use.",
            "detailedDescription": "This pilot study will be a double blind, randomized, active-comparator controlled trial with two study arms. Subjects randomized to Arm 1 (n=10) will receive individual psychotherapy sessions plus a 25mg dose of psilocybin, while Arm 2 subjects (n=10) will receive individual psychotherapy sessions and a 200mg dose of ketamine. Psychotherapy sessions will involve integrative psychotherapy modalities.\n\nAt baseline, subjects will be consented, randomized into one of the two arms, complete psychiatric and medical evaluations, and will undergo an MRI scan. The first two therapy sessions (week 1 and week 2) will be used to learn about the participant's life story, engage the patient, and evoke their reasons for wanting to change their pattern of alcohol use. At week 3, participants will undergo a psilocybin-assisted therapy session or a ketamine-assisted therapy session. The last 2 psychotherapy sessions will be focused on integration of their experiences in the drug administration session and will include a second MRI scan and more assessments. Therefore, each arm receives 4 psychotherapy sessions, and the primary difference between the groups is which drug participants receive. After the psychotherapy sessions are completed at the end of week 4, subjects will be followed weekly for 4 weeks. At the last follow-up (week 8), they will undergo a third MRI scan and a final assessment. At the conclusion of the study, those randomized to the ketamine group will be offered a psilocybin-assisted therapy session, and two follow-up/integration sessions in an open-label extension. The open-label extension will also include an additional 4 weeks of follow-up."
