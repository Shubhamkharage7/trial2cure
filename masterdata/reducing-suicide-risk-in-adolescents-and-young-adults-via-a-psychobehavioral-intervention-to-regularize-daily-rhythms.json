The investigators aim to achieve this with this study of Brain Emotion Circuitry Self-Monitoring and Regulation Therapy for Daily Rhythms (BE-SMART-DR), that provides self-directed strategies to regularize sleep and other DRs to reduce short-term suicide risk that can be used lifelong to potentially also reduce long-term suicide risk.",

Participation will include research clinical/behavioral interviews and symptom self-ratings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, actigraphy wearables, and use of smart phones for ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Subjects will participate in 12 weekly sessions and 6-month in person follow-up.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Show pre-post BE-SMART-DR suicidal ideation and propensity (SI/P) decreases associated with DR regularity and quality increases\n2. Show pre-post BE-SMART-DR improvements in the functioning of a brain system that subserves emotional and other behavioral control (i.e., a hypothalamus-amygdala-ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC), (HAV), system)"
