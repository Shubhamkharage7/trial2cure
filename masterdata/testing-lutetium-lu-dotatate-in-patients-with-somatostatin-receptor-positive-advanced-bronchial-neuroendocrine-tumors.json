            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate compared to the usual treatment (everolimus) in treating patients with somatostatin receptor positive bronchial neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced). Radioactive drugs, such as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and may reduce harm to normal cells. Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate may be more effective than everolimus in shrinking or stabilizing advanced bronchial neuroendocrine tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of receiving lutetium Lu 177 dotatate to that of receiving everolimus in patients with bronchial neuroendocrine tumor (NET).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the overall survival (OS) of receiving lutetium Lu 177 dotatate versus everolimus in patients with bronchial NET.\n\nII. To compare the overall response rate (ORR) associated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate versus everolimus in patients with bronchial NET.\n\nIII. To evaluate and compare the toxicity profile of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and everolimus.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To study late toxicities of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate therapy including renal dysfunction, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute leukemia.\n\nII. To study the impact of pretreatment disease burden, somatostatin receptor status on lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET) (or other somatostatin receptor \\[SSTR\\]-PET), and measured dosimetry of response.\n\nIII. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and other efficacy parameters in typical and atypical carcinoid based on central retrospective pathology review.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 56 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET) during screening. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during screening and on the trial as well as fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on the trial. Additionally, patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection during screening and on the trial.\n\nARM II: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression may be able to cross-over to Arm I. Patients undergo PET during screening. Patients also undergo CT or MRI during screening and on the trial as well as FDG PET and SPECT on the trial. Additionally, patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection during screening and on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years following study registration."
