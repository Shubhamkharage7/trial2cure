This study is seeking participants who:\n\n1. Are age \\<21 years.\n2. Have presentation to participating medical center with evaluation in Emergency Room and/or hospitalization.\n3. Received either the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or booster dose(s) of COMIRNATY within 7 days of symptom onset.\n4. Meet criteria of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition of probable or confirmed myocarditis/pericarditis\n5. Are capable of giving signed informed consent/assent (by parents/legal guardians of minors and/or patients), which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the Informed Consent/Assent Document and in this protocol OR meets criteria for waiver of consent.\n\nThis study will examine the potential long-term effects associated with myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with COMIRNATY. The association of myocarditis/pericarditis in participants who received the study vaccine (COMIRNATY) compared with those associated with COVID-19 will also be examined. This will help us determine if COMIRNATY is safe and effective, and if there is a myocarditis/pericarditis association that should be noted. Participants will take part in this study for up to 5 years. During this time, they will receive complete cardiac imaging tests, and have follow up visits per guidance stated in the study protocol.",

A description of the three cohorts is as follows:\n\nCohort 1: Prospectively ascertained cases of probable or confirmed myocarditis/pericarditis associated with COMIRNATY , i.e., participants enrolled under protocol during hospitalization or \\</= 2 weeks of hospital discharge.\n\nCohort 2: Retrospectively ascertained cases of probable or confirmed myocarditis/pericarditis associated with COMIRNATY , i.e., participants enrolled \\> 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Participants can be retrospectively ascertained and enrolled at any time from their COMIRNATY-associated myocarditis/pericarditis.\n\nCohort 3: Comparator cohort of COVID-19- related myocarditis/pericarditis , including MIS-C, both retrospectively and prospectively ascertained, and enrolled at any time from their COVID-19 or MIS-C associated myocarditis/pericarditis diagnosis.\n\nParticipants in all cohorts will be those who present to participating medical centers for care. This study is a collaboration between the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)'s Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) and Pfizer.\n\nEnrollment will include approximately 300 prospectively and retrospectively ascertained cases of children, adolescents, and young adults \\<21 years of age who receive care for myocarditis/pericarditis associated with COMIRNATY (Cohort 1 and 2); and approximately 100 persons \\<21 years of age with COVID -19-associated myocarditis/pericarditis, including MIS-C (Cohort 3)."
