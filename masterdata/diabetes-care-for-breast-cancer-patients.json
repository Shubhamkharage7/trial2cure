We will have two groups, the researchers will decide who is in which group. One group will be working with a nurse who is trained in diabetes care while the other does not. This will allow the investigators to see if having a trained nurse as part of the care team can help improve the care the patients receive.",
            "detailedDescription": "The present study aims to develop a stakeholder-engaged nurse practitioner (NP)-led intervention to improve diabetes care for patients with breast cancer and diabetes who are undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nThis is a pilot feasibility study, in which we will use a quasi-experimental pre-post design with non-randomized intervention and control groups. In this feasibility study, the investigators will first enroll 38 eligible patients for the control group and collect effectiveness measures at baseline and follow-up (end of chemotherapy or other cancer treatment, \\~12 weeks). Through chart review, the investigators will document cancer treatment regimen completion at follow-up. The investigators will then enroll 38 patients for the intervention group, collecting the effectiveness and implementation outcomes at the end of their treatment (\\~12 weeks).\n\nThe main hypothesis that will be tested in this pilot study is that a nurse practitioner embedded in the oncology team who is trained in diabetes management may successfully manage diabetes during active cancer care for patients undergoing cancer treatment."
