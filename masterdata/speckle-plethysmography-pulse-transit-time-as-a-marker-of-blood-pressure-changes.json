            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nBlood pressure is one of the key markers of cardiovascular health. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, can increase the risk of heart disease or stroke. Monitoring a person s blood pressure continuously over a 24-hour period at home is the best way to diagnose hypertension, but the equipment currently used to do it is cumbersome. This natural history study will test a new technique for monitoring blood pressure continuously over time.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a new technique (speckle plethysmography) for measuring blood pressure in healthy adults.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people aged 18 years and older.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will come to the clinic a minimum of 2 times.\n\nThe screening visit will last up to 2 hours. Participants will have a physical exam. Their vital signs will be taken.\n\nThe clinical visit will last up to 1 hour. Participants will recline in a chair. Sensors to measure the activity of the heart will be placed on their chest. Different sensors will be placed on two fingers and one big toe. A device to measure blood pressure will be placed on one arm.\n\nWhile wearing the sensors, participants will undergo 3 tests:\n\nThey will be asked to breathe slowly for 2 minutes.\n\nThey will be asked to solve a math problem.\n\nThey will immerse one hand or foot into an ice bath for up to 2 minutes.\n\nEach test will be followed by a 5-minute recovery period.\n\nParticipants may elect to return for up to 3 more visits during the following week.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis pilot study will investigate the use of a recently introduced optical technique, speckle plethysmography (SPG), as an alternative to photoplethysmography (PPG) for cuff-free blood pressure (BP) estimation using pulse transit time (PTT). Because of the increased signal quality of SPG in comparison to PPG, we hypothesize that pulse transit times calculated from ECG-SPG (sPTT) will have a better correlation to blood pressure than ECG-PPG (pPTT).\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To examine the use of sPTT as a marker for blood pressure.\n\nSecondary Objective: To evaluate the use of sPTT in comparison to pPTT.\n\nExploratory Objectives: To explore if the SPG waveform by itself can be used as a marker for blood pressure.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints: Pearson correlation coefficient between sPTT and BP.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Pearson correlation coefficient between pPTT and BP.\n\nExploratory Endpoints: Pearson correlation coefficient between BP and signal markers to be determined."
