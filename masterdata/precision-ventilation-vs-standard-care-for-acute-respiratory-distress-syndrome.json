            "briefSummary": "The goal of this interventional study is to compare standard mechanical ventilation to a lung-stress oriented ventilation strategy in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Participants will be ventilated according to one of two different strategies. The main question the study hopes to answer is whether the personalized ventilation strategy helps improve survival.",
            "detailedDescription": "ARDS is a devastating condition that places a heavy burden on public health resources. Recent changes in the practice of mechanical ventilation have improved survival in ARDS, but mortality remains unacceptably high.\n\nThis application is for support of a phase III multi-centered, randomized controlled trial of mechanical ventilation, directed by driving pressure and esophageal manometry, in patients with moderate or severe ARDS. The primary hypothesis is that precise ventilator titration to maintain lung stress within 0-12 centimeters of water (cm H2O), the normal physiological range experienced during relaxed breathing, will improve 60-day mortality, compared to guided usual care.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine the effect on mortality of the precision ventilation strategy, compared to guided usual care, in patients with moderate or severe ARDS.\n\n\u2022 Hypothesis 1: The precision ventilation strategy will decrease 60-day mortality (primary trial endpoint).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To evaluate the effects on lung injury of the precision ventilation strategy, compared to guided usual care, in patients with moderate or severe ARDS.\n\n* Hypothesis 2a: The precision ventilation strategy will improve clinical pulmonary recovery, defined using the composite endpoint alive and ventilator-free (AVF).\n* Hypothesis 2b: The precision ventilation strategy will attenuate alveolar epithelial injury.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To evaluate the hemodynamic safety profile of the precision ventilation strategy, compared to guided usual care, in patients with moderate or severe ARDS.\n\n\u2022 Hypothesis 3: The precision ventilation strategy will decrease hemodynamic instability, measured as shock-free days through Day 28."
