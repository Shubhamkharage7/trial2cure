US adults who are their households' primary shoppers will complete a shopping task in a naturalistic online grocery store. They will be exposed to different front-of-package food labeling systems and asked to shop for groceries. The online store will record participants' selections. Participants will also be asked to complete survey measures.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to determine whether certain front-of-package food labeling systems improve the healthfulness of consumers' grocery selections. The survey research company Cloud Research will recruit a sample of approximately 5,610 US adults ages 18+ who read and speak English and who are their households' primary grocery shopper.\n\nParticipants will complete a between-subjects online randomized experiment. They will be randomized to 1 of 6 front-of-package labeling systems: 1) positive labels, 2) spectrum labels, 3) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) high in labels, 4) FDA traffic light labels, 5) FDA high in labels plus positive labels, or 6) FDA traffic light labels plus positive labels. Participants will complete a shopping task in a naturalistic online grocery store. Participants will be instructed to shop as they usually would for items in the following categories: non-alcoholic beverages (e.g., juice, coffee, tea, soda, sports drinks, water), breads and baked goods, breakfast cereals, soups, boxed and frozen meals, and snacks (e.g., chips, crackers, nuts, applesauce, dried fruit). They will be given a budget based on average spending in these categories in a large supermarket chain. The store will record participants' selections. After completing the shopping task, participants will complete an online survey."
