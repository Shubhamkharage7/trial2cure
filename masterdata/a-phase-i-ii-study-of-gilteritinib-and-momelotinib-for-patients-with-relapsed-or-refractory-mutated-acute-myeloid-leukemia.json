Active Class III-V cardiac failure as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.\n4. Active central nervous system leukemia\n5. Child-Turcotte-Pugh class C cirrhosis\n6.

Participants who have positive hepatitis C antibody may be included if they have an undetectable hepatitis C viral load.\n8. Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment is not anticipated to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen may be included only after discussion with the PI\n9. Treatment with any investigational antileukemic agents or chemotherapy agents in the last 7 days before study entry, unless full recovery from side effects has occurred or participant has rapidly progressive disease judged to be life-threatening by the investigator.\n\n   Prior recent treatment with corticosteroids, hydroxyurea and/or cytarabine (given for cytoreduction) permitted.\n10. Inability to swallow\n11. Unable or unwilling to sign informed consent\n12. Pregnant women will not be eligible; A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: i. Is a woman of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP), OR ii. Is a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of \\<1% per year), with low user dependency, during the intervention period and for at least 4 month after the last dose of study drug.\n13. Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n14. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to gilteritinib, momelotinib or other agents used in study.",
