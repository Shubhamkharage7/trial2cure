During collection of much of the food waste data, participants will record in the app if food waste will be disposed of via composting, disposal, fed to pets, or garbage/landfill. They will also indicate if the food was spoiled, past the expiration date, etc. This will occur for 4-8 days. Participants should perform the prep and eat occasions 4-8 days. The shopping and toss occasions should be completed for at least 7 days."
