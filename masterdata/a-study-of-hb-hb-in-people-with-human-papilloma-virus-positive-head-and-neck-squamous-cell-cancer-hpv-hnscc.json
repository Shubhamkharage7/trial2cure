Participants will have no evidence of cancer on imaging scans (radiographically) or by medical examination (clinically). Past studies have shown that a positive NavDx test strongly suggests the possible presence of microscopic cancer, though we do not know if testing positive will definitely lead to the cancer coming back (recurrence). The NavDx blood test has not been approved by the FDA and is considered investigational."
