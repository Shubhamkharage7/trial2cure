The investigators plan to recruit 30 PD, 30 AD/Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), and 60 age matched healthy controls in this study to study the role of immune response in PD and AD.\n\nThe study involves up to two study visits involving brief questionnaires and blood draw of up to 250cc (approximately 17 tablespoons) to be collected. More ways to participate, including 1) smaller amount blood donation (up to 100cc per visit for 1-2 visits); and 2) participation via tele-visit and mobile phlebotomy visits (blood donation up to 50cc, \\~5 tubes, by a certified mobile phlebotomist at home/location of choice) now available.",
            "detailedDescription": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the misprocessing of specific proteins, but how and if this results in cell death is unknown. This study is being conducted to better understand the role of inflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both AD and PD have long been known to feature prominent neuroinflammatory components. Preliminary studies have found autoimmune features in several patients including recognition of self-antigens by specific T cells. This study will test the hypothesis that AD and PD are associated with self-derived antigens (alpha-syn and tau protein) that become recognized by T cells during aging and disease. The overall aim is to identify antigenic responses associated with PD and AD. The specific aims include:\n\n1. Identify the protein(s) or protein segments that may trigger inflammation\n2. Identify the T cells (immune cells) that may recognize and kill brain cells (neurons and astrocytes)\n3. Identify the genetic profile associated with this immune response (genetic analysis of the immune system)"
