            "briefSummary": "This study will help determine the tolerability and efficacy of the mood-stabilizing anticonvulsant lamotrigine in youth with alcohol use disorder. It will also help establish whether and how lamotrigine improves outcomes related to alcohol use. The results of this proof-of-concept study will inform whether a future larger clinical trial is warranted.",
            "detailedDescription": "Adolescent alcohol use is a leading public health concern worldwide. Clinical trials have tested a variety of psychosocial interventions with youth that yield only modest short-term benefits. One potential way to improve treatments is to augment psychosocial interventions with pharmacotherapy. The National Institutes of Health has mounted a concerted effort to identify medications that reduce drinking for nearly three decades. Although this effort improved treatment for adults, no medication is indicated for adolescent use and randomized controlled trials with teenagers are almost nonexistent. This gap raises key questions about whether and how medications could benefit youth. Optimizing treatment options for youth requires closing this important gap. Lamotrigine is safe with adolescents and does not adversely interact with alcohol. Lamotrigine targets brain mechanisms implicated in alcohol use disorder, and it has shown to help treat adults with alcohol problems. Yet, despite its widespread use with children and adolescents, no published double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have examined the effects of lamotrigine on drinking-related behavior in youth. The purpose of this study is to determine how well teenagers accept lamotrigine plus alcohol education to reduce adolescent alcohol use. This study will also tell us whether teenagers' alcohol use, craving, and enjoyment of drinking are reduced by lamotrigine."
