An entire cycle will be 28 days of continuous Tofacitinib dosing. There will be a gap of 18-24 days between the first and subsequent cycles of treatment. The patient will once again be assessed on Cycle 2 Day 1. An interim follow-up will be done after the second cycle, during which the patient will undergo a brain MRI for tumor measurements along with all other assessments. Subsequent cycles will continue as prior, with subject assessments, brain MRI, and toxicity evaluations every 4 weeks. Treatments will stop upon evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if the physician deems it unsafe for the subject to continue in the study."

NOTE: Prior treatment with Novo-TTF therapy is allowed at initial diagnosis but must be discontinued prior to study entry.\n10. GBMs of the study patients must have EGFR gene amplification, which will be detected by next generation sequencing of tumor tissue from resected sample.\n11. Prior use of bevacizumab is allowed, however patient must be off of this medication for 180 days.\n12. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined by the following criteria:\n\n    * ANC \u22651.5 \u00d7 10(9)/L\n    * Platelets \u2265100 \u00d7 10(9)/L\n    * Hemoglobin \u22658 g/dL\n    * Total bilirubin \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with a total bilirubin \u22642.0 times ULN and direct bilirubin within normal limits are permitted.\n\nALT and AST \u22643 \u00d7 ULN\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior treatment with an EGFR or JAK inhibitor.\n2. Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of the cancer under study.\n3. Patients unable to undergo brain MRI scans with IV gadolinium contrast.\n4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Tofacitinib\n5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.\n6. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.\n7. Prior history of hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, or inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure \\> 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure \\> 100 mmHg while on antihypertensive medication).\n8. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product, or previous significant gastrointestinal resection that would preclude adequate absorption of the trial medications.\n9. History of another malignancy in the previous 3 years, with a disease-free interval of \\< 3 years. Patients with prior history of in situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible.\n10. Concurrent use of Bevacizumab.",
