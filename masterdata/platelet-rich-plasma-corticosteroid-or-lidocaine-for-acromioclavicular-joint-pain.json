Patients that consent and enroll will be randomized to receive (1) a corticosteroid injection, (2) an injection of Platelet Rich Plasma, or (3) a Lidocaine injection. Follow-up will occur over a 1 year period.",

Patients that consent and enroll will be randomized to receive (1) a corticosteroid injection, (2) an injection of Platelet Rich Plasma, or (3) a Lidocaine injection. The primary outcome will be the change in PROMIS Physical Function Scale at 6 months post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes will include additional time points (viz, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 12 months post-enrollment) and additional metrics (eg, AUC) as well as the PROMIS Pain Interference, Patient Acceptable Symptom State, Global Rating of Change, total limited duty days, and perceived recovery. Since the sample size is too small to establish non-inferiority by traditional hypothesis testing, a fully Bayesian approach will be used."
