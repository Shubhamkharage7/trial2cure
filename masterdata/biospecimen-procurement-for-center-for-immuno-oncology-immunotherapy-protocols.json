            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nCancer has a major impact in the United States and across the world. In 2015, over 1.5 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. Researchers want to study samples from people with cancer or a pre-malignant condition. They hope to develop more effective treatments.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo better understand the biology of malignancies and why certain cancers respond differently to treatment.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults at least 18 years old with cancer or a pre-cancerous condition.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. Their diagnosis will be confirmed by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology.\n\nParticipants will send tissue blocks or slides from their original tumor biopsy.\n\nAt least once, participants will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.\n\nParticipants may have the following tests. They may have them more than once:\n\nApheresis. A needle in one arm removes blood. Blood is run through a machine and the sample cells are taken out. The rest of the blood is returned by a needle in the other arm.\n\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The hipbone will be numbed. A needle will be put into the hipbone. Bone marrow will be taken out through the needle.\n\nPiece of cancer tissue taken by a needle and syringe.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) scan or ultrasound to help locate their tumor. For the scans, they lie in a machine that takes pictures.\n\nA small piece of skin removed.\n\nParticipants will be contacted by phone once a year to find out how they are doing.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n-Immunotherapy is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer. CIO investigators are studying immunotherapy for the treatment of diverse malignant and premalignant conditions. These studies require the collection of biospecimens for research purposes.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To collect and bank blood, apheresis products, tumor, body fluids, and other biospecimens from patients with cancer or a premalignant disease or at risk of cancer from an immunodeficiency.\n* To collect and bank biospecimens as directed by companion CIO immunotherapy clinical trial protocols.\n* To conduct nucleic acid, protein, and immunological and biological research studies on samples collected.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Patients must be 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of cancer or a premalignant condition or an immunodeficiency that increases the risk of being diagnosed with a cancer or premalignant condition.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled.\n* Patients will undergo sampling of blood, apheresis products, tumor, effusions, ascites, urine, bone marrow, serum, plasma, skin, mucosa, or other tissues for banking and laboratory studies.\n* No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol."
