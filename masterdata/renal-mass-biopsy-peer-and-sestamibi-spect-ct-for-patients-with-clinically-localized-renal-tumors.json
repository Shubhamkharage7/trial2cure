These can be done on paper, electronically, or by telephone.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators are asking the participant to take part in this research study because they were diagnosed with a kidney tumor. Kidney tumors can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer) and the investigators hope to figure out how to better tell them apart before surgery or other treatment.\n\nThe investigators hope to better tell apart whether kidney tumors are benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer) based on a biopsy or imaging tests and ask patients how they feel about decisions they make about treatment of their kidney tumor.\n\nBiopsy is a standard test to determine if a tumor is cancerous before making a treatment decision.\n\nThe imaging test (99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT) the investigators are studying has been studied before and found to help identify benign kidney tumors. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for imaging kidney tumors. It is FDA approved for use in imaging the heart and breasts. It has been studied for use in parathyroid gland imaging.\n\nThe participant will be asked to complete survey questions related to their health and kidney tumor at the start and end of the study. The participant will receive a 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT scan (if they have not had one already) for research purposes. The participant will receive a biopsy of the kidney tumor (if they have not had one already) as part of their routine clinical care. The participant will then receive treatment of the kidney tumor as determined by consultation with their doctor."
