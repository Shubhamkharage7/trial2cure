            "briefSummary": "This pilot study evaluates the role terpenes play in the stress-reducing effects of a forest bathing intervention. Participants will participate in two interventions in random order: 1) terpene exposure and 2) no terpene exposure.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will use an individual-level crossover design in which each session is conducted independently and on different days. Participants will be outfitted with a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) to selectively modulate exposure to a natural suite of forest-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) while present in forest environments. Each participant will undergo two forest bathing sessions, one in which VOCs are not filtered (treatment condition), and one in which they are filtered (control condition). Sessions will be separated by a 7-day washout period for each participant, and order will be counterbalanced. The investigators will estimate the average effect of treatment over 40 distinct treatment days against 40 distinct control/filtered days. The power and sample size calculations (N = 40) were determined using previous nature exposure studies of similar cross-over design. The study is adequately powered assuming the conventional targets of \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 0.80 with a 10% anticipated dropout rate, and including temperature, wind, and light variability during treatment days.\n\nThe specific aim of this project is to 1) assess whether VOC inhalation regulates increases in the high frequency (HF) (ms2) component of heart rate variability (HRV) as the primary outcome (with decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, self-reported stress, and levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum included as secondary outcomes); and 1a) assess the degree of association of absorbed dose of seven forest-derived VOCs in serum (i.e., \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b2-myrcene, \u2206 3-carene, d-limonene, \u03b2- caryophyllene, \u03b1-humulene) with these outcomes."
