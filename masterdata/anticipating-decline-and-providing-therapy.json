The trial aims to enroll 120 older adults (age 60 or older).",
            "detailedDescription": "Anticipating Decline and Providing Therapy (ADAPT) is a program designed to support the implementation of a routine post-ICU cognitive impairment screening and support intervention. The program includes a routine validated cognitive screen for high-risk older adults at 6 weeks and 6 months post-ICU discharge. Patients with a screening assessment that may be consistent with cognitive impairment or dementia will receive additional resources including a specialized care plan developed by the Sticht Center for Healthy Aging and Alzheimer's Prevention. The specialized care plan is adapted from a health system-based dementia care intervention and designed to support post-ICU cognitive concerns. It was adapted with input from geriatrics, intensive care, and outpatient primary care clinicians. Also conducted are semi-structured interviews with 22 older adult ICU survivors and 6 primary care physicians to elicit preferences and the intervention was further adapted based on these results."
