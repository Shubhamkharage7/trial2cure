Note: Participants on effective antiretroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment are eligible for this trial.\n* Systemic active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result), or hepatitis C. Note: Participants with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \\[anti-HBc\\] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Participants positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.\n* History of bleeding diathesis (irrespective of severity) in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection.\n* Any condition that could make the patient noncompliant with the study procedures and/or study requirements, as judged by the Investigator.\n* Active skin disorder that has required systemic therapy within the past 1 year.\n* History of rhabdomyolysis.\n* Concurrent ocular disorders:\n\n  * Patients with history of glaucoma, history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes.\n  * Patients with history of retinal pathology or evidence of visible retinal pathology that is considered a risk factor for RVO, intraocular pressure \\> 21 mm Hg as measured by tonometry, or other significant ocular pathology, such as anatomical abnormalities that increase the risk for RVO.\n  * Patients with active or chronic, visually significant corneal disorders, other active ocular conditions requiring ongoing therapy or clinically significant corneal disease that prevents adequate monitoring of drug-induced keratopathy. Examples of visually significant corneal disorders include corneal degeneration, active or recurrent keratitis, and other forms of serious ocular surface inflammatory conditions. Visually significant corneal disorders do NOT include dry eyes, blepharitis, and uncomplicated corneal erosions.\n* Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the active (avutometinib, defactinib, encorafenib) or inactive ingredients of the investigational products.\n* Exposure to medications (with or without prescriptions), supplements, herbal remedies, or foods with potential for drug-drug interactions with study interventions within 14 days prior to the first dose of study intervention and during the course of therapy, including:\n\n  * Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, due to potential drug-drug interactions with both avutometinib and defactinib.\n  * Strong CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers, due to potential drug-drug interactions with defactinib.\n  * Strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors or inducers, due to potential drug-drug interactions with both avutometinib and defactinib.\n  * Strong breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors or inducers, due to potential drug-drug interactions with avutometinib.\n* Concomitant treatment with warfarin. Patients who require anticoagulation but cannot discontinue warfarin must be excluded from the study.\n* Participants taking other prohibited medications in protocol, including anticancer therapy or investigational agents and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). A washout period of prohibited medications for a period of at least five half-lives or as clinically indicated should occur before the start of treatment.\n* The diagnosis of another malignancy within \u2264 2 years before study enrollment, except for those considered to be adequately treated with no evidence of disease or symptoms and/or will not require therapy during the study duration (i.e., basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the breast, bladder or of the cervix, or low-grade prostate cancer with Gleason Score \u2264 6)\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures (e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medication, \\[subjects may not receive the drug through a feeding tube\\], social/ psychological issues, etc.)\n* Medical, psychiatric, cognitive, or other conditions that may compromise the subject's ability to understand the subject information, give informed consent, comply with the study protocol or complete the study.",
