            "briefSummary": "This is a phase I/II clinical trial assessing the tolerability and efficacy of CM4620 in children and young adults with acute pancreatitis caused by asparaginase. The tolerability of CM4620 when given to patients receiving frontline chemotherapy will be determined. The effectiveness in reducing the severity of pancreatitis will be estimated.\n\nPrimary Objectives\n\nTo assess the safety of CM4620 administration in children and young adults with asparaginase associated pancreatitis (AAP).\n\nTo profile dose-limiting toxicities and responses of the patients treated in the dose-finding phase.\n\nTo estimate the efficacy of CM4620 to prevent pseudocyst or necrotizing pancreatitis in children with AAP.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo determine the effect of CM4620 on the incidence of severe pancreatitis\n\nTo determine the effect of CM4620 on the incidence of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS).",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open label safety and efficacy evaluation with comparison of toxicity to a historical control population (TOTXVI). There will be 3 cohorts of patients enrolled, and the dose for each cohort will be determined based on the toxicities experienced in the ongoing and prior cohorts.\n\nAn initial 9 patients (cohort 1) will be enrolled and will receive dose level 1 and monitored for toxicity. If the therapy is well tolerated, 6 patients (cohort 2) will be treated at dose level 2. Subsequent enrollment of 9 patients (cohort 3) will be at either dose level 1 or 2 based on tolerability. The keyboard design will be used to determine the dosing for cohorts 2 and 3. Additional patients will be enrolled at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) until a total of 24 patients have been treated at that dose, including any treated during the dose-finding phase.\n\nCM4620 will be given days 1-4 as an IV infusion beginning within 36 hours of the onset of acute pancreatitis associated abdominal pain and within 8 hours of enrollment. For patients with prior abdominal pain or in those unable to communicate the location/characteristic of their pain, a change in the characteristic of the pain or new enzyme elevation/imaging findings after previously normal studies will determine the timing of onset of pancreatitis.\n\nPatients will be followed for about 4 months after treatment."
