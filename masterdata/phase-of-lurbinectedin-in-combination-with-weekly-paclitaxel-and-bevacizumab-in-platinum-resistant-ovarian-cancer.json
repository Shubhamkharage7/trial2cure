Any known history or evidence of hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for HCV RNA or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen); Known to be HIV seropositive\n10. Grade \\>2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline (within 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1).\n11. Serious psychiatric or medical conditions that could interfere with treatment;\n12.
