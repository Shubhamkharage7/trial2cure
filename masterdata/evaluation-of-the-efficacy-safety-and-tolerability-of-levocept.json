Planned use of any non-contraceptive estrogen, progesterone or testosterone any time during the 60 months of study participation;\n10. Exclusively breastfeeding before return of menses; lactating women will be excluded unless they have had 2 normal menstrual periods prior to enrollment;\n11. Unexplained abnormal uterine bleeding (suspicious for a serious condition), including bleeding 4 weeks post-septic abortion or puerperal sepsis;\n12. Severely heavy or painful menstrual bleeding;\n13. Suspected or known cervical, uterine or ovarian cancer, or unresolved clinically significant abnormal Pap test requiring evaluation or treatment;\n14. Any history of gestational trophoblastic disease with or without detectable elevated \u00df-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u00df-hCG) levels, or related malignant disease;\n15.

Known anatomical abnormalities of the cervix such as severe cervical stenosis, prior trachelectomy or extensive conization that, in the opinion of the investigator would prevent cervical dilation and study drug placement;\n18. Untreated or unresolved acute cervicitis or vaginitis;\n19. Known or suspected breast cancer or other progestin-sensitive cancer now or in the past;\n20. Known acute liver disease or liver tumor;\n21. Subjects who have an established immunodeficiency;\n22. Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or clinical AIDS;\n23.
