The diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis will be based on the diagnostic criteria for pulmonary sarcoidosis recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS, 2020).\n\nSubjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OATD-01 or placebo for 12 weeks. A stratification of the study population based on previous treatment status for sarcoidosis (previously treated/treatment-na\u00efve) will be applied for statistical analysis without limitation for the ratio between the subject groups.
