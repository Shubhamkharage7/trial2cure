Our previous studies showed abnormal sensations of second pain (wind-up), indicating central hypersensitivity as an important mechanism of FM. Triggering events have been implicated as the cause of central hypersensitivity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Increasing evidence has shown that the hypersensitivity of FM is not limited to painful stimuli but seems to extend to non-painful stimuli as well. These stimuli include smell, taste, touch, light, and sound. This study will provide detailed QST examinations of FM subjects and controls' responses to light using visually evoked potentials (VEP). In addition, careful characterization of experimental pain responding across multiple sensory modalities will be examined."
