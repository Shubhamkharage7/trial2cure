A standard 3+3 design will be used to determine the MTD of APG-2575 as single agent in patients with solid tumors and MTD and RP2D of APG-2575 in combination with palbociclib in patients with breast cancer (MTD-combo). The phase II portion is a signal seeking expansion of APG-2575 at RP2D in combination with palbociclib in patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancers who have progressed during or relapsed after CDK 4/6inhibitor therapy. The phase \u2161 portion will be conducted based on Simon's Minimax two stage design."
