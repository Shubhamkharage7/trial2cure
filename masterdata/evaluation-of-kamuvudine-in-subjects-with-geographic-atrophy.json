Up to 5 subjects will receive study medication. Study treatment will be administered by intravitreal injections.\n\nParticipants will have 7 scheduled visits - Screening with baseline (injection), safety visit 2 days after injection, week 4, week 13 (injection), safety visit 2 days after injection, week 17, week 26.\n\nExams will look for continuous changes in visual acuity, change in area of geographic atrophy lesions in diagnostic imaging, response measured by multifocal electroretinogram, change in reading speed, and change in microperimetry response."

Absence of hyperautofluorescence (i.e., pattern = none) is exclusionary.\n* Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), or Fluorescein Angiography (FA) imaging of entire geographic atrophy (GA)lesion at least 6 months prior to entry.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy or who are of childbearing potential not using a reliable method of contraception.\n* History or current evidence of hypersensitivity to any components of the study medication or fluorescein, as assessed by the investigator.\n* Participation in any investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to baseline\n* History or current evidence of a medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude the safe administration of study medication or affect the results of the study.\n* Participation in any systemic experimental treatment or any other systemic investigational new drug within 6 weeks or 5 half-lives of the active ingredient (whichever is longer) prior to the start of study treatment. Clinical trials solely involving observation, over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, or diets are not exclusionary.\n* Active ocular or periocular infections, malignancy\n* History of major ophthalmic surgery in the past 3 months, and any ophthalmic surgery in study eye in the last 30 days\n* History of significant ocular disease other than age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that may confound results\n* Known hypersensitivity to study drug or any of the excipients in implant.\n* Macular atrophy secondary to a condition other than age-related macular degeneration (AMD)\n* History of laser therapy in the macular region.\n* Aphakia or surgically compromised/absent posterior capsule including presence of scleral fixated lenses. Note: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy for posterior capsule opacification done at least 60 days prior to screening is not exclusionary.\n* History of prior posterior vitrectomy.\n* History of prior intraocular gene therapy for any indication.\n* Uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as intraocular pressure \\>21mm Hg despite treatment with ocular hypotensive medications at baseline).\n* Prior participation in another interventional clinical study or treatment for GA in either eye including topical, IVT, subretinal, suprachoroidal, periocular or oral medication or placebo within the last 6 weeks or 5 half-lives of the active ingredient (whichever is longer).",
