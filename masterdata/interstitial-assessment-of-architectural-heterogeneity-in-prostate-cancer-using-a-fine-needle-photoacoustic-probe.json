The needle probe will be in the shape of a biopsy needle and compatible with the needle insertion mechanism in the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe. When inserted into the prostate, the fine needle PA probe will assess the histological information in its surrounding tissue without any tissue extraction. The needle probe has been tested in prostate tissue samples and whole human prostates ex vivo."

The technical failure is that we will not be able to achieve measurements with signal-to-noise ratios larger than 1 in 10% of the measurements. We will have a futility analysis after first 5 patients are completed (thus 10 measurements). If of those 10 measurements, 2 have a SNR less 1, then the study will be stopped as it is unlikely to meet its 90% target.",
