The treatment, EQuIP (Empowering Queer Identities in Psychotherapy), uses a CBT-based transdiagnostic approach to target the common cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to minority stress that lead to mental and behavioral health disparities for sexual minority women. We will assess in a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) whether the EQuIP treatment demonstrates significant reductions in heavy drinking (HD) and mental health symptoms (e.g., depression) compared to LGBTQ-affirmative Treatment-As-Usual. The investigators will assess whether psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., emotion dysregulation) mediate reductions in heavy drinking and separately and identify whether EQuIP is differentially efficacious across key demographic factors."
