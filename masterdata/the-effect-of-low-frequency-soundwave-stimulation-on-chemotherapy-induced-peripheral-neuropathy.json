            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of SensoniQ\u00ae Treatment Station in preventing or reducing chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients receiving frontline carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for a gynecologic malignancy. This study will also assess the improvement of CIPN in patients who have previously received carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy with persistent Grade 2 or worse neuropathy.\n\nThe main questions this clinical trial aims to answer are:\n\n1. To investigate the efficacy of SensoniQ\u00ae Treatment Station on the prevention or reduction of CIPN in gynecologic oncology patients receiving front line carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n2. To investigate the efficacy of SensoniQ\u00ae Treatment Station on the improvement of existing CIPN in patients who previously received chemotherapy with platinum agent and paclitaxel for a gynecologic malignancy",
            "detailedDescription": "Chemotherapy induced neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect in patients undergoing treatment for gynecologic malignancies. The most common treatment is a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. A previous analysis of these patients show that 71% experience chemo induced peripheral with neuropathy with 30% experiencing Grade 2 and 32% experiencing Grade 3. There is currently no intervention to prevent CIPN and only one medication, duloxetine, is recommended as treatment based on ASCO guidelines.\n\nThe SensoniQ\u00ae Treatment Station is a chemotherapy chair with multiple transducers that release low- frequency sound waves to different points on the body in a preset frequency, distribution and time during a chemotherapy infusion. Previous investigational studies using SensoniQ\u00ae Treatment during chemotherapy infusion showed a reduction in neuropathy without any additional side effects or complications.\n\nThis study seeks to show patient response measured by questionnaires to SensoniQ\u00ae Treatment and correlate with neurologic test findings to show reduced CIPN in patients undergoing frontline chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel as well as improvement in patients with existing CIPN. This treatment has the potential to change recommendations for prevention of CIPN and improve adherence to treatment and quality of life."
