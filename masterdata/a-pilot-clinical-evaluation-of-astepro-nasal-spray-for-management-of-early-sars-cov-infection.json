            "detailedDescription": "In this study, the study team aims to re-confirm the utility of this medication for use in Covid-19 to decrease the significant impact on quality of life, symptoms, infectivity, and occupation. plan to recruit vaccinated adults immediately upon Covid-19 diagnosis at one major Chicago University and follow viral load as a primary outcome in those randomized to receive Astepro\u00ae vs. placebo. Subjects who have a home antigen test or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive diagnosis of Covid-19 will be enrolled in the study. Viral load will be assessed at Day -1, day of presentation, followed by self-collected saliva over the subsequent 10 days in patients getting either azelastine or placebo.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\nTo address this hypothesis, the study team is investigating the following specific aims:\n\n1. Compare the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper airway of adults with new onset Covid-19 randomized to receive azelastine at standard rhinitis dosing (n=70) or placebo (n=70) over 10 days. The study team will target early disease (immediately upon diagnosis), mild severity in outpatients (facilitating study participation and self-sample collection), and pragmatic, receptive target populations (volunteers living nearby).\n2. Determine if there is a decrease in R0 in Covid-19 positive patients and their closest contacts The study team hypothesizes that less new covid infections will be observed among close contacts who co-habitate with subjects randomized to the Astepro (azelastine) arm.\n3. Determine whether treatment with azelastine improves pertinent clinical parameters in these subjects. Rates, durations, and intensities of key symptoms will be captured using existing, low burden data collection instruments that meet FDA guidelines. All sample and data collection, including validated, objective olfactory testing, will be contactless, minimizing risk.\n4. Assess and quantitate side effects, subject satisfaction, and tolerability of azelastine in this setting. Given the heterogeneous nature of Covid-19, the study team will assess the feasibility of this treatment from the patient standpoint, including qualitative and quantitative feedback, to inform future trials and scaling."
