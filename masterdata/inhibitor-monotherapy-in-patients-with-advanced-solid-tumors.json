The study will include 2 components: 1) a Dose-Escalation Component for participants with advanced solid tumors and 2) a Dose-Expansion Component for participants with advanced solid tumors harboring certain specific mutations/rearrangements that result in hyperactivation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Participants will be treated until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first."
