            "detailedDescription": "The study will have 2 cohorts. Cohort A will include haploidentical donor who is identical to the stem cell donor. Cohort B will include haploidentical donor who is different from the stem cell donor. Seropositive donors will be screened for the presence of CMV- and ADV-specific T-cells using a functional flow cytometry assay. The donor will be considered suitable if the percentage of CD3+/IFN-\u03b3+ cells is greater than 0.01% of CD3+ T-cells. Donor leukocytes will be collected using the Spectra Optia system. CMV- and ADV-specific T-cells will be isolated from donor leukocytes by 'IFN-\u03b3-capture' technology using the Prodigy device over a 24-36 hour period and infused."
