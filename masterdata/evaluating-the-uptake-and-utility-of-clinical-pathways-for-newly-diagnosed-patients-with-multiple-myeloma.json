            "briefSummary": "All4Cure is partnering with community oncology practices participating in the Quality Cancer Care Alliance (QCCA) and Exigent Research to develop a clinical pathway that standardizes the evaluation, treatment and ongoing management of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who wish to achieve and maintain MRD negativity.\n\nThis is a longitudinal retrospective study that will collect data from three separate cohorts of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). The cohorts classify patients based on whether care is delivered under an intention to adhere to an MRD-targeted clinical pathway, and if so, whether the implementation of that clinical pathway occurs through participation in the All4Cure platform vs. through written documentation. The three cohorts are labeled: Platform, Documentation, and Off-Pathway.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will employ two implementations of an MRD-targeted pathway one that disseminates pathway guidance through written documentation, and another that leverages the All4Cure platform to support pathway adherence through direct engagement of other experts, and through integration of elements of the MRD-targeted pathway into the structured components of the platform. The study also includes a comparator cohort of patients not being treated according to the clinical pathway. Analysis under the primary objective will evaluate outcomes between patients being treated following written pathway documentation and patients being treated off pathway. The primary endpoints are the proportion of patients with achievement of VGPR or better (\u2265VGPR), and the proportion of patients with a CR or better (\u2265CR), within 12 months. Secondary endpoints include MRD negativity, pathway adherence, time to next treatment (TTNT), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and obstacles to getting daratumumab treatment. Sustained MRD negativity is an exploratory endpoint.\n\nData will be collected retrospectively, through stratified random sampling by race within cohort, with patients accrued over a 12-month period. All patients will be followed over time after accrual, with minimum available follow-up of 12 months. Accordingly, the estimated period from first accrual to last follow-up will be approximately 24 months."
