Studying markers such as age, level of proteins in blood, percent of abnormal blood cells in the bone marrow, genes in the abnormal blood cells, and bone abnormalities may help researchers to validate clinical and genomic predictors for future use in clinical practice.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the rate of progression to multiple myeloma after 3 years of follow up.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe baseline patient characteristics and clinical variables. II. To identify molecular and genetic correlates that may predict for progression to multiple myeloma (MM).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood samples every 6 months for 3 years. Patients may also undergo a biopsy, x-rays, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to check the status of disease at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nAfter completion of 3 years on study, patients are followed up every 6-12 months thereafter."
