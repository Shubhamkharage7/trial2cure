            "detailedDescription": "Obesity affects four-in-ten American adults and is associated with hypertension and greater all-cause mortality. Irrespective of weight loss, aerobic exercise reduces arterial blood pressure (BP) and improves cardiometabolic health. However, nearly half of adults with obesity do not perform aerobic exercise because of low leisure time availability and exertional dyspnea secondary to high chest wall mass-related inspiratory muscle dysfunction. In other clinical populations, emerging data demonstrates time-efficient high-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) reduces BP and improves respiratory muscle function. Therefore, the investigators will determine whether eight weeks of daily high-resistance IMST reduces BP, improves respiratory muscle function, and concomitantly reduces exertional dyspnea in a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled (i.e., very low-resistance IMST) clinical trial among adults with obesity"
