            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn whether existing treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be improved. Two treatments for PTSD, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) will be studied. CPT and PE are effective treatments that are widely available, but interventions are needed to improve patient outcomes in these treatments. The investigators have developed an Adjunctive Writing intervention for Amplifying Response and Engagement (AWARE), which was designed using health communication strategies to enhance CPT and PE by improving communication between patients and therapists about patients' experiences in treatment. This research will investigate whether adding AWARE to CPT and PE will lead to better treatment outcomes compared to CPT and PE provided as usual without AWARE. AWARE includes a brief writing task asking patients about their experiences in treatment, as well as guided therapist responses to improve patient-therapist communication about patients' experiences in treatment. In the first phase of the study (case series phase), CPT or PE with AWARE will be provided to four adults with PTSD to pilot test adding AWARE to CPT and PE, seek patient and provider feedback, and refine AWARE. The first four participants who enroll will be part of the case series and will receive CPT or PE with AWARE. Then, in the second phase of the study, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) phase, the investigators will enroll 50 more adults with PTSD who will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive CPT/PE as usual or CPT/PE with AWARE. It is expected that 25 participants will be randomized to CPT/PE with AWARE and 25 participants will be randomized to receive CPT/PE provided as usual. The goals of the RCT phase are to study whether AWARE is acceptable to patients, whether it is feasible to add AWARE to CPT and PE, and whether adding AWARE to CPT and PE improves patient-therapist communication and treatment outcomes compared to CPT/PE as usual."
