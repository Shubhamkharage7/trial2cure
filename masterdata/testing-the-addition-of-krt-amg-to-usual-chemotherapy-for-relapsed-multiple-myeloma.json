            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232 when given together with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in treating patient with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). KRT-232 (AMG 232) may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking a protein called MDM2 that is needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide help shrink or slow the growth of multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carfilzomib and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232, lenalidomide, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone together may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate safety and tolerability of MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232 (KRT-232 \\[AMG 232\\]) in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd). (Part A) II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd). (Part A) III. Confirm the safety and tolerability of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) at MTD/tentative RP2D in a goal of 10 subjects with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma. (Part B)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate progressive disease (PD) effects of KRT-232 (AMG 232) through serum MIC-1 levels. (Part A) II. Assess KRT-232 (AMG 232) exposure-response relationships (PD, toxicity, and efficacy). (Part A) III. Evaluate the overall response rate of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) in relapsed/refractory myeloma by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. (Part B) IV. Evaluate PD effects of KRT-232 (AMG 232) through serum MIC-1 levels. (Part B) V. Assess KRT-232 (AMG 232) exposure-response relationships (PD, toxicity, and efficacy). (Part B)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) in relapsed/refractory myeloma by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. (Part A) II. Evaluate ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression levels of relevant genes in the TP53 pathway that may predict response to therapy using pre- and post-treatment bone marrow biopsies. (Parts A and B)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232.\n\nPatients receive MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, 8-9, and 15-16 of cycles 1-12 and on days 1-2 and 15-16 of cycles 13-18, lenalidomide PO on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO or dexamethasone sodium phosphate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity. Patients undergo echocardiography during screening and bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days."

should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of KRT-232 (AMG 232) administration; this includes one highly effective form of contraception (e.g. intrauterine device \\[IUD\\], hormonal \\[birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants\\] or partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective contraceptive method (e.g. male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap)\n* Subjects must be able to swallow medication\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects with myeloma that is relapsed and/or refractory to KRd when used in combination defined as progression of disease while on therapy or within 60 days of completing therapy\n* Subjects must show evidence of wild-type (WT) p53 status on somatic tissue specimens as assessed by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing; note that since patients with relapsed myeloma have a rapidly proliferating disease, patient can be enrolled and begin treatment prior to obtaining the results of this test; patients who are discovered to have a TP53 mutation will be removed from study after cycle one and can continue on carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd); all enrolled patients will be followed for toxicity\n* Subjects who have not recovered from toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy, defined as not having resolved to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grade 0 or 1, or to levels dictated in the eligibility criteria with the exception of alopecia (grade 2 or 3 toxicities from prior antitumor therapy that are considered irreversible \\[defined as having been present and stable for \\> 6 months\\], such as grade 2 chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, may be allowed if they are not otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND there is agreement to allow by both the investigator and sponsor)\n* Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Subjects who have undergone major surgery within 28 days of study day 1; vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty, which must have been performed at least 1 week prior to starting KRT-232 (AMG 232) + KRd\n* Subjects with known central nervous system involvement of myeloma should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events\n* Subjects with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to KRT-232 (AMG 232) or carfilzomib, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone\n* Subjects' medication list such as herbal medicines (e.g., St. John's wort), vitamins, and supplements will be reviewed before starting first dose of KRT-232 (AMG 232) and at each clinic visit; any potential drug interactions will be brought and discussed with the principal investigator; use of any known CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic window (such as alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or terfanide) within the 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of KRT-232 (AMG 232) is not permitted; other medications (such as fentanyl and oxycodone) may be allowed per investigator's assessment/evaluation\n* Treatment with medications known to cause QTc interval prolongation within 7 days of study day 1 is not permitted unless approved by the sponsor; use of ondansetron is permitted for treatment of nausea and vomiting\n* Current use of warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors; Note: low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic low dose warfarin are permitted; PT/PTT must meet the inclusion criteria; subjects taking warfarin must have their INR followed closely\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Subjects with myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] class III and higher), unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication are excluded\n* Subjects with gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease causing the inability to take oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, requirement for intravenous alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis)\n* Subjects with history of bleeding diathesis\n* Subjects with active infection requiring IV antibiotics within 2 weeks of study enrollment (day 1) are excluded\n* Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B), positive hepatitis total core antibody with negative HBsAG (suggestive of occult hepatitis B), or detectable hepatitis C virus RNA by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assay (indicative of active hepatitis C - screening is generally done by hepatitis C antibody \\[HepCAb\\], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR if HepCAb is positive); subjects with hepatitis B virus suppressed on therapy, and previously treated/eradicated hepatitis C virus are eligible for study\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive subjects must have:\n\n  * A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)\n  * No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections\n  * CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based test\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because KRT-232 (AMG 232) is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with KRT-232 (AMG 232), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with KRT-232 (AMG 232); these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Women who are lactating/breast feeding or who plan to breastfeed while on study through 1 week after receiving the last dose of study drug\n* Subjects with prior treatment with an MDM2 inhibitor",
