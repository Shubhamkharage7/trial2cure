            "briefSummary": "This is a study of participants that will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of oxytocin (naturally occurring hormone that is made in the brain).\n\nIn this study healthy volunteers and people with knee arthritis so severe that they may need joint replacement are recruited for a one day study. Each study participant will have an IV catheter placed. After placement of the IV catheter oxytocin will be given by IV infusion. Investigators will perform some tests to evaluate how oxytocin changes perceptions on the skin. Investigators will study a painful perception by placing a probe on the skin and heating it to 113 -117 degrees Fahrenheit (F) for 5 minutes. Each study participant will score any pain that is experienced on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find that pain rises during the 5 minutes, but remains mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0 to 10 scale. The 5 minute heating temperature will be determined according to the subjects pain rating during the screening visit.\n\nThe main goal of the study is to determine the effect of oxytocin during and after a fixed rate intravenous infusion on reduction in pain to a sustained heat stimulus in order to generate a model for peripheral analgesia.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study healthy people or those with knee arthritis so severe that they may need joint replacement are recruited for a one day study. Study participants will come to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and one intravenous (IV) catheter will be inserted in the forearm for oxytocin infusion. Participants in this study will receive oxytocin at a steady rate for 30 minutes. This information will be analyzed by another group at Stanford University in the Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Core part of this application. Mathematics will be utilized to calculate how quickly oxytocin moves from the blood to where it reduces pain.\n\nInvestigators will also do a pain test to determine how much oxytocin reduces pain. For this Investigators will place a probe on the skin and heat it to 113 - 117 degrees for 5 minutes. Study participants will score any pain they feel on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find that pain rises during the 5 minutes, but remains mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0 to 10 scale."
