This study utilizes a two-arm randomized control trial design to measure impacts of receiving the SafeSpace Sexual Health program compared to receiving a similar-length control app program, SafeSpace General Health that focuses on general health.\n\nThe investigators will ask participants to:\n\n* Keep the SafeSpace app downloaded to their device and visit the app regularly over the course of 10 weeks.\n* Provide contact information.\n* Receive and open app push notifications for 10 weeks (up to 3 per week).\n* Complete 3 online surveys over a year: baseline, short-term follow-up (10 weeks after baseline), and long-term follow up (9 months after short-term follow-up).\n* Receive occasional text messages from the study team."
