As well as adherence to PoNS device utilization.\n\nExploratory Objectives: To further evaluate quality of life to measure physical, mental, behavioral, and general health, as well as functional decline (\\> 30% on gait or balance improvement at endpoint) during the 12-week follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "Observational, interventional, single-arm, open label, clinical trial investigating PoNS utilization with combined with dynamic gait and balance rehabilitation exercise (DGB training) in chronic stroke survivors.\n\n6 The data from this prospective, single arm, multi-site, study that will enroll 30 subjects at 3 different clinical sites will be used to augment safety data obtained in the RCT (which will randomize 60 patients 1:1 into either active PoNS combined with DGB training versus DGB training with a sham device). The totality of the proposed clinical evidence spans 3-4 sites and approximately 90 patients.\n\nEligible study participants in this study will be assigned to treatment with a PoNS device \\[\"active\"\\]. Participants will work with a study physical therapist - trained on PoNS Therapy by HMI Medical and registered as a PoNS Trainer (Trainer). The Trainer will prepare a DGB training exercise program appropriate to the participant's ability level and instruct on how to perform the breathing and awareness (mindfulness) training (BAT). To ensure patient's safety during rehabilitation at home, the Trainer may assign a DGB training program slightly different from the one performed in clinic.\n\nAll participants will undergo a total of twelve weeks of DGB training program, performed both in clinic (4 weeks, Part 1), supervised by the Trainer, and at home (8 weeks, Part 2), unsupervised. At the end of the treatment period, they will be asked to return to the clinic site for the follow-up visit 12 weeks after the end of the treatment period, as shown below:\n\nDuring the training sessions in clinic and, subsequently, during at-home training period, the trainer can adjust /flex the DGB training based on the participant's individual response to PoNS Therapy. During Phase 2, the Trainer will follow-up weekly with participants either in person, or through a telemedicine session, if patient is unavailable to travel to the clinic.\n\nTwelve weeks after completing the 12-week treatment phase of the study, participants will be required to return to the clinic for the final assessment of treatment effect. During the 12-week follow-up period (Part 3), participants will no longer utilize PoNS device but will still be encouraged to continue with their physical rehabilitation program for the duration follow-up period until the final study visit."
