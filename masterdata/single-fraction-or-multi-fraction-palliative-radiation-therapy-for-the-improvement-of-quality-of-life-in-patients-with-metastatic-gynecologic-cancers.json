            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies if a single session of palliative radiation therapy can help improve symptoms of gynecologic cancers that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and that affect quality of life as well or more so than multiple sessions (which is the standard of care). Palliative radiation therapy may help patients with metastatic gynecologic cancers live more comfortably. Researchers also want to learn how radiation affects the immune system and to compare the effects of giving one radiation treatment to giving multiple radiation treatments.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine whether single fraction palliative radiation therapy (SFRT) improves health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) over multi-fraction palliative radiotherapy (MFRT).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether single fraction palliative radiation therapy (SFRT) improves individual domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) over multi-fraction palliative radiotherapy (MFRT).\n\nII. To determine whether SFRT increases clinically meaningful HR-QOL improvement over MFRT.\n\nIII. To determine whether SFRT provides non-inferior symptom burden improvement to MFRT.\n\nIV. To describe radiation related toxicity rates within 21 days and within year for patients receiving SFRT and MFRT.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe T-cell repertoire of patients receiving SFRT and MFRT. II. To describe vaginal microbiome of patients receiving SFRT and MFRT. III. To describe gut microbiome of patients receiving SFRT and MFRT. IV. To describe financial burden of patients undergoing palliative pelvic radiation with either SFRT or MFRT.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy in the form of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT) at the physician's discretion for 1 fraction in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with \\< 30% decrease in the Symptom Inventory Scale (SIS) may receive an additional fraction on day 21 at the physician's discretion.\n\nARM B: Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy in the form of 3D CRT, IMRT, or VMAT at the physician's discretion over 2 weeks for 10 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1 year."
