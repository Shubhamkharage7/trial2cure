            "briefSummary": "Determine if Total30 for Astigmatism contact lenses (CLs) provide a comfortable wearing experience all day. CL discomfort affects most CL wearers with discomfort consistently topping the reasons why established CL wearers drop out of CLs. In fact, studies have consistently found that the frequency of CL dropout is around 20% with this dropout frequency staying relatively stable over the past 20 plus years. This static frequency of CL dropout is surprising since there have been a number of dramatic soft CL innovations during this time frame (e.g., widely available daily disposable CLs, silicone hydrogel CL materials with high oxygen transmissibility, new CL surface coatings).",
            "detailedDescription": "A common issues that contact lens (CL) wearers frequently face is that their discomfort symptoms increase towards the end of the wear day. This burdensome discomfort can unfortunately cause patients to remove their CLs before their desired wear time. While comfortable wear times vary from patient to patient, Terry et al. has suggested that patients should be able to comfortably wear their CLs for at least 12 hours per day for at least 6 days per week. Nevertheless, the literature currently lacks sufficient data to comment fully on the full day wear experience, which for many patients may be 16 or more hours per day, especially if they have demanding careers. One CL that has the potential to allow for all day comfort is the Total30 for Astigmatism CLs, which is a new water gradient, monthly CL aimed at delivering all day comfort and visual performance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to map comfort over the full wear day in established, asymptomatic, soft CL wearers who are refit in Total30 for Astigmatism CLs. These data are not only important for judging the performance of Total30 for Astigmatism CLs, but they will provide some of the first insights into the full day CL wearing experience over one month."
