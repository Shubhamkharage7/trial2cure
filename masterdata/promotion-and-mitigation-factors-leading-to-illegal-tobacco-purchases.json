            "detailedDescription": "In the present study, we propose to examine some promotion factors and mitigation strategies and how they impact tobacco product legal and illegal purchases. Specifically, we have developed an Illegal Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (iETM). The iETM permits us to identify the number, type, and characteristics of tobacco users who would seek illegal tobacco products and the conditions that would induce them to seek that option. The critical questions we seek to answer are whether changes in product standards and availability will engender illegal tobacco purchasing as a function of tobacco user type (e.g., exclusive combustible product users, and dual cigarette/NVP users). Understanding the user types and the relevant conditions will inform greater tailoring of policy to diminish consumer interest in an illegal market."

In the low nicotine conditions, a ban will permit only very-low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) in the LETM and preferred cigarettes will be available in the iETM. Additionally, we will model three mitigation strategies that may reduce iETM purchases: health communications, availability of nicotine replacement, and penalties. The three mitigation factors will be applied during both promotion policies described above.",
