            "briefSummary": "This investigation constitutes an initial evaluation of the stoma occlusion device in humans with a mature permanent Brooke ileostomy. The overall objective of this study is to assess feasibility and initial operating characteristics of a novel stoma occlusion device. The study will recruit 20 patients for placement of the device into the mature Brooke ileostomy and subsequent 2 hour observation period. The device will remain in the ileostomy for up to 2 hours.",
            "detailedDescription": "An ostomy is a protrusion of part of the intestines extending through the abdominal wall for the purpose of elimination of wastes and may be temporary or permanent depending on the purpose of the initial surgery. The most common reasons for permanent bowel diversion are cancer and ulcerative colitis. Appliances have improved greatly over the last 50 years, but patients continue to experience appliance leakage and skin infections and struggle with the emotional and social impact of an external pouch. This study seeks to answer the opportunity to significantly improve quality of life to a large segment of the global population through optimization of a technology for a stoma occlusion device in patients with permanent stomas. Four pre-clinical animal studies have been conducted. All the animals that completed the study tolerated the device well and had no adverse reactions to device materials. This project will allow a prototype of an artificial stomal occlusion device to be tested in humans."
