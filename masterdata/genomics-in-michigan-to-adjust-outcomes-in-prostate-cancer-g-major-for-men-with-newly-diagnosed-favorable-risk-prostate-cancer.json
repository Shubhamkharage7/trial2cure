            "detailedDescription": "All patients in this study have received or will receive a score from the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative's Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (askMUSIC) scoring system, at the time of enrollment. AskMUSIC is a risk calculator based on standard clinical and pathologic variables and is generally included as part of routine clinical care. The variables used in the risk calculator are prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, number of positive core biopsies, number of negative core biopsies, and clinical stage.\n\nPatients will be randomized to either an intervention arm or a control arm. In the control arm, the treating provider will review the askMUSIC score with the patient. In the intervention arm, the treating provider will review the askMUSIC and the GEC score with the patient. Biopsies obtained during the course of standard clinical care will be analyzed using one of the following GECs: Decipher, Prolaris or Oncotype Dx Genomic Prostate Score. No additional biopsies will be obtained as part of this study.\n\nAfter reviewing the results, patients and their treating physicians will decide on a management strategy.\n\nLong-term follow-up will be tracked through the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) registry."
