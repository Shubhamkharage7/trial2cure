            "briefSummary": "This is a multicenter trial of the Optune device to examine the feasibility and to describe the device-related toxicity in children with supratentorial high grade glioma (HGG) or ependymoma (Stratum 1) and to examine the feasibility and efficacy of concurrent Optune and standard focal radiation therapy (RT) in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (Stratum 2).",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objectives of Stratum 1 are: 1) to evaluate the feasibility of treatment with Optune in pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma or ependymoma, and 2) to describe the Optune device treatment-related toxicities in children with recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma or ependymoma.\n\nThe primary objectives of Stratum 2 are: 1) to describe the safety and tolerability of concurrent Optune therapy and RT (Phase I component), 2) to evaluate the feasibility of treatment with concurrent Optune and RT (Phase II component), and 3) to estimate the overall survival (Phase II component) in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed DIPG treated with concurrent Optune therapy and standard RT.\n\nThe Optune System produces alternating electrical fields, called tumor treatment fields (TTFields) by means of 4 transducer arrays placed on the shaved scalp. The very low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields impair the growth of tumor cells through the arrest of cell division and inducing apoptosis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated TTFields synergistically enhance the efficacy of irradiation in glioma cell lines.\n\nOptune will be worn for a minimum of 18 hours a day, with a recommendation of 22 hours/day for at least 23 days in a 28-day cycle. Treatment may continue up to 26 cycles in Stratum 1 and Optune treatment may continue for up to 5 years in Stratum 2 if the participant is deriving benefit and in the absence of significant treatment-related toxicity. Patients will be followed for 2 years from the cessation of protocol treatment in Stratum 1, and for 3 years from the cessation of Optune device treatment in Stratum 2 for the monitoring of unexpected later developing toxicities and to document disease progression, event-free and overall survival.\n\nFor patients in Stratum 1, the therapy will be deemed feasible for patients who are able to use the device for \u2265 18 hours/day for at least 23 days out of 28 days of cycle one (feasibility assessment period). A total of 20 patients need to be assessed with an interim analysis to be conducted after the first 11 patients. Kaplan-Meier estimates of EFS for all eligible patients who use the device for at least 1 day will be provided separately for the two histology-based cohorts i.e. HGG and Ependymoma.\n\nFor patients in Stratum 2, the study will consist of two parts: a phase I portion to evaluate the safety and tolerability of concurrent Optune and RT; and a phase II portion to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of concurrent Optune and standard RT. The therapy will be deemed feasible for patients who are able to use the device for \u2265 18 hours/day for at least 40 of the 49 days of the feasibility assessment period of cycle one, which consists of concurrent Optune and RT. Up to 18 evaluable patients may need to be assessed for the phase I component. A total of 30 patients need to be assessed for the phase II component (6 of whom will be counted from the phase I component). The design also incorporates 2 interim analyses for futility assessed when 9 and 14 events are observed."

PBTC is required to make data available to other investigators for use in research projects. An investigator requesting data from published PBTC studies will submit a proposal describing the studies from which data are requested, the requested data, and a list of investigators in the project and their affiliated institutions, along with the investigator's CV to the PBTC Steering Committee for review. Once approved, the requesting investigator will be asked to complete a Data Transfer Agreement before the release of deidentified data. Requests for data are typically only considered once the primary study manuscript has been published though exceptions may be made in the event of long delays in the primary study data publication.",
