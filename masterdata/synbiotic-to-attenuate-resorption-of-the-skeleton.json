            "detailedDescription": "There are currently no consistent guidelines on how middle aged and older adults can maintain healthy bone mass as they age. Hence, there is an unmet need for safe and effective dietary interventions for the metabolic processes underlying bone loss. The objective of this project, is to test the efficacy of a probiotic/prebiotic combination or synbiotic i.e. Solarea Bio defined microbial assemblage 111 (SBD111) medical food on the skeleton of older women.\n\nAim 1: To determine the effect of 18 months of daily intake of SBD111 medical food on the primary outcome of lumbar spine dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone mineral density (BMD) and secondary outcomes (Biomechanical Computed Tomography analysis (BCT)-derived vertebral compressive strength, volumetric BMD (vBMD), and markers of bone turnover) in women.\n\nHypothesis 1a: BMD, vertebral compressive strength, and vBMD will be greater in women randomized to SBD111 medical food compared to placebo.\n\nHypothesis 1b: Biochemical markers of bone turnover will decrease with SBD111 medical food use compared to placebo.\n\nAim 2: To determine the effect of 18 months of daily intake of SBD111 medical food on markers of inflammation and gut microbiome function (secondary outcomes) in women.\n\nHypothesis 2a: Markers of inflammation \\[interleukin 17A (IL17A) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)\\] will be reduced with SBD111 medical food use compared to placebo.\n\nHypothesis 2b: Functional genes and pathways related to fiber breakdown (glycosyl hydrolases), menaquinone 7 production, and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, will be enriched in stool metagenomes and upregulated in stool metatranscriptomes from those receiving SBD111 medical food compared to placebo.\n\nEligible women will be randomized to SBD111 medical food versus placebo capsules for 18 months. Assessments will be made at the in-person baseline visit, 9-month and 18-month follow-up visits as well as monthly telephone calls.\n\nThe primary outcome is lumbar spine BMD (g/cm2) and secondary outcomes include vertebral compressive strength (N), vBMD (g/cm3), and bone biomarkers.\n\nIntent-to-treat analysis will be conducted for all endpoints."
