            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of 2% lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine and 0.5% bupivicaine 1:200,000 epinephrine in reducing post-operative pain in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis on a mandibular tooth that receive endodontic treatment. Participants of this study will include patients that present to the University of Washington Endodontic clinic and fit the inclusion criteria of being \\>18 years old, healthy (ASA I or II) and having a diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis on a mandibular tooth, that is willing to undergo endodontic treatment in two visits. Upon diagnosis, and informed consent, patients will be asked to participate in this study. If enrolled in the study, participants will receive standard endodontic treatment with temporary placement of Calcium Hydroxide medicament within the canals of the tooth and placement of a temporary filling. They will then be randomized to receive an inferior alveolar nerve block with 1 cartridge (1.8mL) of either 2% lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine or 0.5% bupivicaine 1:200,000 epinephrine. Patients will be given a form to track their pain levels for the next 72 hours, that they will return at a follow up visit. This form will use the Heft-Parker visual analog pain scale to track pain levels as well as ask participants to track their use of over the counter analgesics, in particular, Advil/ibuprofen. The pain tracking form will be returned to the clinic and root canal will be completed also at this follow up visit."
