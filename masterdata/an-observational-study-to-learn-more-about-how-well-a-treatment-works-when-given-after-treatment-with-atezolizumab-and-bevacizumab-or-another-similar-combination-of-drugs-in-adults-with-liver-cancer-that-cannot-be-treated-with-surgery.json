            "briefSummary": "This is an observational study in which only data will be collected from adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. These adults should be prescribed a different treatment after treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, or another similar combination of drugs, by their doctors.\n\nUnresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) is a type of liver cancer that cannot be treated with surgery.\n\nIn the past, sorafenib was the only approved first-line anti-cancer drug for people with uHCC. Regorafenib and other drugs were approved as second-line treatments for uHCC if a person could not take sorafenib or it stopped working for them.\n\nLately, another first-line (1L) treatment called immuno-oncology (IO) immune checkpoint inhibitor combination (1L-IO combo), like atezolizumab with bevacizumab (AB), has become the preferred choice of treatment. This is because of the meaningful impact on patient survival. 1L-IO combo are drugs that help the body's defense system recognize and kill cancer cells.\n\nSince the other treatments were previously approved for use following sorafenib, the best order to take these treatments in following an 1L-IO combo is unknown.\n\nTo better understand and determine this order, more knowledge is needed about how well different treatments work in participants with uHCC who have been treated with AB or another 1L-IO combo.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn more about how well different treatments work when given after first-line treatment with AB or another approved 1L-IO combo. To do this, researchers will collect data on how long the participants live (also called overall survival) from the start of any treatment given after the first-line treatment.\n\nIn addition, researchers will also collect the following information to learn more about the participants who will be given a different treatment after the 1L-IO combo:\n\n* characteristics including age, sex, and race, and signs and symptoms of the participants over the duration of their first-line treatment\n* the length of time from the first to the last dose (also called duration of therapy) of the treatments given after the 1L-IO combo\n* the length of time until a participant's cancer worsens, or they die (also called progression free survival) from the start of the treatments given after the 1L-IO combo\n* the number of participants whose tumor completely disappears or shrinks (also called overall tumor response) after taking the treatments given after the 1L-IO combo\n* the sequence of treatments given after the 1L-IO combo Data will be collected from September 2023 to December 2026 and cover a period of around 3 years. The data will be collected using medical records or by interviewing the participants during their routine visits to the doctor.\n\nResearchers will observe participants from the start of the treatment given after the 1L-IO combo until the end of their participation in the study.\n\nIn this study, only data from routine care will be collected. No visits or tests are required as part of this study."
