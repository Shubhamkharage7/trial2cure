All participants will receive KB-GDT-01 as intravenous infusions in combination with radiotherapy.\n\nAfter being informed about the study and its potential risks, during the 28-day screening period, all consented participants will have laboratory tests, assessments, tumor scans, and a tumor biopsy.\n\nCytokine release syndrome symptoms and other potential adverse effects, will be monitored during the dose limiting toxicity period.\n\nThe study will be conducted in 2 parts, with the same number of visits in each part.\n\nIn Part 1 Dose Escalation, the study will attempt to identify the best dose with the lowest incidence of adverse effects (AE) and try to identify if the KB-GDT-01 is working (effectiveness). In Part 2 Dose Expansion the best dose will be further investigated for AE and effectiveness. There will be up to 36 participants in Part 1 and up to 12 additional participants in Part 2 of the study.\n\nThe total treatment cycle of the study drug protocol will be completed in 10 days. Participants will then attend clinic visits during a 30-day short-term follow-up period, with a subsequent long-term follow-up period up to Month 24"

Three dose levels of KB-GDT-01 will be evaluated and will follow a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design rule based on a targeting rate of 25% for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring between the first KB-GDT-01 infusion and Day 40. Depending on observed DLT rate, the safety monitoring committee will assess whether to escalate to the next dose, de-escalate (not applicable for the first dose), hold at current dose or stop the study if at the first dose.",
