            "detailedDescription": "The present study is a two-arm parallel design RCT to test the efficacy of using ecological momentary intervention (EMI) to deliver therapeutic content based on the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) - an evidence-based transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that focuses on delivering adaptive skills for managing strong emotions. Participants in this study will be 50 adult psychiatric inpatients with recent suicidal thoughts or behaviors (STBs). Participants will be randomized to receive either the control condition, which consists of treatment as usual (TAU; n = 25) and 4x/daily daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of emotions and STBs, or the experimental condition, consisting of TAU, 4x/daily EMA, 3 brief sessions to deliver CBT skills (mindful emotion awareness, cognitive flexibility, and changing emotional behaviors, all drawn from the UP), one discretionary skills booster session, and EMI to prompt guided skills practice (n = 25).\n\nControl participants will receive TAU and be prompted to complete 4x/day EMA of emotions and STBs for the duration of their hospital stay and the 28-day post-discharge period. Participants randomized to the experimental conditions will receive TAU plus three brief treatment sessions delivering core UP skills content (during inpatient stays) and a discretionary booster session to reinforce treatment sessions that may be offered after discharge via either phone or telehealth. Those in the experimental condition will also receive training to use the EMI (which prompts guided skills practice), followed by smartphone-based EMA/EMI for the duration of the inpatient stay and the 28-day post-discharge period."
