The primary questions to be addressed are:\n\nDoes Solarplast (R) decrease muscle damage and inflammation associated with heavy resistance exercise?\n\nDoes Solarplast (R) reduce the decline in performance associate with heavy resistance exercise?\n\nResearchers will compare Solarplast (R) to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no active ingredients) to see if Solarplast (R) is effective at improving recovery.\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\nTake Solarplast (R) or placebo daily for 4 weeks\n\nVisit the laboratory at least once per week to receive their supplement\n\nReport to the lab for 3 consecutive visits following supplementation to complete a heavy resistance training session and follow-up testing."
