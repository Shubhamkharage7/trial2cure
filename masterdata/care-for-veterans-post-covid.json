            "briefSummary": "The evidence-based Concordant Care approach involves engaging in processes that: 1) validate the patient's experience, 2) develop a shared understanding of the condition, and 3) create a patient-centered, whole health-oriented action plan to manage the condition. This is consistent with published expert opinion that Concordant Care underlies patients' (and clinicians') positive experiences of care for poorly understood conditions. Despite strong evidence supporting this care approach, there are no interventions to train clinicians on practices to provide Concordant Care for Veterans with poorly understood conditions such as Long-COVID. Part 1 of the study will optimize and test if a Concordant Care training improves VA clinicians' engagement in recommended practices to provide Concordant Care (i.e., validate, shared understanding, action plan) for Veterans with Long-COVID. This study will adapt and refine Concordant Care training for Long-COVID. Part 2 of this study will determine if Concordant Care training increases clinicians' engagement in recommended practices to provide Concordant Care and will explore the effectiveness of Concordant Care on care outcomes including satisfaction, adherence to care, \\& disability for Veterans with Long-COVID. Veterans treated by clinicians receiving Concordant Care training will report their clinician more frequently engaged in recommended conversations (i.e., ask about Long-COVID, validate experience with Long-COVID, create a shared understanding and action plan), and Veterans will perceive greater shared understanding of Long-COVID with their clinicians than Veterans treated by clinicians in the control arm.",

Part 1 of the study will optimize and test if a Concordant Care training improves VA clinicians' engagement in recommended practices to provide Concordant Care (i.e., validate, shared understanding, action plan) for Veterans with Long-COVID. The evidence-based Concordant Care approach involves engaging in processes that: 1) validate the patient's experience, 2) develop a shared understanding of the condition, and 3) create a patient-centered, whole health-oriented action plan to manage the condition. Concordant Care will be adapted through interviews and focus groups with Veterans with Long-COVID (estimated n=9) and primary care providers (estimated n=21). Feedback from the participants will help refine and test Concordant Care training. Part 2 of this study will determine if Concordant Care training increases clinicians' engagement in recommended practices to provide Concordant Care and will explore the effectiveness of Concordant Care on care outcomes including satisfaction, adherence to care, \\& disability for Veterans with Long-COVID. Part 2 will be a randomized parallel cluster trial with primary care clinicians (n=60) separated into a Concordant Care training group and an education packet control group. Veterans (n=240) who have an upcoming appointment with their primary care provider who is a participant in the study will be recruited. The Veterans will be assessed at baseline before their appointment and approximately 3-months later after their appointment. Veterans treated by clinicians receiving Concordant Care training will report their clinician more frequently engaged in recommended conversations (i.e., ask about Long-COVID, validate experience with Long-COVID, create a shared understanding and action plan), and Veterans will perceive greater shared understanding of Long-COVID with their clinicians than Veterans treated by clinicians in the control arm."
