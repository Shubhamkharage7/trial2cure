            "briefSummary": "The LINKED- HEARTS Program is a multi-level project that intervenes at the practice level by linking home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) with a telemonitoring platform (Sphygmo). The program incorporates team-based care by including community health workers (CHWs) and pharmacists to improve the outcomes of multiple chronic conditions (reduced blood pressure (BP), lower blood sugar, and improved kidney function). The LINKED-HEARTS Program will recruit a total of 600 adults with uncontrolled hypertension (BP \u2265 140/90 mm Hg) AND either type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) across 16 community health centers or primary care practices serving high-risk adults. This cluster-randomized trial consists of two arms: (1) enhanced \"usual care arm,\" wherein patients will be provided with Omron 10 series home BP monitors and will be managed by the patients' primary care clinicians as usual; and (2) the \"intervention arm\" which will integrate HBPM telemonitoring, a CHW intervention and provider-level interventions into the usual clinical care to improve BP control and provide support for self-management of chronic conditions. The study pharmacist will conduct telehealth, use the Sphygmo app and the Pharmacist Patient Care Process to collaborate with other providers to optimize pharmacologic therapy to improve hypertension outcomes and with payors to ensure consistent access to drug therapy."
