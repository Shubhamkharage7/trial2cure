            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also called lupus, is a disease that causes the body s immune system to attack healthy tissue. Lupus causes swelling and inflammation in the skin, skin, joints, kidneys, brain, blood vessels, and other organs. There is no cure for lupus. Current treatments do not help everyone and may have adverse effects. Better treatments are needed.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a study drug (Gusacitinib) in people with lupus.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older with lupus.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood and urine tests and a test of their heart function. They will have a chest X-ray. They will have tests that use blood pressure cuffs to measure blood flow and pressure throughout the body.\n\nParticipants will have 9 clinic visits and 6 phone visits over about 7 months.\n\nThe study has 3 parts.\n\nPart 1: Gusacitinib is a tablet taken by mouth. Participants will be divided into 3 groups. One group will receive the study drug, and a second group will get a placebo. The placebo looks like the study drug but does not contain any medicine. Both of these groups will take their tablets once a day for 12 weeks. The third group will continue to take their usual medications for lupus throughout the study.\n\nPart 2: All patients who took the study drug or placebo in part 1 will take the study drug once a day for 12 weeks.\n\nPart 3: All patients who took the study drug will stop taking it for 4 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "STUDY DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis is a phase Ib study of Gusacitinib a dual inhibitor of JAK and SYK kinases, that can simultaneously target multiple signaling pathways responsible for the SLE disease pathogenesis. This study will compare the safety of Gusacitinib 80 mg with placebo initially in a double-blind period and then 80 mg daily in an open label period, followed by an off-drug period.\n\nIn addition, we will have a comparator group of SLE subjects receiving standard of care treatment. We hypothesize that Gusacitinib will be safe and well tolerated in subjects with SLE.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary Objective of the study is to determine safety and tolerability of Gusacitinib 80 mg in subjects with SLE.\n\nSecondary Objectives: Pharmacokinetics of Gusacitinib in SLE. Effects of Gusacitinib on plasma lipid profile, vascular stiffness, and endothelial dysfunction. Effectiveness of Gusacitinib in controlling SLE disease activity. Exploratory objectives to understand the effects of dual JAK and SYK inhibition on Interferon Gene Signature, Serum Cytokines, NET formation, and Immune cells phenotype.\n\nENDPOINTS:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Adverse Events severity (as defined by AEs equal or greater than grade 3 as per the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) and frequency as compared to placebo at week 12.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Change in the proportion of patients achieving SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI 4) response at week 24 compared to baseline. Another efficacy analysis will be done by comparing subjects treated with Gusacitinib vs. placebo at week 12. SRI-4 response is defined as:\n\n* Reduction of \\>=4 points from baseline in SLEDAI-2K score\n* No new BILAG A or no more than 1 new BILAG B disease activity scores\n* No worsening (defined as an increase of \\>=0.3 points \\[10 mm\\] from baseline) in the Physician s Global Assessment of Disease Activity\n* Change in SLEDAI-2K total score at week 24"

At the investigator s discretion, glucocorticoids may be tapered during the second (open label) period of the study.\n* If on hydroxychloroquine, the dose must have been stable for the 12 weeks prior to screening visit. The maximum allowed dose is hydroxychloroquine up to 400 mg/day or 6.5 mg/kg/day if more than 400 mg/day; or equivalent dose of other antimalarial medications.\n* Stable doses of immunosuppressant for the 12 weeks prior to the screening visit. Immunosuppressant medications include azathioprine up to 2 mg/kg, methotrexate up to 20 mg/week, mycophenolate mofetil up to 3000 mg/day or mycophenolic acid \\<= 2.16 g/day. The subject will be taken off these immunosuppressant medications 2 weeks prior to administration of study medication and will be kept off these medications for the duration of study. Any subject experiencing worsening of SLE disease activity will be treated by a single dose of intra-muscular corticosteroid. This will be allowed only once during each period of the study. A second flare during each period requiring treatment would lead to withdrawal of the subject. The subjects in comparator group will continue on standard of care treatment.\n* Stable medications for diabetes, hypertension and/or statins for 12 weeks prior to the screening visit.\n* For female subject of childbearing potential involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead to pregnancy: the subject must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method from at least 4 weeks before Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after the last study product administration. Highly effective contraceptive methods include hormonal contraceptives (e.g. combined oral contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring, injectable, or implant), intrauterine devices or intrauterine systems, vasectomized partner(s), tubal ligation, or double barrier methods of contraception (e.g. male condom with cervical cap, male condom with diaphragm, or male condom with contraceptive sponge) in conjunction with spermicide.\n\nNote: Subjects must have been on a stable dose of hormonal contraceptives for at least 4 weeks before Day 1.\n\nNote: The above list of contraceptive methods does not apply to subjects who are abstinent for at least 4 weeks before Day 1 and will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse throughout the study. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.\n\nNote: A female subject of nonchildbearing potential is as follows:\n\n* Female subject who has had surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy);\n* Female subject who has had a cessation of menses for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause, and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test confirming nonchildbearing potential (as per the reference range of the testing laboratory).\n\n  * For male subject involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead to pregnancy, subject must agree to use one of the highly effective contraceptive methods listed in Inclusion Criterion #6, from Day 1 until at least 90 days after the last study product administration. If the female partner of a male subject use any of the hormonal contraceptive methods listed above, this contraceptive method must be used by the female partner from at least 4 weeks before Day 1 until at least 90 days after the last study product administration by the male subject.\n  * Male subjects must not donate sperm from Day 1 until at least 90 days after the last study product administration.\n  * Female subject of childbearing potential has had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1.\n  * Subject is willing to participate and can give informed consent.\n  * Subjects must be willing to comply with all study procedures and must be available for the duration of the study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n* Subject is a female who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or who is planning to become pregnant during the study.\n* Subject has a history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease within 5 years prior to Day 1. Note: Subjects with successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not to be excluded.\n* Subject has any clinically significant medical condition or physical/laboratory/ECG/vital signs abnormality that would, in the opinion of the investigator, put the subject at undue risk or interfere with interpretation of study results.\n* Subject has 12-lead ECG abnormalities considered by the investigator to be clinically\n\nsignificant or a QTcF \\>= 450 milliseconds, regardless of clinical significance, at screening. Abnormal ECG may be confirmed with one repeated assessment.
