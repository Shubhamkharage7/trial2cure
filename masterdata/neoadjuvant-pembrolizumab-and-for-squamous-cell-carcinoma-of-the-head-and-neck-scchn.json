Chronic managed disorders that are not clinically active are acceptable.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Congestive heart failure , unstable angina, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry or a history of myocarditis",
