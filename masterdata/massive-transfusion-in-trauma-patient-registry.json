            "briefSummary": "The early use of blood products as a part of Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) during trauma resuscitation has been increasingly supported by providers and backed by the literature. However, the incidence of hypocalcemia during MTP has also been recorded and continues to be studied as an exacerbating factor in coagulopathy during trauma.",
            "detailedDescription": "Although initially it was thought that the coagulopathy was due to the trauma itself, studies suggest that it is worsened by the transfusion of blood as this is associated with increased hypocalcemia. The level of hypocalcemia is said to correlate with the amount of blood products transfused, but the number of units needed to produce a particular degree of hypocalcemia remains to be defined. A standardized value for hypocalcemia due to MTP has yet to be established. Establishing this value would be helpful in determining what level actually affects the rate of mortality. Some studies suggest intravenous calcium supplement should be considered during massive transfusion while others state this does not make a difference.\n\nThis data repository will serve as a means to aggregate and analyze best practices as relative to MTP in the trauma patient, with specific interest in component best practices, whole blood protocols, and electrolyte/metabolite replacement."
