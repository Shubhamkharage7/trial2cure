            "briefSummary": "The goal of the study is to test the efficacy of a dietary intervention in inducing clinical response and remission for patients with Crohn's disease in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention diet: DAIN has been adapted from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Anti-Inflammatory Diet or IBD-AID\u2122 taking into account the food availability and preferences of Puerto Ricans. DAIN also includes traditional foods commonly consumed in the typical Puerto Rican diet while maintaining the fundamental components of the IBD-AID\u2122.",
            "detailedDescription": "Crohn's disease is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal that results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to an altered gut microbiome (i.e., dysbiosis). Diet is the main driver of microbiome composition. Diet also has been increasingly recognized as a cost-effective strategy to induce remission in pediatric and adult patients with Crohn's disease but diets that can substitute traditional and locally available foods among Puerto Ricans have not been explored. DAIN, a newly created dietary program, incorporates an extensive patient curriculum of recipes and menus adapted to the local availability and food preferences of Puerto Rican patients with Crohn's disease. This study aims to address three questions: whether DAIN a diet adapted to Puerto Rican patients with Crohn's disease, can: 1) induce clinical response and remission; 2) change the inflammatory tone, and 3) revert dysbiosis in Crohn's disease patients.\n\nParticipants will be randomized 1:1 ratio into two arms:\n\n* Arm 1 Crohn's disease patients + DAIN (Experimental): this group of patients will participate in ten weeks of DAIN intervention (From week 1 to week 10)\n* Arm 2 Crohn's disease patients no intervention (Control): this group of patients will not participate in the DAIN dietary intervention and will continue the usual diet.\n\nParticipation in the study lasts for 15 weeks with four-time points: week 0 (baseline), week 6, week 10, and week 14. At each time point, all subjects will complete a series of questionnaires to assess overall health, Crohn's disease activity, and dietary compliance. Blood and stool samples will be also collected at home at each time point. Samples will be either shipped or brought to the Research Unit at the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic at the University of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe primary outcome is clinical response and remission. Secondary outcomes are: (i) reduction of inflammation, (ii) changes in the gut microbiome, and (iii) dietary compliance."
