The goal is to treat the tumor bed locally, eliminating any remaining micro metastases or close margins that are unable to be fully resected while avoiding system circulation.\n\nThis study will enroll up to 40 subjects. In this study both safety and efficacy will be evaluated. All subjects will be monitored for possible DLTs.",
            "detailedDescription": "Methodology: This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, Safety and Efficacy, Tolerability, Anti-Tumor Effects, Systemic Exposure, and Device Technical Effects of PRV211 (Intraoperative Cisplatin System) in subjects with T2-T3 oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) amenable to surgery.\n\nStudy Design: This study will enroll up to 40 subjects. An interim analysis will take place to evaluate safety and efficacy results and the addition of a second arm (see interim analysis section for further detail). In this study both safety and efficacy will be evaluated. All subjects will be monitored for possible DLTs.\n\nFor the purpose of dose selection, tolerable dose is defined as a dose where fewer than 33% of subjects being evaluated within the safety population present with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Effective dose is determined based on the evaluable population as described in the Statistical Methods section.\n\nThe study is described below:\n\nUp to 15 subjects will be enrolled for stage 1 and undergo 1 PRV211 treatment application during standard of care tumor resection surgery. Each treatment will include permeation enhancer. If 5 or less respond, the dose can be escalated given safety requirements are met.\n\nA total of ten (10) PRV211 patches can be applied in this single application during tumor resection surgery.\n\nDefinition of Response: A subject will be considered to have responded to the treatment if there is no incidence of locoregional recurrence at 3 months post-surgery and/or adjuvant therapy as indicated on positron emission tomography (PET) scan."
