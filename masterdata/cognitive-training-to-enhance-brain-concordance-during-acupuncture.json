This study design will also allow the investigators to evaluate a neural model supporting therapeutic alliance for pain outcomes for fibromyalgia.",
            "detailedDescription": "The patient-clinician interaction is central to most therapies and is supported by key interpersonal mechanisms of action such as clinician empathy, therapeutic alliance, and trust. However, the neural underpinnings of this effect are mostly unknown. The investigators' recently published study applied functional MRI (fMRI) hyperscanning (i.e. simultaneously neuroimaging chronic pain patients and clinicians in synchronized MRI scanners) demonstrated that brain-to-brain concordance in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is up-regulated following a clinical interaction and associated with patient analgesia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder in great need of novel therapies. This study will evaluate the impact of a novel multimodal therapy, a type of approach known to improve pain outcomes and recommended by the Institute of Medicine report for chronic pain management. The study design will also allow the investigators to evaluate a neural model supporting therapeutic alliance for pain outcomes for fibromyalgia wherein training and acupuncture will synergistically target a critical therapeutic pathway - i.e., patient-provider alliance, instantiated by TPJ concordance."
