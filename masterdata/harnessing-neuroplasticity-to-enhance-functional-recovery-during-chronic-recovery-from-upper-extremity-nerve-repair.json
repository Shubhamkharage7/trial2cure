            "briefSummary": "This study adopts a strategy that has arisen from basic neuroscience research on facilitating adaptive brain plasticity and applies this to rehabilitation to improve functional recovery in peripheral nervous system injuries (including hand transplantation, hand replantation, and surgically repaired upper extremity nerve injuries). The technique involves combining behavioral training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-a non-invasive form of brain stimulation capable of facilitating adaptive changes in brain organization.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will implement and evaluate an innovative program of post hand transplant rehabilitation; one that harnesses recent discoveries in neuroscience to facilitate long-term, experience-dependent adaptations within the brain's sensory and motor systems. The current approach to rehabilitation of function in allogeneic hand transplant recipients is largely the same as standard-of-care following hand replantation (re-attachment) and peripheral nerve repairs. This involves an eclectic combination of traditional therapies. In seeking to improve on this approach, there is potentially much to be gained by considering evidence that limb amputation not only impacts the peripheral nervous system but also the brain, and tailoring interventions accordingly."

The technique involves placing two saline-soaked electrodes (anode and cathode) on the scalp and passing a small direct current (1.5 milliamps; mA) between them. Cortex underlying the anode is more easily excited due to lowered thresholds for depolarization of glutamatergic neurons, while thresholds are increased in neurons beneath the cathode, making them less excitable. Sham stimulation is easily implemented, and the technique can be effectively double-blinded.",
