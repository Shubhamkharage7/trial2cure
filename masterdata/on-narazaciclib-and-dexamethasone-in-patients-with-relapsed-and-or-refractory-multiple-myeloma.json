            "briefSummary": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of plasma cells for which there is an urgent and unmet need to develop new, effective therapeutics. Onconova Therapeutics has developed a first-in-class oral inhibitor of CDK4 and ARK5 ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) which shows potent anti-myeloma activity in vitro and in vivo in preclinical models, and is undergoing evaluation in Phase 1-2 trials worldwide.\n\nIn this study, the researchers will test the safety and preliminary efficacy of inhibition of CDK4 and ARK5 by ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) in combination with dexamethasone in myeloma patients in a Phase I/II clinical trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6, AMPK-related protein kinase 5 (ARK5), colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), tyrosine-protein kinase kit (c-Kit), and fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT)3 at low nM concentrations that can arrest the cell cycle and thus block tumor cell proliferation and inhibit the growth of cancer cells. As an apoptotic and antiproliferative agent, ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) modulates the levels and activities of regulatory proteins of the cell cycle, including cyclin D1 and inhibits retinoblastoma (Rb) protein binding. ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) inhibits cancer cell growth and suppresses deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis by preventing CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition, followed by tumor cell death by induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.\n\nON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) is being investigated for potential treatment of patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer therapies. This is supported by antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects that have been observed with ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) in a wide variety of malignant human cell lines in cell-based assay systems, and in mouse xenograft models of breast cancer, colon cancer, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and melanoma. Based on the nonclinical efficacy models, Onconova intends to study patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.\n\nAs of the data cutoff date 05 January 2022, Onconova-sponsored Study 19-01 (United States \\[US\\]) is an ongoing exploratory Phase 1 dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) capsules administered orally as escalating daily doses in patients with advanced cancer relapsed or refractory to at least 1 prior line of therapy.\n\nEnrolled patients will continue 28-day cycles of ON 123300 (NARAZACICLIB) + dexamethasone as long as the drug shows anti-myeloma activity with a disease response \u2265PR (PR, VGPR, CR) and the patient does not exhibit any DLTs and the study is open. Patients will continue the regimen until disease progression/intolerable toxicity/death, withdrawal OR for a maximum up to 2 years after enrollment. Treatment would be discontinued for Grade 4 or above toxicity. For Grade 2-3 toxicity, will challenge with the lower dose first before discontinuing. (Grading of toxicities per CTCAE version 5.0)"
