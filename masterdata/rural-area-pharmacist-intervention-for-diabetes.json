            "briefSummary": "The goal of the project is to inform the system leaders regarding the feasibility and utility of having an embedded telehealth-based clinical pharmacist at rural primary care practices for supportive disease management of patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether continuing and expanding the program within the system is worthwhile.",
            "detailedDescription": "Improvement of suboptimal type 2 diabetes (T2D) management and outcomes in rural areas in the United States (US) is an urgent national health policy priority. Novel approaches such as telehealth and supportive clinical management of T2D by non-physician providers have been recommended to fill gaps in care. With specialty in drug therapy, clinical pharmacists are in a position to uniquely contribute to filling gaps in T2D management related to medication therapy, which are common and often the cause of adverse outcomes in patients with T2D. The objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, barriers and facilitators of implementation, and preliminary effectiveness of a telehealth-based clinical pharmacy intervention to inform the design of a subsequently planned fully powered effectiveness-implementation trial of the intervention. This pilot study will involve randomization based on the days the patients had encounters at participating practices (4 in North Carolina). The 2 study arms will be: 1) Usual care, receiving standard practice of care managed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants with access to chronic disease management services and 2) Intervention arm, receiving the intervention consisting of clinical pharmacy services including identification and resolution of medication-related problems and patient needs, optimization of medication regimen and T2D education and self-management support, in addition to usual care. The intervention will last for 3 months and will consist of biweekly video/phone calls between patients and the pharmacist. Based on recommendations from literature on pilot studies, the total planned sample size is 240 patients. Implementation science framework by Proctor and colleagues and scales by Weiner and colleagues (for feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and fidelity) and Consolidated Framework for implementation Research (for barriers and facilitators of intervention implementation) will guide collection of data on outcomes. for using complementary medicine and healthcare avoidance. The results of our work will facilitate wide implementation of the intervention and thereby improved outcomes."
