This study will include 6 individuals with chronic refractory obesity, that have failed other treatments including gastric bypass surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Six (N = 6) subjects with chronic refractory obesity will receive bilateral DBS implants in the LHA using the Boston Scientific Vercise Gevia DBS system. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of DBS of the LHA using the current-driven Boston Scientific device and compare that to the safety data for our previous pilot using the voltage-driven DBS system for the treatment of chronic refractory obesity. The primary efficacy objective is to determine if DBS of the LHA can affect energy balance (i.e. energy intake and/or energy expenditure) in these patients. Secondary outcomes include quality of life outcomes and changes in feeding behaviors. Study participants will undergo a two-part DBS implantation procedure for placement of DBS electrodes in the LHA. Following this procedure, subjects with complete resting metabolic rate (RMR) testing to determine the optimal settings for the LHA stimulation. If effective, DBS technology might offer severely obese adults (BMI of \u226550 kg/m2), who have failed traditional therapy, a non-destructive, adaptable, reversible neurosurgical option for altering eating habits leading to sustained weight loss in the long-term."
