The ICF and HIPAA authorization must be obtained before conduction and procedures that do not form a part of the subject's normal care.\n6. After signing the ICF and HIPAA Authorization, subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility during the Screening Period (no more than 28 days before study drug administration) according to the following further inclusion/exclusion criteria:\n\nStudy Population/Inclusion Criteria\n\n1.

Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI- except where contraindicated, in which case a CT scan is acceptable) evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration. An MRI is not required to rule out brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. There must also be no requirement for high doses of systemic corticosteroids that could result in immunosuppression (\\>10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study dry administration.\n\nMedical History and Concurrent Disease\n\nAny serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results. Specifically:\n\n1. Subjects with active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n2. Subjects with interstitial lung disease or a history of pneumonitis that required oral or intravenous glucocorticoids to assist with management.\n3.

History of or medication induced prolonged QT interval.\n13. Any botanical preparation (e.g., herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) intended to treat the disease under study or provide supportive care. Use of marijuana and its derivatives for treatment of symptoms related to cancer treatment, even if obtained by medical prescription or if its use (even without a medical prescription) has been legalized locally.\n\nPhysical and Laboratory Test Findings\n\n1. A history of Hepatitis B or C, either acute or chronic, as indicated by HBV surface antigen positivity, HBV core antibody positivity, or positive HCV antibody with reflex to positive HCV RNA.\n2. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n3. Active tuberculosis (history of exposure or history of positive tuberculosis test plus presence of clinical symptoms, physical or radiographic findings).\n4. EKG demonstrating a QTc interval \\>470 msec or patients with congenital long QT syndrome.\n\nAllergies and Adverse Drug Reaction\n\n1. History of allergy to study drug components (examples: hydroxpropylmethylcellulose phthalate (hypromellose phthalate or HPMCP), microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and silicon dioxide).\n2. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody (Grade \u2265 3 NCI-CTCAE v5).\n3. History of anaphylaxis, or recent (within 5 months) history of uncontrolled asthma.\n\nSex and Reproductive Status/Special Populations\n\n1. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception with a failure rate of less than 1% while on study and for 5 months after the last dose of SX-682 or nivolumab. A WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes.\n2. Women under the age of 62 with a history of being postmenopausal must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level \\> 40 mIU/mL.\n3. Women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.\n4. Women must not be breastfeeding.\n5. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year while on study and for a period at least 7 months after the last dose of study drug.\n6. Women who are not of childbearing potential and azoospermic men do not require contraception.\n7.
