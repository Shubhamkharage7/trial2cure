After an initial screening visit, visit the Center for the Study of Tobacco Products 4 more times for approximately 3-hour study visits.\n2. Before each visit, abstain from all tobacco products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vapes, cigars, and hookah/waterpipe) for at least 12 hours.\n3. Allow researcher to take blood pressure readings (with blood pressure cuff on their arm) monitor their heart rate (with a device that attaches to their finger), and allow a nurse to insert an IV catheter into their arm that will stay there for the entire session. This catheter will be used to draw blood periodically (less than 1 tablespoon per sample, 5 samples per visit).\n4. During each session, participants will respond to several questionnaires to measure how they feel before and after they use an e-cigarette.\n5. In each session, use an electronic cigarette provided by the study team at two separate times. After using the e-cigarette two times, participants will be offered the opportunity to use their own e-cigarette or cigarette."
