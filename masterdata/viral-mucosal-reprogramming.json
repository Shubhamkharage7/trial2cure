Three groups (HC, AR, and AA) will undergo screening to establish clinical history, will undergo pulmonary function testing (spirometry), and will have blood drawn for clinical characterization (IgE, , ImmunoCAP, CBC and differential), and for assessing the presence of existing neutralizing antibody against RV16. Only those who meet criteria will be permitted to continue into the interventional and run-out phases of the study."
