The patient would be randomized and blinded to either left perioral or right perioral RECELL application. The surgeon would also be blinded to which side received RECELL treatment or Placebo (saline spray). Randomization would occur before study initiation with subjects assigned either left perioral or right perioral RECELL treatment based on their subject enrollment number. The study team member who prepares and blinds the RECELL will create the list of subject ID numbers with subject ID number randomly assigned to either left perioral or right perioral treatment group. This will be completed prior to any patient enrollment in the study. This spreadsheet will be password protected and only accessible to study coordinators and the team member responsible for preparing RECELL."
