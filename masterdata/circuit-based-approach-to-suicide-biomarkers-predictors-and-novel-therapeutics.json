This study also aims to identify the structural and functional circuit properties that characterized the suicidal brain and the signatures that explain the clinical severity of suicidal risk. Moreover, this study aims to determine biological and dimensional predictors of anti-suicidal response to iTBS-TMS and its mechanism of action."
