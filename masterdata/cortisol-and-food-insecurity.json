Moderation analyses will test whether cortisol reactivity to the stressor acts as a modulator of the relationship between high levels of food insecurity and increased hyperpalatable food intake."

Participants are given five minutes to prepare for a five-minute speech task followed by a five-minute mental arithmetic task in front of two panelists wearing white lab coats (i.e., a male and female research assistant). The speech task posits the participant in a mock interview, with the two panelists listening to the speech in an unresponsive, neutral manner and asking standardized probing questions. Participants undergoing the mental arithmetic task are instructed to subtract odd numbers (i.e., 7 and 13) from a large number (i.e., 2935) as quickly as possible. If the participant makes a mistake, the panelist interrupts them and instructs them to start the task again from the beginning. The panelists also constantly remind the participant to \"go faster\" if they start to slow down with the task.",
