Both the control and intervention groups will start standard physical therapy six weeks postoperative. Primary outcome measure will be the isometric strength of the gastrocnemius muscle. The secondary outcomes will comprise subjective clinical evaluations (using the Lower Extremity Functional Scale \\[LEFS\\]), functional assessments such as the sit-to-stand test, 2-minute walk test, stair climb test and objective clinical evaluation using contralateral comparison of calf circumference."
