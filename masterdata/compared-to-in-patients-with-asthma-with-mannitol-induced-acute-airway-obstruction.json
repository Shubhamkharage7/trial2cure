The data obtained from Part 1 will be assessed by an internal AstraZeneca advisory board, and suggested changes may be made to Part 2 of the study.\n\nThe following is the sequence of study visits:\n\n(i) Visit 1 (V1) screening (ii) Visit 2 (V2) 10 to 14 days after Visit 1 assessments; 1st dual challenge and treatment visit (iii) Visit 3 (V3) 10 to 14 days after Visit 2; 2nd dual challenge and treatment visit\n\nAt Visit 1, all participants will be subjected to a single mannitol challenge to establish a positive response (defined as a \u226515% decrease in forced expiratory volume in the first second \\[FEV1\\] from the 0 mg mannitol FEV1 value) and will receive 4 puffs of open-label PT007. At Visit 2, participants will be randomized to one of 2 treatment sequences, A/B or B/A, where treatments A and B are defined as:\n\n(i) Treatment A = PT027 (ii) Treatment B = PT007\n\nFor treatment sequence A/B, participants will receive repeated inhalations of PT027 at Visit 2 followed by repeated inhalations of PT007 in Visit 3 .\n\nFor treatment sequence B/A, participants will receive repeated inhalations of PT007 at Visit 2 followed by repeated inhalations of PT027 in Visit 3.\n\nParticipants will have a Follow-up Telephone call 7 days after Visit 3/after Early discontinuation (ED)."
