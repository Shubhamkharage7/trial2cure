Multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine may help people resist CMV life-threatening complications.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate the optimal dose of multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine (Triplex) in CMV-positive pediatric patients receiving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched, mismatched, or haploid-identical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the safety profile of Triplex in this patient population. (Phase I) III. To determine if Triplex reduces the frequency of CMV events when compared to historical data. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize CMV reactivation and disease by assessing: time to CMV reactivation, duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (defined as \\> 100 days and =\\< 365 days post HCT), use of anti-viral drugs triggered by rising CMV viremia or viremia \\>= 3750 IU/mL, cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days.\n\nII. To evaluate the impact of Triplex on transplant related outcomes by assessing the incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), all-cause mortality, infections.\n\nIII. To investigate the impact of Triplex on cellular immunity by investigating: the level, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T-cell immunity, the changes in adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population and highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells, and changes in GVHD biomarkers.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on days 28 and 56 post-HCT.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 270 or 365 days."
