The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 Does the product induce any sensitization (contact allergy) after a skin prick using a UniTest PC (pain control) device in healthy human subjects? Participants will have the test product and both positive and negative controls applied, and skin response will be evaluated by an allergist at 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 24-48 hours post-application to see if sensitization occurs.",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be a single center, with no randomization or blinding, study design in 30 healthy adult subjects, age 18-70 years. Based on prior experience approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled to ensure 20 subjects complete the study.\n\nSkin response to the test product and both positive and negative controls will be evaluated and measured by an allergist. If the measured diameter is \u22653mm in response to the test product with expected reactions to both the positive and negative controls, the site will be considered a positive allergen."
