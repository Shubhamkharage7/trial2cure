The investigators are working to find ways to make sure that all patients with type 1 diabetes are equally able to use these technologies. The purpose of this study is to find out if a new computer program for the diabetes team, along with a smartphone app (called Glucosano) for patients/parents, as well as a community health worker, are accepted and used by Black/African American patients and parents living with type 1 diabetes, and if this can help decrease racial disparities in the use of diabetes technologies."
