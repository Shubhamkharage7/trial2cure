            "detailedDescription": "The study design is cross-sectional. This study will be conducted at a single Magnet-designated facility, Methodist Richardson Medical Center (MRMC), within the Methodist Health System. The sample will be a convenience sample of hospital-registered nurses and para-professional nursing services staff (e.g., patient care technicians and specialty area technicians) who agree to participate in an online survey launched via the Survey Monkey\u00ae portal. Survey Monkey\u00ae is an online, cloud-based survey delivery portal, and the subscription for the use of the portal is paid for by the Department of Education (DOE) at MRMC. Hence, the data will be owned by MHS. The study is a one-time inquiry. The PI and designated sub-investigators will send institutional emails to staff members who meet the inclusion criteria. The timeline for the study will be a total of four weeks. The study will be introduced for one week, be available for three weeks, and will conclude by the end of week four."
