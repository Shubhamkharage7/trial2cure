Participants will include individuals with chronic pain, who will be randomized into one of two intervention conditions: low THC/high CBD or placebo. In addition to receiving CBD or placebo, participants also will complete symptom assessments of chronic pain data (intensity, quality, interference/disability) throughout the study. These measures will be gathered prior to and following the fifth doses (dosing will occur once per day for five days) of CBD or placebo. A secondary objective will be to examine the association between clinical and inflammatory markers."
