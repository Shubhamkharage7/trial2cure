            "briefSummary": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common benign neoplasm in men. Almost 90% of men in their 70s report lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH. These symptoms carry a significant negative impact on the patients' quality of life.\n\nDespite the wide availability of surgical offerings to relieve bladder outlet obstruction such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP), and prostatectomy, many patients still suffer from persistent LUTS after undergoing these. A study describing postoperative outcomes following HoLEP revealed that patients with severe lower urinary tract symptoms, storage-positive sub-score, and high maximum urinary flow rate before the surgery were affected by a rebound of mainly storage symptoms 6-8 weeks after HoLEP and prolonged recovery from LUTS with 7.4% of them presenting for persistent urge complaints.\n\nOptimizing the management approach for these patients has been limited by lack of high level evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus. Intravesical botox injections are well-established therapeutic options for several urinary disorders. The current practice offers intravesical botox injections to patients who suffer from persistent urinary symptoms few months after their BPH procedure. This study aims to evaluate if giving botox injections at the time of the HoLEP surgery would yield a better outcome than performing the two procedures separately at different times (few months apart).\n\nThe concomitant use of botox injection during bladder de-obstructing procedures has been previously studied in TURP and have showed a significant reduction of incontinence episodes and OAB symptoms in the group that were treated with botox injections after 36 weeks post TURP. This data may suggest promising potential of this intervention in managing persistent OAB symptoms in patients with BOO. However, the efficacy of combining HoLEP and bladder Botox injections has not been systematically studied and evaluated.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of intravesical Botox injections on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) when administered during HoLEP surgery in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and overactive bladder symptoms (OAB). The investigators are interested in comparing the postoperative outcome in terms of recovery and symptom relief in patients who performed HoLEP surgery with bladder Botox injections versus those who performed HoLEP surgery only at 2 weeks,1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that administering bladder botox injections during HoLEP surgery is a combination treatment that will result in faster and more potent symptom relief compared to patients who received only a HoLEP surgery for their obstructive and irritative symptoms."

This cohort of patients will be recruited and randomized into two groups: a control group that would undergo HoLEP procedure only, and an experimental group that will undergo HoLEP procedure combined with an intravesical Botox injection.\n\nThis study will utilize a 1:1 randomization scheme to assign participants to either the control group or the experimental group. Participants will not be blinded to the procedure they are receiving. No one on the study team including those involved in data analysis will be blinded to the study arm assignment. The investigators plan to recruit a maximum of 50 participants in each arm.\n\nThe study's intervention is whether Botox injections are added during the surgery or not.",
