The goal of this survey study is to have a panel of specialty-specific experts create a consensus agreement on a minimum set of key data elements for use in standardized reports. These recommendations would be used to develop standardized methods to report key data in electronic health records to better manage cancer patients at time of diagnosis, treatment, follow up, and into survivorship.",

To formulate consensus agreement on a minimum set of clinical key elements that should be included in standardized reports in electronic health records when managing patients with prostate cancer.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants complete 3-4 rounds of questionnaires over 20-30 minutes each over 2 weeks."
