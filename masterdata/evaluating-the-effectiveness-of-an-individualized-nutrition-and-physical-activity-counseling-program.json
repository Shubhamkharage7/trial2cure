Obese breast cancer survivors have been found to have greater than a two-fold increase in mortality compared to women with normal body mass index (BMI). The current standard for weight loss interventions involves in-person counseling. However, this incurs costs related to travel for counseling sessions, potentially limiting program participation, compliance and sustainability.This is a pilot study of an individualized in-person and telephone-based nutrition and exercise counseling program."
