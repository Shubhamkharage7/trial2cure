Additional cohorts in other eosinophilic diseases may be added in future protocol amendments.\n\nThe study consists of 3 periods:\n\n1. Screening period: 1 to 4 weeks\n2. Open-label treatment period: 52 weeks\n3. Open-label extension period: at least 52 weeks (plus safety follow-up \\[SFU\\] weeks after last investigational product \\[IP\\] administration)\n\nAll eligible participants will receive benralizumab SC Q4W during the 52-week open-label treatment period.\n\nAll participants who complete the 52-week open-label treatment period on IP will be offered the opportunity to continue into an extension period. The extension period is intended to allow each participant at least an additional one year of treatment with benralizumab."
