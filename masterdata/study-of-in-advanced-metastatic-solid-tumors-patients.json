Olaparib or Niraparib are collectively referred to as PARPi.\n\nPart B will evaluate the preliminary efficacy, safety profile, and PK of ART6043 in combination with a PARPi compared to PARPi alone. Part B will randomize patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-ve) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a germline or somatic breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation (g/sBRCA-m) who have received no or \u22641 month of prior treatment with a PARPi, in a 1:1 to an RP2D of ART6043 in combination with a PARPi vs a PARPi alone.\n\nPatients may continue to receive ART6043 and/or PARPi as long as they may be continuing to derive clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator and/or until disease progression, withdrawal of consent or until they experience unacceptable drug-related toxicity."
