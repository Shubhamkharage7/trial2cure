            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Ritlecitinib in skin and blood in persons with Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL). CTCL is a rare type of cancer that starts in the white blood cells and eventually can result in rashes or tumors in the skin. This study includes a 24 week Treatment Period and a 24 week Follow-up Period. This study will involve physical examinations, visual assessments, laboratory tests, PET-CT scans, electrocardiograms, photographs of your skin, skin biopsies, and hearing tests.",
            "detailedDescription": "After providing informed consent, patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the Screening visit (day -28 to day -1) which includes: assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria; targeted physical examination (including vital signs); mSWAT scoring and disease staging; electrocardiogram (ECG); review of medical history and concomitant medications as well as prior medications/treatments; and serum pregnancy test (if applicable). Laboratory tests will be performed for Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differentials (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils), serum chemistry including albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, creatine kinase, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, LDH, viral surveillance panel (EBV, CMV, HSV1, HSV2, and VZV), as well as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBcAb, hepatitis C antibody, and undergo testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Urinalysis will be performed. Patients will also undergo tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) or QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT) testing. Patients will also undergo flow cytometric analyses and TCR rearrangement studies of peripheral blood to monitor potential CTCL blood involvement. CT scans with PET (positron emission tomography) scans will be performed within 4 weeks before baseline to help establish or confirm peripheral lymph node size and assign TNM classification, or at any time if internal involvement is suspected by the investigator.\n\nPatients who meet eligibility criteria (meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria) will undergo Baseline / Day 0 assessments. These assessments include vital signs and targeted physical examination, mSWAT scoring, clinical disease staging, questionnaires, clinical photography, urine pregnancy test (if applicable), and blood collection for chemistry, hematology, mechanistic studies, baseline for drug levels, blood DNA analysis, blood RNA analysis, and blood proteomic analysis. Two skin biopsies will be obtained (one from an involved area and one from an adjacent uninvolved area). Concomitant medications and any adverse events will be assessed.\n\nPatients will then receive the first oral dose (200mg) of ritlecitinib. Patients will continue to receive the study drug QD through Week 24.\n\nPatients will return for visits every 2-4 weeks to have the following performed: vital signs and targeted physical will be taken; concomitant medications and any adverse events will be assessed.\n\nSafety, laboratory, and clinical assessments, as well as questionnaires will be performed at specified clinic visits. A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and urine pregnancy tests will be performed at Baseline and every 2-4 weeks prior to administration of the study drug, if applicable. Clinical photographs of the skin lesions will be taken at each visit.\n\nSkin biopsies will be performed on all patients at Baseline and Week 24 or Early Termination visit. At Baseline, biopsies will be obtained from involved and uninvolved areas of a CTCL lesion. At Week 24 or Early Termination visit, the biopsy will be performed in the vicinity of the involved area biopsied at Baseline. An optional biopsy will be performed at Week 12, within the same area that was biopsied at Baseline.\n\nAt Baseline, serum will be obtained for DNA (1 PaxGene), RNA (2 PaxGene), and proteomic analysis (2 tubes serum). Studies of RNA and proteomic analysis will further be performed at Weeks 12, 24 and 48/early termination."
