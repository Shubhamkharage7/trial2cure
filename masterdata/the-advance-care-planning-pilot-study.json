            "briefSummary": "Affordable housing residents continue to experience multi-faceted insecurity and advance care planning (ACP) challenges even after obtaining secure housing, resulting in significant inequities in quality of care during times of cognitive incapacity. To promote proactive planning for affordable housing residents, this proposal is for a pilot study to test a novel trauma-informed care adapted advance care planning intervention with the following aims: to test initial efficacy of the intervention on ACP outcomes (Aim 1) and determine resident perceptions of intervention acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility and perceived implementation barriers and facilitators (Aim 2). These data will support the development of a larger scale study of ACP interventions within a resiliency-based hub model to comprehensively support whole-person care and proactive planning for times of cognitive incapacity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Long-term objectives and goals. Vanderbilt University School of Nursing (VUSN) and Urban Housing Solutions (UHS) - the second largest provider of affordable housing in Nashville - are partners with the long-term goal of reducing health disparities among medically-underserved UHS residents in Nashville. This partnership is developing resiliency hubs that will provide essential services and support within a communal setting at the housing facility. Previous literature and data findings support that similar populations to this community lack information about and access to advance care planning (ACP), which specifies their healthcare wishes during cognitive incapacitation or end-of-life, and nationwide research shows significant disparities regarding ACP participation among low-income populations. The short-term goal of the proposed work is to pilot test a Hybrid type 1, single-arm, pre-post intervention to assess the initial efficacy and implementation outcomes of a trauma-informed care (TIC)-adapted ACP intervention to improve learning and communication for times of decisional incapacity among UHS residents, within the context of a resiliency hub model. This is a necessary first step for developing a long-term research portfolio dedicated to addressing ACP disparities and promoting equitable end-of-life planning among low-income, medically-underserved populations."

Adverse Childhood Experiences and previous death-related experiences assessed during baseline data collection will be used to tailor the discussion to carefully explore relevant history to assess resident ACP values, preferences, and goals.",
