            "detailedDescription": "A prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, blinded trial of participants implanted with the ReStore Device for VNS Therapy. After implantation, all participants will be randomized to either active VNS therapy or sham VNS stimulation accompanying PE therapy twice weekly for 6 weeks (12 total sessions, Phase 1). Following completion of Phase 1, all participants will receive assessment and then advance to the open-label Phase 2. In Phase 2, all participants will receive up to an additional 12 sessions of PE paired with active VNS, regardless of their prior randomization group in Phase 1. Post-therapy assessments will be performed during and after Phase 2. All participants will be monitored annually for up to 2 years following implantation or until the device is FDA approved, whichever comes first"
