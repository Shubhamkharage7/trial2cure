            "briefSummary": "This study will examine the effects of lithium 20mg/day compared to placebo on MRI and blood-based biomarkers among 20 early-stage Parkinson's disease patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "In observational studies, small daily doses of lithium have been associated with a 77% reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, lithium therapy has been effective in preventing neuronal death and behavioral symptoms in several PD animal models. Recently, our group has shown 24-weeks of low-dose lithium therapy in PD to improve both MRI and blood-based biomarkers implying that lithium may be slowing the progression of the disease. However, these findings stem from only three of four patients receiving MRIs. A larger study will be required to determine if these promising results can be replicated. The proposed study will enroll 20 additional PD patients who will be randomly assigned to receive either lithium 20mg/day or identically-appearing placebo capsules for 24 weeks. This will be a double-blind study meaning that neither the patients nor the study team will know to which therapy patients have been assigned. Positive results from this study will support further research on lithium that could eventually support lithium as a disease-modifying therapy for PD that could improve patients' long-term prognoses."
