The second aim to test for (a) differences between the two treatments for the prevention of relapse and (b) preliminary change on clinical ED outcomes (e.g., ED symptoms, fears). The investigators further aim to examine the two treatments target fear extinction and if fear extinction is associated with ED outcomes. The investigators also plan to test if baseline differences in fear conditioning relate to change in ED outcomes across treatment."
