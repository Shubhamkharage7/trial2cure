Different ways of doing the scan (techniques) will be tested to see if they are practical and can prevent problems related to motion. For example, changes in the timing of the magnetic field and the radio waves will be examined, and at changes in the way a computer is used to process the images. The new techniques will be compared with the techniques that are usually used."
