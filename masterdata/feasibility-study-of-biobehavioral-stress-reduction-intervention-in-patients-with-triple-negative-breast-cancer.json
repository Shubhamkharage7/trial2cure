            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial aims to see if patients with triple negative breast cancer can complete a biobehavioral stress reduction program that also addresses health related social needs (e.g., utilities, transportation, etc.). The stress reduction program is over ten weeks and includes stress reduction (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation), coping, problem solving, communication, and social support. Health related social needs will be evaluated at the beginning of the study, and referrals will be made to social work to help address those needs. The study will examine stress as reported by the patients and also use biological markers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI Acceptability of the biobehavioral intervention will be determined using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ). CSQ is an 8-item self-report measure with item assessing different aspects of treatment satisfaction (e.g., quality of service, the degree to which needs were met, overall satisfaction).\n\nIII Tolerability of the biobehavioral intervention will be assessed by analyzing pre to post treatment change on the Profile of Mood States.\n\nIII Feasibility of the biobehavioral intervention will be assessed using three metrics: 1) accrual number as a percentage of available patients approached; 2) number/percent of patients completing each BBI session; and, 3) number/percent of patients retained and completing 10 BBI sessions.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To examine the feasibility of collecting biomarkers--white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6, TNF-alpha (\u03b1), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein; albumin, hemoglobin A1C, body mass index (BMI).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To test for pre/post effects of the biobehavioral stress reduction intervention on measures of stress (Impact of Events Scale), mood and psychological symptoms, and allostatic load.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive biobehavioral stress reduction intervention while on study. Patients undergo blood specimen collection at baseline and follow up, and have their medical records reviewed."
