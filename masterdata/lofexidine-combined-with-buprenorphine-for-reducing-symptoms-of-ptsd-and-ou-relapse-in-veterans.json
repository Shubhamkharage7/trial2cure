Other study objectives are to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BUP treatment alone, to BUP treatment with adjunct LFX, on measures of OUD and PTSD symptoms in Veterans with both prognosis .",
            "detailedDescription": "The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Lucemyra\u2122 (lofexidine; LFX), an alpha-2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b12-AR) agonist, as a medication for the prevention of opiate relapse and the alleviation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in opiate-dependent veterans.\n\nPrimary Endpoints :\n\nFor OUD:\n\nDrug-Taking Behavior (% abstinent from illicit opioid use from Week 5 to Week 12 of the active treatment phase) is the primary efficacy endpoint for monitoring the effects of treatment on OUD, which is measured by both urine drug screen (UDS; opioids are detectable for 1-4 days) and timeline follow-back (TLFB) interviews of drug/alcohol use.\n\nFor PTSD:\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint for monitoring the effects of treatment on PTSD symptoms is mean change scores on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (PCL-5), which is recommended by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline as a quantitative measure of a patient's PTSD symptoms and response to treatment over time.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nFor OUD:\n\nDrug-Taking Behavior (\u2265 80% abstinent between Week 5 to Week 12), treatment duration (days in treatment), and scores on the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale (OC-VAS) are secondary efficacy endpoints for monitoring the effects of treatment on symptoms on OUD.\n\nFor PTSD:\n\nThe secondary efficacy endpoints for monitoring the effects of treatment on core symptoms of PTSD are CAPS-5 change score (between screening and Week 12).\n\nPopulation:\n\n120 veteran participants will be recruited from within the MEDVAMC. The study population will consist of veterans diagnosed with OUD and potential or provisional PTSD who are seeking treatment.\n\nPhase:\n\nThis is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site, parallel groups, 12-week treatment study\n\nDuration:\n\nEnrollment period of 24 months. Participant duration is 18 weeks (consisting of 4 weeks screening, a 12-week treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up)."
