            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test psilocybin in combination with mindfulness training in healthy adults. The main question it aims to answer is \"Does mindfulness training enhance the effects of psychedelic therapy (psilocybin) on mental health?\" Interested individuals will complete an initial eligibility session and eligible participants will then be randomized into one of two groups: one dose of psilocybin (administered under the supervision of study therapists) combined with 8 weeks of weekly mindfulness training classes (Arm 1) or psilocybin alone (Arm 2). Both groups will complete baseline and post-treatment assessment sessions where they will complete questionnaires and have an EEG (a measure of electrical activity in the brain). Both groups will also complete 2 follow-up surveys (at 8 weeks and 1 year after the post-treatment assessment) either online through REDCap or by phone or video call with a research assistant.",
            "detailedDescription": "Psilocybin is a psychoactive compound found in a variety of mushrooms that has been used for centuries to facilitate spiritual experiences. Recent evidence suggests that the combination of psilocybin with mindfulness training may enhance the therapeutic effects of these interventions for mental health; however, to date, only few studies have investigated a combination approach, and no studies have yet investigated the effects of psilocybin in combination with a formal mindfulness training program in participants with little or no prior meditation experience. We propose here to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of psilocybin administration in combination with 8 weeks of mindfulness training. Participants (N = 40) will complete an initial eligibility session and eligible participants will then be randomized into one of two groups: psilocybin integrated with mindfulness training (MT) (Arm 1) and psilocybin alone (Arm 2). Both groups will complete baseline and post-treatment assessment sessions where they will complete questionnaires and cognitive assessments. Both groups will also complete 2 brief follow-up surveys (at 8 weeks and 1 year after the post-treatment assessment) either online through REDCap or by phone or video call with a research assistant. The primary outcome will be change in self-reported depression on the CES-D scale from baseline to post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include change in blood inflammatory \\& neurotrophic markers and neurocognitive measures (EEG outcomes) from baseline to post-treatment. Additional psychometric secondary outcomes are change in self-reported mood and other psychological measures from baseline to post-treatment and from baseline to follow-up. Logistic regression models will be used to examine the relationships between intervention group and the primary and secondary outcome variables. The results of this pilot study will be used to support a larger NIH grant application as well as the extension of this intervention to clinical populations."
