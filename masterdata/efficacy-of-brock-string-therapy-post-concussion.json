            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of Brock String therapy prescribed in the acute stage of concussion recovery can improve clinical outcomes among patients with receded near point of convergence (NPC).\n\nAim 1: Determine if participants receiving the Brock String have more significant improvements in NPC measurements at follow up 7-10 days post injury.\n\nAim 2: Determine if participants receiving the Brock String 1) improve on computerized neurocognitive test scores from initial visit (\\<48 hours post injury) to follow up visit (7-10 days post injury) compared to control participants, and 2) have reduced recovery time (i.e., days from injury until return to play) compared to control participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "Receded near point of convergence (NPC) is a common oculomotor deficit associated with numerous vision diagnoses, including convergence and accommodative insufficiencies, following sport-related concussion (SRC). Researchers have found associations with worse neurocognitive test scores, higher post-concussion symptom burden, and longer recovery among patients with receded NPC relative to concussion patients with normal NPC. Although oculomotor dysfunction may resolve spontaneously or improves with vision therapy exercises in the post-acute phase of recovery, it is unclear if early intervention can improve recovery outcomes. The Brock String is a cost effective and practical vision therapy exercise for congenital convergence insufficiency (CI), and initial research supports effectiveness with SRC patients who have receded NPC in the subacute phase of recovery (e.g., weeks to months post injury). Early vision therapy intervention may be efficacious in improving recovery times and reduce healthcare costs by eliminating later therapies for chronic deficits."
