            "detailedDescription": "Most research to date in neonatal lung disease has focused on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) prevention. As a result, insufficient investigation has been performed to define optimal respiratory management strategies for infants and young children with established BPD. Thus, there is no robust evidence base to guide ventilator management to promote lung disease recovery and support neurodevelopment in this population. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is an alternative to conventional flow triggered ventilation that has shown promise for improving respiratory gas exchange, patient-ventilator interaction, and work of breathing in preterm neonates. The safety and efficacy of NAVA in infants and young children with established, severe BPD is uncertain. This prospective, unblinded, pilot randomized cross-over trial of 2 modes of mechanical ventilation will compare measures of pulmonary mechanics, respiratory gas exchange, and patient comfort between conventional flow triggered mechanical ventilation and NAVA among 20 prematurely born infants and young children receiving invasive respiratory support for severe BPD."
