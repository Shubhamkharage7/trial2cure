            "briefSummary": "The opioid epidemic is a considerable problem in the United States, and prescription opioids significantly contribute to the epidemic. Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are inherently at increased risk for opioid dependence as surgical treatment can cause significant pain and up to 50% of patients also suffer from psychiatric comorbidities. Novel methods are needed to decrease opioid consumption following HNC surgeries to limit the risk of chronic opioid dependence in these patients. Conditioning therapy with placebo aims to elicit a classically conditioned response to an inactive medication through consistent pairing of the medication with a neutral stimulus (i.e. an odor) and has been shown to be effective for decreasing the amount of active drug require for certain clinical responses, including for acute pain. However, studies have not been completed for the treatment of acute pain in the inpatient post-operative setting. The overall goal of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of conditioned open-label placebo (COLP) as an adjunct for post-operative pain management in complex head and neck cancer patients. This randomized, controlled, open-label trial will specifically compare post-operative opioid consumption and pain scales between patients receiving multimodal analgesia along with conditioned open-label placebo (COLP group) to those receiving multimodal analgesia, alone (Treatment as usual group). Findings from this study will determine the efficacy of COLP as an innovative approach to decrease opioid consumption and improve pain control in head and neck cancer patients and will provide rationale for development of future large scale trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nThe opioid epidemic is a considerable problem in the United States, with more than 5 million Americans currently affected by opioid-related substance use disorders. While prescription medications may be thought of as safe and controlled, many opioid-na\u00efve patients report continuing to take prescription opioids for over one year after surgery, and the majority of heroin users report starting with abuse of prescription opioids. At the same time, prescription opioids have more than doubled from 2001-2013 and multiple studies in other surgical specialties suggest that patients receive opioids in excess of the patient's peri-operative pain needs Prior efforts to battle this epidemic have included the increased use of multimodal analgesia, policies to limit the amount of opioids able to be prescribed at one time, and databases to track prescribing habits across health care facilities. While these have had some success, there is significant room for improvement.\n\nHead and neck cancer (HNC) patients represent a unique population in that surgical resection often leads to significant peri-operative pain and disfigurement. A high proportion, up to 50% of these patients also suffer from psychiatric comorbidities. These factors inherently increase the risk of opioid dependence and studies have shown that chronic opioid use following surgery for HNC is associated with decreased disease free survival. Novel methods are needed to minimize opioid risks in this patient population.\n\nConditioning therapy aims to elicit a classically conditioned, or Pavlovian, response through consistent pairing of a medication with a neutral stimulus (i.e. an odor). Treatment involves reinforcement with simultaneous presentation of a characteristic odor with each dose of active and inactive medication. Prior studies have shown efficacy of conditioning therapy paired with placebo medication to decrease the total dose of active medications required for a clinical response including opioids for pain following spinal cord injury, stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and corticosteroids for psoriasis. Many of these have been performed as \"open-label\" studies, where patients were aware of group assignment and were informed when each placebo treatment was given.\n\nThese results suggest that patients with HNC may also benefit from conditioned open-label placebos by reducing total opioid consumption required for adequate pain control in the peri-operative setting and providing an innovative intervention to potentially decrease the risk of opioid dependence in this patient population.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nDetermine if the addition conditioned open-label placebo (COLP) to standard multimodal analgesia decreases baseline opioid consumption from post-operative day (POD) 2 to 5 in comparison to standard multimodal analgesia alone in patients with head and neck cancer.\n\nRationale:\n\nPatients with head and neck cancer will be enrolled in this randomized, controlled, open-label trial. All study participants will receive standard multimodal analgesia, including opioids, and will have daily opioid consumption and pain severity documented following surgery. Patients in the COLP group will additionally receive conditioning (i.e. exposure to clove oil) with each active oxycodone dose on POD 1-5 and a scheduled placebo oxycodone paired with conditioning (i.e. exposure to clove oil) 3 times per day on POD 2-5. The chance in baseline opioid consumption from POD 2 to 5 will be compared between groups.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nDetermine if the addition conditioned open-label placebo (COLP) to standard multimodal analgesia leads to a reduction in pain severity following surgery and persistent opioid use at 6-months following surgery in comparison to standard multimodal analgesia alone in patients with head and neck cancer.\n\nRationale:\n\nFollowing surgery, patients complete daily surveys on pain severity. The investigators will compare these pain scales between COLP and TAU groups to determine if there is a difference in pain severity between treatment groups. The investigators will also analyze long-term effects of the intervention with COLP. After the second week following surgery, opioid consumption will continue to be recorded by nursing (if inpatient) or with patient reported surveys (after discharge) through 6 months after surgery. While COLP may have immediate effects on opioid consumption during therapy, the goal of this aim is to determine if short-term therapy can result in long-term changes in behavior."
