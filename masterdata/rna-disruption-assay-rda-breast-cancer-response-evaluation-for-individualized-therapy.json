            "briefSummary": "The current study aims to provide validation results of RNA Disruption Assay (RDA) as a tumour response assessment tool that uses tumour core biopsies taken starting from 35 +/- 4 days after the initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Rationale:\n\nThere is some evidence that identifying non-responders early in neoadjuvant treatment and offering alternative agents (response-guided therapy) increased pathological complete response (pCR) rates and/or survival resulting in improved care and incremental cost effectiveness.\n\nDifferentiating non-responders to chemotherapy from responders with reliable guidance tools early during therapy is crucial to the success of response-guided therapy.\n\nThe current study aims to provide validation results of RDA as a tumour response assessment tool that uses tumour core biopsies starting from 35 +/- 4 days after the initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nStudy Objectives and Endpoints:\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine the 2 RDI cut-offs to have a diagnostic test optimized in terms of both negative and positive predictive values NPV and PPV (in a training set of patients i.e. phase 1 of the study) for predicting nopCR/pCR and to establish the performance characteristics for the first cut-off (test result \"zone 1\") in terms of NPV as primary endpoint (in a validation set i.e. phase 2).\n\nThe secondary objective is to assess the test's NPV in the different cancer subtypes and the test's PPV in Her2+ patients; also to assess and compare pCR prevalence, residual cancer burden (RCB class at surgery) and DFS (secondary endpoints) in zones 1-3 for all patients and each cancer subtype.\n\nPatient Population:\n\nThe study aims to enrol approximately 594 patients in centres in the US, Canada, Italy, Germany, Spain and France.\n\nThe population consists of patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of standard of care treatment. Throughout the study, patients will receive standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatments including taxanes, anthracyclines or other targeted drugs and drug combinations as prescribed based on the investigators' / clinicians' choice. Adjuvant therapies (e.g. radiotherapy, hormonal treatment ... etc.) may be prescribed to patients according to standard of care and independently of the RDI score results.\n\nRDA is presently in an experimental stage and clinicians will not receive or use the RDA results in this study.\n\nBiopsy Collection:\n\n* 1st core needle biopsy for RDA (2 specimens): Time Point: 35 +/- days after initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy;\n* 2nd core needle biopsy for RDA (2 specimens): Time Point: if therapy is changed (as part of SoC), a second biopsy \\~2-3 weeks after initiation of new drugs; Timing by type of drug schedule 3-weekly: at 16 days +/- 2 days, Bi-weekly: at day of 2nd dose preferably before drug admin., Weekly: at day of 4th dose preferably before drug admin. If Therapy is not changed (as part of SoC), a second biopsy is taken at 55 +/- 5 days after the first initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nStatistical Plan:\n\nThe study consists of a training set / phase 1 (80 fully evaluable patients) to determine response zone cut-offs using pCR outcomes and RDA's predictive values, and a validation set / phase 2 (454 fully evaluable patients) to validate the performance characteristics of the RDA test. The study aims to enrol 594 patients in order to achieve an accrual of 534 fully evaluable patients which is the number required to adequately statistically power the trial. Combined statistical analysis and various subgroup analyses will be performed for the primary and secondary objectives.\n\nDuration and Follow-up:\n\nThere will be an 18 months of active patient accrual (or until last patient is accrued) in addition to 60 months of patient follow-up."
