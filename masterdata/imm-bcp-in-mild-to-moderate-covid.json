            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, PK, and viral clearance of single ascending doses of IV IMM-BCP-01 in subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19 caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or its variants.\n\nThe study will consist of a screening period of up to 36 hours, a treatment period of one day, two further clinic visits, four visits that will take place either in the clinic or at the subject's home, six virtual visits (telephone or video), and an end-of-study visit 12 weeks (+/- 5 days) after study drug dosing. The total duration of a subject's participation is approximately 90 days.\n\nSubjects presenting at the clinic with signs and symptoms of mild to moderate COVID-19 and agreeing to participate in the study will be screened, and if deemed eligible for the study, will be randomized (2:1) to receive a single IV dose of IMM-BCP-01 or placebo on Day 1. Subjects at risk of severe disease and those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 within 6 weeks prior to screening or who have received monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and/or COVID-19 convalescent plasma at any time will not be eligible.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to receive IMM BCP-01 or placebo."

Subjects must be without clinically significant abnormalities as assessed by review of medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital signs measurement, ECG, and laboratory evaluations conducted at screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Has one or more symptoms suggestive of more severe illness with COVID-19 and/or requires hospitalization.\n2. Is asymptomatic at screening or randomization, regardless of a positive COVID-19 test.\n3. Is at increased risk of severe COVID-19 for any reason including but not limited to: cancer (basal cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma in situ \\[Gleason \u2264 6\\] are acceptable), chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart condition (congestive heart failure II, III and IV as per New York Heart Association: coronary disease and any other cardiac condition that imposes high risk of developing severe COVID-19), immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, sickle cell disease, or other condition, autoimmune disease, use of immunosuppressants (including high doses of systemic corticosteroids), type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, current or prior history of smoking or vaping any product, including nicotine or THC.\n4. Has any active infection, other than the underlying COVID-19.\n5. Has been admitted to a hospital within 3 months prior to randomization (except for planned admissions for minor procedures).\n6. Has been hospitalized due to COVID-19 at any time.\n7. Has participated or is participating in a clinical research study currently or within 3 months or less than 5 half-lives of the investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit.\n8.
