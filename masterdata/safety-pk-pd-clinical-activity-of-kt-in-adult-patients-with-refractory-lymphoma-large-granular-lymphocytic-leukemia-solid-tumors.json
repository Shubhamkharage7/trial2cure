The Phase 1a stage of the study will explore escalating doses of single-agent KT-333. The Phase Ib stage will consist of 4 expansion cohorts to further characterize the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of KT-333 in Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL), Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL), LGL-L, and solid tumors.",

Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth.\n\n   Note: Patients with solid tumors are eligible if their CNS metastases or cord compression have been treated (e.g., radiotherapy, stereotactic surgery) and they are clinically stable, off steroids for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug and have no evidence of progression at time of study enrollment.\n\n   Note: Patients with lymphomas are eligible if their CNS metastases or cord compression have been treated effectively (i.e. achieved CR) and there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of active lymphoma.\n2. Diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).\n3. History of or active concurrent malignancy other than lymphoma or solid tumors unless the patient has been disease-free for \u2265 2 years.\n4. Patient has not recovered from any clinically significant adverse events (AEs) of previous treatments to pretreatment baseline or Grade 1 prior to first dose of study drug.\n5. Ongoing unstable cardiovascular function.\n6. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant less than 3 months prior to first dose of study drug.\n7. Prior allogenic hematopoietic or bone marrow transplant.",
