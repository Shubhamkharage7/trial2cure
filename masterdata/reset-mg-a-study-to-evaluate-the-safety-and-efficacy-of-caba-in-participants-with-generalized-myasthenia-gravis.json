            "detailedDescription": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibody responses that cause defective transmission of signals at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in a distinctive pattern of weakness. Patients with generalized MG (gMG) typically experience symptoms associated with ocular disease in addition to weakness of many other voluntary muscle groups, including extremity, bulbar, and respiratory muscles. MG is considered a classic example of a B-cell mediated autoimmune disease. Currently, there are no curative treatments for MG. This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational cell therapy, CABA-201, that can be given to patients with gMG. A single dose of CABA-201 in combination with cyclophosphamide (CY) and fludarabine (FLU) will be evaluated."
