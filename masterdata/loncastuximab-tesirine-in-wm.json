            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine in patients with Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia (WM) who have received at least 2 prior treatments, including an anti-CD20 antibody such as rituximab and a BTK inhibitor such as ibrutinib.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved loncastuximab tesirine for Macroglobulinemia (WM) but it has been approved for other uses. Loncastuximab tesirine is a type of therapy called an antibody drug conjugate. This type of treatment is an antibody to CD19, a protein that is typically found on B-cells and plasma cells in patients with Macroglobulinemia (WM). This is a targeted therapy that uses an antibody (immunoglobulin) to deliver a toxin directly to the cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nIt is expected that about 36 people will take part in this research study.\n\nADC Therapeutics is supporting this research study by providing funding and the study drug."
