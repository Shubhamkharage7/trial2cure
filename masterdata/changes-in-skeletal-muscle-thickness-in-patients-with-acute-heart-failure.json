            "briefSummary": "This study aims to determine, via skeletal muscle ultrasound (US), the extent, timing and relationship between skeletal muscle mass loss and outcomes after orthotropic heart transplantation (OHT) and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation amongst patients with cardiogenic shock. Advanced therapies such as OHT and VADs in the heart failure (HF) population may promote skeletal muscle mass and subsequent quality of life, but there is a lack of literature assessing muscle mass changes in HF patients before and after advanced therapies using US imaging. Therefore this observational study will provide further insight into the 1) changes in lean body mass during critical illness and 2) the feasibility of using bedside US to assess lean body mass in the inpatient setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will be recruiting subjects with advanced cardiomyopathy in cardiogenic shock in the inpatient setting. This is an observational study to better understand changes in lean body mass during critical illness through a quick, safe, and non-invasive method. This study will also validate the use of the BodyMetrix BX 2000 Pro ultrasound machine for the assessment of body composition, particularly muscle wasting, in the cardiogenic shock population.\n\nThe ultrasound device received 501(k) designation from the FDA in 2009 for measurement of localized fat and muscle thickness. Baseline US muscle thickness assessments will occur at baseline after consent; then days 3 and 7 after baseline study visit; then every 7 days thereafter until end of the index hospitalization (discharge or death). Each measurement session will take about 20-30 minutes.The investigators will take measurements at two sites: the lateral thigh and bicep (participant's dominant side). Clear ultrasound gel will be applied to the skin and the ultrasound probe placed against the skin, and the muscle thickness measurement made five times at each position.\n\nThe US images are read after a study visit completion, with measurements taken at pre-specified anatomic landmarks to obtain the muscle thickness, which is averaged accross the duplicate measurements. The primary endpoints are: Percentage change in skeletal muscle thickness from admission to nadir; Percentage change in skeletal muscle thickness after advanced therapies; and the Relationship between muscle mass loss during cardiogenic shock and subsequent clinical outcomes."
