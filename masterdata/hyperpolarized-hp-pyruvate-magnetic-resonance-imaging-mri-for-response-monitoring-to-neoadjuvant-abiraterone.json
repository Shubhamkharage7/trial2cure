            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate on-treatment changes in HP 13C MRI derived kPL as an early response biomarker in men with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer receiving neoadjuvant abiraterone/prednisone prior to radical prostatectomy (RP).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the pathologic complete response/minimal residual disease rate at the time of radical prostatectomy following 12 weeks of neoadjuvant abiraterone/prednisone in patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.\n\nII. To determine the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant abiraterone/prednisone in patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer planning to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP).\n\nIII. To assess time to biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy after 12 weeks of neoadjuvant abiraterone/prednisone IV. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to neoadjuvant abiraterone/prednisone prior to RP.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the diagnostic performances of PSMA PET, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and hyperpolarized 13C MRI (HP13C MRI) for pathological response at the time of RP II. To investigate the association between early changes in intratumoral metabolism (HP 13C derived pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate kPL) on neoadjuvant abiraterone with PSA nadir. III. To evaluate associations between baseline genomic and transcriptional features, changes in intratumoral kPL, and pathologic response at the time of radical prostatectomy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants will receive 12 weeks of neoadjuvant abiraterone/prednisone. After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, participants will proceed to radical prostatectomy. Participants will be followed for up to 5 years every 3 months for the first year following RP, then every 6 months until death, biochemical recurrence or initiation of additional prostate cancer directed therapy."

No evidence of distant metastatic disease as determined by PSMA PET/CT or PET/MR. Nodal disease below the iliac bifurcation (clinical stage N1) is not an exclusion.\n5. Participants must be planning to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without pelvic lymph node dissection and considered surgically resectable by urologic evaluation at the time of study entry.
