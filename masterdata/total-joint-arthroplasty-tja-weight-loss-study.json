            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of bariatric surgery vs medical weight loss vs. the \"usual standard of care\" to optimize a morbidly obese patient with end-stage osteoarthritis of the hip or knee joint for total joint arthroplasty (TJA).\n\nThe study population will include patients with hip or knee joint osteoarthritis and BMI (Body Mass Index) \\> 40 kg/m2 who are evaluated in the joint arthroplasty clinic at Boston Medical Center.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine if bariatric surgery or medical weight loss is more effective than the usual standard of care in optimizing a morbidly obese patient with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee joint for TJA. This will be determined by comparing the number of patients within each group who are able to lose weight through either bariatric surgery, medical weight loss, or the usual standard of care to achieve a BMI \u2264 40 kg/m2 to eventually undergo TJA.\n\nThe secondary objectives of this study are to compare total operative time, postoperative complication rates, readmission rates, percentage of total body weight lost, revision rate, and reoperation rate. The ability of patients within each study arm to maintain a BMI \u2264 40 kg/m2 for up to 2 years after undergoing TJA will also be assessed, as well as their level of satisfaction before and after being in the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this prospective RCT, eligible participants will be randomized to one of three arms - the bariatric surgery study arm, the medical weight loss study arm, or the \"usual standard of care\" study arm. Each patient's progress will be monitored during visits by study personnel. Participants will also have telemedicine visits with an arthroplasty physician assistant every 3 months to ensure they are making progress in terms of weight loss and becoming a safer candidate for TJA. Participants will complete research surveys every 3 months during the telemedicine visits to provide feedback regarding their progress and weight loss methods.\n\nAfter the study participant has achieved a BMI \u2264 40 kg/m2, they will undergo TJA and will be seen postoperatively in the arthroplasty clinic for routine follow up visits. Patients will continue to complete patient research surveys every 3 months via telemedicine for up to 2 years to provide feedback regarding how they are managing with their weight loss after undergoing TJA."
