The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n\u2022 Does targeted radiation therapy decrease recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture after treatment with Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum?\n\nParticipants will undergo:\n\n* Release of Dupuytren's Contracture after Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum injection\n* Daily radiation therapy treatment for 5 days followed by 6-8 week rest period and then another course of 5 days of radiation therapy",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective phase II trial where patients diagnosed with late/advanced stage Dupuytren's Contracture (DC) who undergo successful Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH) injection and release will receive a standardized regimen of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). The study will be powered to assess the outcome in patients undergoing the combination of successful release followed by RT. Patients will be monitored for acute and late toxicities while we evaluate disease recurrence defined as a \\> 20 degree worsening of contracture in the presence of a palpable cord as compared to within 14 days from CCH injection, or the need for medical/surgical intervention to correct the new or worsening contracture."
