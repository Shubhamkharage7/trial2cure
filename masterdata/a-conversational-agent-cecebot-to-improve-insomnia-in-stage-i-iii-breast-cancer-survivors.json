            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates the effect of conversational agent, Cecebot, on improving insomnia in stage I-III breast cancer survivors. Sleep disturbance ranks among the top concerns reported by breast cancer survivors and is associated with poor quality of life. Many breast cancer survivors also have decreased physical activity, which may also have a negative impact on sleep and quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) and physical activity interventions have individually been reported to improve sleep and to have a positive impact on quality of life. Cecebot is a personalized short messaging service (SMS)-based behavioral intervention that combines CBTi and physical activity strategies that may improve sleep for breast cancer survivors.",
