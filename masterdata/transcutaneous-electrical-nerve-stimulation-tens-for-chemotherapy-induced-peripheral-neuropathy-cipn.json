            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the acceptability and proof of concept effectiveness of a wireless Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) technology to address Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN). Participants, who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria and sign the informed consent form will be randomly assigned with ratio of 1:1 into two groups. The patients and clinicians will be blinded for group allocation. One group will utilize TENS high-dose devices (Intervention group, IG); the other group will utilize low-dose TENS devices (Placebo group, PG). The baseline measurements will be performed, and the patients will take the programmed device home for a duration of 8 weeks. Then, the patients will come back after four weeks (4W) and after 8 weeks (8W) for outcome assessment. The primary outcome will be pain. Secondary outcomes include: nerve conduction and velocity, vibration perception threshold, quality of life. Exploratory outcomes include gait assessment (gait speed, stride length, double stance, and gait steadiness), and balance.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chemotherapy and other cancer treatments can cause damage to the peripheral nerves mainly reflected in severe pain in the upper and/or lower extremities. Additional to pain, cancer treatment may cause loss of balance which affects motor capacity and is a major cause of poor quality of life. There are only minimally effective treatments for CIPN despite over 20 years of research. Few recent studies have suggested that exercise intervention could be effective to restore numbness and motor capacity loss because of CIPN. Unfortunately, conventional rehabilitation programs however suffer from poor adherence and those programs for supervised settings have limitation of access for those who live in the remote areas (e.g., rural area), or could be too frail to travel after chemotherapy. This raised a significant disparity for delivering an effective therapy for those who are living in remote areas or those who are too frail to travel. Therefore, will test Quell\u00ae Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation device developed by Neurometrix Inc. (Woburn, MA, USA), to mitigate the associated symptoms caused by CIPN. This device utilizes a wireless technology manageable through a smart phone application (Quell App) that also tracks symptom-status.\n\nThe investigators institution, Duncan Cancer Center (McNair Campus, Baylor College of Medicine St Luke's, Houston, Texas, USA) supervised by specialists in clinical and surgical oncology, has a high volume of patients that present with CIPN. Therefore, the investigators believe that this institution is a suitable place to perform this sub-study. The premise of this sub-study is that daily basis of TENS therapy could be effective to reduce pain, reduce numbness and improve both motor-capacity and mobility performance leading to improve quality of life in those who suffer from CIPN and have limited access to health care."
