Participants will be randomized to watching and reading different combinations of video-based education modules and text-based education modules. Participants will be asked to answer questions about their familiarity with heart failure medications and management before and after the said education modules.",

Educational material regarding two different topics - heart failure self-monitoring and medication management - has been developed in two different formats: animated educational videos and text-based documents. Both formats contain the same information. In this study, participants will be randomized to either watching or reading different combinations of the education for these two topics to better understand which educational tool - animated videos or text-based - is preferred by participants and leads to greater educational attainment. Educational attainment is evaluated by pre and post questions about both topics."
