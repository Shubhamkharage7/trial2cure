            "briefSummary": "Although dysphagia is a known complication of cardiac surgery, risk factors and sensitive bedside clinical markers of dysphagia have not yet been identified. This longitudinal study will enroll 380 cardiac surgical patients and identify contributing risk factors of incident cases of dysphagia and identify sensitive bedside markers of dysphagia. Statistical modeling will produce two pragmatic clinical tools - a risk prediction model and a beside screening tool to improve care models.",
            "detailedDescription": "Swallowing impairment and VFMI are common, yet often overlooked, complications of cardiovascular surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment techniques and validated outcomes in all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The study is therefore aimed to determine the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population and to characterize impairment profiles related to swallowing safety and efficiency. In addition, the study is also aimed to assess the relative impact of VFMI and dysphagia on health-related outcomes such as length of hospital stay, pneumonia, sepsis, reintubation, and discharge status. The study will identify risk factors for postoperative dysphagia and VFMI in cardiovascular patients to build a practical electronic risk-stratification tool. The study will also aim to identify sensitive bedside clinical markers of dysphagia in postoperative cardiovascular patients to develop a bedside screening tool. All participants with planned surgeries will undergo two research visits (one preoperatively and one postoperatively) where they will undergo an instrumental swallowing test and complete several patient report outcomes and clinical tests. If they are found to have dysphagia after surgery, they will be offered no-cost follow-up swallow tests at months 1 and 6. For those without planned surgeries, the same course of tests with the exception of the preoperative research visit will be completed. Finally, health-related outcomes will be indexed in enrolled participants to determine the impact of dysphagia."
