To achieve this, the investigators are running a single-arm study for older adults that involves a 12-week home-based Tai Chi intervention. Study participation includes four remote and/or in-person (at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital) visits to evaluate study participants (mobility tests and questionnaires).",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of the study is to test the delivery of a novel Tele-Tai Chi (TC) intervention in a single-arm feasibility study for community-dwelling TC-nai\u0308ve older adults. The investigators will assess feasibility and acceptability of the Tele-TC intervention and its specific components through both qualitative and quantitative feedback, as well as the systematic tracking of adherence data to inform future trials and potential clinical use of the Tele-TC system. The investigators will also explore changes in outcome measures including physical activity, self-efficacy, quality of life, cognition, balance and gait, and evaluate changes in TC proficiency.\n\nParticipants will be assessed at 4 timepoints over the course of the 12-week Tele-TC intervention: at baseline, at 4 weeks, at 8 weeks, and at 12 weeks.\n\nStudy participants will be instructed to train on their own at least three times a week and to participate in one-on-one live sessions with TC instructors two or more times during the study period."

Additionally, a set of traditional TC warm-up exercises that focus on loosening the physical body, incorporating mindfulness and imagery into movement, promoting overall relaxation, and coordinating breathing awareness are included. Chairs are used in the protocol for a subset of seated warm-up exercises, as well as for stability and rest as needed. Participants will be asked to practice the protocol (45-60 min) at home for at least 3 days a week for 12 weeks.
