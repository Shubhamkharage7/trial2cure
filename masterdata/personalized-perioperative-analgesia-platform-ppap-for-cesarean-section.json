Develop and implement a perioperative precision analgesia platform (PPAP) by linking genomics to opioid metabolism, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation (CPIC) guidelines, precision dosing, clinical safety, and personalizing analgesia\n\nAim 2. Evaluate utility of PPAP in nursing mothers and their newborns following Cesarean Section The investigators hypothesize that CYP2D6 and other (ABCB1, and OPRM1) variants will explain clinical and pharmacokinetic variations of oxycodone, and PPAP implementation will reduce adverse effects in mothers and infants."
