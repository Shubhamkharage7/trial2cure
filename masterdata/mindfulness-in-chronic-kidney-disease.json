            "detailedDescription": "\\~30 million people in the US have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are at 5-15 fold greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and mortality. A major factor contributing to increased CV risk in these patients is chronic elevation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. New therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively ameliorate SNS over-activity are of paramount importance to improve clinical outcomes in this highly prevalent and high-risk patient population.\n\nThis study will test whether mindfulness meditation (MM) improves sympathetic function in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and whether transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) optimizes the sympatho-inhibitory effects of mindfulness meditation (MM) and restores autonomic balance in CKD patients."
