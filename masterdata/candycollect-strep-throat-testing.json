            "briefSummary": "This study will enroll children ages 5-17 who test positive for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) at a single clinic visit lasting approximately 30-60 minutes. The primary aim of this study is to assess the accuracy and feasibility of the CandyCollect platform to capture and detect GAS. The investigators hypothesize that the CandyCollect platform is non-inferior to gold-standard rapid antigen detection testing for GAS.",
            "detailedDescription": "The rationale for this study is to demonstrate the potential of the CandyCollect platform for acquisition of samples from children in the clinic. With deliberate design to maximize collection performance from saliva sampling, the investigators long-term vision is that the CandyCollect platform will achieve better sensitivity and specificity than can be obtained with current biospecimen collection techniques, while providing a platform that is preferred by patients and usable in home settings. Ultimately, the CandyCollect has the potential to make saliva sampling a new gold standard for respiratory disease diagnostics and prevent the discomfort associated with a pharyngeal swab.\n\nThe Theberge Lab at the University of Washington that is developing CandyCollect is using data collected throughout the study to iterate the engineering of the device. As such, analyses were performed after Cohort 1 (n=30 dyad completers), and in line with the iterative nature of this study, the study team adjusted the study design to further inform the engineering of the device. For Cohort 2, which will also target n=30 dyad completers, the study team will still administer surveys to the child and caregiver and collect 4 saliva samples from each child.\n\nIntervention:\n\n* Cohort 1: Pediatric participants diagnosed with GAS via rapid antigen detection test (RADT) will be asked to suck on a swab for 10 seconds, like sucking on a lollipop. They will then be asked to suck on a candy lollipop that will collect their saliva. Participants will do each type of saliva collection twice-two swabs, then two lollipops. Afterwards, participants (both pediatric and caregiver) will fill out a short survey asking about their feelings and opinions about the different types of tests.\n* Cohort 2: Pediatric participants diagnosed with GAS via rapid antigen detection test (RADT) will be asked to suck on four CandyCollect devices. The CandyCollect devices will be designed such that one will take 10 seconds to obtain, one will take 30 seconds to obtain; and two will each take 1 minute to obtain; participants will be instructed to suck on the CandyCollect device for these durations. Afterwards, participants (both pediatric and caregiver) will fill out a short survey asking about their feelings and opinions about the different types of tests.\n\nSpecific aims:\n\n* Aim 1: The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the CandyCollect platform to capture and detect GAS in a small scale clinical study. The investigators will compare results of the CandyCollect sampling with both the RADT, which is the current gold standard, as well as a lollipop swab.\n* Aim 2: The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of the CandyCollect device by surveying pediatric participant and parent experience, acceptance of the collection technique, and their willingness to perform the test at home.\n\nHypotheses to be tested:\n\n* Aim 1: The CandyCollect platform is non-inferior to gold-standard RADT for GAS.\n* Aim 2: Pediatric participants and their parent/legal guardians will have a more positive experience with the CandyCollect than the RADT throat swab or the lollipop swab, and they will be willing to do the CandyCollect at home."
