Subjects will begin an oral drug regimen of Glyburide with the initial dose being within 8 hours of the injury and again every 6 hours after for 72 total hours of treatment. The daily dose of 3.125mg on day one and 2.5 mg on days 2 and 3 will be used to determine if the investigational drug provides any neuroprotection when given soon after injury. If indicated, the subject will also have surgical intervention for spinal cord decompression surgery and spinal stabilization. Participants will have labs drawn regularly, and ECGs done throughout their hospital stay. Adverse events will be monitored daily through day 14 of participation or hospital discharge (whichever is earlier). Study participation will last for 365 days (+/- 30 days), with post-hospitalization follow-up occurring on days 28, 42, 84, 182, and 365."
