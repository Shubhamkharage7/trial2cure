The main question it aims to answer is whether the WeCAB intervention leads to a net improvement in utilization of postpartum care compared to those receiving usual care.\n\nThe WeCAB group will have a dedicated WeCAB community health worker who will be trained in digital care navigation.\n\nResearchers will compare the WeCAB group versus the group receiving usual care to see if the patients randomized to WeCAB will have higher rates of early post-partum care compared to patients in the control group."
