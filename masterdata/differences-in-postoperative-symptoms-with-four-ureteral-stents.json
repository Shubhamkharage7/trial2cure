            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will compare Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) scores with each ureteral stent. Laser lithotripsy is a surgical procedure performed during stone surgeries. The Percuflex ureteral stent and Tria ureteral stent are FDA approved and clinically used in the United States.\n\nA total of 3 clinic visits (i.e., pre-operative visit, the stent removal 1-2 weeks after surgery, and one post-operative visit 3-6 weeks after surgery) in addition to the surgery will be needed for this study. The patient's demographic information and medical background data will be collected from the medical record.\n\nThe USSQ will be administered twice:\n\n1. At the time of stent removal (1-2 weeks after surgery ) (This is standard of care)\n2. At the first postoperative follow-up after stent removal (3-6 weeks) (This is the standard of care).\n\nThe following information will be collected as secondary outcomes:\n\n1. WisQOL which will be administered three times. It is UW standard of care for stone patients to complete the WisQOL at every clinic visit.\n2. ER visits documented in patients chart\n3. Unscheduled clinic follow-up documented in patient chart\n4. Additional prescriptions for stent related symptoms documented by patient chart\n5. Stent complications by fluoroscopy or image\n6. Physician evaluation of the stent. Physicians will complete a one page survey at the end of the case evaluating the stent."
