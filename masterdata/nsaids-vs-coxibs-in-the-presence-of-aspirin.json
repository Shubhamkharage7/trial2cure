            "detailedDescription": "The relative cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs, particularly among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at higher CVD risk, has generated considerable concern among both patients and physicians because of knowledge gaps in the evidence relative to comparative safety and pharmacodynamic interactions between aspirin and NSAIDs. In the recently reported PRECISION trial, a moderate dose of celecoxib was found to be noninferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with respect to cardiovascular safety in patients with arthritis at increased CVD risk. At this time, no comparative prior data are available analyzing the effects of NSAIDs vs. Coxibs in the presence of aspirin on platelet function, biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial function.\n\nThirty patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk or with established CV disease will be enrolled in the study. Patients taking anticoagulant therapy or any other antiplatelet agent other than aspirin will be excluded.\n\nPatients will be treated with immediate release 81mg aspirin for 4 weeks in the run-in period followed by randomization to celecoxib (200 mg bid) vs. naproxen sodium (550 mg bid) for 4 weeks and then cross over to the other drug for another 4 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline before the aspirin run in period, 24\u00b14 hr after the last dose of aspirin in the run in period, 24\u00b14 hr after the last dose of the first period study drug and 24\u00b14 hr after the last dose of the second period study drug. Assays for platelet function, biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial function will be performed at these time points."
