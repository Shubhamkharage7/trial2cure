            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is a type of malignant glioma. These cancers are nearly always fatal. People who develop these cancers get aggressive treatments. But the tumors almost always recur. Researchers want to study people with newly diagnosed disease to learn more.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study people with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma to look at the changes in immune cells in the blood of those who take ipilimumab and nivolumab, along with temozolomide.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma, who have had surgical removal of their tumor and have completed standard initial chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with the following:\n\nMedical record review\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nTests to assess their nervous system and their ability to do typical activities\n\nBlood tests\n\nTumor assessment. For this, they will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They may get a contrast dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter. The MRI scanner makes noise. They will get earplugs.\n\nElectrocardiogram. It measures heart rate and rhythm. They will lie still. Sticky pads will be placed on their chest, arms, and legs.\n\nScreening tests will be repeated during the study.\n\nTreatment will be given in cycles. Each cycle lasts 4 weeks. Participants will get nivolumab and ipilimumab via IV. They will take temozolomide by mouth. They will keep a pill diary.\n\nParticipants will fill out surveys about their symptoms.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up visits about 60 days and 100 days after treatment ends. Then they will be contacted every 6 months for the rest of their life.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nGlioblastoma (GBM) represents an aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options. The immunosuppressive nature of GBM may be reversible with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, however, initial studies have yet to demonstrate this. It is postulated that trafficking of peripherally activated lymphocytes may play a role in generating a robust intracranial immune response. Therefore, a blood-based assay to identify peripheral blood response may both predict response and better identify the ideal patient populations for future ICI clinical trials.\n\nObjectives:\n\nDetermine if the outcomes, as measured by overall survival, is improved in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma when treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors result in an immune response in peripheral blood T lymphocytes.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHistologically confirmed, newly diagnosed primary glioblastoma or gliosarcoma;\n\nAge greater than or equal to 18 years;\n\nAdequate organ function;\n\nKarnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 70;\n\nSubjects must recently complete resection and chemoradiation;\n\nSubjects must not have prior immunotherapy, other current investigational agents, or corticosteroid treatment \\> 30mg cortisone-equivalents per day.\n\nDesign:\n\nOpen-label, investigator-initiated exploratory study of newly-diagnosed GBM who have completed resection and chemoradiation.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to be treated in Arm 1 or 2, consistent of adjuvant chemotherapy (temozolomide (TMZ)) and immunotherapy (nivolumab + ipilimumab):\n\nTMZ (150-200 mg/m2 PO on days 1-5 q28 days for cycles 1-6)\n\nArm 1:\n\nNivolumab (1 mg/kg IV q2weeks for cycles 1-4, then 480 mg IV q4weeks for cycles 5-16) + ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV q4 weeks for cycles 1-4)\n\nArm 2:\n\nNivolumab (1 mg/kg IV q2weeks for cycles 1-4, then 480 mg IV q4weeks for cycles 5-16) + ipilimumab (3 mg/kg IV q4 weeks for cycles 1-4)\n\nFor the primary objective, serial examination of peripheral blood, including comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of leukocyte populations and cytokines, and Interferon- \\>= (IFN- \\>=) ELISPOT functional analysis of CD4+/8+ response to common recall antigens will be used to determine systemic response to ICI treatment.\n\nFor the secondary objectives, correlative studies assess peripheral blood T cells' ability to respond to an in vitro stimulation paradigm, including nivolumab and ipilimumab, in a microbead-based model. The T cell response to pretreatment in vitro stimulation would be compared to post-treatment in vivo stimulation to determine if this in vitro model can predict in vivo response.\n\nAdditional exploratory studies are planned to characterize the in vivo immune response to adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, including but not limited to:\n\nPhospho-flow functional analysis of NK cell response to IFN/IL-15 stimulation."

Participants with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren s syndrome, psoriasis controlled with topical medication, and participants with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.\n\n* The participant must not be currently on a corticosteroid dose greater than physiologic replacement dosing defined as 30 mg of cortisone per day or its equivalent. Participants must have stopped corticosteroids above this threshold at least 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations (within timeframes identified in the bullets below) that\n\nwould limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n-Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study treatment potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown.
