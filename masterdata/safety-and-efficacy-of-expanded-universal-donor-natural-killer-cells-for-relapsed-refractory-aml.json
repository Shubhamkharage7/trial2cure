To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose of adoptive NK cell therapy using UD-NK cells in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the efficacy of UD- NK cells with FLA chemotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the immunophenotype and function of UD-NK cells\n\nII. To characterize in vivo expansion of UD-NK cells\n\nIII. To determine the persistence of UD-NK cells\n\nSix doses of universal donor mbIL-21 expanded NK cells (UD-NK) given thrice weekly for two weeks. Days may vary and NK cells can be given from days 0 to 21. Patients may receive up to 2 cycles of fludarabine/cytarabine (FLA) + NK cells (up to 12 NK cell infusions) if they do not achieve CR after cycle 1 or if necessary to bridge to transplant.",
            "detailedDescription": "The treatment plan consists of Fludarabine/Cytarabine chemotherapy followed by six doses of universal donor mbIL-21 expanded NK cells (UD-NK) given thrice weekly for two weeks. Days may vary and NK cells can be given from days 0 to 21. Patients may receive up to 2 cycles of fludarabine/cytarabine (FLA) + NK cells (up to 12 NK cell infusions) if they do not achieve CR after cycle 1 or if necessary to bridge to transplant.\n\nIn this study the first NK cell infusion is referred as day zero (D0), treatment plan activities prior or after D0 are denominated as day minus (D-) or day plus (D+).\n\nFLA will be give as follows: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day (day -6 to day -2) and Cytarabine 2000 mg/ m2/day (days -6 to day -2)\n\nSix doses of UD-NK cells will be given thrice weekly for two weeks beginning day 0. NK cell administration schedule may vary and doses may be given from day 0 to 21. A minimum of 2 days between NK cell doses is required. Patients must meet eligibility criteria for NK cell infusion as described in the protocol.\n\nPatients will be eligible to receive a second cycle of chemotherapy for the following reasons:\n\n1. \\<CR after cycle 1\n2. Additional cycle is needed to bridge the patient to HSCT\n\nCriteria to begin Cycle 2:\n\n1. \u226528 days since the first NK Cell infusion\n2. \u22652 days since the last NK Cell infusion in cycle 1\n3. Bone marrow evaluation after cycle 1 complete\n4. It is suggested but not required for ANC \\> 500/uL AND platelets \\>50,000/uL prior to beginning cycle 2\n5. Prior treatment related toxicities must have resolved to \u2264 Grade 2\n\nNK Cell Dose Levels:\n\n1. Dose level 1: 1.00x10\\^7 NK cell/kg (\u00b120%) each dose for 6 doses per cycle\n2. Dose level 2: 3.00x10\\^7 NK cell/kg (\u00b120%) each dose for 6 doses per cycle\n3. Dose level 3: 1.00x10\\^8 NK cell/kg (\u00b120%) each dose for 6 doses per cycle\n\nThe NK dose will be calculated based on actual body weight. Dose escalation will proceed according to the study design outlined in Section 9.1 to determine the MTD. Once a patient is enrolled at a dose level, the dose will remain at the enrolled dose level for all subsequent NK cell infusions."
