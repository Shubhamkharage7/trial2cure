            "briefSummary": "The study will test the feasibility of using Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) to treat motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). LIFUP is a new technique that can increase brain activity in highly specific target areas and is MRI compatible. Thus, in real-time, it is possible to directly observe how LIFUP changes the brain areas important in PD by measuring its effects on brain activity, blood flow, and brain connectivity. If successful, this research will mark the first step towards a novel, non-invasive, non-medication treatment for PD.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial is a proof-of-concept, proof-of-mechanism study of a novel neuromodulation technology - LIFUP - to treat motor symptoms in PD. Much like Deep Brain Stimulation, LIFUP can be focused on deep brain structures with high spatial accuracy, including those implicated in PD; however, it can do so non-invasively. Other non-invasive neuromodulation tools such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation can only target surface brain structures and are not optimal PD treatment tools. This study will test this new technology in 30 participants with PD during simultaneous resting state functional MRI, and collect pre- and post-LIFUP functional MRI, arterial spin labeling, motor performance data, and behavioral data, in a double-blind crossover trial to determine whether LIFUP: 1) will improve motor symptoms during and after treatment; 2) can modulate neural activity in the target brain region important for PD, the internal globus pallidus; and 3) enhance cortico-striatal motor circuit connectivity. All participants in this study will receive active ultrasound at one of the two in-person sessions and sham at the other."
