The dose escalation part (Phase 1a) of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of GLB-001 administered orally. Approximately 24 participants (up to 42 participants) may be enrolled in Phase 1a of the study.\n\nThe dose expansion part (Phase 1b) will be followed to understand the relationships among dose, exposure, toxicity, tolerability and clinical activity, to identify minimally active dose, and to select the recommended dose(s) for phase 2 study. Up to 24 participants (12 participants per dose level) may be enrolled in Phase 1b of the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will be applied to evaluate a set of several dose levels to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of GLB-001 in R/R AML or R/R HR-MDS patients who are eligible for DLT evaluation. The actual dose-escalation magnitude or dosing frequency may be adjusted based on the available PK and safety data in human.\n\nAfter the MTD or MAD of GLB-001 is defined in Phase 1a, 1 or 2 dose levels will be selected for expansion per safety review committee (SRC) recommendation, approximately 12 patients will be enrolled per dose level. Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be selected based on the results of PK, PD, safety and efficacy in the dose escalation and expansion study."
