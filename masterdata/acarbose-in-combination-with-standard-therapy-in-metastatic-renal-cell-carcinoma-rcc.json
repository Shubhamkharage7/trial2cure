Histologically confirmed diagnosis of clear cell or non-clear cell carcinoma of the kidney, except for medullary carcinoma, collecting duct carcinoma, lymphoma and sarcoma. Sarcomatoid features of any degree are allowed\n2. Must have locally advanced or unresectable metastatic disease (i.e., newly diagnosed Stage IV RCC per American Joint Committee on Cancer) or has recurrent disease.\n3. Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator/site radiologist.\n4. Has received no prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC in the past 3 weeks.\n5. Has Karnofsky performance status (KPS) \u2265 60% as assessed within 10 days prior to randomization.\n6. If receiving bone resorptive therapy (including but not limited to bisphosphonate or RANK-L inhibitor) must have therapy initiated at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.\n7. Demonstrates adequate organ function defined as follows\n\n   1. Liver function liver function (bilirubin \\< 3mg/dL, AST and/or ALT \\<3 x ULN)\n   2. Kidney function (CrCL \\>=15ml/min using cockroft-gault method)\n   3. ANC \\>= 500/microliter, Hemoglobin \\> 8 mg/dL, platelet count \\> 50,000/microliter\n8. CNS metastasis is allowed if has been treated \\>3 weeks and patient has achieved clinical stability with no new neurologic deficits in the interim\n9. Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study drugs. Male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception, starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n\n  2. Has had major surgery within 4 weeks, received radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or has not recovered (i.e., \u2264 Grade 1 or at baseline) from AEs due to prior treatment.\n\n  3. Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., generalized rash/erythema, hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema or anaphylaxis) to acarbose or investigators choice of standard of care therapy.\n\n  4. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency OR is receiving a systemic steroid therapy exceeding physiologic corticosteroid dose or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to randomization, except in the case of central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\n\n  5.

Note: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ such as breast cancer in situ are acceptable if they have undergone potentially curative therapy. Low grade prostate cancer with gleason score 6 or lower which is not under active therapy will be acceptable if in investigator judgement it is likely not a competing risk to patient's life expectancy.\n\n  7. Has known active untreated CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. 8. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. 9. Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of randomization. 10.

Has current use (within 7 days of randomization) or anticipated need for treatment with drugs that are known strong CYP3A4/5 inducers, including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John's wort; or drugs that are known with proarrhythmic potential.\n\n  20. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study.\n\n  21. Has had a prior solid organ transplant. 22.
