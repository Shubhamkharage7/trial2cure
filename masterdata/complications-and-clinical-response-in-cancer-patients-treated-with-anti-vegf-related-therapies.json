This may help doctors learn if there are any relationships between these side effects and how the disease may respond to treatment.",

To explore the incidence of clinical complications associated with anti-VEGF-related therapies in cancer patients treated at Emory University and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the correlation of clinical response rates to a novel blood pressure scoring system in cancer patients treated with anti-VEGF-related therapies.\n\nII. To explore the correlation of objective response to each toxicity grade 3 or higher in cancer patients treated with anti-VEGF-related therapies.\n\nIII. To investigate the validity of a novel multi-parameter-based blood pressure scoring system and to determine if the new scoring method is concordant with the current Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) method.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients' medical records are reviewed."
