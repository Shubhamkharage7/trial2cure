            "briefSummary": "MICS CABG (Minimally invasive coronary surgery), where coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is completed through a small incision over the left chest, has evolved to become a safe and less invasive alternative to conventional sternotomy CABG. Several observational studies have suggested significantly shorter time to return to physical activity for MICS CABG patients compared to sternotomy CABG patients. A randomized study is warranted to validate these findings, provide higher level of evidence, and potentially lead to changes in practice. The MIST Trial is a multi-centre, prospective, open label, randomized control trial comparing quality of life and recovery in the early post-operative period, between patients undergoing MICS CABG versus patients undergoing sternotomy CABG. Patients referred for isolated CABG for multi-vessel coronary artery disease and deemed technically suitable for sternotomy CABG as well as for MICS CABG are considered for enrollment into the trial. Quality of life questionnaires (The SF-36, Seattle Angina Questionnaire and EQ-5D-5L) will be used to assess the quality of life and recovery in patients undergoing sternotomy CABG or MICS CABG at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow up."
