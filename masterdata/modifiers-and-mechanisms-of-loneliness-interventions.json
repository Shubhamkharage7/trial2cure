This study is a Stage III, 19-month 2 (groups) x 2 (assessment timepoints) randomized clinical trial (RCT) aimed at identifying whether lonely caregivers' capacity, is associated with the degree to which loneliness is reduced in response to social engagement intervention (S-ENG). Further, the study will address whether a digitized, social engagement prioritization tool (C4C) used in the first session of S-ENG can improve intervention fidelity and"
