            "detailedDescription": "Reiki is a popular complementary medicine modality sought after by patients. This non- intrusive Japanese based therapy centers on the guiding of energy through a Reiki practitioner to the patient which facilitates innate healing by modulation of energy fields. Reiki is formally classified as biofield therapy by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).\n\nCurrent research indicates that Reiki shows promise as a noninvasive healing tool for mind and body, particularly among patients with cancer. However, the data validating the effectiveness of Reiki integrated within a structured medical paradigm and the effect on cancer immunity remains unknown.\n\nGiven the clear demand for Reiki among cancer patients but skepticism within the medical community, this trial will aim to determine an objective patient reported quality of life (PRQoL) benefit by utilizing validated tools, in order to effectively implement Reiki into traditional medical practice.\n\nMultiple myeloma patients are at high risk of serious illness from the COVID-19 virus during this pandemic, and so distance Reiki will be carried out via video conferencing platform."
