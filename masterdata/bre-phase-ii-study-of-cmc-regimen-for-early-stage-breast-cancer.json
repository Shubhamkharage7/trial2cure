Following completion of radiation therapy, participants may then resume with cycle 5 of CMC. The washout period before and after radiation therapy is a minimum of 2 weeks. Alternatively, patients may receive adjuvant radiotherapy after the completion of the final (8) cycle of CMC.\n\nThe study team will collect data on cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and capecitabine compliance at routine clinical visits every 3 weeks. In addition, standard electrolyte, chemistry and liver function laboratory monitoring will be conducted at each clinic visit"
