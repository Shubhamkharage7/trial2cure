            "briefSummary": "Mitral regurgitation may be seen in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. Observational studies suggest improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with mitral regurgitation in the setting of cardiogenic shock; however, there remains a lack of randomized clinical data to support the use of TEER in cardiogenic shock.\n\nThis study will be a multicenter, open-label, randomized-controlled trial with two study arms: medical therapy and TEER. Patients admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU), Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit (CSICU) or Intensive Care Units (ICU) at participating centers will be recruited.\n\nThe study aims to answer the question: \"Does TEER in patients with SCAI stage C or D cardiogenic with concomitant moderate or greater mitral regurgitation improve outcomes as compared to medical therapy?\"\n\nThe study hypothesis is that TEER will lead to an overall improvement in the composite outcome as compared to the medical therapy arm.",
            "detailedDescription": "Current management strategies for patients with SCAI stage C through E cardiogenic shock include management in a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) or cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) with intravenous inotropes (i.e. medications to increase the pumping function of the heart), vasopressors (i.e. medications to increase blood pressure), ventilatory support, and/or mechanical circulatory support. Importantly, with the exception of revascularization, little data exists demonstrating the ability to alter prognosis in patients with cardiogenic shock.\n\nMitral regurgitation may be seen in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. Observational studies suggest improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with mitral regurgitation in the setting of cardiogenic shock; however, there remains a lack of randomized clinical data to support the use of TEER in cardiogenic shock.\n\nThis study will be divided into two phases, as follows:\n\nPhase 1 (Vanguard) - The first phase of this study will be composed of a feasibility stage where a total of 10 participants from centers in Ontario, Canada will be recruited. The primary objective of this phase is to ascertain feasibility of participant recruitment and treatment. Feasibility would be considered met if 10 participants were enrolled 12 months from the date of activation of all four centers.\n\nPhase 2 - The second phase of this study will be a continuation of Phase 1 where the remaining 134 participants, for a total of 144 participants in the overall study. For this second phase of the study, patients will be recruited from high-volume TEER centers in Canada and the United States - with participating centers performing more than 25 TEER procedures per year.\n\nEligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to the medical therapy arm (i.e. control arm) or the TEER arm (i.e. intervention arm) of the trial."
