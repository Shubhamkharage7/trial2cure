            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether combination of talazoparib and temozolomide works to shrink tumors in patients with rare cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Talazoparib is an inhibitor of poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Temozolomide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It damages the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. Giving talazoparib in combination with temozolomide may help shrink advanced rare cancers or stop them from growing.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the proportion of patients with advanced rare cancers who have objective responses (OR) to treatment with temozolomide and talazoparib.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months on study agents.\n\nII. To identify genomic and transcriptomic determinants of response and resistance in tumor biopsy specimens.\n\nIII. To examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that may be associated with response or resistance.\n\nIV. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination on biomarkers of cell death and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumor tissue and CTCs.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO QD on days 2-6 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo CT scans and may optionally undergo biopsy and/or blood sample collection at baseline and on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days or until one of the following occurs: patient enrolls on another protocol, patient receives standard of care, or death, whichever comes first."

For these patients, an HIV viral load test must be completed within 28 days prior to enrollment\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Sensory/motor neuropathy \\>= grade 2\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial. Patients with treated brain metastases, whose brain metastatic disease has remained stable for \\>= 1 month without requiring steroid and anti-seizure medication are eligible to participate\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition to study drugs\n* Known clinically significant liver disease, including active viral, alcoholic, or other hepatitis; cirrhosis; fatty liver; and inherited liver disease\n\n  * Patients with past or resolved hepatitis B infection (defined as having a negative hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] test and a positive anti-HBc \\[antibody to hepatitis B core antigen\\] antibody test) are eligible. For these patients, HBsAg and anti-HBc tests must be done within 28 days prior to enrollment\n  * Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). For these patients, an HCV RNA test must be done within 28 days prior to enrollment\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious untreated infection, symptomatic respiratory failure/congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because temozolomide and talazoparib have demonstrated fetal harm in animal reproductive studies. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the first dose of study drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 1 months following the last dose of study drug",
