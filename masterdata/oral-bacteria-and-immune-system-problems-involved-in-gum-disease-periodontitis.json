            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\n- Gum disease is a condition in which the tissue around the tooth root becomes swollen and infected. This condition can cause tooth loss if it is not treated. Who gets gum disease and how bad it will be depends on (1) the different bacteria in the mouth and (2) how the immune system of an individual handles these bacteria. Researchers want to look at the oral bacteria and genetic immune problems of different people to learn how these affect gum disease and other conditions of the mouth.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To study how immune system problems may lead to problems in the mouth, including gum disease.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Children and adults at least 7 years of age who have genetic problems with their immune system.\n* Healthy adults that have periodontal disease\n* Health adults that do not have periodontal disease\n\nDesign:\n\n* This study will involve a screening visit and a study visit.\n* Participants will be screened with a medical history, blood work and a full oral and dental exam, including dental x-rays and photos.\n* The study visit will involve collection of blood, urine, and other samples, including saliva, plaque, and gum swabs. Any abnormal tissue will sampled for a biopsy. Additional oral and dental exams will be performed. Participants will also answer questions about any current medical or dental problems.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a cross sectional/natural history protocol designed to investigate the clinical,\n\nmicrobiologic, and immunologic consequences of genetic immune defects in the oral cavity. The hypothesis is that genetic immune defects will lead to alterations in the local immune response and microbial colonization and ultimately predispose to susceptibility to oral infections and inflammatory conditions.\n\nIn the cross-sectional phase the following individuals will be enrolled, evaluated and screened for presence and severity of periodontitis, presence of a genetic defects and sampled for studies in oral immunity and microbiome: 1) individuals diagnosed with genetic immune defects 2) individuals with severe periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and their family members 3) healthy volunteers. Subjects identified with a genetic immune defect and with presence of oral disease (primarily periodontitis) may enter the natural history phase of the study to be clinically followed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over time. This protocol aims to determine whether specific genetic immune defects will predispose to oral disease (primarily periodontitis) and to better understand consequences of immune deficiency on the oral immune response and microbiome.\n\nPrimary Objectives\n\n1. Investigate the degree, scope, etiology and natural history of oral manifestations in patients with genetic immune defects.\n2. Characterize the immune response in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune defects.\n3. Characterize the microbiome in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune defects.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n1. Assay development/validation for the study of tissue immunity and microbiome characterization\n2. Establishment of normative values for immune mediators and microbial elements at the oral cavity\n\nStudy Population (s)\n\nThe study population will include:\n\n1. Subjects with genetic immune defects\n2. Subjects with severe periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and their family members\n3. Healthy volunteers (with/without periodontal disease)\n\nDesign\n\nThis is a cross-sectional/natural history study for the evaluation of clinical, immunologic, and microbiologic oral manifestations (primarily periodontitis) in patients diagnosed with genetic immune defects or those with severe periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and healthy volunteer subjects.\n\nCross Sectional Phase: Three groups of subjects will be enrolled in the cross-sectional phase of the study 1) individuals diagnosed with genetic immune defects 2) individuals with severe periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and their family members that include parents or siblings 3) healthy volunteers (with/without periodontal disease). All groups will be evaluated for oral disease (periodontitis) and sampled for oral immunity, systemic immunity and microbiome characterization. Individuals with severe periodontitis in the presence/absence of a genetic defect may be offered the option of receiving standard of care inflammatory control periodontal treatment at NIH without travel compensation, following the cross-sectional portion of the study. Family members (parents or siblings) of individuals with periodontal disease of suspected genetic may be asked to participate in this study. During the course of genetic testing, family members may be enrolled in the cross sectional phase of the study for phenotyping and genetic testing.\n\nNatural History Phase: Subjects identified with a genetic defect with the presence of oral disease may enroll in the natural history phase of the study to be followed clinically over time.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measures\n\n1. Clinical intraoral characterization (i.e., presence and severity of periodontitis).\n2. Characterize the immune response in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune defects\n3. Characterize the microbiome in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune defects\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures\n\n1. Assay development/validation for the study of tissue immunity and microbiome characterization\n2. Establishment of normative values for immune mediators and microbial elements at the oral cavity\n\nExploratory Outcome Measures\n\nInitial data from this study may generate new hypotheses for investigation as part of this study."
