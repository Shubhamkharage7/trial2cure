            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose to plan for a multi-center randomized controlled trial (M-RCT) to test the effectiveness of novel gluten detection technologies as an adjunct to telemedicine to manage celiac disease in newly diagnosed adults. If successful, the proposed intervention will improve mucosal recovery, promote a shift in current practice of celiac disease management toward long-term monitoring, and represent a significant step toward reducing the severe physical and psychological consequences of celiac disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed project addresses the need for a rigorous trial to test the effectiveness of novel gluten detection technologies as an adjunct to telemedicine to manage celiac disease in adults. Celiac disease affects about 1% of the United States (U.S.) population and seroprevalence has increased up to 5-fold in the U.S. since the 1950's, with diagnosis rates continuing to rise. Morbidity can be severe and includes anemia, infertility, osteoporosis, and malignancies, which can increase all-cause mortality. The only proven therapy is a strict gluten-free diet, the management of which can be extremely challenging and has been linked to diminished quality of life, including anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Despite the recommendation to see a dietitian regularly, many with celiac disease do not see one at all or have only a single session immediately post-diagnosis. The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the rapid adoption of telemedicine in gastroenterology and can facilitate communication between patient and dietitian by eliminating the need to arrange face-to-face meetings at celiac disease centers, which may be at great distance. Self-monitoring with new technologies for gluten detection in urine (e.g., gluten immunogenic peptide kits) can facilitate greater individual awareness of gluten exposures, are commercially available to the public, and have been shown to be valid and reliable. Physicians and dietitians are being asked if this technology should be used, and our preliminary studies have demonstrated acceptability and feasibility, but their impact on clinical outcomes such as mucosal recovery and symptoms has not been established. This U01 proposal is for a multi-center (New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Tennessee) randomized controlled trial (M-RCT) to assess the effectiveness and document costs of gluten detection technologies as an adjunct to telemedicine on behavioral and clinical outcomes among newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease. Participants will be randomized to receive either 1) standard of care (i.e. a one-time in-person dietitian session plus telemedicine dietitian follow-up; or 2) standard of care + gluten detection technology. This would be the first large-scale clinical trial to test the effect of self-monitoring using gluten detection technology in the management of celiac disease. The primary outcome will be mucosal recovery 12-months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include change in gastrointestinal symptoms, diet adherence, quality of life (including anxiety and depression), eating behaviors, intraepithelial lymphocyte counts on histology, and celiac disease serology, all assessed at baseline and again at 12-months post-randomization. If the primary endpoint of this proposed U01 is met, the intervention will improve mucosal recovery, promote a shift in current practice of celiac disease management toward long-term monitoring, and represent a significant step toward reducing the severe physical and psychological consequences of celiac disease."
