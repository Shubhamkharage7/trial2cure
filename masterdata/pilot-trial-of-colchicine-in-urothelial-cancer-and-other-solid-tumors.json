There are two cohorts, which will enroll separately and parallelly. Cohort 1 will include two successive groups with advanced/recurrent solid tumors (15 patients will receive low-dose colchicine and 15 for high-dose colchicine) who will receive 14 days of colchicine. In Cohort 2, 15 patients with post-radical surgery for high-risk clinically localized urothelial cancer will be enrolled. They will receive one 28-day cycle of colchicine. The primary outcome, post-treatment decline in CRP level, a continuous measure, will be defined as the maximum percentage decline from baseline in post-treatment CRP value within two weeks of colchicine (Cohort 1) or one cycle of colchicine (cohort 2), where the baseline value is measured before any treatment is initiated."
