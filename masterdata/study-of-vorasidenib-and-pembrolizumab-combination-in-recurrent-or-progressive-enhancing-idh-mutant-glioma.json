In the Safety Lead-In Phase, the recommended combination dose (RCD) of vorasidenib will be determined. In the Randomized Perioperative Phase, the Lymphocytes infiltration in tumors will be evaluated following pre-surgical treatment with vorasidenib and pembrolizumab combination, compared to untreated control tumors. Prior to surgery, participants will be randomized to receive vorasidenib at the RCD in combination with pembrolizumab, or vorasidenib only, or no treatment (untreated control group). Following surgery, participants will have the option to receive treatment with vorasidenib in combination with pembrolizumab in 21-day cycles.\n\nStudy treatment will be administered until participant experiences unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or other discontinuation criteria are met."

Have received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy within 1 month of the first dose of IMP, radiation within 12 months of the first dose of IMP, or an investigational agent \\< 14 days prior to the first dose of IMP. In addition, the first dose of IMP should not occur before a period of \u2265 5 half-lives of the investigational agent has elapsed.\n2. Have received 2 or more courses of radiation.\n3.
