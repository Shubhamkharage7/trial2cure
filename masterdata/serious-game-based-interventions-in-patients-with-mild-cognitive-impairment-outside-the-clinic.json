For the following 12 weeks, the participants will not engage in any therapist-supervised cognitive therapies (i.e., no-intervention period).\n\nGroup B will not engage in any therapist-supervised cognitive therapies (i.e., no-intervention period). For the following 12 weeks, the participants will self-administer Neuro-World cognitive training games for 30 minutes a day, twice a week in the home setting (i.e., intervention period).\n\nAll the participants in both groups will receive phone calls twice a week to 1) provide feedback on their adherence to Neuro-World cognitive training (during the intervention period) and 2) learn any significant changes in the level of their daily activities (during the no-intervention period and the intervention period)."
