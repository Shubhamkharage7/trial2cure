            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of WSD0922-FU for the treatment of glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the central nervous system (central nervous system metastases). WSD0922-FU is a targeted treatment which blocks the EGFR protein - a strategy that has led to a lot of benefit in patients with many different cancers. WSD0922-FU may also be able to get into cancers in the brain and spinal cord and help patients with brain and spinal cord cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EGFR/EGFRvIII inhibitor WSD0922-FU (WSD0922-FU) in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma, IDH wildtype (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH wildtype (AA) and central nervous system (CNS) metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to WSD0922-FU.\n\nII. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial overall response rate (ORR), and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for GBM/AA and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for NSCLC.\n\nIII. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial disease control rate (DCR) and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.\n\nIV. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial duration of response (DOR) and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.\n\nV. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.\n\nEXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate the presence and/or identity of the drug metabolites of WSD0922-FU, and the concentrations of these in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tumor.\n\nII. To assess plasma concentration of WSD0922-FU and metabolite SN16110801P1 and pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters after single and multiple doses of WSD0922-FU.\n\nIII. To assess the brain tumor pharmacokinetics of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after a single dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - Brain tumor penetration \\[BTP\\] cohort only).\n\nIV. To assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after multiple doses of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - NSCLC cohort only).\n\nV. To explore the impact of tumor markers (e.g. MGMT promoter methylation, EGFR mutation \\[including EGFR vIII\\], PTEN deletion, TP53 mutation, etc.) on clinical parameters associated with WSD0922-FU treatment.\n\nVI. To evaluate and measure pharmacodynamic biomarkers of inhibition of EGFR and downstream signals in tumor samples after a single dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion Cohort - BTP cohort only).\n\nVII. To evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of single dose of WSD0922-FU in plasma (Dose Expansion - GBM/AA cohort only).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nDOSE ESCALATION: Patients receive WSD0922-FU orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and collection of blood samples on study. Patients with NSCLC with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) also undergo collection of CSF samples on study.\n\nDOSE EXPANSION: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patients with GBM/AA receive WSD0922-FU PO on days 1 and 4 of cycle 0. Patients then receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo MRI during screening and on study, as well as blood sample collection on study. Patients may undergo additional optional blood sample collection on study.\n\nCOHORT II: Patients with BTP receive a single dose of WSD0922-FU prior to surgery. Patients then undergo surgical resection of brain tumor. After surgery, patients receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo MRI during screening and on study, as well as blood sample collection on study.\n\nCOHORT III: Patients with NSCLC receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo MRI and CT during screening and on study, as well as blood sample collection on study. Patients with LM also undergo collection of CSF samples on study. Patients may also undergo optional blood sample collection on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, then every 2 months until progressive disease, at progressive disease, and then every 3 months after progressive disease for up to 5 years.\n\nFunding Source - FDA OOPD"
