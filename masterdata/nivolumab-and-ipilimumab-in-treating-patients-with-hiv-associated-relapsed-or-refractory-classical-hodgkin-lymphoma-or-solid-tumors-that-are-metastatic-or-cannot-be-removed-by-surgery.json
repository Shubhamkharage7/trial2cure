            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with ipilimumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory), or solid tumors that have spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against a molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 controls a part of the immune system by shutting it down. Nivolumab is a type of antibody that is specific for human programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a protein that is responsible for destruction of immune cells. Giving ipilimumab with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with HIV associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma or solid tumors compared to ipilimumab with nivolumab alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To demonstrate safety and feasibility of ipilimumab and nivolumab at the standard doses of drug in solid tumor and relapsed refractory HIV-classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection given the possibility of increased toxicity based on immune activation, co-morbidity, or interference with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy. (Dose De-escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, on immune function (HIV viral load in plasma using conventional assay, CD4+ and CD8+ cells). (Dose De-escalation Cohort) II. To preliminarily assess objective response rates associated with treatment for commonly represented solid tumors (Kaposi sarcoma, anal cancer, and lung cancer) and relapsed refractory HIV-cHL. (Solid Tumor Dose Expansion and cHL Cohorts) III. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, on immune function (HIV viral load in plasma using conventional HIV assay, CD4+, and CD8+ cells). (Solid Tumor Dose Expansion and cHL Cohorts)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Understand the immune response to agent in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART), of altered immune function, and repertoire due to prior HIV infection.\n\nIa. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, on intratumor immune cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) such as PD1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL-1), and others.\n\nIb. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on circulating cytokine markers by multiplex assay, such as: interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL2R)-alpha, sCD27, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)1, and sTNFR2.\n\nII. To understand the response of human tumor viruses (human papillomavirus \\[HPV\\], Epstein-Barr virus \\[EBV\\], Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus \\[KSHV\\]) to agent.\n\nIIa. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on herpesvirus loads (EBV, KSHV, cytomegalovirus \\[CMV\\]) in plasma.\n\nIIb. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on latent herpesvirus (EBV, KSHV, CMV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\n\nIIc. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on herpesvirus specific CD8 and CD4 T cells in PBMC.\n\nIId. In cases of Kaposi sarcoma, to evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on viral transcription in tumor biopsies.\n\nIIe. In cases of anal cancer, to evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on HPV types in anal swabs, when feasible.\n\nIII. Understand the response of HIV to agent. IIIa. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on latent HIV loads in PBMC using outgrowth assay.\n\nIIIb. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on HIV reactive T cells.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nivolumab.\n\nPatients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients in dose level 2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of every third cycle of nivolumab, and patients in dose level -2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of every sixth cycle of nivolumab. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 46 cycles of nivolumab (with ipilimumab if receiving dose level 2 or -2) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection throughout the study. Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) during screening and on study. Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy on screening and may undergo it during follow up.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 16 weeks or 112 days (based on 5 half lives)."

cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control); the result must be obtained within 12 weeks prior to enrollment; PPD positive (or Quantiferon assay positive) participants are permitted if prophylaxis has been completed prior to enrollment\n* The effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after the last dose of investigational drug;

same dose level as those with CD4 counts \\> 200/mm\\^3 (Stratum 1), participants in the expansion cohort with CD4 counts \\>= 100/mm\\^3 are permitted; otherwise, the expansion is open to all solid tumor patients except those whose tumors are known not to respond to nivolumab (pancreas, prostate and MSS colon cancer); for the relapsed refractory HIV-cHL cohort, participants with CD4 count \\>= 100/mm\\^3 are permitted\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have received any other investigational agents within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment; concurrent radiation therapy is not permitted, except palliative (limited-field) radiation therapy, if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n  * Repeat imaging demonstrates no new sites of bone metastases\n  * The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion\n* Participants with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases must be excluded unless they qualify for enrollment as described below because of poor prognosis and concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; participants with brain metastases are permitted if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks or more after treatment is complete and within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ipilimumab, nivolumab, or other agents used in study, or history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody\n* Participants should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids

non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted; use of anabolic steroids is permitted\n* Participants with clinical or radiographic evidence of pancreatitis are excluded\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Participants should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways; prior immune modulating therapy including vaccines may be eligible; prior immune events must be evaluated and the risk for new events which may represent continued sub clinical disease or a new process at previously damaged site or immune potentiation (e.g. ipilimumab followed by IL2 causing bowel perforation, ipilimumab followed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase \\[IDO\\] inhibitor resulting in clinical hypophysitis); please keep in mind that inflammatory events may occur weeks to months following the last dose of ipilimumab and possibly nivolumab; assessment of potential effects of prior therapy should include:\n\n  * Immune status\n  * Organ damage\n  * Risk of autoimmunity\n  * Immunopotentiation\n* The participant has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) =\\< grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except =\\< grade 2 alopecia, neuropathy, and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs)\n* The participant has a primary brain tumor\n* Participant has \\>= grade 2 diarrhea (participants with grade 1 diarrhea are eligible provided stool for ova/parasites and stool cryptosporidium studies are negative)\n* Opportunistic infection within the last 3 months\n* Participants with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded; these include but are not limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and participants with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease; participants with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible; participants with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and participants with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible; participants are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event)\n* Participants who have had evidence of Clostridium (C.) difficile infection, active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, intra-abdominal abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis, which are known risk factors for bowel perforation, should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before coming on study\n* cHL COHORT ONLY: history of allogeneic transplant",
