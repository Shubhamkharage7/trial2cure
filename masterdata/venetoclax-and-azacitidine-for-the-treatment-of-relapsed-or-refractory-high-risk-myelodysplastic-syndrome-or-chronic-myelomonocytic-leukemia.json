            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given together with azacitidine and to see how well it works in treating patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving venetoclax and azacitidine together may help to control myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability (phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (phase 2) of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with bone marrow excess blasts \\> 5% that are relapsed/refractory to prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Rate of complete remission (CR). II. Rate of marrow/morphologic complete remission (mCR). III. Rate of hematologic improvement (HI; erythroid/platelet/neutrophil responses).\n\nIV. Rate of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence. V. Rate of platelet (PLT) transfusion independence. VI. Rate of cytogenetic response. VII. Rate of bone marrow blast response. VIII. Time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IX. Duration of response (DOR). X. Overall survival (OS). XI. Progression-free survival (PFS). XII. Time to next MDS treatment (TTNT). XIII. Event-free survival (EFS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate the effects of therapy on MDS and to identify biological markers of response to venetoclax and/or its combination with azacitidine.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-14 and azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 4-8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every 3-6 months for up to 5 years."
