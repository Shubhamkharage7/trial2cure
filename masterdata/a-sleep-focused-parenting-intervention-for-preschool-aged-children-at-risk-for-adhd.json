            "detailedDescription": "Sleep problems may be one mechanism through which young children may be at risk for developing ADHD, although first line ADHD interventions, including parent behavioral interventions (PBIs), do not address sleep. Investigators will test a modified version of a PBI to target sleep disrupting behaviors for children 3-5 years old at elevated risk for ADHD. The intervention will be delivered by behavioral health therapists embedded in pediatric primary care to increase families' access to intervention. This pilot effectiveness trial is the first step towards developing an early intervention targeting sleep as a mechanism to reduce the prevalence, symptoms, and impairments associated with childhood ADHD."
