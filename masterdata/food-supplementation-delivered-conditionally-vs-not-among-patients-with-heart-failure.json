            "briefSummary": "The current study proposes to investigate if the provision of healthy food can improve outcomes following discharge after HF hospitalization. To investigate this in an efficient and pragmatic manner, a 2x2 factorial randomized control trial design will be utilized to simultaneously investigate two separate, important food-related questions:\n\n* Does the provision of 90 days of either medically-tailored meals or fresh produce boxes improve 90-day patient outcomes among those with HF relative to a control group not receiving food supplements and instead receiving an equivalent monetary supplement?\n* Does receipt of the supplement in a conditional fashion, where the supplement is continued only if the participant attends follow-up visits or fills prescribed medications at the pharmacy, have more impact than providing unconditional supplementation?",
            "detailedDescription": "Eating a nutritious diet is important for maintaining health. However, getting healthy foods can be a challenge for many individuals whose food shopping is limited by finances, location, or physical limitations from pre-existing health problems. For such in-need individuals, providing supplemental healthy meals can improve their diet and potentially improve their health outcomes. Additionally, getting food supplements can also be a powerful incentive to encourage healthy behaviors.\n\nIndividuals with heart failure (HF) present a unique population to assess the value of food supplementation both for its nutritional value and as a health engagement incentive. HF is a common, high-cost public health problem in the United States. Hospitalizations for HF are associated with high rates of mortality, readmission, worsened quality of life, and burgeoning healthcare expenditures. During the post-discharge period, patients are exceptionally vulnerable to a wide variety of adverse health events due to multi-system physiologic impairments. Roughly 20% of all patients with Medicare are readmitted within 30 days, and many are readmitted for different causes than the principal diagnosis of the index admission. While multifactorial, frequent contributing causes of HF readmission include dietary indiscretion, failure to take medications, and failure to follow up with healthcare providers.\n\nPrior studies demonstrate that patients with HF often have food insecurity and non-ideal diets. Nationally, food insecurity among those patients with cardiovascular diseases has increased. Those with HF specifically had some of the highest rates of food insecurity, and the prevalence of food insecurity rose from 11.3% in 1999-2000 to 45.3% in 2017-2018.\n\nStudies have also investigated whether providing food supplements to patients with HF can potentially also improve health outcomes. In a recent cohort study, Medicare Advantage patients with acute heart failure (HF) were given up to 4 weeks of post-hospitalization home-delivered meals. Compared with historical controls, those receiving these meals were significantly less likely to have all-cause readmission and death. In contrast, a recent randomized clinical trial found that providing 10 weeks of medically tailored meals to patients with chronic diseases hospitalized during the COVID-19 pandemic did not lead to reductions in risk of 90-day readmission. However, in an exploratory sub-analysis, patients with HF who had the medically tailored meal intervention had significant reductions in readmissions. While these data are supportive of the hypothesis, they are not definitive, and a prospective randomized trial among patients with HF is needed to rigorously support the efficacy of food support in the post-discharge period to reduce readmission. There is also limited information on the type and means of food supplementation may affect its efficacy.\n\nBased on this background, the current study proposes to investigate if the provision of healthy food can improve outcomes following discharge after HF hospitalization. To investigate this in an efficient and pragmatic manner, a 2 x2 factorial randomized control trial design will be used that will simultaneously investigate two separate important food-related questions. The first factorial design question will evaluate the direct impact of two nutritional supplementation strategies on HF rehospitalizations. Specifically, those hospitalized for HF will be randomized at hospital discharge to either 90 days of healthy medically tailored full meals (MTM) (n=50) or 90 days of a weekly fresh produce box (n=50) or to a control arm (usual care receiving no food supplements) (N=50).\n\nThe second factorial intervention will determine whether food supplements can be used as an incentive to increase patient engagement in their own care (i.e., attending a follow-up clinic visit and filling their prescriptions). Specifically, participants receiving food supplementation will be randomized 1:1 to receive their food supplements (MTMs or produce box) in an unconditional or conditional fashion based on the participant successfully attending their visit and filling their medication."
