            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to treat an infection with a cell-based immunotherapy (therapy that uses the patient's own immune system to treat the infection). This treatment is called adoptive T cell therapy. Another purpose is to learn about the side effects and toxicities of adoptive T cell therapy.\n\nAdoptive T cell therapy is an investigational (experimental) therapy that works by using the blood of a donor that has immunity against the virus. The donor cells are collected and then the cells, called T cells, that are capable of defending against the virus are selected out. These selected T cells are then infused back into the patient, to try to give the immune system the ability to fight the infection. Adoptive T cell therapy is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

A safety period between cohorts of 30 days (between treatment of the last subject of one cohort and the first subject of the subsequent cohort).\n\nStudy Design: Staggered enrollment of patients with an observation period of 30 days after infusion. Safety monitoring points planned after patient No. 5 and No. 11"
