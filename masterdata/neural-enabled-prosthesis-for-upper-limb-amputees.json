It is intended to provide the sense of touch, grasp force and hand opening to the user by sending electrical stimulation pulses to electrodes implanted in nerve fascicles in the upper arm of the residual limb. The system uses measurements from sensors in the prosthetic hand and wireless communication to the implanted neurostimulator to adjust the pulses continuously so that the user gets sensation as tasks are performed with the prosthesis."
