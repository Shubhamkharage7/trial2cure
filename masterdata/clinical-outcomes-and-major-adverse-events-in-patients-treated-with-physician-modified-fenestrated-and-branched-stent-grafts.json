(ie. Ventral hernia repairs)\n* Prior radiation therapy targeting abdomen and/or pelvis\n* History of intraabdominal sepsis. (ie.

Participation in investigational device trials not encompassed by the IDE protocol should be performed remotely from the fenestrated procedure (\\>30 days). Examples include remote (\\>30 days) participation in a thoracic, abdominal, or iliac branch device trial, or participation in a percutaneous aortic valve trial. Participation in medical therapy trial or advanced imaging trial designed to improve peri-operative outcomes or to reduce radiation exposure of fenestrated-branched endografts may be concurrent with the IDE study. Examples include therapy directed to reduce rates of spinal cord injury, stroke and contrast-induced nephropathy associated with implantation of fenestrated-branched stent-grafts or advanced imaging trials designed to reduce radiation exposure during repair.\n\nMedical Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known sensitivities or allergies to stainless steel, nitinol, polyester, solder (tin, silver), polypropylene, PTFE, urethane, or gold.\n* History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.\n* Uncorrectable coagulopathy.\n* Mycotic aneurysm or patients with evidence of active systemic infection.\n* History of connective tissue disorder (e.g vascular Ehlers Danlos, Marfan's syndrome), except for those patients who had prior open surgical aortic replacement, where a surgical graft would serve as landing zone for the investigational stent-graft, those who are deemed prohibitive risk for open surgical repair or connective tissue disorders with no effect of vascular system (e.g non-vascular Ehlers Danlos).\n* Body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta and its branches.\n\nAnatomic Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Inadequate femoral or iliac access compatible with the required delivery systems.\n* Inability to perform a temporary or permanent open surgical or endovascular iliac conduit for patients with inadequate femoral/iliac access.\n* Absence of a non-aneurysmal aortic segment in the distal thoracic aorta above the diaphragmatic hiatus with:\n\n  * A diameter measured outer wall to outer wall of no greater than 42mm and no less than 21 mm;\n  * Parallel aortic wall with \\<20% diameter change and without significant calcification and/or thrombus in the selected area of seal zone\n* Visceral vessel anatomy not compatible with fenestrated/branched stent graft visceral vessel incorporation due to excessive occlusive disease or small size not amenable to stent graft placement\n* Unsuitable distal iliac artery fixation site and anatomy for iliac limb extension or iliac branch device as per devices' instructions for use (IFU)",
