            "detailedDescription": "The network will create a large-scale clinicogenomics dataset, which will support research to discover molecular and genetic determinants of disease risk, disease progression, treatment response, health economic outcomes, social or behavioral determinants of health, targets for therapeutic intervention, risk stratification, clinical implementation, and other clinical indicators of interest. This clinicogenomics dataset will be used to reveal molecular and/or genetic factors that could improve the diagnosis or medical treatment of individual participants and includes a process to share individual results with participants. Participants will also receive annual reports on study outcomes and the impact of HRN, as such information becomes available.\n\nInstitutional membership in HRN will consist of Helix and member healthcare systems (herein referred to as \"HRN Member Site(s)\"). The Helix Research Network is a multi-center research program that will enroll an unlimited number of participants. Participants will be recruited concurrently from HRN Member Sites. In some cases, HRN Member Sites may recruit participants from multiple clinical sites. Participants who meet the enrollment criteria established in this protocol will be enrolled if they or their legally authorized representative(s) provide informed consent in accordance with all applicable regulations and sIRB requirements. Participants will be enrolled until withdrawal from the study or end of the study. Participants may be recruited at any point during the study period, until the recruitment goals established by the protocol are met."

It is possible that participants may receive actionable health information as a result of analysis of their DNA information. This means that the participant's genetic results may be used by their healthcare providers to inform medical decisions. It is also possible that novel discoveries may be generated from the research that could positively impact a participant's healthcare in the future.",
