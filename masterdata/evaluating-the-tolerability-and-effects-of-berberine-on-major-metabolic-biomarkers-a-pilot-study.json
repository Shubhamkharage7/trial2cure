            "briefSummary": "Berberine is a dietary supplement that comes from the roots, stems, and bark of various plants and has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. It may help lower cholesterol, lower blood sugar, and reduce inflammation.Very few studies have been done in the United States to show how berberine effects cholesterol and blood sugar. This study is looking to see how berberine changes cholesterol and blood sugar, and to see how well it is tolerated.Berberine is not a prescription medication but it appears to have similar actions to common prescription medications to lower cholesterol like statins, and to lower blood sugar like metformin. We are studying berberine to see if it may be a good option for people that do not want to take prescription medications."
