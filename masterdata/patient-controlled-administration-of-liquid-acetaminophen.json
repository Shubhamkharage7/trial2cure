            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this prospective pilot study is to determine the feasibility of patient-controlled administration of liquid oral acetaminophen using recruitment rate and adherence to the study protocol rate as surrogate markers. Investigators hypothesize that patients will accept the new concept of self-controlled oral administration of liquid acetaminophen, with more than 50% patient enrollment rate and less than 20% withdrawal rate from the study group to the traditional nurse-administered acetaminophen pills.\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of patient-controlled delivery of oral acetaminophen administration.\n\nIf the medication is spilled or otherwise not dispensed correctly, the patients will be instructed to report this instantly to the nurse. The nurse will document and provide a replacement.\n\nAll study participants have the option to call the nurse for assistance with break through pain. In addition, there is a call button to call for help with any other needs or discomfort.\n\nAll other medications, such as NSAIDs or oral opioids, will be administered as prescribed.\n\nParticipants will have to fill out a paper questionnaire and keep a pain diary, and nurses will have to fill out a questionnaire."
