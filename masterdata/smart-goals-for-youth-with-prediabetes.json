The main question is if participants using the SMART Goal Setting Protocol (SGSP) will have a significant reduction. The participants randomized to the study group will receive the SGSP, consisting of the SMART Goal Selection Guide (SGSG) and Weekly Goal Monitoring Tool (WGMT), in BMI Z-score, A1c, and dyslipidemia in 6 months compared to controls.",
            "detailedDescription": "Implementing a SMART goal-setting protocol for the overweight and obese pediatric population with prediabetes can benefit patients by empowering participants to set their own goals. In addition, utilizing a standardized tool can provide a more focused approach to behavior change between visits and increase a child's sense of self- efficacy and autonomy which may enhance motivation and engagement in the treatment process. This study can add strength to current interventions involving childhood obesity and prediabetes management and may inform the development of a more effective interventions in this population. By providing evidenced-based strategies, this study has the potential to improve the health of children at risk for type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe investigators will recruit 60 participants with newly diagnosed prediabetes to the proposed study.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Children's Diabetes Center at the Cohen Children's Medical Center, Long Island, NY.\n\nParticipants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms. The participants will be stratified by Tanner stage (II and III vs IV and V) and sex (Male vs Female) before randomization.\n\nThe Medical Nutrition therapy (MNT) Protocol and visit frequency will be the same for all of the study participants in both the study and standard of care group in which the Registered Dietician (RD) will reinforce and encourage healthy habits and behaviors In addition successes and barriers to change.\n\nAt the end of each visit, the participants in the standard of care (SOC) group will be asked to provide a summary of topics discussed and what the participants plan to improve on from now and their next visit: responses will be documented in the EMR, and participants will schedule a follow-up visit in 1-4 months.\n\nThe participant randomized in the study group will first receive the SGSG which will highlight 3 domains of SMART goals (exercise, diet, and behavior). Each domain will have 1 predetermined and unchanging primary goal which will serve as the standard for all participants to strive for based on the latest literature recommendations. In addition, each domain will provide a list of examples of SMART goals for participants to choose from. Participants will be asked to independently select and personalize 2-3 SMART goals from this list.\n\nThe Registered Dietitian will identify the patient's perceived challenges in achieving their goal, work collaboratively with the patient to problem-solve and make necessary modifications to the goal to overcome challenges. The provider may suggest scaling back the goal if participant reports that perceived challenges are deemed to be significant or participants may choose to work on new goals or will intensify current goals as necessary at the end of each follow-up. The goal will be recorded in the WGMT for progress evaluation and monitoring. This tool should be returned at follow-up. The WGMT will be documented into the patients' chart and scanned into the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).\n\nThe study will evaluate changes in weight throughout the intervention by measuring participants anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, and BMI. These measurements will be taken at baseline, 1-4 months, and 4-7 months using the Touchbase Electronic medical record system, which will calculate BMI based on CDC growth charts adjusted for age and sex based.\n\nTo assess changes in metabolic parameters, routine laboratory data will be collected based on the discretion of the attending endocrinologist per the standard of care. This will include Hemoglobin A1c, lipid panel and blood pressure. The data will be used to evaluate changes in metabolic health over the course of the study."
