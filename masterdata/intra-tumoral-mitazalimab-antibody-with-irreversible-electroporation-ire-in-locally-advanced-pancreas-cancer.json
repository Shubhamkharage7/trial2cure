            "briefSummary": "This is a phase I study of an agonistic CD40 antibody (mitazalimab) injected intratumorally at the time of surgical IRE in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Intratumoral delivery has potential to be more effective than systemic (intravenous) delivery while decreasing the systemic side effects of immunotherapy. We hypothesize that local delivery of mitazalimab at the time of IRE in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer will be safe, augment the immune effects of IRE, and decrease the risk of recurrence.",
            "detailedDescription": "Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a form of non-thermal ablation (tissue destruction) that is being used to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancers. Locally advanced pancreatic cancers are tumors that have not spread (metastasized to distant locations) but cannot be surgically resected. There is evidence that IRE can help to generate anti-tumor immune responses by releasing tumor antigens in the setting of inflammation. CD40 is an immune receptor that helps to stimulate antigen presentation to the immune system. Preclinical data from the PI's laboratory have shown that combination of IRE with an antibody that stimulates the CD40 receptor improves responses to IRE and inhibits metastatic tumor growth.\n\nThis is a phase I study of an agonistic CD40 antibody (mitazalimab) injected intratumorally at the time of surgical IRE in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Intratumoral delivery has potential to be more effective than systemic (intravenous) delivery while decreasing the systemic side effects of immunotherapy.

We will use an interval 3 + 3 dose escalation design, which allows rapid dose escalation and de-escalation while maintaining good overdose control. The starting intratumoral dose of mitazalimab in the first-in-human study was 22.5 \u00b5g/kg, but no serious adverse events were observed until the third dose level (200 \u00b5g/kg). As such, we conservatively propose to start at the second dose level (75 \u00b5g/kg) with a single dose escalation to 200 \u00b5g/kg, and de-escalation to 25 \u00b5g/kg if dose-limiting toxicities are encountered at 75 \u00b5g/kg.
