            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nA new cancer therapy involves taking white blood cells from a person, growing them in the lab, genetically modifying them, then giving them back to the person. This therapy is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if anti-KRAS G12 V mTCR cells are safe and can shrink tumors.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults at least 18 years old with cancer that has the KRAS G12V molecule on the surface of tumors.\n\nDesign:\n\nIn another protocol, participants will:\n\nBe screened\n\nHave cells harvested and grown\n\nHave leukapheresis\n\nIn this protocol, participants will have the procedures below.\n\nParticipants will be admitted to the hospital.\n\nOver 5 days, participants will get 2 chemotherapy medicines as an infusion via catheter in the upper chest.\n\nA few days later, participants will get the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells via catheter.\n\nFor up to 3 days, participants will get a drug to make the cells active.\n\nA day after getting the cells, participants will get a drug to increase their white blood cell count. This will be a shot or injection under the skin.\n\nParticipants will recover in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. They will have lab and blood tests.\n\nParticipants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.\n\nParticipants will have visits every few months for 2 years, and then as determined by their doctor.\n\nVisits will be 1-2 days. They will include lab tests, imaging studies, and physical exam. Some visits may include leukapheresis or blood drawn.\n\nParticipants will have blood collected over several years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* We generated an HLA-A\\*11:01-restricted murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that specifically recognizes the G12V-mutated variant of KRAS (and other RAS family genes), expressed by many human cancers and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains alpha and beta chains that confer recognition of this antigen when transduced into PBL.\n* In co-cultures with HLA-A\\*11:01+ target cells expressing this mutated oncogene, mTCR transduced T cells lyse target cells and secrete IFN-gamma with high specificity.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary objectives:\n\n* Phase I: Determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12V mTCR in concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2; aldesleukin).\n* Phase II: Determine if anti-KRAS G12V mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of tumors harboring the RAS G12V mutation.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients must be/have:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 72 years\n* HLA-A\\*11:01 positive\n* Metastatic or unresectable RAS G12V-expressing cancer which has progressed after standard therapy (if available).\n\nPatients may not have:\n\n-Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide or fludarabine.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a Phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12V mTCR in HLA-A\\*11:01 positive patients with advanced solid tumors expressing G12V mutated RAS.\n* PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.\n* Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR.\n* All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n* On day 0, patients will receive their PBL transduced with the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR and will then begin high-dose aldesleukin.\n* A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after treatment.\n* The study will be conducted using a phase I/II Simon minimax design, with two separate\n\ncohorts for the Phase II component: Cohort 2a, patients with RAS G12V pancreatic\n\ncancer, and Cohort 2b, patients with RAS G12V non-pancreatic cancer.\n\n-A total of up to 110 patients may be required; approximately 24 patients in the phase I portion of the study and 86 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable per phase II cohort) patients in the phase II portion of the study."
