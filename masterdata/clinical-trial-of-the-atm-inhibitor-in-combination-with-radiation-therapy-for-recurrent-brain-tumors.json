            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test WSD0628 in combination with radiation therapy for recurrent brain tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "High grade gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite aggressive treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, these tumors have a dismal prognosis. Following a radiation therapy, almost 80% of them recur locally. The focus of this project is the development of a radiation sensitizer (a small molecule ATM inhibitor, WSD0628) with the goal to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy. The first step will be to establish a pre-clinical PK\u2192PD\u2192efficacy model to describe WSD0628 plasma and tumor concentrations associated with robust ATM inhibition and radiosensitizing effects. This model will be instrumental in interpreting the pharmacokinetic (PK) data and dosage selection in the proposed first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study in approximately 42 adult patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. The aims of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, PKs and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WSD0628 in combination with radiation therapy. The dose-escalation portion of the study (Part A) will enroll approximately 24 patients and is comprised of Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design with target toxicity rate of 22%-33%. Once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is established, Part B of the study will commence in which an additional 12 patients will be enrolled and treated at the RP2D for further evaluation of safety and efficacy (standard expansion cohort), and an additional 6 patients will have a tissue evaluation of tumor penetrance after a one-time dose of study drug prior to radiosurgery and surgical resection (Phase 0, tumor penetrance cohort). Tumor response will be assessed, using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with assessment based on the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, and safety will include analysis of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory data. Additionally, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), overall survival, progression-free survival, overall response rate, and patient-reported outcomes will be evaluated. The maximum duration of Part A will be 32 months and Part B,12 months. Funding Source - FDA OOPD"
