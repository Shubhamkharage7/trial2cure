This remotely-delivered intervention combining targeted cognitive training exercises and group support was developed to directly impact processing speed, and at the same time, boost motivation and engagement in adolescents at risk for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of a cognitive remediation (CR) program plus group coaching and support designed to improve processing speed and, in turn, social functioning and attenuated positive symptoms in individual considered Clinical High Risk for psychosis. The SCORES (Specific COgnitive REmediation with Support) intervention is a novel Cognitive Remediation program combined with group coaching, performance-based rewards, game-like tasks, and educational elements to increase engagement and retention. The study is funded by a R61/R33 award. In the R61 phase, all participants were asked to complete 40 hours of Cognitive Remediation or brain training (4 hours per week/10 weeks) with a mid-point assessment (at 5 weeks) to determine the training dose needed to impact processing speed as measured by the Matrics Cognitive Consensus Battery. The current R33 (Phase 2) will look to replicate the results of the R61 and assess the specificity of the targeted intervention with the addition of a non-speeded cognitive training group.."

All de-identified data resulting from this NIH-funded award will be submitted to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) according to this timeline, along with appropriate supporting documentation to enable efficient use of the data by other researchers not involved in the study.
