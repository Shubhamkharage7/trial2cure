AU-007 will be administered either as a monotherapy, or in combination with a single loading dose of aldesleukin, or with both AU-007 and aldesleukin given every 2 weeks (Q2w)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a first in human, multicenter, open-label Phase 1-2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy of AU-007 with or without aldesleukin, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cancer. Patients must either be ineligible for or have progressed on prior standard of care therapy. Part 1 consists of 3 escalation Arms, each starting with a single 1+2 escalation cohort followed by 3+3 escalation cohorts to define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study begins in Arm A evaluating escalating doses of AU-007 (Q2w) in sequential escalation cohorts to define RP2D or MTD. In Arm B, AU-007 (Q2w) is evaluated in combination with a single dose of aldesleukin given with the first AU-007 dose. AU-007 is administered at a fixed dose (Q2w) with an escalating single aldesleukin dose in sequential escalation cohorts. In Arm C, AU-007 is evaluated in combination with aldesleukin both given Q2w. AU-007 will be administered at a fixed dose with an escalating dose of aldesleukin in each sequential Arm C escalation cohort. The Part 2-cohort expansion portion of the study consists of up to three expansion Arms evaluating the initial efficacy of the RP2D from corresponding dose escalation Arms A, B, and C in selected solid tumor types, prioritizing melanoma, renal cell cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Other eligible cancers include but are not limited to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial cancer, gastric or gastro-esophageal cancer, and ovarian cancer. Part 3 evaluates the safety of AU-007 in combination with aldesleukin and avelumab, followed by one expansion cohort, in NSCLC."
