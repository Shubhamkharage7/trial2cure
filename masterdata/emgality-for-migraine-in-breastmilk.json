            "briefSummary": "The goal of this project is to evaluate galcanezumab transfer into maternal breastmilk, and to evaluate infant (growth, development, constipation, colic, infections) and maternal (headache) outcomes for dyads in which the mother was treated with galcanezumab and to compare outcomes for infants who were or were not breastfed after maternal treatment.\n\nIn this prospective observational study, the study team proposes to prospectively collect serial milk samples from 30 adult women who are treated with galcanezumab for migraine. Mothers who are interested in participating will be connected with us, the main clinical site, by neurologists across the USA. Mothers must carry a diagnosis of migraine, be aged 18-45 years, and be between 14 days and 9 months postpartum, and still nursing, at the time of enrollment.\n\nThis study will fill a significant unmet need as women of childbearing potential are over-represented in the migraine population, and yet they are excluded from clinical trials of migraine treatments during pregnancy and lactation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Galcanezumab will be prescribed clinically by the treating clinician, i.e., no drug will be provided by the study. This treatment may be prescribed in several clinical scenarios:\n\n* Patient with established migraine history, treated with galcanezumab prior to pregnancy, who plans to resume the medication post partum\n* Patient with established migraine history, who experiences migraines postpartum and who has previously been \"failed by\", or intolerant to, other first-line prophylactic medications\n* Patient with established migraine history, who warrants said treatment trial otherwise, at the discretion of the prescribing clinician\n\nInterested participants will be contacted by our UCSF coordinator, sign an informed consent form, and receive instructions for milk collection. A pamphlet on effective birth control will be provided to all enrollees (https://owh-wh-d9-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/documents/fact-sheet-birth-control-methods.pdf), as well as OCT-available at-home pregnancy tests.\n\nMothers will complete questionnaires relating to their infants, at 6M and 12M postpartum (Ages and Stages, colic, etc.) and will sign a release form for us to obtain and review infant health records up to 12 months post-delivery to calculate: growth, infections, incidence of constipation or infant colic.\n\nMilk collection:\n\nParticipants will pump and provide up to 8 samples (15mL volume each), at specific timepoints over up to 2 treatment cycles (before treatment 1; 24hours, 7d, 28d post treatment 1; 24hours, 7d, 28d post treatment 2 and 7d post treatment 3). Samples will be shipped in an insulated container with gel packs to maintain temperature via FedEx priority overnight shipping to our Laboratory at UCSF and stored in a -80 \u00b0C degrees freezer.\n\nSample assays:\n\nSamples will be batch analyzed using enzyme immunoassay at (1) interim report after 15 sets received and (2) final report after all 30 sets received. The study team has worked with MarinBio who are experts in measuring biologics."
