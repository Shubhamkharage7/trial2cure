            "briefSummary": "Bupivacaine is the most widely used local anesthetic agent across majority of the Cardiac Implantable Electronic device (CIED) implant procedures in the United States. It is hypothesized that the combination of Bupivacaine-Ketorolac-Ketamine (BKK) is more effective in alleviating perioperative and postoperative pain as compared to the use of bupivacaine alone.\n\nA few studies have been done to look for the effectiveness of BKK in abdominal surgical procedures. However, no study has been done to evaluate its efficacy and effectiveness in patients undergoing CIED insertion.",
            "detailedDescription": "Bupivacaine is a widely used local anesthetic and is often administered by spinal injection prior to major surgical procedures. Ketorolac is a potent NSAID which is used for the short-term relief of moderate to severe pain. It's used for long term duration is generally limited due to its potential to cause GI ulcers/perforation and renal failure. A single dose of perioperative Ketorolac has been found to be effective in reducing opioid consumption. Ketamine is NMDA receptor antagonist and is used for its anesthetic, analgesic, and psychotomimetic effects. It is primarily used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia and induces a trance like state providing pain relief, sedation, and amnesia.\n\nAlthough an effective local anesthetic agent, bupivacaine has weak analgesic effect and is used in combination with several analgesic agents for effective perioperative and postoperative analgesia. A common drug used in this analgesic regimen usually includes opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. Over the last few decades the United States has witnessed an opioid epidemic and post-surgical opioid prescription is one of the major contributors of this epidemic. An opioid free combination of Bupivacaine-Ketorolac-Ketamine (BKK) is thought to be effective in alleviating perioperative and postoperative pain."
