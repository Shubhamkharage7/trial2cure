            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept in pediatric participants with \u03b2-thalassemia.\n\nThe study will be conducted in 2 parts for both transfusion-dependent (TD) and non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) \u03b2-thalassemia participants: TD Part A will be in adolescent participants aged 12 to \\<18 years with two dose escalation cohorts, followed by a dose expansion cohort. NTD Part A will be conducted in the same age group participants as TD Part A with dose confirmation and expansion phase. After Part A TD participants have completed at least one year of treatment, all available safety data from Part A adolescent participants will be evaluated before initiating TD and NTD Part B in the age group from 6 to \\<12 years old. Part B will consist of two dose escalation cohorts for TD and two dose escalation cohorts for NTD.\n\nUpon completion of the Treatment Period, participants of any cohort who are benefiting from the study treatment, will be offered the opportunity to continue luspatercept treatment in the Long-term Treatment Period for up to 5 years from their first dose.\n\nParticipants who discontinue study treatment at any time will continue in the Posttreatment Follow-up Period for at least 5 years from their first dose of luspatercept, or 3 years from their last dose, whichever occurs later, or until they withdraw consent/assent, are lost to follow-up, or the End of Trial, whichever occurs first."

Male participants, as appropriate to age and the discretion of the study physician:\n\n   * Must practice true abstinence\\* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use a synthetic or latex condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a Female children of childbearing potential (FCCBP)/FCBP while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 12 weeks (approximately 5 times the mean terminal t1/2 of luspatercept based on multiple-dose PK data) following IP discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy\n\n     * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. \\[Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\\] \\*\\* Agreement to use highly effective methods of contraception that alone or in combination result in a failure rate of a Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly throughout the course of the study. Such methods include: Combined (estrogen and progesterone/progestin containing) hormonal contraception: Oral; Intravaginal; Transdermal; Progestogen/progestin only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: Oral; Injectable hormonal contraception; Implantable hormonal contraception; Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD); Placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); Bilateral tubal occlusion; Vasectomized partner; Sexual Abstinence.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nThe presence of any of the following will exclude a participant from enrollment into the study:\n\n1. Participant has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the participant from participating in the study.\n2.
