            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test how well a new investigational closed loop system manages your blood sugar with the ability to deliver insulin and pramlintide. Pramlintide is a drug that is used with mealtime insulin to control blood sugar in people who have diabetes. It works by slowing down the movement of food through the stomach which prevents blood sugar from rising too high after a meal. The closed loop system will receive glucose values from the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automatically send commands to one Omnipod for insulin and one Omnipod for pramlintide delivery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will undergo two 12.5 hour clinic visits. Participants will complete a training on how to start the Dexcom G6 sensor at home. Participants will start the G6 sensor the day before each study visit. For one visit, the system will use insulin only for managing blood sugar. For the other study, the system will use both insulin and pramlintide. The order of the visits will be randomly chosen. For 3 days before the insulin and pramlintide visit, participants will dose with pramlintide before each meal. During the visits, participants will wear one or two Omnipods to delivery insulin and insulin/pramlintide and a Dexcom G6 CGM. The CGM system will provide sensor glucose data every 5 minutes. Sensor glucose data will be wirelessly transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) from the Dexcom G6 to the smartphone master controller every 5 minutes. The smartphone will communicate via BTLE to an Omnipod for insulin delivery. The closed loop system will receive activity data through a Polar M600 watch worn by the participant. Participants will eat breakfast and lunch in clinic."
