            "detailedDescription": "After being informed about the study and giving consent, participants will enroll in an eight-week program that collects data at enrollment, at the end of the program, and 12 months following the program. Research questions in this study are framed by a descriptive evaluation design to assess whether outcomes improve for low-income fathers who participate in the SAY SDDC FIRE program. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed before and after participants complete core curricula - 24/7 Dads, Healthy Relationships, and Economic Stability workshops (pre to post). Primary outcome measures will indicate whether behaviors improved for healthy family relationships (parent, co-parent, and partner) and economic stability (financial, employment). Secondary outcome measures will indicate whether improvements were made in the attitudes and expectations that facilitate and reflect behavior for healthy partner relationships and financial stability."
