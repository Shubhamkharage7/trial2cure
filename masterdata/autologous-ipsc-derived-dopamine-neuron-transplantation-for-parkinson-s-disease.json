This research study is a single-center Phase 1 clinical trial, which will test the safety of injecting the investigational cell product into the brain of subjects with Parkinson's disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this research study is to test a new treatment for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease that causes people to lose specific brain cells called midbrain dopamine neurons. When these dopamine neurons are lost, it leads to a lack of dopamine in the brain. When there is not enough dopamine, people with Parkinson's disease experience problems with their movement. This trial will test whether new dopamine neurons made from blood cells from subjects with Parkinson's disease are safe when surgically injected into the area of the brain affected (called the putamen) of the same subjects (called autologous transplantation). The trial will assess the safety of the injected cells and will also measure the effects of the transplanted autologous dopamine neurons on Parkinson's disease symptoms."
