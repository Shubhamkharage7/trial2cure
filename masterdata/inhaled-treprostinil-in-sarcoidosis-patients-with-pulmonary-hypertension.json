Inhaled treprostinil has shown clinical improvements in exercise capacity after 12 weeks of therapy in patients with WHO Group 1 pulmonary hypertension. More recently, there has been interest in using inhaled PAH-specific therapies for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease.\n\nThe investigators believe that those patients with pulmonary hypertension in the setting of sarcoidosis-associated interstitial lung disease are a unique population which may potentially benefit from inhaled, targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy (inhaled treprostinil) while minimizing the adverse effects associated with systemic pulmonary vasodilators. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled treprostinil in subjects with sarcoidosis-associated interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension."
