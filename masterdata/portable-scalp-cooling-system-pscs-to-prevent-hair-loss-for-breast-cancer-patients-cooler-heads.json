            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate hair loss as assessed by the investigator at 3 weeks (\u00b11 week) after the completion of the last chemotherapy (CT) treatment/infusion visit using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) by comparing post-treatment photographs to pre-treatment photographs.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess safety of the Amma PSCS based on the occurrence of device-related adverse events, occurrence of scalp changes determined by physical examination, and patient symptoms with use of the PSCS.\n\nII. To evaluate hair loss as measured by the patient at 3 weeks (\u00b11 week) after the completion of the last treatment/infusion visit using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0 or above) by comparing post-treatment photographs to baseline photographs.\n\nIII. To assess tolerability/compliance with use of the PSCS. IV. To assess patient quality of life and satisfaction with hair preservation after Amma PSCS usage using the Body Image Scale (BIS) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) for Breast Cancer (EORTC-QLQ-BR23) questionnaire.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants will use the AMMA PSCS while receiving non-investigational, chemotherapy treatments. Participants may continue device usage through their last cycle of chemotherapy (approximately 6 months) and will be followed for 30 days after the last device usage date, until removal from study, or until death, whichever occurs first."
