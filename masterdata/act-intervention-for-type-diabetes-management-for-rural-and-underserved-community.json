            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this project is to examine the feasibility/acceptability of a one-day Acceptance and Commitment Therapy + Lifestyle Education group intervention paired with 12-weeks of Continuous Glucose Monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) living in rural communities. This study is being designed as a randomized control trial (RCT) comparing ACT+LE+CGM to LE+CGM to LE. The ultimate goal of this line of research is that a community-wide intervention of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) with Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and Lifestyle Education (LE) will improve T2D outcomes in rural communities compared to CGM and LE, or LE alone. Our goal is to develop a scalable and sustainable program for diabetes management in rural areas that enables individual self-management and does not require extensive healthcare resources in an existing medical desert.",
            "detailedDescription": "ADA guidelines highlight the essential role of nutrition therapy and/or diabetes self-management education (DSME) programs in diabetes management. A recent NHANES analysis which included 2365 people with diabetes indicated that only 32% are considered in good control of diabetes (HbA1c 6.5-6.9%). In the rural community at higher risk of diabetes, conventional lifestyle intervention approaches to diabetes management (e.g., Look AHEAD) or prevention, are not sustainable as they are resource intense. In medical deserts such as rural areas, there is a need for alternative strategies. To add, a mechanism that can impact lack of behavioral adherence is experiential avoidance. Experiential avoidance describes avoiding or escaping behaviors that cause B. distress, anxiety, shame, guilt, pain, and others. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) targets experiential avoidance, which many believe prevents engagement in health behavior change. ACT has demonstrated efficacy in numerous psychological and biomedical diseases, including depression and anxiety, migraines, chronic pain, inflammatory bowel disease, weight loss, and T2D. ACT helps patients to overcome avoidance of health behaviors by promoting acceptance of negative feelings and thoughts and by encouraging them to engage in behaviors that align well with their values. Although dietary data suggest people with diabetes may be making self-perceived positive dietary changes, experiential avoidance likely prohibits sustained food behavior change and better self-management.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to examine the feasibility/acceptability of a one-day Acceptance and Commitment Therapy + Lifestyle Education group intervention paired with 12-weeks of Continuous Glucose Monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) living in rural communities. This study is being designed as a randomized control trial (RCT) comparing ACT+LE+CGM to LE+CGM to LE. The ultimate goal of this line of research is that a community-wide intervention of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) with Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and Lifestyle Education (LE) will improve T2D outcomes in rural communities compared to CGM and LE, or LE alone. Our goal is to develop a scalable and sustainable program for diabetes management in rural areas that enables individual self-management and does not require extensive healthcare resources in an existing medical desert.\n\nSpecific aims:\n\nAim 1: To implement and adapt (to include CGM monitoring) an abbreviated (one day session) ACT protocol for T2D8 that we can administer at the group level to rural individuals. By the end of the one-day workshop, participants should understand how to use acceptance skills (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive defusion from negative thoughts) to engage in committed action towards T2D management and adherence. Two clinical psychologists, with input from the multidisciplinary team, will adapt the protocol and participant worksheets from existing brief ACT interventions for T2D.\n\nAim 2: To conduct a pilot single-blind randomized control trial of an adapted ACT for T2D, in combination with CGM and LE, to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of this protocol at a among in rural individuals. Therefore, this study will compare the efficacy of ACT+CGM+LE to CGM+LE, or LE alone, on hemoglobin HbA1c in 60 people with T2D recruited from a rural population."
