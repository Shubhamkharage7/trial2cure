Participants will then complete semi-structured individual interviews to provide feedback about barriers to and facilitators of intervention adherence. Results of Part 1 will inform the design and delivery of the candidate components in Part 2.\n\nIn Part 2, a 2\\^3 full factorial design will be followed to randomize 80 gynecologic cancer survivors to one of eight six-week intervention conditions reflecting all possible combinations of the three candidate intervention components."
