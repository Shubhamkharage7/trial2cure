Optimal placement of the implants will be verified cystoscopically. On average, 4-6 UroLift System implants are typically implanted but more or less can be placed per provided discretion, up to a maximum of 10 implants per manufacturer specifications.\n\nGiven that patients will also undergo UroLift System placement, patients will be offered to undergo UroLift System, fiducial marker placement and rectal gel spacer placement in one single procedure, under general anesthesia.\n\nSAbR will be performed following placement of UroLift System, prostate fiducials, rectal spacer, and MR/CT simulation, using stereotactic immobilization/localization, rectal enema, prophylactic medication support (tamsulosin, dexamethasone unless contraindicated), bladder filling protocol, and appropriate imaging verification."
