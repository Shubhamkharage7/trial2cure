Given that the Keen2 is anticipated to increase awareness of pulling behavior (but not necessarily change pulling behavior), the investigators hypothesize that the Keen 2 will increase awareness of pulling behaviors and reduce automatic pulling behavior. The investigators will explore reductions in overall hair pulling severity and related psychiatric symptoms.",
            "detailedDescription": "Novel technologies present one solution to help identify and reduce automatic pulling behaviors associated with trichotillomania (TTM). The Keen 2 is one such novel technology, which is a bracelet which gives the user alerts in the form of a vibration when the user is engaging in hair pulling behavior. Thus, using the Keen 2 could positively increase the awareness of automatic pulling behaviors, which is largely unaffected by existing evidence-based treatments like HRT. This information would be advantageous for the scientific community to determine the possible benefit of this approach to help individuals with TTM.\n\nThis project will examine the effect using the Keen 2 on hair pulling styles (automatic and focused), the severity of hair pulling behaviors, and related psychiatric symptoms.

The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4, with a total score derived from the summation of all 7-items (range: 0 to 28). Higher total scores are indicative of greater hair pulling severity. The MGH-HPS exhibited good internal consistency with strong test-retest reliability between 2 and 4 weeks. Convergent validity for the MGH-HPS received support from significant correlations within measurement type. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by non-significant correlations with ratings of depression. The MGH-HPS has been used as a treatment outcome measure and appears to be sensitive to behavioral and pharmacological treatments in a sample that included both youth and adults (McGuire et al., 2012).",
