            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of using a new treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells against the CSPG4 antigen (iC9.CAR-CSPG4 T cells) in patients with head and neck cancer that came back after receiving standard therapy for this cancer. The iC9.CAR-CSPG4 treatment is experimental and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nHow many (dose) of the iC9.CAR. CSPG4 T cells are safe to use in patients without causing too many side effects, and what is the maximum dose that could be tolerated will be investigated. The information collected from the study would help cancer patients in the future.\n\nThere are two parts to this study. In part 1, blood will be collected to prepare the iC9.CAR-CSPG4 T cells. Disease fighting T cells will be isolated and modified to prepare the iC9.CAR-CSPG4 T cells. In part 2, the iC9.CAR-CSPG4 T cells are given by infusion after completion of lymphodepletion chemotherapy.\n\nThe data from the dose escalation will be used to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), which will be decided based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Additionally, recommended phase 2 dose will be tested.\n\nEligible subjects will receive lymphodepletion chemotherapy standard followed by infusion of iC9-CAR.CSPG4 T cells. After treatment completion or discontinuation, subjects will be followed since involving gene transfer experiments."
