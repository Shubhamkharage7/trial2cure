Urine samples will be tested using mass-spectroscopy-based techniques. A 'total toxicity score' will be calculated based on the urine analysis of toxins. A 'symptoms score' will be determined using the 'Symptom History' form which will be used to assess the patient's GI conditions. Additionally, a 'diagnosis score' will be calculated from the diagnosis generated in the electronic medical record (EMR). The determined 'total toxicity score' will be correlated with the 'symptoms score' and the 'diagnosis score.' The observations from this study will help us understand the potential effect of environmental toxins, heavy metals, PFAS and mycotoxins on GI and overall health."
