            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates how well ZEN-3694, enzalutamide, and pembrolizumab work in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). ZEN-3694 blocks the expression of the MYC gene to prevent cellular growth in certain types of tumors, including castrate resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide has been shown to block testosterone from reaching prostate cancer cells by binding to a receptor on prostate cancer cells, called androgen receptors. This works similar to a lock and key. When enzalutamide (key) inserts into the androgen receptor (lock) testosterone cannot attach to the androgen receptor, which slows the growth of tumor cells and may cause them to shrink. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody (proteins that can protect the body from foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses) designed to block a specific control switch which may be activated by tumor cells to overcome the body's natural immune system defenses. It also enhances the activity of the body's immune cells against tumor cells. The purpose of this study is to find out the effects ZEN-3694, enzalutamide, and pembrolizumab on patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have previously experienced disease progression.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had prior disease progression on at least one second generation androgen signaling inhibitor, including abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, and/or enzalutamide and have clinicogenomic evidence of transdifferentiated mCRPC (Cohort A) or mCRPC without transdifferentiation (Cohort B). Prior to enrollment in Phase 2 (Cohort A and B), a safety lead-in cohort of 6 patients with metastatic CRPC will be enrolled. Accrual will proceed to Phase 2 if \\< 33% of patients (0/6 or 1/6 patients) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity during Cycle 1.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-21. Patients not on enzalutamide prior to study enrollment or have previously discontinued enzalutamide receive BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 beginning on day 1 of cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 90 days until death or study completion or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the composite response rate in Cohort A and Cohort B study population.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate and median duration of response in each study cohort.\n\nII. To determine the median progression free survival and 6-month progression-free survival rate.\n\nIII. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 50 (PSA50) response proportion in each study cohort.\n\nIV. To determine the median overall survival of each cohort. V. To determine the safety of the treatment combination.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the association between baseline metastatic tumor characteristics including treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (t-SCNC), androgen receptor (AR), retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) loss, and immune response transcriptional signatures with clinical outcomes.\n\nII. To evaluate modulation of AR transcriptional activity, expression of t-SCNC markers, and immune parameters including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression in evaluable paired tumor biopsies.\n\nIII. To evaluate the association between baseline and change from baseline in peripheral blood biomarkers including T cell subsets, T cell repertoire, and inhibitors of bromodomain extraterminal protein (BETi) whole blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) panel with clinical outcomes.\n\nIV. To evaluate the association between baseline or change from baseline in gallium Ga 68 citrate (68Ga-citrate) positron emission tomography (PET) with subsequent clinical outcomes.\n\nV. To compare efficacy outcomes (composite response, PSA50 response, objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)) between cohorts."

Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it\n13. Patients must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 60 days after last administration of study treatment. Adequate contraception includes:\n\n    1. Patients who are sexually active should consider their female partner to be of childbearing potential if she has experienced menarche and is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea \\> 24 consecutive months) or has not undergone successful surgical sterilization. Even women who use contraceptive hormones (oral, implanted, or injected), an intrauterine device, or barrier methods (diaphragms, condoms, spermicide) should be considered to be of childbearing potential\n    2. Patients who have undergone vasectomy themselves should also be considered to be of childbearing potential\n    3. Acceptable methods of contraception include continuous total abstinence, or double-barrier method of birth control (e.g. condoms used with spermicide, or condoms used with oral contraceptives). Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n14. Patients must be willing to undergo metastatic tumor biopsy during screening. If no metastatic lesion is safely accessible to tumor biopsy, this requirement will be waived. Bone or soft tissue lesion is allowed, but soft tissue will be prioritized. If a patient has archival tissue obtained within 90 days of C1D1 the requirement for fresh tumor biopsy will be waived\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Has participated in a study of an investigational product and received study treatment or used an investigational device other than those specified in the protocol within 2 weeks of C1D1\n2. Hypersensitivity to ZEN-3694, pembrolizumab, enzalutamide, or any of its excipients\n3. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of C1D1. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (=\\< 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease\n4. Receipt of prior pembrolizumab or another immune checkpoint inhibitor (e.g. nivolumab, ipilimumab). Prior treatment with sipuleucel-T is allowed\n5.

Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Patients on low dose oral weekly methotrexate are allowed. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) or treatment with drugs (e.g. methimazole, neomercazol, carbamazole, etc.) that function to decrease the generation of thyroid hormone by a hyper-functioning thyroid gland (e.g., in Graves' disease) is not considered a form of systemic treatment of an autoimmune disease\n9.

Chronic active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection defined as positive viral load (screening not required in the absence of risk factors)\n16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/ interstitial lung disease\n17. Has an active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics within 7 days prior to C1D1\n18. Use of a prohibited concomitant medication within 7 days of C1D1\n19. Major surgery within 28 days prior to C1D1. Minor procedures including biopsies, dental surgery, cataract surgery, or outpatient procedure are allowed\n20.
