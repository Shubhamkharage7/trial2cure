            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn whether a superficial cervical plexus block improves quality of recovery after thyroid surgery. Investigators will compare a superficial cervical plexus block with bupivacaine compared to an identical procedure performed saline placebo to see if there is a difference in quality of recovery on the first postoperative day.\n\nThe main question to answer is:\n\n\u2022 Does a superficial cervical plexus block with bupivacaine compared to placebo improve quality of recovery in patients having thyroid surgery.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Fill out an initial preoperative survey\n* Be randomized to receive a superficial cervical plexus block with bupivacaine or saline placebo while under anesthesia before the surgery starts\n* Fill out a survey about recovery on the first day after surgery",
            "detailedDescription": "Thyroid surgery is associated with mild to moderate post-operative pain, with most patients requiring opioid pain medicine postoperatively. Nerve blocks, such as the superficial cervical plexus block, are an important component of pain control plans. Superficial cervical plexus blocks have been proven to decrease pain and reduce the need for opioid medications in thyroid surgery. However, previous studies were performed before it became common practice to administer a combination of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids for thyroid surgery which also help with pain. Whether the superficial cervical plexus block improves pain control and quality of recovery in this context is unknown. This study aims to determine whether the superficial cervical plexus block has an impact on quality of recovery as measured by a survey called the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40)."

Possible responses range from 1 = 'none of the time' to 5 = 'all of the time'. For negative items, the Likert scale is reversed. The individual scores are summed for the total score which can range from 40 points to 200 points. A higher score indicates better post-operative quality of recovery.\n\nParticipants will be sent an electronic link to the survey via their email. They will complete the surveys privately from their own electronic devices.\n\nInvestigators will then compare the changes in pre-operative vs POD 1 QoR-40 scores between the two groups.",
