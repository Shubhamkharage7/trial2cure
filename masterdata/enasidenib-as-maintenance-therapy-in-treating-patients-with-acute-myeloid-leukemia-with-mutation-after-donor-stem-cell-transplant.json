Enasidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of enasidenib mesylate as maintenance therapy in post hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess overall and leukemia free survival in patients post allogeneic HCT. II. Estimate relapse incidence, non-relapse mortality, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and relapse free survival (GRFS) in patients receiving enasidenib mesylate maintenance therapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Monitor disease status among subset of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) positive disease when starting to receive enasidenib mesylate by multiparameter flow cytometry post allogeneic HCT on patients bone marrow (BM) on days +100 and +365.\n\nII. Investigate clearance of IDH2 mutation post HCT by next generation sequencing-polymerase chain reaction (NGS-PCR) testing on the bone marrow specimens on days +100 and +365 and in peripheral blood every 3 months till 2 year follow up.\n\nIII. Investigate mIDH2 variant allele fraction (VAF) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) BEAMing technology on bone marrow specimens on days +100 and +365.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and periodically thereafter up to 2 years."
