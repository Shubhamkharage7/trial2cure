The study treatment will be delivered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravitreal (IVT) injection on the same day. Each participant will be followed for safety and efficacy for 5 years after treatment. Efficacy assessments in this study will evaluate motor, language, visual and cognitive function."
