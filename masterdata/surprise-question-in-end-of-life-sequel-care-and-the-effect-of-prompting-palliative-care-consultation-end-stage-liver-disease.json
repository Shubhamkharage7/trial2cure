            "briefSummary": "This is a single center randomized platform trial determining whether prompting consideration of palliative care consultation through the electronic health record impacts the number of palliative consultations placed and hospital-free days among hospitalized adults with End-Stage Liver Disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Palliative care is specialized medical care focused on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of serious illness, regardless of diagnosis, by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the patient's family. Palliative care is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness. It may be provided together with curative treatment, and includes intensive focus on symptom and pain management, psychosocial and spiritual support, and assistance in advance care planning.\n\nThere is potential benefit to introducing palliative care earlier in the course of illness for patients with chronic liver disease. For some patients with cirrhosis, palliative care has been shown to improve physical and emotional symptoms. In a recent observational study, it was found that for patients with End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) on the waiting list for liver transplant, an early palliative care intervention counteracted the progression of worsening symptoms and significantly improved pruritus, appetite, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and well-being. Moreover, the introduction of palliative care within the care course of patients with decompensated cirrhosis is endorsed by an AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) practice guidance document.\n\nDespite the available evidence regarding the potential benefits of specialized palliative care across multiple serious illnesses, the incorporation of palliative care consultation into clinical practice in many settings is inconsistent and often too late in the clinical trajectory. In an effort to introduce palliative care sooner and more consistently into patients' care pathways, the study team will explore an interruptive provider nudge to prompt palliative care consideration in ESLD. This integrated approach will also help bridge the knowledge gap as to whether systematically prompting palliative care consultation can improve referral rates and outcomes for patients with ESLD.\n\nThe processes used to 1) identify hospitalized patients with ESLD, 2) query a provider about their status, and 3) prompt consideration of palliative care consultation are amenable to conduct through the electronic health record. Step 1 will employ phenotyping of clinical and admission characteristics readily extractable from the medical record. Step 2 will utilize the \"Surprise Question\" as a screening tool for identification of potentially unmet palliative care needs. In previous studies of serious illness, patients for whom consideration of palliative care consultation might be appropriate have used the \"Surprise Question\", which asks the treating clinician \"would you be surprised if this patient died in the next 12 months?\" Step 3 will harness the capability to prompt a provider to consider appropriately indicated, complementary, supportive care that may be otherwise underutilized while managing the patient's immediate health crisis.\n\nGiven the preliminary evidence that specialist palliative care may improve the quality and quantity of time spent alive and outside of the hospital for patients with serious illness and the incomplete implementation of specialty palliative care in current clinical practice, the study team will evaluate the effect of prompting consideration of palliative care consultation in the electronic health record on provider referral rates to the palliative care service and hospital-free days among hospitalized patients with ESLD."
