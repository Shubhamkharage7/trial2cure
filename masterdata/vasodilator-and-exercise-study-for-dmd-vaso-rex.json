            "briefSummary": "Examining two strategies as potential adjuvant therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); aerobic exercise training (to induce adaptations in skeletal muscle and improve cardiovascular health) and tadalafil, an FDA-approved vasodilator (to optimize blood flow and muscle perfusion which is impaired and often overlooked in DMD). Target: improved muscle function, vascular health, and DMD treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by rapid muscle deterioration, mitochondrial and vascular impairments, resulting in premature loss of ambulation and mortality. Disease-modifying therapeutics are emerging and although they are expected to improve muscle function and daily activity in boys with DMD, most are not designed to correct the vascular impairment. This impairment is due to the lack of restoration of neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling, which is crucial for vasodilation during and after exercise. The investigators believe limitations in study design were responsible for the lack of efficacy. Therefore, this study combines tadalafil with aerobic exercise to necessitate increased blood flow and activate the drug.\n\nThis Exploratory Clinical Trial will assess two potential adjuvant therapies for ambulatory boys with DMD (6 years and older): 1) aerobic exercise training and 2) tadalafil, an FDA-approved vasodilator drug. Preclinical and clinical data, including recent findings from the principal investigator's lab, support the use of these strategies and their potential to benefit muscle perfusion, fatigue, and quality of life.\n\nThe study will first test for drug responsiveness (increase in muscle oxygenation) after a single dose. Drug-responsive boys with DMD will be randomized to a 6-month intervention of daily tadalafil or placebo, combined with structured cycle exercise training. Participants will receive exercise-related equipment for use at home and be monitored by the research team via video. The study will quantify the intervention's impact on vascular impairment, muscle pathophysiology (inflammation, fat accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction), exertional fatigue, and cycling performance.\n\nOur findings are expected to yield:\n\n1. Criteria to identify DMD patients most likely to benefit from tadalafil as adjuvant therapy.\n2. Evidence of a powerful synergy between drug impact and exercise training in DMD."
