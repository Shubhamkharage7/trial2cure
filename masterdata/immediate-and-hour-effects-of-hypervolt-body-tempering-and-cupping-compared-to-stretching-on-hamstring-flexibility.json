            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the HyperVolt percussive massage device, body tempering, and dry cupping to static stretching of the hamstrings of healthy adults aged 18-39 years on the active knee extension and back saver sit-and-reach test.While these modalities are frequently used in healthcare settings there is a paucity of research regarding effectiveness. If the effects on flexibility are comparable, patients could save time and money by performing static stretching.",
            "detailedDescription": "Our study aims to compare the effects of the HyperVolt percussive massage device (HyperVolt), body tempering, and dry cupping compared to static stretching on flexibility and range of motion (ROM), specifically in those with active hamstring ROM limitations. Those individuals from the University of South Carolina community who are interested in becoming study participants will be identified by means of announcements made in the Seminar in Physical Therapy course which is attended by all Physical Therapy students, faculty, and staff each week. Interested individuals will be provided with Dr.Cathy Arnot's email address in order to schedule an evaluation session to determine whether or not they meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. A flyer will also be posted in the Blatt PE Building with Sean Edmonds' contact information included. Interested individuals that contact Sean will be scheduled for screening by Dr.Cathy Arnot. Participants will be assigned to either the HyperVolt percussive massage device (HyperVolt) group, body tempering group, dry cupping group, or static stretching group via blocked randomization for sex and age, with at least twenty participants being placed into each group. The HyperVolt percussive massage group participants will receive a therapist-performed HyperVolt technique for a period of 5 minutes. The body tempering group participants will receive a therapist-performed body tempering technique for a period of 5 minutes. The dry cupping group participants will receive a therapist-performed dry cupping technique for a period of 5 minutes. The static stretch group participants will perform a self-facilitated stretch by looping a strap around the heel of their foot and grasping it with both hands followed by pulling the strap to raise the fully extended leg into hip flexion. The participant will then lift the leg until they reach their maximal tolerable point and then alternate between periods of resting and stretching for a total of 5 minutes. Measurements will be assessed at three time points: Immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 24 hours after the intervention."
