To assess the feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C MR imaging as a new and unique tool in the characterization of aggressive tumor behavior in participants with meningioma.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nI. To define the most appropriate parameters for obtaining hyperpolarized 13C data from meningioma patients with a run-in study to optimize spatial and temporal resolution and coverage by detecting signal amplitudes and time dynamics.\n\nII. To measure tumor pyruvate-to-lactate, pyruvate-to-alanine, and pyruvate-to-bicarbonate conversion by 13C pyruvate MR imaging in participants with meningioma planning to undergo surgical resection within 4 weeks, using parameters.\n\nOutline:\n\nParticipants will receive a single imaging procedure using HP 13C pyruvate. Participants will then be followed-up for 30 days after completion of the study or until voluntary withdrawal or death."
