After surgery, patient will be seen in 4-12 weeks to determine if adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated, in which case patient will receive adjuvant therapy. At this visit a blood draw will be done.\n\nPart 2: If the patient is stage 0/1/2 and no plan for adjuvant treatments, then the patient will be randomized in a 2:1 manner to EGCG 900 mg daily vs observation (standard of care) for 1 year. Patients randomized to the EGCG arm, will start EGCG within 4-12 weeks of surgery and take EGCG 450 mg PO twice a day. Blood draw will be done at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 months. Colonoscopy will be done at 1 year from diagnosis, at which time normal colonic tissue biopsies as well as any resected polyps will be collected."

Patients with nasogastric tube (NG-tube), J-tube, or G-tube will not be allowed to participate.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of unknown effects of EGCG on teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must also agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.\n* Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with EGCG, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\n* Informed Consent - No study specific procedures will be performed without a written and signed informed consent document.
