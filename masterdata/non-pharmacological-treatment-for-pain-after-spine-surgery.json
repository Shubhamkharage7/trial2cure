            "briefSummary": "This study will compare the effectiveness of two pain management pathways (standard vs. enriched) for patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery in the Military Health System (MHS). Effectiveness will be based on post-surgery patient-centered outcomes and extent of opioid use. The study design is a 2-arm, parallel group, individual-randomized trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "The relevance of our model is supported by evidence that pain catastrophizing, self-efficacy and hypervigilance predict poor surgical outcomes and long-term opioid use. Surgery can exacerbate catastrophic thinking, especially if patients have unrealistic recovery expectations that go unmet. Physical therapy (PT) can improve chronic LBP (low back pain) outcomes, with effects mediated through changes in pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy. Mindfulness techniques help patients disentangle an experience (e.g., pain) from associated emotions and appraisals. Mindfulness can enhance emotion regulation and raise un-conscious behavioral responses (e.g., opioid use) to conscious consideration. The benefits of mindfulness for chronic pain are mediated by changes in hypervigilance and self-efficacy. Physical therapy and mindfulness can disrupt the self-reinforcing cycle of pain, catastrophic appraisal and unconscious behavioral response including opioid use. Our project examines an innovative strategy to integrate mindfulness and PT into an enriched surgical management pathway for individuals undergoing lumbar spine surgery.\n\nPatients at 3 different military hospitals will be randomized prior to surgery to two different treatment groups and followed for a period of 6 months, including the post-operative intervention phase."
