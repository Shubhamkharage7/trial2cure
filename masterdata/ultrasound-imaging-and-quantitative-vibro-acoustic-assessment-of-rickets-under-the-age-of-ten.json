To determine if ultrasound imaging of bone can identify the changes of impaired mineralization of the growth plates at the wrists and the knees, similar to those visible on plain radiographs.\n2. To determine if quantitative vibro-acoustic measurements of the bone in subjects with rickets significantly differs from control subjects, matched for age, sex, and BMI.\n3. To determine the relationship of ultrasound images and quantitative vibro-acoustic assessment with rickets severity score (RSS), based on radiographs of the wrists and knees.\n4. To determine if longitudinal changes in ultrasound images and quantitative vibro-acoustic assessment with treatment of rickets are related to changes in the rickets severity score."
