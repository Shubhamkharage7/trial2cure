            "briefSummary": "Effective respiratory ventilation is achieved by moving the right amount of air to and out of the lungs while keeping the pressures at a safe level. A disposable safety device, Adult Sotair\u00ae, was created to improve manual ventilation delivery. In this superiority study, the investigators will perform two-group cross over randomized design to test the superiority of the Adult Sotair\u00ae device compared to manual ventilation alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "Poor manual ventilation technique is a well-documented problem which occurs irrespective of a provider's qualifications or experience. A disposable safety device, Adult Sotair\u00ae, was created to improve manual ventilation delivery among providers. The device is attached to a bag valve mask (i.e. manual resuscitator) and employs a flow limiting valve mechanism to minimize excessive pressure in the airway system without venting air by capping peak flow rates at 55 L/min. For an average adult with normal lung compliance and resistance, this corresponds to a maximum airway pressure of approximately 20 cmH2O which minimizes air entry into the stomach. In this superiority study, the investigators will use a two-group cross over randomized design to test the superiority of the Adult Sotair\u00ae device compared to manual ventilation alone with respect to airway pressure."
