            "detailedDescription": "Effective pharmacotherapeutic treatments for mental disorders are available, but their effectiveness is limited by low compliance due to frequent side effects. This is partly due to patient heterogeneity in the genes encoding for drug-metabolising enzymes. Pharmacogenetic testing allows the assessment of person-specific genetic factors that are thought to predict clinical response and side effects. Recent studies have suggested that genotyping genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes may improve treatment efficacy and tolerability, potentially benefitting millions of patients.\n\nPSY-PGx is the first initiative to propose a large-scale non-industry sponsored clinical study that aims to demonstrate the clinical benefits and potential of the implementation of pharmacogenetics for psychiatric patients in existing medical settings.\n\nThis is an international 24-week, patient- and rater-blinded, two-arm, parallel-group controlled, and multi-centre randomized clinical trial (RCT) to establish the benefits of pharmacogenetics-informed pharmacotherapy versus dosing as usual (DAU) in psychiatric patients suffering from mood, anxiety, or psychotic disorders."
