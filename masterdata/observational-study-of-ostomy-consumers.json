Research participants will be asked to self-report on the ostomy pouching systems they typically use and other various aspects of living with an ostomy and/or caring for an individual living with an ostomy.",
            "detailedDescription": "This longitudinal prospective observational study is designed as an ePRO registry to collect data from consumers with an ostomy (ileostomy, colostomy, or urostomy) in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. An ePRO registry provides a relevant data source founded on the patient's voice. As such, an ePRO registry will be invaluable for prospective observational research aiming to investigate associations of ostomy pouching systems (inclusive of accessories) with peristomal skin health, participant QoL, caregiver burden, product satisfaction, and Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU). Information from this registry will inform and guide industry healthcare providers and payers in decision-making and subsequent research that factors in the patient and caregiver perspectives. The current study does not test any specific a priori hypotheses."
