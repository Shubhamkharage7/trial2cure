To describe the population PK of bedaquiline and its M2 metabolite, with or without rifabutin co-administration (PK#1)\n9. To conduct pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics study of the test drugs to determine relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax) and outcome measures (time to culture negativity or rate of change in TTP) using non-linear mixed effects models, adjusting for key covariates that may affect outcomes (e.g. companion drugs, HIV status, cavitary disease) (PK#2)\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n1. Time to sputum culture negative in liquid media\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n1. Proportion of participants with a Grade 3 or higher adverse event during 26 weeks from randomization\n2.
