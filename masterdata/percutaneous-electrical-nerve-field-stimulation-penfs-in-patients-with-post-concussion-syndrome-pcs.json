            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to test the effect of Auricular Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Field Stimulation (a Neurostim device) on children with pain and Post Concussion symptoms. Patient will be offered a Neurostim device. This device is placed on the outer ear through tiny needles. Since this is a randomized trial, patients may receive an active (experiment) or nonactive (control) Neurostim device. However, the nonactive control Neurostim device group will be given the option to receive an active device after the initial study procedures. The experiment group may be in this study up to 8 weeks and the control group may be in this study up to 12 weeks. The control group will have 4 additional weeks due to the transition to an active device following the first 8 weeks. The device is worn weekly for 4 weeks. Each device is worn for 5 consecutive days for the full 24 hours. The participant will be able to easily take the device off on the 6th day. Study procedures include: Neurological testing- a balance test and computerized neurological standard testing, Cardiology testing- electrocardiogram for heart rate variability (heart electrical pulse test), a pupilometer (eye) test, and parent/child questionnaires. You may benefit from this research, but there is no guarantee that being in this study will help you.\n\nPatients in the COVID arm will be offered 6 placements of Neurostim devices. This device is placed on the outer ear through tiny needles. Patients in this arm will not be randomized, all patients will receive active devices. This group will be in the study for up to 10 weeks. The device is worn weekly for 6 weeks. Each device is worn for 5 consecutive days for the full 24 hours. The patient will be able to remove the device on the 6th day. Study procedures include: Neurological testing called Cognigram to measure cognitive functioning and parent/child questionnaires. After 6 weeks of device placements, parent and child will complete a 1-week and 1-questionnaires. You may benefit from this research, but there is no guarantee that being in this study will help you."
