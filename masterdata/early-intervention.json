            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm pilot study of a compression sleeve intervention for patients at high risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). The compression sleeve will also include a novel sensor to capture patient adherence to compression wear and pressure applied to the arm.\n\nThis research is being done because patients receiving lymph node surgery and lymph node radiation for breast cancer are at risk of lymphedema on the arm, trunk or breast/chest wall on the side of treatment. There is some evidence that compression sleeves may prevent progression of early swelling to lymphedema. This study is looking to determine if:\n\n1. a compression garment worn for four weeks helps to prevent breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) in those at high risk of BCRL\n2. a sensor attached to the sleeve is accurately measuring time worn and pressure applied\n3. participants are wearing the compression for the prescribed time, and if not, what are the barriers to wear\n4. participants adhere to the study schedule for filling out patient surveys regarding symptoms and satisfaction with screening.\n\nFindings from this study will apply to the development of a larger randomized controlled trial to examine if compression prevents progression to BCRL for patients with low volume swelling.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility, treatment including evaluations and follow up visits. Study treatment will last for four weeks with follow up at one, three, six, nine and 12 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis study is receiving financial support from the Adele McKinnon Research Fund for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema (AG Taghian); the Olayan-Xefos Family Fund for Breast Cancer Research (AG Taghian), and the Heinz Family Foundation (AGTaghian).\n\nJuzo Inc. is supporting this research study by providing compression garments and a Juzo pressure monitor. Impedimed Inc is supporting this study by providing a Sozo bioimpedance measurement device for research use."

Because of the extremely low incidence of BC in children and males, only female participants over the age of 18 will be included.\n* Eligible participants will demonstrate low volume swelling (RVC 5-\\<10%) \\>/=12 weeks postoperatively\n* Eligible participants will read and comprehend English, with the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written consent document.\n* Most patients treated for breast cancer will have undergone SLNB for axillary staging, and are therefore at lower risk for BCRL, compared to patients with ALND and/or regional lymph node radiation (RLNR). We have chosen to include only patients at high risk of BCRL, i.e., those who have undergone ALND, and we will not be including those who are at low BCRL risk, i.e., had only SLNB for axillary staging on the side of BC.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have bilateral BC (ie. contralateral staging SLNB or ALND) will not be eligible due to the need of a contralateral control arm for the RVC equation.\n* Participants will not be eligible if they have been diagnosed and/or treated for BCRL.\n* Participants will not be eligible if they have metastases that may cause BCRL. Participants with metastatic disease will be excluded.\n* Participants with implanted cardiac devices and those who are pregnant will be excluded from the Sozo measurement component of the study.",
