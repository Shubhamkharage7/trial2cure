            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of tumor treating fields therapy in combination with either cabozantinib or nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab in treating patients with solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax that have spread to other parts of the body (advanced). Tumor treating fields therapy on this study utilizes NovoTTF systems that are wearable devices that use electrical fields at different frequencies that may help stop the growth of tumor cells by interrupting cancer cells' ability to divide. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tumor treating fields therapy in combination with either cabozantinib, or with nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab may help control advanced solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of TTF, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), in combination with cabozantinib (Cohort 1) with nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab (Cohort 2) in patients with advanced solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax to the 4 prespecified tumor types.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival of TTF in combination with cabozantinib (Cohort 1) with nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab (Cohort 2) in patients with advanced solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax to the 4 prespecified tumor types.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT 1: Patients receive TTF continuously for at least 18 hours per day on days 1-21 of each cycle. Patients also receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOHORT 2: Patients receive TTF continuously for at least 18 hours per day on days 1-28 of each cycle. Patients also receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 6 weeks."

Childbearing potential will be defined as women who have had menses within the past 12 months and who have not had a tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Participants who are already on cabozantinib and have progressive disease are allowed to transition to treatment with tumor treating fields and cabozantinib. Participants in both cohorts who already started treatments as standard of care (Cohort 1: Cabozantinib and Cohort 2: nab-paclitaxel and Pembrolizumab) are allowed to start on protocol within the first 2-3 weeks of treatment initiation. Palliative radiation therapy is allowed.\n* Participants must have recovered to Grade 0-1 toxicity from prior therapy.\n* Active brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.

(B) Participants who had prior immunotherapies and experienced Grade 1-2 immune-related adverse event (irAE) must have documentation that their irAEs are Grade 1 or 0 using current Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) and participants must be off steroid therapy and/or other immunosuppressive therapy, as treatment for irAEs, for \\>= 14 days from Cycle 1, Day 1. (C) Participants who experienced Grade 3 irAEs consisting of laboratory abnormalities that were asymptomatic and have now resolved to Grade 1 or 0 and participants who have been off steroid and/or other immunosuppressive therapy, as treatment for irAEs, for \\>= 30 days from Cycle 1, Day 1.
