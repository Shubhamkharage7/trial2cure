The study will enroll 50 subjects with SAD who will be randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either Epidiolex or placebo before experiencing the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), the gold-standard for ethically inducing stress in a controlled laboratory setting. Following the TSST, neuroimaging measures of emotional processing and self-referential processing will be acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nThis study will be conducted primarily at Massachusetts Institute of Technology with research and clinical support from Massachusetts General Hospital."
