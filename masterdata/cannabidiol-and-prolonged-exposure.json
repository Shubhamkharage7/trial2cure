            "briefSummary": "The trial will include a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of using Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating cannabinoid, as an adjunctive to Prolonged Exposure therapy (PE). The trial will compare PE + CBD to PE + placebo in a sample of 136 military Veterans with PTSD at the VA San Diego Medical Center. The study represents the logical and innovative next step for augmenting existing treatments and developing novel pharmacotherapy for PTSD. Findings from the proposed RCT will inform clinical practice and policy by investigating whether administration of CBD in the context of PE therapy will improve treatment outcomes for military Veterans with PTSD.",
            "detailedDescription": "Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is among the most efficacious treatments for PTSD and is designated as a VA/DoD frontline treatment. However, PE does not always lead to clinically meaningful symptom reductions in Veterans with PTSD. Successful PE treatment relies on extinction learning, which is often impaired in patients with PTSD. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid. Administration of specific phytocannabinoids, like CBD, increase extinction learning in patients with PTSD, and could increase the speed and effectiveness of PE therapy. CBD also modulates 5-HT1A, which may directly improve hyperarousal/insomnia symptoms, and improve engagement and retention in treatment. Given these findings, adjunctive administration of CBD+PE could improve response rates to PE and reduce the number of sessions of PE needed to reach clinically meaningful change. The proposed study is designed to test the efficacy of using CBD in conjunction with PE for the treatment of PTSD in US Military Veterans. A randomized, controlled, double-blind study will compare Veterans who receive PE+CBD to PE+placebo. Participants will include 136 male and female Veterans from all service eras with PTSD. The primary hypothesis is that PE+CBD will reduce PTSD symptoms to a greater degree than PE+placebo."
