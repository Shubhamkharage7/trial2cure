Minimal residual disease is multiple myeloma cells below the level of 1 cancer cell out of 100,000 in the bone marrow.\n\nFor patients who become MRD \"negative\" (i.e. less than 1 cancer cell out of 100,000) at the end of 6 cycles of therapy, this study will study if that good response can be maintained with 3 additional cycles of treatment instead of use of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT).\n\nFor patients who are MRD \"positive\" at the end of 6 cycles of therapy, this study will answer whether more patients can become and remain MRD \"negative\" with AHCT plus teclistamab in combination with daratumumab when compared with patients who undergo AHCT followed by lenalidomide (an established anti-myeloma drug) plus daratumumab."

Skin cancer (non-melanoma or melanoma) treated within the last 24 months that is considered completely cured.\n   3. Noninvasive cervical cancer treated within the last 24 months that is considered completely cured\n   4. Localized prostate cancer (N0M0):\n\n      1. With a Gleason score of \u22646, treated within the last 24 months, or untreated and under surveillance\n      2. With a Gleason score of 3+4 that has been treated \\>6 months prior to full study screening and considered to have a very low risk of recurrence, or\n   5. History of localized prostate cancer and receiving androgen deprivation therapy and considered to have a very low risk of recurrence.\n   6. Breast cancer: adequately treated lobular carcinoma in situ or ductal carcinoma in situ, or history of localized breast cancer and receiving antihormonal agents and considered to have a very low risk of recurrence\n   7. Other malignancy that is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence\n6. Stroke or seizure within 6 months prior to signing ICF.\n7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) \\<50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for participants suspected of having COPD and participants must be excluded if FEV1 is \\<50% of predicted normal.\n8. Moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years or uncontrolled asthma of any classification. Note that participants who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed to participate in the study.\n9. Prior allogeneic bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant.\n10. Participant is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study or within 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n11. Participant plans to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n12. Presence of the following cardiac conditions:\n\n    1. New York Heart Association stage III or IV congestive heart failure\n    2. Myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft \u22646 months prior to randomization\n    3. History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, not believed to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration\n    4. History of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy\n13. Any of the following:\n\n    1. Known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus\n    2. Hepatitis B infection (ie, HBsAg or HBV-DNA positive). In the event the infection status is unclear, quantitative viral levels are necessary to determine the infection status.\n    3. Active hepatitis C infection as measured by positive HCV-RNA testing.\n14. Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to the start of administration of study treatment, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has major surgery planned during the time the participant is expected to be treated in the study or within 2 weeks after administration of the last dose of study treatment.\n15. Significant neuropathy (Grades 3-4, or Grade 2 with pain) within 21 days prior to registration.\n16. Contra indication or intolerance to required supportive care medications.\n17. Concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease that is likely to interfere with study procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the investigator would constitute a hazard for participating in this study, such as:\n\n    1. Uncontrolled diabetes\n    2. Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease\n    3. Evidence of active systemic viral, fungal, or bacterial infection, requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy\n    4. History of autoimmune disease with the exception of vitiligo, type I diabetes, and prior autoimmune thyroiditis that is currently euthyroid based on clinical symptoms and laboratory testing\n    5. Disabling psychiatric conditions (eg, alcohol or drug abuse), severe dementia, or altered mental status\n    6. Any other issue that would impair the ability of the participant to receive or tolerate the planned treatment at the investigational site, to understand informed consent or any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (eg, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments\n    7.
