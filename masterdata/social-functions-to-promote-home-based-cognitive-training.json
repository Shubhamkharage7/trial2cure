            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility of two new features, a chat function and a leaderboard function, to encourage social interactions and support adherence to cognitive training protocols (mental exercises delivered via a tablet) over a period of time (2 months), and uncover individual difference factors that can predict poor adherence in the future and social interactions in the game. Even effective cognitive interventions may fail if individuals do not adhere to them for an extended period. This project will compare cognitive training games with chat function and leaderboard in reducing social isolation and improving adherence to the training, compared to an external control group using a generic reminder system delivered via smartphone text messages to promote adherence. The ultimate goal, as effective technology-based interventions to improve cognition become available, is to help support their benefit for older adults by maximizing long-term adherence."
