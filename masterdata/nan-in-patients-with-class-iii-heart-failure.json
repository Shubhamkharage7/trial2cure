Patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure will be enrolled until up to 12 subjects have received infusions of investigational product. All patients will be followed until 12 months post treatment intervention, and then undergo long-term follow-up via semi-structured telephone questionnaires every 6 months for an additional 24 months (+/- 30 days).",

Functional endpoints will be assessed as changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months following investigational product administration as indicated. These endpoints include:\n\nFunctional Status \\& Hospitalizations\n\n* Peak VO2 assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing\n* 6-minute walk test\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification\n* Total number of days alive out-of-hospital (as well as total days out-of-hospital as a % of total days alive post study intervention)\n\nPhysiologic Assessments at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline\n\n* Echocardiographic assessments of LVEF, LVEVD, LVEDVI, VLESV, LVEVI, SpI and GLSand degree of mitral regurgitation\n* NT-proBNP level\n\nQuality of Life at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline\n\no Health related quality of life as assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ)\n\nThe following endpoints will also be measured over the 12 month follow-up period and long-term follow-up period (until month 36 post-intervention):\n\n* Survival\n* Cardiac transplantation\n* Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation"
