            "briefSummary": "One of the targeted objectives of Healthy People 2020 is to reduce iron deficiency among women of reproductive age (WRA). Consuming foods rich in iron and/or oral iron supplementation is typically recommended to improve iron status; however, global rates of iron deficiency remain high. Thus, nutritional strategies to improve/maintain iron status are warranted. Dietary iron is found in two different forms: heme and non-heme iron. Non-heme iron is found in plant-based sources and is commonly used as a supplement and food fortificant. Absorption of non-heme iron is low compared to heme iron, which is found in animal sources, such as beef. Studies have also demonstrated that beef contains an unidentified factor that stimulates the absorption of non-heme iron. The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine the effects of incorporating daily meals containing beef or plant-based alternative with or without an iron supplement on indicators of iron status in iron-deficient WRA."
