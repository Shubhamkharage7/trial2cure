            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of implanting small 24-K gold fiducial markers around a bladder tumor site, so that a Radiation Oncologist can identify the original tumor location at the time of radiation treatment. Other goals of the study include assessing whether a new MRI imaging technology can help with detection of bladder cancer earlier and more accurately when evidence of bladder cancer is not visible by scope.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study of fiducial markers in patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer will enroll patients electing bladder preservation with tri-modal therapy.\n\n24-K gold fiducial markers will be endoscopically implanted around the tumor resection area to mark the location of the tumor site, into the bladder wall submucosa space under direct visualization via a coaxial needle. The markers are visible on all imaging modalities, including all available on-table imaging (e.g., portal and cone-beam CT) used for radiotherapy. Reliable fiducial marker placement within the bladder may have the potential to advance bladder-sparing management of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\n\nThis study will examine the effectiveness of bladder-preserving multi-modal treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer with and without fiducial marker placement to guide radiotherapy targeting and to minimize collateral radiation. In addition, this study intends to verify the accuracy and report on the sensitivity and specificity of mp-MRI imaging to detect the presence and location of bladder cancer."
