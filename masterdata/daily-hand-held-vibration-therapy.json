The investigators hypothesize that daily vibration therapy can reduce the severity of patient's CIPN in their hands and improve CIPN-related quality of life. The hope is that results from this study will provide early data on the feasibility, efficacy, and most importantly, safety, of daily 3-minute hand-held vibration therapy needed to justify future clinical trials examining vibration therapy as a potential option for treating CIPN in the future."
