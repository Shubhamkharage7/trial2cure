The objective is to determine the safety and efficacy of CELZ-201 administration, based on the timing and dose of CELZ-201 treatment. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to treatment or control groups, in a 2:1 ratio. Subjects in the Group I (Treatment Group, n=12) will receive standard of care for type 1 diabetes and CELZ-201 within 1 month from enrollment (within 180 days of diagnosis). Subjects in Group II (Control Arm, n=6) and will receive enhanced standard of care for type 1 diabetes."

Presence of an allograft.\n21. Diagnosed or self-reported drug or alcohol abuse.\n22. An individual who has a medical, psychological or social condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would interfere with safe and proper completion of the trial.\n23.
