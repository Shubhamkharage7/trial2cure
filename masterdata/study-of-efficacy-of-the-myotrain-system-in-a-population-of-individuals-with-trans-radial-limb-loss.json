These individuals will be randomized to Group A (Control Group using standard motor imagery training) and Group B (who are provided the MyoTrain system).\n\nThe investigators will test three hypotheses:\n\n1. The use of MyoTrain results in skills transference to control of the final prosthesis\n2. The virtual outcome measures in MyoTrain are correlated with real-world functional outcome measures\n3. The use of MyoTrain results in improved clinical outcomes as measured by functional, subjective and usage metrics\n\nFollowing a baseline functional assessment, participants will undergo a 30-day pre-prosthetic training period specific to their assigned Group. After this training period, participants will receive their prosthetic device and occupational therapy consistent with the current clinical care standard, after which they will again undergo clinical assessment. Post-device delivery, participants will then complete 3 56-day blocks of at-home prosthesis use, in between which they will return to clinic for assessment."

Instead, the proctor for the measure chooses an everyday activity, such as setting up a table for snacks or replanting a flower, that is relevant to the study population. As the participants perform the chosen task, a trained rater will assess their capacity for control of their myoelectric prosthesis as represented by 30 items reflecting 6 aspects of quality of myoelectric control. These 6 aspects are \"the need for external support,\" \"grip force and opening width,\" \"coordination of both hands, \"in different positions and in motion (timing),\" \"repetitive grip and release,\" and \"the need for visual feedback.\" Each item is scored on a 4-point scale and converted into linear measures of myoelectric control using Rasch analysis methods on the ACMC website.

For wrist pronation/supination tasks, a translucent grey bar appears in a target orientation and a red bar acts a visual marker indicating the virtual hand's current orientation. The goal of the task is to match the hand or wrist orientation with the target location or orientation, respectively.
