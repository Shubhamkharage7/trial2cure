These \"pets\" are designed to interact with people as a real pet might. They purr when stroked, make eye contact, have a heartbeat, turn toward a person when touched, are warm, and appear lifelike. Does introduction of such a pet reduce loneliness or promote engagement in older adults with cognitive or physical disability?\n\nThis research will determine if:\n\n1. Older adults with disabilities engage with such robotic companions;\n2. Placing a robotic pet in a home enhances mood and positive affect in older people;\n3. Caregivers to these adults find the robots beneficial for their own mood and time use.\n\nIn a single-blind randomized controlled trial over 6-8 weeks, we hypothesize that older adults in the intervention arm will engage with the pets and show benefit in mood as reported by family caregivers."
