            "briefSummary": "The overarching purpose of this pilot study is to investigate an increasingly common, but under-researched, practice of employing paraprofessional coaches to improve emerging adults' access to and engagement in evidence-based substance use practices, focusing on the paraprofessional coaches' outcomes and the role of lived experience.",
            "detailedDescription": "Criminal legal system involved emerging adults are one of the highest-risk populations for opioid and other substance use and other significant problems (criminal behaviors), but they lack access to and engagement in evidence-based practices. The deleterious outcomes and long-term costs of substance use for emerging adults, communities, and society (estimated at over $740 billion annually and greater than costs for any other health problem), make this a priority. This pilot project is aimed at using paraprofessional coaches to increase engagement and access to evidence-based practices (i.e., contingency management for substance use and vocational/educational coaching) for emerging adults with substance use and criminal legal system involvement. In partnership with parole and probation, sixty emerging adults with substance use will be randomized to work with twenty paraprofessional coaches either with or without lived experience (i.e., successful substance use recovery and/or adult criminal legal system involvement). Although using peer paraprofessional coaches (those with lived experience) is becoming more popular and supported at the federal level, the outcome of this work on the paraprofessional coaches themselves, especially for emerging adults, is largely unexplored. The proposed study will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess feasibility and acceptability of the services and research protocols and to gain a better understanding of the impacts on both the coaches and their emerging adult clients. As substance use and poor vocational/educational attainment greatly increases the likelihood of recidivism, innovative strategies to reduce opioid and other substance use for emerging adults is critical, along with understanding the effects on the service providers (i.e., paraprofessional coaches). Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of paraprofessional coaches to deliver (with high adherence) the established interventions to emerging adults with substance use and criminal legal system involvement as part of probation and parole services, and explore differences in the delivery of the interventions based on lived experience. Aim 2: Compare emerging adult clients' engagement (attendance, completion of the intervention) and outcomes (substance use, vocational/educational attainment, criminal recidivism), when interventions are delivered by paraprofessional coaches with vs. without lived experience. Aim 3: For paraprofessional coaches delivering the interventions, examine the differences over time between those with vs. without lived experience on their own substance use symptoms and substance use relapse risk factors."
