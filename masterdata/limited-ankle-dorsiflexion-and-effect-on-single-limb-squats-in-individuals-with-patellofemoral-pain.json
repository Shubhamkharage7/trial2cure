Randomization will occur to create an experimental group and a minimal intervention group.\n2. Participants will complete two self-reported questionnaires on how their diagnosis affects functional activities.\n3. Dorsiflexion range of motion in a weight bearing position will be taken.\n4. Hip abductor strength on tested limb will be measure on isokinetic device.\n5. The Lateral Step Down test will be conducted for 6 trials on each participant, 3 with a heel wedge and 3 without, movement recorded, and graded using two motion capture devices.\n6. The experimental group will receive two interventions to increase dorsiflexion range of motion. The minimal intervention group will read and infographic and complete 5 minutes of treadmill walking.\n7. Each participant will then have their dorsiflexion measured again prior to completing another 3 trials of the Lateral Step Down test."
