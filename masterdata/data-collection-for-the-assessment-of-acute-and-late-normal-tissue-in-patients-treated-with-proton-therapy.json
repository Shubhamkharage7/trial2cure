To prospectively collect data on acute and late toxicities (including second malignant neoplasms) in patients treated with proton therapy.\n\nII. To collect and store the corresponding radiation dose distribution and imaging data in order to correlate normal tissue response with dose distribution.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To derive and refine dose-response relationships for normal tissue toxicity after proton therapy.\n\nII. To document and compare symptom burden weekly during treatment and twice a month for 3 months after therapy, using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergoing standard of care proton therapy are assessed for toxicities weekly during proton treatment, then from 1 to 3 times up to 90 days from the start of treatment and annually thereafter. Patients also complete questionnaires over 15-20 minutes at baseline, weekly during treatment, and every 2 weeks during follow up for up to 3 months."
