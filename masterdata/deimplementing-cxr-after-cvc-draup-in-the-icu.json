Study data will be used to optimize the intervention for a subsequent larger trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are millions of critically ill patients annually who require imaging confirmation after central venous catheter insertion. Emerging literature demonstrates that ultrasound is a faster alternative to historical chest xray, thus serving as the ideal confirmation for catheter use. When able to confirm catheter position, ultrasound decreases the number of unnecessary chest radiographs, cumulative resources (technologist, radiologist, equipment), and patient care delays. However, providers are not adopting this practice. Previously, we developed and initiated a successful evidence-based deimplementation program for ultrasound in lieu of chest xray called DRAUP in the Emergency Department. We now move to adapt the deimplementation bundle in the new environment of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hopeful continued success.\n\nIn experiment 1, qualitative analysis will be employ a systematic approach to DRAUP component refinement dosed to the unique context of the Intensive Care Unit and implementation outcomes as well as cost will be evaluated. In experiment 3, mixed methods will be used to evaluate the mechanism of impact of the refined program in the new environment."
