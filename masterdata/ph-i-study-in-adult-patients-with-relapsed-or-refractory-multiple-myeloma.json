Patients with QTc interval \u2265 480 milliseconds or with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., uncontrolled heart failure, uncontrolled hypokalemia, history of prolonged QTc interval or family history of long QT syndrome). For patients receiving treatment with concomitant medications known to prolong the QTc interval, replacement with another treatment should be considered. If replacement or discontinuation is not clinically feasible, a careful risk/benefit evaluation should be performed prior to enrollment.\n21. Breast-feeding or planning to breast feed during the study or within 3 months after study treatment.\n22. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the NMS-03597812 drug product.\n23. Known hypersensitivity to steroids or any of the components of the dexamethasone drug product (applies only to the expansion cohort testing NMS-03597812 in combination with dexamethasone).\n24. Any of the following in the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, NYHA class III or IV congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism.\n25. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections including: known infection with HIV, HBV and/or HCV; patients who are seropositive following HBV vaccine are eligible.\n26. Known active gastrointestinal disease (e.g., documented gastrointestinal ulcer, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact drug absorption or represent a contra-indication for the treatment with dexamethasone (NMS-03597812 and dexamethasone expansion cohort).\n27. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor.\n28. Patient who are receiving concomitant medications that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP34A and CYP2C9 that cannot be replaced with alternative therapy.\n29.
