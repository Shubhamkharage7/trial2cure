            "briefSummary": "The long-term goal is to develop effective parenting strategies to facilitate optimal child development for mothers suffering with PPD symptoms. The overall objective for this application is to study whether this program combined with online depression treatment leads to more responsive parenting (target) and signals improved child language, socioemotional and cognitive development (outcomes) compared to depression treatment alone. Findings from this application can be used to inform a future study to test the effectiveness and implementation of this social media-based parenting program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms are common among women following the birth of a child and can adversely impact a mother's ability to care for her child. As a result, infants of mothers with PPD symptoms may experience less responsive parenting, placing them at greater risk for delays in development. Evidence- based parenting programs have been developed to guide mothers with caring for their infants but may not address the impact of depression on parenting, are intensive and expensive to administer with limited ability for scale up, or are not available in a format that facilitates participation by women with depressive symptoms. To address these barriers, investigators developed a theoretically-driven social media-based parenting program on responsive parenting and child development.\n\nTo determine whether the social media-based parenting program can improve responsive parenting and signal greater child development among women with PPD symptoms, investigators will conduct a prospective individually randomized group treatment trial. 113 eligible women who screen positive for PPD at their infants' well child visit and their children will be consented, enrolled, and randomized as mother-child dyads 1:1 to receive a) the social media-based parenting program plus online depression treatment or b) online depression treatment alone. Investigators chose a randomized design, because it is most effective in guarding against bias and will ensure that patients in both arms are similar in observed and unobserved characteristics. Treatment assignment will be done at the time of enrollment following informed consent.\n\nDescriptive statistics for demographic and poverty characteristics and PPD symptoms measured at baseline will be examined across the two treatment groups to assess the success of the randomization. Investigators will assess responsive parenting at baseline and 3 months post-enrollment. Secondary endpoints which include the changes in EPDS, PSOC, and PSI-SF scores measured between baseline and the 3-month follow-up between groups, will be explored to determine if the effects of the parenting program are consistent with preliminary study findings. The secondary child developmental outcomes will include differences in the Bayley-3 cognitive, language, and motor subscale scores at the 12-month follow-up visit. The intervention arm will also be assessed with the Therapeutic Factors Inventory-8 (TFI-8) to measure cohesion and the Acceptability survey which measures feasibility of the parenting program at 3-months post-enrollment. Additionally, at the 3-month mark, all participants will be administered the MoodGym Acceptability Survey to assess feasibility of the online depression treatment program.\n\nThe results of this application would be expected to contribute important new knowledge and inform a future trial on parenting strategies to better assist mothers with PPD symptoms and improve child developmental outcomes."

To obtain this data set, other investigators will need to contact the study Principal Investigator (PI) who will provide a data sharing agreement. The data sharing agreement will permit a deidentified data set to be shared once an Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol has been approved at the investigators' home institution and the investigators have signed a pledge to not attempt to identify individual study subjects. The data set will be made available on a Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) or through a secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site.",
