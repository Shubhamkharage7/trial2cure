            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the use and effectiveness of a mobile web application (app) that is designed to educate and allow patients to manage diabetes and make sustainable lifestyle changes, and to study the impact of the app on clinical outcomes of diabetes (HA1C) and educational outcomes (Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Scale). The main question to answer is: Does the use of the Diabetes Application significantly affect clinical outcomes of diabetes and cardiometabolic risk factors (BMI and Blood Pressure)? Patients will be enrolled in one of two available arms of the study.\n\nParticipants in the 'intervention arm' will use the app to view educational information presented as videos in the following areas: Healthy Coping, Healthy Eating, Staying Active, Medications (Use and Safety), Problem Solving in Diabetes and Disease Pathophysiology. They will continue routine follow-up care with their primary care physicians during the study.\n\nParticipants in the 'control arm' will continue with their primary care physician in routine follow-up care, as normally scheduled.\n\nResearchers will compare the intervention arm participants to the control arm participants to find out about and compare changes in HA1C, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. Groups will also be compared on the basis of self-perceived confidence of managing their diabetes by way of the Diabetes Self Efficacy Scale."
