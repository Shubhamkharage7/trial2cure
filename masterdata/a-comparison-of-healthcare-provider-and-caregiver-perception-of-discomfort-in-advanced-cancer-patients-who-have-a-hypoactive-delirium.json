The caregiver's perception will be based upon the Caregiver Survey of Patient Discomfort, and the nurse's perception will be based upon the Healthcare Provider Survey of Patient Discomfort.\n\nExploratory Objective:\n\nTo assess associations between patient demographics and clinical characteristics as well as caregiver and nurse demographics on corresponding caregiver and nurse survey responses."
