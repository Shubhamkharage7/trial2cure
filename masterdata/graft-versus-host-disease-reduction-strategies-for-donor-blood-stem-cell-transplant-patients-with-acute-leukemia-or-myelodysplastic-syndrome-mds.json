            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates two strategies and how well they work for the reduction of graft versus host disease in patients with acute leukemia or MDS in remission. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms (Arms A and C).\n\nARM A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A1 (TBI BASED): Patients undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -10 to -7, and receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days -6 and -5, fludarabine IV over 30 to 60 minutes on days -6 to -2, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV continuously starting on day -1, CD34+ enriched CD45RA-depleted donor T-lymphocytes IV on day 0, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).\n\nARM A2 (BUSULFAN BASED): Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 to 60 minutes on days -6 to -2, busulfan IV over 180 minutes on days -5 to -2, and undergo TBI BID on day -1. Patients also receive tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV continuously starting on day -1, CD34+ enriched CD45RA-depleted donor T-lymphocytes IV on day 0, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).\n\nARM C: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM C1: Patients undergo TBI BID on days -4 to -2 or -3 to -1, and receive PBSC IV on day 0. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 to 2 hours on days 3 and 4, and tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV continuously starting on day 5 approximately 24 hours after the end of the second dose of cyclophosphamide. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).\n\nARM C2: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 to 60 minutes on days -5 to -2, busulfan IV over 180 minutes on days -5 to -2, PBSC IV on day 0, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 to 2 hours on days 3 and 4, and tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV continuously starting on day 5 approximately 24 hours after the end of the second dose of cyclophosphamide. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).\n\nARM D: (DISCONTINUED NOVEMBER 2021): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM D1: Patients undergo TBI BID on days -6 to -4, and receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 to -2, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV continuously starting on day -1, PBSC IV on day 0, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).\n\nARM D2: Patients receive busulfan IV over 180 minutes on days -8 to -5, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 to -2, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV continuously starting on day -1, PBSC IV on day 0, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).\n\nAll patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 80, 180, and 270 and at 1, 1.5, and 2 years."

A patient may have a history of CNS disease. However, any CNS disease must be cleared by the end of the pre-conditioning evaluation time frame. If CNS disease is identified on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation within 30 days of the start of the preparative regimen a repeat CSF evaluation must be performed and show no evidence of disease in order for the patient to be eligible for the protocol.\n* Patients on other experimental protocols for prevention of GVHD.\n* Patient weight:\n\n  * Patients with HLA-matched related donors will be excluded if they weigh \\>= 110 kg.\n  * Patients with HLA-matched unrelated donors will be excluded if they weigh \\>= 110 kg and must be discussed with the Fred Hutch protocol principal investigator (PI) if they weigh \\>= 90 kg.\n* Patients who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2, human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)1 or HTLV2.\n* Patients with uncontrolled infections for whom myeloablative HCT is considered contraindicated by the consulting infectious disease physician; i.e. patients with active infections require infectious disease consultation and documentation by the infectious disease team that myeloablative HCT is not considered to be contraindicated. Upper respiratory tract infection is not considered to represent an uncontrolled infection in this context.\n* Patients with organ dysfunction, including:\n\n  * Renal insufficiency (creatinine \\> 1.5 mg/dl) at the time of evaluation for the protocol. Patients with a known history of creatinine \\> 1.5 mg/dl or a current serum creatinine above the normal range for age must have a current creatinine clearance of \\> 60 ml/min/1.73 m\\^2 (measured by 24-hr urine specimen or nuclear glomerular filtration rate \\[GFR\\]).\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction \\< 45%.\n  * Carbon monoxide diffusing capability (DLCO) corrected \\< 60%. Patients who are unable to perform pulmonary function tests (for example, due to young age and/or developmental status) will be excluded if the oxygen (O2) saturation is \\< 92% on room air.\n  * Liver function abnormality. Patients who have liver function test (LFT)s (specifically, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] or alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\]) \\>= twice the upper limit of normal should be evaluated by a gastrointestinal (GI) physician unless there is a clear precipitating factor (such as an azole, MTX, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or another drug). If the GI physician considers that HCT on the protocol is contraindicated, that patient will be excluded from the protocol. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome require GI physician consultation but may be included on the protocol. Patients with no other known liver function abnormality or with reversible drug-related transaminitis do not necessarily require GI consultation and may be included on the protocol.\n* Patients who have received previous myeloablative allogeneic or autologous transplantation.\n* Patients with a life expectancy \\< 12 months from co-existing disease other than the leukemia or MDS.\n* Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Patients of childbearing age who are presumed to be fertile and are unwilling to use an effective birth control method or refrain from sexual intercourse during and for 12 months post-HCT.\n* Patients with any other significant medical conditions that would make them unsuitable for transplantation, as determined by the PI.\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or MTX\n* Patients who have received checkpoint inhibitors within three months of transplantation unless an exception is made by the PI\n* DONOR: Donors who are HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1, HTLV-2 seropositive or with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection. Test must be performed using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed, cleared, and approved test kits (serological and/or nucleic acid amplification test \\[NAT\\] and/or other approved testing) in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\n* Unrelated donors donating outside of the USA.",
