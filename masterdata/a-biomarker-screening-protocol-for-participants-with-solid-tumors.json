No investigational treatments will be administered in this non-interventional screening study. Only previously obtained archival tumor tissue will be allowed on this study for biomarker analysis. Fresh tumor biopsies are not permitted on this study. The study will be conducted virtually and participants will utilize telehealth and e-consent modules. If participants tumors express the biomarkers of interest they can be referred to open and enrolling clinical trials. Participation on the screening study does not guarantee enrollment or treatment on an interventional clinical trial."
