Following confirmation of eligibility and completion of Baseline 1 testing, individuals will be randomized to receive up to 15 visits over approximately 5 weeks of either high or low intensity virtual reality gait training. Following which, individuals will undergo Post 1 testing to capture potential change in outcomes following the intervention. Participants will then take at least a 4-week break before returning to complete Baseline 2 testing and up 15 visits over 5 weeks of the alternative intervention before finally completing Post 2 testing."
