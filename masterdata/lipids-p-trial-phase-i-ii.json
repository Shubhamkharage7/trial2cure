            "briefSummary": "Briefly, this pilot clinical trial will evaluate preliminary safety and efficacy of the study drug (Smoflipid) at elevating cholesterol levels (primary outcome) in patients with sepsis and moderate organ dysfunction and will also evaluate measures of organ dysfunction, mortality, and biological activity (secondary outcomes).",
            "detailedDescription": "Sepsis is a life-threatening disease for which there are no effective treatments. It results from metabolic and immunologic derangements that lead to organ dysfunction, shock and sometimes death. Both \"good\" (high density lipoprotein, HDL) and \"bad\" (low density lipoprotein, LDL) cholesterol should be protective against sepsis by helping to clear bacterial toxins from the blood stream and by providing a fuel for endogenous corticosteroids, part of the body's protective stress-response in shock. However, for partially unknown reasons, cholesterol levels drop to critically low levels in early sepsis, leaving the body unable to protect itself against sepsis via these mechanisms. Currently, lipid emulsions are available that are FDA approved for intravenous nutrition in critically ill patients (including sepsis) and may be capable of elevating serum cholesterol levels. This Phase II randomized pilot clinical trial, proposes to assess the following in a cohort of patients with early sepsis (first 24 hours): 1) safety and tolerability of the proposed lipid injectable emulsion (Smoflipid) and any adverse effects, 2) the drugs ability to optimally elevate cholesterol at 48 hours, and 3) preliminary measures of biological activity and clinical outcomes."

For the Phase I, which has been completed, 10 patients were enrolled in the study to evaluate for dose limiting toxicity (DLT). For patients enrolled in the Phase I dose-escalation study, there was no control group, with doses starting at 1.0g/kg and increasing incrementally based on weight by 0.2g/kg to a maximum dose of 1.6g/kg. Dose escalation or de-escalation occurred based on whether DLTs were observed at a specific dose, with the threshold for toxicity set at 10%. After evaluating for DLT, the two highest and safest doses will be used to randomize the remaining 48 patients into the Phase II study to either Smoflipid or control (no active treatment) using a Bayesian Optimal Interval Design. Thus, the Phase II arm will include 24 patients per arm randomized to one of the two most efficacious doses of the study drug based on body weight, while the control group will receive no drug.",
