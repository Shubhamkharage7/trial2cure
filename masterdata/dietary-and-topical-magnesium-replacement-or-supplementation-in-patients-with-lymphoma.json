            "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial investigates the effect of dietary and topical magnesium replacement on magnesium blood levels in patients with lymphoma. Magnesium is an element in the body that is important to cell health. The body cannot make magnesium and it typically comes from the food we eat. In patients who are ill, magnesium is often replaced intravenously (IV) through a vein or by mouth. This study may help researchers find out if being on a magnesium rich diet and using a magnesium lotion on the skin helps to keep magnesium blood levels in an ideal range. This study also investigates side effects and quality of life when receiving different forms of magnesium.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess if dietary replacement with magnesium rich foods and topical magnesium replacement improves serum magnesium levels in patients with a history of a lymphoproliferative disorder, not on active myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and have a serum magnesium levels 1.5 - 1.9 mg/dL.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the compliance of a diet rich in magnesium as well as compliance with topical magnesium replacement in lymphoma patients who have completed therapy and are in remission.\n\nII. Assess feasibility of enrolling patients with a history of lymphoproliferative disorder, not on active treatment with low magnesium levels.\n\nIII. Assess tolerability and toxicity of a magnesium rich diet with and without topical magnesium replacement.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess quality of life in patients receiving magnesium replacement with diet and/or topical magnesium.\n\nII. Evaluate whether magnesium replacement strategies are equally effective between ethnicities.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nCYCLE 1: Participants consume magnesium rich foods orally (PO) daily for 28 days.\n\nCYCLE 2: Participants with a magnesium level between 1.5-2.1 mg/dL at the end of cycle 1 are assigned to Arm I. Patients with a magnesium level between 2.2-2.3 mg/dL at the end of cycle 1 are assigned to Arm II. Patients with a magnesium level \\< 1.5 mg/dL at the end of cycle 1 go off study.\n\nARM I: Participants continue consuming magnesium rich foods PO daily and apply Ancient Minerals Magnesium Lotion topically daily for 28 days.\n\nARM II: Participants continue consuming magnesium rich foods PO daily for 28 days."
