This study looks at whether adipose (fat) tissue contributes to PASC by driving chronic inflammation or by serving as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 persistence. The results will not only determine whether obesity and IR are risk factors for PASC, but will also define fundamental biology that sets the stage for the investigation of novel or existing therapies that target the causal pathways identified."

The insulin sensitivity test is designed to measure how well your cells remove glucose from your blood in response to insulin. During this test participants will have two small catheters (tubing) placed in their veins (I.V. lines). The total amount of blood that will be drawn during this test will be 140 mL of blood (approximately 9.5 tablespoons). Insulin is a natural hormone, and octreotide (a synthetic hormone) is a drug that temporarily blocks the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.
