Each week, participants will engage in 2 activities: a live virtual Wellness Session and an at-home cooking experience using ingredients sent to them via grocery delivery service.\n\nThe study will examine the pre-post difference in overall diet quality, dermal carotenoid levels, physical activity, body composition, and glycemic measures among at-risk black adolescent girls and their caregivers. Investigators hypothesize that after the program, participants' diets will be higher in quality than before."
