Researchers may use this information to predict response (good or bad) of the cervical cancer to treatment and detect recurrent cancer sooner.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the ctDNA detection rate in cervix cancer patients undergoing surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy in the setting of primary, recurrent or metastatic disease.\n\nII. Association of ctDNA baseline levels and clearance kinetics with clinical and radiographic tumor response.\n\nIII. To explore the association of detectable ctDNA at each time point with invasive recurrence-free survival and overall survival.\n\nIV. To explore the use of ctDNA for surveillance and detection of disease recurrence.\n\nV. To create a repository for future exploratory studies including analyzing changes in T cell and other immune cell subpopulations during and following therapy for cervix cancer.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT 1: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to surgery, at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery, every 6 months during year 2, and at the time of recurrence (if applicable).\n\nCOHORT 2: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to the first fraction of radiation, during week 4 of radiotherapy, at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiotherapy, every 6 months during year 2, and at the time of recurrence (if applicable).\n\nCOHORT 3: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to the first fraction of radiation, during week 4 of radiotherapy, on the day of the final fraction of radiotherapy, at 3 months post-radiotherapy, every 3 months during years 1 and 2, and at the time of recurrence (if applicable).\n\nCOHORT 4: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to initiation of chemotherapy or immunotherapy, at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy or immunotherapy, every 3 months during years 1 and 2, and at the time of recurrence (if applicable)."
