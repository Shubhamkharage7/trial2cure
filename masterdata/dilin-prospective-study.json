            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to identify individuals who have suffered a liver injury arising as an idiosyncratic reaction to a prescription drug or a complementary and alternative medicine. Recently added acute cases enrollment that meets criteria to the protocol. Also added Fibroscans to the protocol that will be completed at baseline and follow-up on chronic subjects.",
            "detailedDescription": "Liver injury due to prescription and non-prescription medication use is a medical, scientific and public health problem of increasing frequency and importance in the United States. Indeed, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most important reason for non-approval, withdrawal, limitation in use and clinical monitoring by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, detection of signals for liver injury frequently relies upon the reporting of cases by practitioners to health authorities in post-marketing surveillance. Under-reporting of cases, lack of mandatory reporting systems, and difficulties in establishing a diagnosis make the current system sub-optimal. Moreover, with the growing use of complementary and alternative medications (CAM), there have also been increasing reports of liver toxicity due to various non-prescription herbal, dietary and food additive supplements. Because the manufacturing, dispensing and testing of these products is not regulated, the hepatotoxic potential of these formulations is poorly characterized or completely unknown.\n\nThe DILIN Prospective Study is a multi-centered epidemiological study designed to gather clinical information and biological specimens on cases of suspected liver injury due to drugs and CAM. The goals of this study are to develop a database of recent DILI cases, identify the clinical, environmental and genetic risk factors that predict DILI, develop standardized instruments and terminology and perform careful longitudinal follow-up of DILI subjects. Biological samples collected will be used in future studies of the mechanisms and genetics of DILI.\n\nPatients who are referred to one of the DILIN clinical sites and who, in the opinion of gastroenterologist/hepatologist, experienced a drug-induced liver injury are enrolled. Detailed clinical data and biological specimens are collected. Clinical data will be reviewed by the DILIN Causality Committee and the final determination on whether the subject qualifies as a bona fide DILI case is made by consensus opinion. DILI cases (only) are followed for at least 6 months to derive the longitudinal profile of drug-and CAM-induced liver injury. Detailed clinical data including liver elastography (FibroScans) and biological specimens are collected. Patients who satisfy the definition of chronic DILI will be evaluated with additional FibroScans at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months thereafter."
