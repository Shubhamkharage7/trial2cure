Twenty adult patients with nail psorasis and skin disease qualifying for a systemic agent per investigator will be treated with deucravacitinib 6 mg daily. Subjects will be assessed for a total of 48 weeks. Psoriasis assessments such as the modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index will be conducted. Photos will be used to document nail involvement. Descriptive statistical analysis will be conducted at the conclusion of the study."
