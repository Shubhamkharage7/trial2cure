It is designed to explore acceptability, feasibility and proof of concept/ .",
            "detailedDescription": "Foot ulceration is the most common and costly late complication of diabetes, with morbidity and mortality being worse than many cancers. It is estimated that up to one-third of people with diabetes will develop a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in their lifetime. Non-healing DFUs are a leading cause of hospitalization, amputation, disability, and death among people with diabetes. In the United States, one-third of all diabetes-related costs are spent on diabetic foot care, with two-thirds of the costs incurred in inpatient settings, constituting a substantial economic burden to society. Therefore, every means possible should be used to try to heal DFU and prevent amputation. In this regard, there is a significant body of evidence related to the clinical benefits of exercise for people with DFU, including improving blood flow and oxygen supply, muscle loss prevention, and joint mobility. Despite this evidence, exercise is not part of the standard care for wound healing, mainly because there is no solution for promoting and managing home-based exercise programs for people with DFU.\n\nTo address the gaps described above, we propose an interactive foot and ankle tele-exercise platform called \"Tele-FootX\". This platform allows clinicians to remotely and virtually supervise exercise tasks and coach patients to perform evidence-based foot and ankle exercises inspired by the validated Buerger-Allen (BA), while also educating and monitoring the patients adherence to the exercise program."
