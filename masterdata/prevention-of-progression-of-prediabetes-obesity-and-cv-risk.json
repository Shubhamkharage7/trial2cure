The goal is to use new and affordable treatments to bring blood sugar levels back to normal and help participants to lose weight. The investigators also want to reduce participants risk of heart problems. The study team will look at how these treatments affect metabolism and other body functions to help find new ways to treat diabetes and obesity in the future.",

A placebo is an inactive, harmless substance that looks like the other study drugs. This study does not require overnight stays at the hospital in any of the study groups.\n\nDuration of the Study will be about 6-7 months."
