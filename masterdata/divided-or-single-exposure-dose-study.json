            "detailedDescription": "This study follows a successfully completed project (NCT03254043) to now pursue the investigators overarching goal of optimizing methadone dosing as a method for managing comorbid chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) among persons receiving methadone for the treatment of OUD. Up to 62% of persons maintained on methadone for OUD experience clinically significant pain, versus 31% in the general population. Pain in methadone-maintained persons (MMP) is associated with poor OUD treatment outcomes and severe distress. No effective treatment for comorbid pain and OUD currently exists; though preclinical and human data suggest divided methadone dosing may be a more optimal strategy for managing pain than once daily dosing, this has never been empirically examined. This study will evaluate an intervention for comorbid chronic pain among MMP using a Phase II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled comparison of treatment as usual (TAU) versus split daily methadone dosing for 12-weeks. Methadone will be remotely managed via an electronic pillbox. Outcomes will include weekly assessments of pain and OUD outcomes, ecological momentary assessment of pain before and after dosing, and point-prevalence measures of laboratory-induced pain to explore mechanism of effects. If effective, this approach could transform the care of MMP with pain because it would be feasible to implement within the operational structure of a methadone clinic and would impose low provider burden. Results could provide a high magnitude treatment for the substantial number of MMP who experience daily pain with no reliable form of treatment."
