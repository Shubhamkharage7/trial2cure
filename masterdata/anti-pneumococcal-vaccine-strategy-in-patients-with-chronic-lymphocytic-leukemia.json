            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial compares the effect of initial vaccination (PCV20 followed by PSV23) with yearly vaccinations of PSV23 to the standard 5 year vaccination in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. At present chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients are poorly protected by anti-pneumococcal vaccination. Current vaccination schedule for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients is based on general recommendations in immunocompromised patients (initial vaccination with PCV13 followed by one dose of PSV23 after an interval of two months, followed by revaccination at 5 years). Giving patients frequent immunization as compared to 5 year immunization may result in higher protective titers in patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Proportion of patients with anti-pneumococcal immunogenicity following early revaccination (1 year) at 2 years (Serotype to be measured are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A 19 F and 23F using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\[ELISA\\] method).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Number of patients with anti-pneumococcal immunogenicity at 5 years. II. Number of patients with local and/or general reaction at months 1, 3 as self-reported.\n\nIII. Number of pneumococcal infections.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive PCV 20 IM at week 0. Titers will be checked 4 weeks after this dose. Booster Vaccine: None. Titers will be checked at 12 weeks and then yearly for 5 years.\n\nARM B: Patients receive PCV 20 IM at week 0 and PSV23 IM at week 8. Titers will be checked 4 weeks after the first dose and at 12 weeks (4 weeks after the second dose). Booster Vaccine: None. Annual titers will be checked for 5 years.\n\nARM C: Patients receive PCV 20 IM at week 0 and PSV23 IM at week 8. Titers will be checked 4 weeks after the first dose and at 12 weeks (4 weeks after the second dose). Booster Vaccine: PCV23 booster vaccination dose will be administered yearly for 5 years. Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination (at 4 weeks) titers will be checked each time yearly for 5 years."
