            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and improve Veterans' community reintegration.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal of the proposed project is to use mindfulness practices to reduce depression and improve community reintegration among post-9/11 Veterans. This proposal focuses on the REconnecting to Civilian Life using Activities that Improve Mindfulness (RECLAIM) intervention. RECLAIM is a virtual multi-component, mindfulness-based intervention developed by the study team in collaboration with VA clinicians, post-9/11 Veterans, and stakeholders and guided by the VA Whole Health framework. The proposed project builds on preliminary pilot work and a Small Award Initiative for Impact (SWIFT) pilot project funded by the VA HSR\\&D Center of Innovation. In the SWIFT pilot, the investigators refined the RECLAIM content and tested the feasibility of virtual delivery with a small sample (N=18) using a single arm pre/post-test design. The proposed pilot project builds on preliminary work by (1) testing the refined intervention in a randomized controlled design to assess feasibility of recruitment for a randomized trial, (2) randomization, (3) retention in both study arms, and (4) intervention acceptability. Findings from the proposed project will support a HSR\\&D Investigator Initiated Research Merit award application that will assess the effectiveness of RECLAIM while simultaneously planning for implementation in a Hybrid Type I trial. The following are the specific aims for this pilot project.\n\nAim 1: Conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to assess feasibility of the RECLAIM intervention. The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized pilot study. Veterans (N=48) will be randomized to either the intervention arm (i.e., virtually delivered RECLAIM) or a control arm (i.e., psychoeducation materials). The investigators will assess intervention feasibility, including recruitment, randomization, administration and completion of outcome assessments, treatment engagement, and retention in both the intervention and control study arms.\n\nAim 2: Conduct qualitative interviews to assess acceptability of RECLAIM. A purposefully sampled subgroup (i.e., based on attendance) of RECLAIM participants (i.e., Veterans from the intervention arm; N=16) will engage in a qualitative interview to explore experiences in RECLAIM, including perceived strengths and suggestions for future improvements.\n\nAim 3: Refine and finalize the RECLAIM intervention. As findings emerge from the Aim 1 pilot test and Aim 2 interviews with Veteran participants, the investigators will iteratively update the RECLAIM protocol manual and testing procedures (i.e., randomization, control group materials). The investigators will consult with the Patient Advisory Council of the Indianapolis VAMC to gather Veteran feedback on the revised RECLAIM protocol manual, as well as partners (e.g., Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation). These actions will help refine the study methods, design, and intervention in anticipation of a larger trial."

Difficulty adjusting to civilian life (i.e., reintegration challenges) will be assessed using the Military to Civilian Questionnaire (M2C-Q). For this study, \"some\" difficulty will be defined as a mean M2C-Q score of 2; the M2C-Q developers established a score of 2 as indicative of \"some\" reintegration difficulty and, as such, this is the score we will use in the current study.\n* endorse at least a moderate level of depression. We will use the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms among potential Veteran participants. Moderate depression is defined as a score of 10-14 on the PHQ-9. This strategy for eligibility criteria optimally positions us to target Veterans who will likely benefit most from RECLAIM and to detect intervention effects in a future fully-powered follow-up trial.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Veterans will not be immediately excluded from participation in the study; the study team will consult with the Roudebush Suicide Prevention Team and/or the Veterans' care provider to determine whether continued study participation is appropriate.",
