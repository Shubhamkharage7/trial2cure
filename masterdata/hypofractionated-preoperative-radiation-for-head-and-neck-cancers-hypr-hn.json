Participants will receive a total radiation dose of 46 Gy in 10 fractions (Dose Level 1), 40 Gy in 7 fractions (Dose Level 2), or 35 Gy in 5 fractions (Dose Level 3), depending on the assigned experimental total fractions. Radiation will be delivered using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with a daily cone-beam CT for five days a week, for less than two weeks depending on the assigned dose level at the time of enrollment."

Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy), must agree to one of the following:\n\n   * Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study period and through 60 calendar days after the last dose of study agent, OR\n   * Must also adhere to the guidelines of any study-specific pregnancy prevention program, if applicable, OR\n   * Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence \\[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, postovulation methods\\] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n7. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Radiographic evidence of extranodal extension.\n2. Patients with laryngeal involvement who are candidates for non-surgical laryngeal preservation as deemed by a surgeon and/or radiation oncologist. These patients include, but are not limited to, those with T1-T3 laryngeal cancer who do not have pretreatment tracheostomy and/or feeding tube or those with base of tongue/hypopharyngeal cancers with laryngeal involvement without cartilage invasion or pretreatment tracheostomy and/or feeding tube.\n3. HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma.\n4. Prior invasive malignancy within the past three years (except for non-melanomatous skin cancer, and early stage treated prostate cancer).\n5. Life expectancy less than 12 months.\n6. Zubrod performance status \u2265 3.\n7. Patients with prior radiation therapy to the head and neck (Note: Prior external beam radiotherapy is excluded, but iodine-131 is allowed).\n8. Prior systemic therapy, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic/targeted therapy, or immune therapy for the study cancer.\n9. Body weight \u2264 30 kg.\n10. Any of the following severe laboratory abnormalities within 14 days of registration, unless corrected prior to it: sodium \\< 130 mmol/L or \\> 155 mmol/L; potassium \\< 3.5 mmol/L or \\> 6 mmol/L; fasting glucose \\< 40 mg/dL or \\> 400 mg/dL; serum calcium (ionized or adjusted for albumin) \\< 7 mg/dL or \\> 12.5 mg/dL; magnesium \\< 0.9 mg/dL or \\> 3 mg/dL.\n11. Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within three months prior to step 1 registration.\n12. Transmural myocardial infarction within three months prior to step 1 registration.\n13. Medical or psychiatric illness which would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate treatment or limit compliance with study requirements.\n14. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during treatment and for six months after radiation, this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.
