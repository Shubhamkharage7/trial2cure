In this study, women with opioid use disorder will be randomized to receive treatment-as-usual plus a gender-specific digital intervention or treatment-as-usual only. Feasibility, satisfaction, and engagement with the intervention are the primary outcomes and will be measured post-intervention and at two-week, 6-week, and 12-week follow-up visits.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study has two aims: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of delivering a gender-specific digital intervention (GSDI) to women with opioid use disorder; (2) to collect preliminary estimates on the effect of the GSDI on engagement in medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to achieve these aims. Women (N=40) who have recently initiated MOUD (within 30 days) will be enrolled and randomized to receive either the GSDI+TAU (gender-specific digital intervention + treatment as usual) or TAU-only. Feasibility, satisfaction, and engagement with the GSDI are the primary outcomes and will be measured post-intervention and at two-week, 6-week, and 12-week follow-ups. MOUD engagement will be assessed at two time-points: (1) 6-weeks and (2) 12-weeks post-enrollment to collect preliminary estimates on the effect of the GSDI on MOUD engagement."

Participants complete the web-based portion immediately after completing baseline assessments. The mobile component includes three parts: (1) weekly self-report surveys of opioid and other substance use and medication adherence, (2) weekly skills-practice exercises, and (3) daily motivational messages encouraging self-care.
