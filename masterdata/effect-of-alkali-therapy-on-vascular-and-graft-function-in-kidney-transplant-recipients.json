            "briefSummary": "Lower serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal laboratory range, in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are associated with an increased risk of graft loss, cardiovascular events and mortality. Because acid retention is common in KTRs, it is plausible that alkali therapy in KTRs may also result in improved vascular and graft function. The investigators will perform a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 12 month study in 120 KTRs to examine the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy on surrogate markers of CVD and graft function. The overall hypothesis is that treatment with bicarbonate will improve indicators of vascular and graft function in KTRs by decreasing complement activation."
