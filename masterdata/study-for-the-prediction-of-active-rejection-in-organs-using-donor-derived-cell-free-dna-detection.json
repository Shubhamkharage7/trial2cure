Relevant medical data will also be collected for each patient enrolled.\n\nUrine samples may also be collected at the above described time-points.\n\nUp to 500 subjects over the age of 2 worldwide who meet the study eligibility criteria are expected to be enrolled in this study.

We are also measuring the donor cell free DNA, which is presumably indicating of an organ being rejected or not. Alterations in the cut off of that donor derived cell free DNA level that is allocated to high risk of rejection will be explored. Sensitivity and specificity of our assay will be calculated as needed for the purpose of validating and improving our technology in detecting donor derived cfDNA from a transplant recipient's blood.
