CARv3-TEAM-E T cells are administered in subjects up to six times in main Study #20-532.\n\nNo investigational treatment will be administered in this study.\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 2018) recommend long-term follow-up for subjects treated with gene therapy drug products to monitor for selected adverse events (AEs) and the durability of clinical response.\n\nAfter the subjects in the parent study has been completed (24 months after CARv3-TEAM-E T cells infusion, or \\<24 months after CARv3-TEAM-E infusion if subject discontinues due to disease progression or any other reason), subjects will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up study."
