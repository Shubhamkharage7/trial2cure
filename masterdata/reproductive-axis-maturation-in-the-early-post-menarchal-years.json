            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMost adult women with irregular periods of unknown cause report symptoms dating back to early adolescence. This study aims to learn how girls' periods change in the 2 years after their first period. We are also looking at girls who may have a condition called PCOS. This will help researchers learn what healthy puberty looks like and how they can spot signs of hormone problems early on.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn how long it takes girls to develop regular menstrual cycles after their first period.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy girls ages 8-14 who either (1) haven't had their first period but show signs of puberty, such as breast development and hair in the genital area; or (2) had their first period in the past 6 months\n\nGirls at risk for PCOS age 8-14 who have a mom or sister with PCOS\n\nGirls with irregulat menstrual cycles age 11-17.5\n\nTo compare with the girls, we are looking at women \\>=18-34 years old with PCOS,\n\nHealthy women \\>= 18-34 years old without PCOS\n\nDesign:\n\nBoth parents or guardians must allow their daughter to participate. They must attend all study visits with her.\n\nParticipants will first be screened by phone. Those who qualify will be screened in person. They will have a physical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will have an ultrasound of their abdomen. They will fill out questionnaires. They will sit in a BOD POD for 6 minutes: This is an egg- shaped machine that takes body measurements. They have the option to provide DNA samples.\n\nParticipants will have sets of visits at home or at the clinic about every 6 months. The number of visits in each set will depend on their menstrual cycle. Then they will have a final visit. Visits will include repeats of the screening tests. There are additional parts that participants may choose to be involved in depending on how involved they want to be.\n\nAt home, participants will collect their urine daily to measure hormones. They will keep a diary of their periods.\n\nAdults: Women with known PCOS will complete the same Screening Visit as the girls and will collect dried urine specimens at home for 8 weeks;\n\nThe Healthy control women group will complete the same Screening Visit as the girls and collect dried urine specimens at home for 2 menstrual cycles.",
            "detailedDescription": "The broad goal of these studies is to determine the physiologic and pathophysiologic underpinnings of irregular menstrual cycles among adolescents in general and those with increased genetic risk for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in the early postmenarchal\n\nperiod. Irregular menstruation affects \\> 2.5 million reproductive-age women in the US each year1. Most adult women with oligomenorrhea of unknown etiology reporting symptoms dating back to early adolescence. Importantly, irregular menstrual cycles during the teenage years may be a harbinger of future health risks extending beyond the reproductive system; among the nearly 80,000 female participants the Nurses' Health Study II, those with irregular and long cycles during adolescence and adulthood had a greater risk of premature mortality, particularly related to cardiovascular disease. While a period of cycle irregularity is well-described in the first few years after menarche, a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of normal reproductive axis development in the post-menarchal female has hampered our ability to distinguish abnormal from normal developmental trajectories. Moreover, the commonly held belief that menstrual irregularity among teenage girls is normal has also delayed detection of pathology in reproductive development, precluding institution of early preventative strategies to curtail future reproductive morbidity."
