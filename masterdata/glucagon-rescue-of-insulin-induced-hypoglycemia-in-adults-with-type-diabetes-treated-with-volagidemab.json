            "briefSummary": "This trial is designed to evaluate the effect of glucagon receptor antagonism by volagidemab (once weekly) on glucose recovery from hypoglycemia after treatment with glucagon in adults with type 1 diabetes. After informed consent, Screening procedures to establish subject eligibility will be performed within a period of 28 days. Approximately 24 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on stable doses of insulin will be enrolled.\n\nAfter enrollment, subjects will undergo a baseline Hypoglycemia Recovery Procedure (with glucagon rescue). Subjects will then receive volagidemab subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 6 weeks. At the end of the treatment phase, subjects will undergo a second Hypoglycemia Recovery Procedure. Subjects will be followed for 6 weeks after the last volagidemab dose with a final End-of-Study (EOS) visit during Week 12. The primary outcome will be the change in time to glucagon treatment success at Week 6 versus baseline."
