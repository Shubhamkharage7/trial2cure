            "detailedDescription": "Aim: Conduct a pilot study (N=12; 10 completers) of Web-TIRELESS followed by virtual exit interviews with adult patients with painful nontraumatic upper extremity conditions and comorbid risky substance use. The investigators will use this mixed methods information to assess the feasibility, credibility, and acceptability of Web-TIRELESS and optimize the program and study methodology in preparation for a pilot feasibility randomized control trial (RCT).\n\nThe Web-TIRELESS program, adapted from the Toolkit for Optimal Recovery (P# 2020P000095), consists of 4 on-demand video sessions each being approximately 30-45 minutes long. The sessions aim to teach mind-body skills, cognitive-behavioral strategies (e.g., reframing, pain and substance use urge surfing), activity pacing, acceptance and commitment skills, and psychoeducation on the association between substance use and pain. Each session will consist of a combination of short (5-10 min) educational videos, exercises, and guided home practice goal-setting. At the end of each session, each participant will complete an interactive quiz that covers the subject of the session to facilitate deeper understanding and internalization of the session content. The interactive quiz format has been demonstrated to be useful for learning new information, including among orthopedic patients. Between sessions, participants will be encouraged to practice program skills at home. Home practice materials include Web-based audio and video clips (e.g., 5 min mindfulness of pain and substance urge). Outside the on-demand sessions, participants will continue to use the web-based platform to guide and log their home practice.\n\nAfter completion of the program, participants will attend a one-time 15-30 minute exit interview to share their perceptions of Web-TIRELESS and any recommendations to improve quality. This information will be used to further adapt and optimize Web-TIRELESS prior to future study phases.\n\nAssessments: Participants will complete baseline and post-test assessments."
