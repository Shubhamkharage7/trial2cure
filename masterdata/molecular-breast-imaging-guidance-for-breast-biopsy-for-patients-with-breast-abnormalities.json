            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests how well molecular breast imaging (MBI) works to guide the collection of a breast biopsy in patients with a breast abnormality. Currently, a biopsy is often guided by either ultrasound or mammography in order to ensure that a sample of the correct part of the breast is taken. Sometimes a lesion or part of the lesion cannot be seen on ultrasound or mammography, and, therefore, a biopsy guided with ultrasound or mammography may not be always be accurate. Studies have shown that high resolution MBI may have potential to improve the detection of some breast tumors. This trial uses a new high-resolution MBI system that may help perform a biopsy using MBI.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate a methodology for MBI-guided biopsy of suspicious breast lesions.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 study parts.\n\nPART I: Patients receive technetium Tc-99m sestamibi intravenously (IV) and undergo MBI on study.\n\nPART II: Patients receive technetium Tc-99m sestamibi IV and undergo MBI. Patients whose breast lesions of interest are visualized on MBI then undergo breast biopsy using the Stereo Navigator accessory.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients may be asked to follow up at 3-6 months."
