The goal of the Expansion phase of the study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK at the selected RDE and identify the RP2D for NKT2152 in combination with palbociclib (Doublet) and with palbociclib and sasanlimab (Triplet) in subjects with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who received prior therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 2 open-label, multicenter, global study of NKT2152. This study is designed as two phases: a Lead-in phase and an Expansion phase. Patients must be 18 years or older, with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Eligible patients must have progressed or relapsed after at least 1 prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) systemic therapy and 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or metastatic ccRCC alone or in combination.\n\nThe Lead-in phase is designed as a dose escalation phase to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of NKT2152 in combination with palbociclib and sasanlimab in advanced or metastatic ccRCC patients who received prior therapy.\n\nThe subsequent Expansion phase will evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK at the selected RDE and identify the RP2D for NKT2152 in combination with palbociclib and sasanlimab in advanced or metastatic ccRCC patients who received prior therapy."
