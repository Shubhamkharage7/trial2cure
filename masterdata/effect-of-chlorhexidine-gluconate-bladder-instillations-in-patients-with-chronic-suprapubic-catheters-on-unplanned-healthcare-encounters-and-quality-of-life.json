            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of 0.05% Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CGH) bladder instillations in an outpatient setting at the time of suprapubic catheter (SPC) exchange in patients with history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). The main questions are:\n\n1. is instillation of 150mL of CGH for five-minute duration at the time of SPC exchange feasible in an outpatient setting and tolerable for patients.\n2. does this protocol decrease the rate of unplanned health care visits and improve patient quality of life.\n\nPatients will undergo the treatment protocol during their routine suprapubic catheter exchanges.",
            "detailedDescription": "Bacterial colonization is present in up to 95% of chronically catheterized patients. Although a positive urine culture collected from an indwelling catheter is not in isolation indicative of an acute urinary tract infection (UTI), long term catheter use is associated with increased rates of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI), pyelonephritis, and bacteremia. Using antibiotics for prevention of infections in this patient population can be challenging given the side effects, cost, and emergence of resistant bacteria with antibiotic therapy. To limit systemic side effects, intravesical irrigation is a promising route of medication administration. The use of a non-antibiotic anti-microbial at the time of SPC exchange would eliminate the obstacles of non-compliance and antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic irrigation for preventive therapy. Irrisept, a 0.05% Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) irrigation in sterile water, could be a promising agent to reduce symptomatic UTIs and unplanned tube changes in chronically catheterized patients.\n\nThe proposed route of intravesical instillation involves the administration of a therapeutic agent directly into the bladder via a urinary catheter. This route allows for local contact with bladder mucosa and urinary pathogens. It is a currently accepted route of administration used for therapeutics in urologic conditions including, but not limited to UTI prophylaxis, bladder cancer, hemorrhagic cystitis, and interstitial cystitis. Benefits of intravesical instillation include maximizing exposure of the therapeutic within the bladder while limiting systemic absorption and side effects.\n\nA volume 150cc is based on current clinical administration of bladder instillations. Current intravesical drug delivery is most commonly utilized in volumes 50-150cc for in-office instillation. Population studies of normal volunteers demonstrate that 1st bladder sensation occurs between 125-200cc with subsequent desire to void occurring between 170-370cc. Increasing instillation volumes greater than 150cc, especially in the chronically catheterized population, can lead to patient discomfort or dysreflexia and inability to tolerate the therapy without analgesia or anesthetic."
