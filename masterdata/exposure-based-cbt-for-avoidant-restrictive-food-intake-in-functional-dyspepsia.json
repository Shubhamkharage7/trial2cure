Participants randomized into the CBT group will receive eight 1-hour sessions delivered weekly via the MGH-approved secure video platform Enterprise Zoom while the usual care group will be allowed to continue with treatment they are already receiving at the time of randomization. Participants in the usual care group will be offered CBT after study participation. We will determine the feasibility and acceptability of the CBT and explore changes in clinical outcomes and preliminary mechanisms."
