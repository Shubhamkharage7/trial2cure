In addition, the investigators will see if the stimulation helps regulate body temperature when in a cool environment. The study will consist of 7 visits, that will be between 3-4 hours in duration, separated by no less than 3 days. Visit 1 will consist of determining baseline autonomic function and screening visit. The participant will undergo a sit up set to determine hypotension and orthostatic hypotension and complete a couple surveys. Visits 2 and 3 will determine which site the stimulation parameters should be on the spine, either T7-T8 or T11-12. The site that increases seated systolic blood pressure will be used for the rest of the study. Visits 4 and 5 will consists of putting the electrode at the optimal spot on the spine and completing a submaximal arm ergometry exercise and the other visit will be a sham visit. Visits 6 and 7 will consist of assessing core temperature when in a cool environment with the stimulator on and off."
