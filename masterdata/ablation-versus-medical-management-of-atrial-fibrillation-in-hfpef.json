The PVI procedure has been shown to be safe and comparably effective in treating Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in HFpEF patients, but no studies have yet demonstrated the effects of catheter ablation on exercise capacity or clinical outcomes.\n\nThe investigators propose a prospective, non-blinded randomized control pilot study to assess the feasibility of conducting larger scale studies to determine if there are differences between catheter ablation with medical management on exercise capacity and quality of life in HFpEF patients with AF. The investigators' study will be powered for AF burden reduction, and the investigators hope to use the effect size on exercise capacity and heart failure events to help determine power for larger clinical studies that will follow to shed light on how invasive management of atrial fibrillation may impact the natural history of individuals with these two cardiovascular conditions."
