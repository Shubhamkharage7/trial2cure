This is an observational study with no study intervention or randomization.\n\nParticipants will undergo baseline history and physical, 12-lead EKG, laboratory studies of blood/serum/urine, echocardiography, activity questionnaire, 6 minute walk test, and placement of wearable devices to be worn for up to 14 days (activity monitors, EKG monitor and continuous glucose monitor).\n\nParticipants will return after \\~14 days of wearing the devices and repeat of physical examination, 12-lead EKG, 6 minute walk test, activity questionnaire. Additionally, participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their leg with exercise, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and, for those who qualify, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their heart with exercise."
