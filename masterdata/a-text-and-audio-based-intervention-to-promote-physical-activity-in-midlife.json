In Move with Meaning, participants will listen to weekly audio sessions and complete twice weekly text message sessions, in which they will set a weekly physical activity goal. The primary outcome is feasibility (measured by number of successful text message sessions sent). Secondary outcomes include acceptability and preliminary impact on physical activity, psychological health-, and physical health-related outcomes."
