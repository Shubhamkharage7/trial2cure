            "briefSummary": "* Endoscopic strip craniectomy (ESC) with post-operative helmeting is the gold-standard treatment for isolated, non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis in children under 6 months of age as it is has been demonstrated to reduce perioperative morbidity when compared to more invasive procedures such as cranial vault remodeling. ESC is frequently performed with or without the use of lateral osteotomies with technical selection being largely based on surgeon preference.\n* Previous studies have shown that there are no statistically significant differences in cranial expansion or complications between the two procedure variants; however, these studies are retrospective in nature and do not account for aesthetic outcomes.\n* The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of ESC with or without the use of lateral osteotomies in regard to cranial expansion and aesthetic outcomes for children treated with isolated, non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis. In addition, we seek to investigate if there are any observable changes in perioperative morbidity between the two procedures.",
            "detailedDescription": "* This prospective, randomized parallel study seeks to compare the efficacy of ESC with or without the use of lateral osteotomies in regard to cranial expansion and aesthetic outcomes for children treated with isolated, non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis.\n* Both arms of the study will undergo standard care throughout their participation which includes preoperative \\& postoperative measurements of cephalic index using the STARscanner\u00a9 (Orthomerica products Inc.), preoperative \\& postoperative photographs, post-operative helmeting, and standard post-operative visits.\n* Additional research-related activities include chart review. Primary outcomes include degree of cranial expansion at 1 year post-operatively.\n* Secondary outcomes include aesthetic appearance at 1 year post-operatively (using a 5-point Likert scale) and a multitude of intraoperative clinical variables including estimated blood loss, instances of transfusion, instances of dural tear, instances of 30-day readmission, and instances of needing further surgery."
