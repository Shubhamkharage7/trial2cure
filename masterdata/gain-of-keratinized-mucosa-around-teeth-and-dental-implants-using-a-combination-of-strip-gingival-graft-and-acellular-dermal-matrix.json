To evaluate to determine if either grafting technique (FGG vs SGG+ADM) demonstrates superiority in clinical (amount of KT increase, tissue thickness increase, and practitioner-assessed esthetics) and patient-centered outcomes (pain, swelling, change in daily activities, and patient-assessed esthetics) in a controlled study."
