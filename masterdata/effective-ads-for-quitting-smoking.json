            "detailedDescription": "This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of efficacy-based quit smoking ads in a 5 (theme) x 6 (ad) mixed factorial randomized design.\n\nRecruitment: A survey company will recruit \\~1,400 participants. Participants will complete a screener to confirm that they are US adults (ages 21+), currently smoke menthol cigarettes, and are able to read and speak English. A portion of the sample will be nationally representative, and a portion will be a convenience sample.\n\nInformed Consent: The consent form will appear on the first page of the survey. Participants will provide their consent to be in the trial by clicking on a button that forwards to the next page of the survey.\n\nRandomization: After consent, the survey software will randomize participants to 1 of 5 themes between-subjects. The design will include 3 intervention ad themes about quitting smoking (self-efficacy ads, response efficacy ads, or motivation ads) and 2 control ad themes about neutral non-smoking related topics (reading or password safety).\n\nEach participant will view 6 ads on their assigned theme, presented in a random order.\n\nAssessment: Participants will complete a \\~15 minute online survey one time."
