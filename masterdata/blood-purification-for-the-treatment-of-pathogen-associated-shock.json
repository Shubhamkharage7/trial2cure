            "briefSummary": "This study is a multi-center, randomized controlled feasibility trial to evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of a novel extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) therapy in critically ill patients with pathogen associated shock across 15 U.S. sites. Adults (18 years old and older) admitted to the ICU with all of the following:\n\n\u2022 Pathogen associated shock defined as:\n\n* The need for vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) \u2265 65 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation\n* Presence of a pathogen detected in the bloodstream within 72 hours of screening using commercially available in-vitro diagnostic testing",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive either treatment with the investigational device (Seraph 100) + 'State of the Art' care versus 'State of the Art' care alone. This study is a multi-center, un-blinded, randomized controlled feasibility trial to evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of Seraph 100 in critically ill patients with pathogen associated shock across 15 US sites. This study will not be done in a blinded fashion from either the patient or caregiver perspective given: 1) the need for invasive, central line placement, and 2) to ensure that limited hospital resources (e.g., hemodialysis machines) are available for patients that require therapy. While the study trial will not be conducted in a blinded fashion, the members of the study team that do the data analysis will be blinded.\n\nThe target population is adults (18 years old and older) admitted to the ICU with all of the following:\n\n* Pathogen associated shock AND\n* The need for vasopressors at any dose to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) \u2265 65 mm Hg despite adequate fluid resuscitation.\n\nStudy Arms: Patients will be randomized to receive either Arm 1: Seraph 100 treatment plus 'State of the Art' or Arm 2: 'State of the Art' care alone. \"State of the Art care\" will be defined as the treatment algorithms outlined in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign for the treatment of septic shock, available at https://www.sccm.org/SurvivingSepsisCampaign/Home.\n\nStudy Randomization and stratification: Patients who qualify will be immediately randomized. The study will randomize patients 2:1 to investigational product plus 'State of the Art' care and 'State of the Art' alone, respectively. Upon randomization, patients will be stratified by age (\u226565 and \\<65). While ideally, the research team would stratify by other variables (to include demographics, causative pathogen, GCS, SOFA, associated organ failure, and pre-existing conditions), given the small number of patients in this trial (particularly in the control group) this is not possible.\n\nThe Seraph 100 Microbind\u00ae Affinity Blood Filter (Seraph 100) manufactured by ExThera Medical Corporation in Martinez, CA.\n\nInvestigational Treatment Duration for Seraph 100: A sufficient blood flow rate and exposure of the patient's blood to the Seraph 100 adsorption media will optimize the treatment success with a target total filtered blood volume of 100L per day. Based on the target total filtered blood volume of 100L, the average treatment duration and blood flow rates are captured below:\n\nAverage Blood Flow Rate Treatment Duration 350 ml/min 5 hours 300 ml/min 6 hours 250 ml/min 7 hours 200 ml/min 8 hours\n\n* At an average blood flow of 350mL/min, this would translate to almost 5 hours of treatment time; an average of 200mL/min would mean a treatment time of 8 hours.\n* Treatments will occur daily for up to 4 consecutive days or until all of the following criteria are met:\n\n  * Vasopressor-free for \\>24h\n  * MAP\u226565\n* Treatments will be held if subjects are unable to tolerate extra-corporeal therapy (defined as MAP\\<65 despite fluids and vasopressors)\n\nPatients will be assessed daily while hospitalized as part of routine, standard of care in the ICU. All patients enrolled in this study will undergo clinical efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Blood, urine, and respiratory samples will be obtained at baseline, Day 1 (pre/post treatment) through Day 4, Day 7, and Day 28. Demographic and baseline clinical parameters will be recorded at the time of randomization. Pertinent clinical parameters will be recorded hourly for the first 96 hours, once on day 7, and once on day 28. SOFA scores will be recorded daily for the first 7 days. Outcomes data will be recorded on day 28 and at the time of hospital discharge or death. Patient status will be assessed at 30, 60, and 90 days to include vital signs, physical examination, adverse event evaluation, and a targeted medication review. Survival status will be assessed 90 days after enrollment (if the patient is no longer hospitalized).\n\nThe first 10 patients randomized to interventional therapy, as well as the first 5 patients randomized to the control group, will undergo additional pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of antimicrobial removal by the filter treatment. These first 15 total patients enrolled must also meet all requirements for the main portion of the study.\n\nAs part of the initial PK study, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also review safety data after the first 5 device patients consented and treated. Safety and PK data will also be reviewed after the first 10 device patients are consented and treated. If there are significant safety concerns after DSMB review, the sponsor will immediately pause the trial and communicate the information with the FDA.\n\nThe PK results of the first 10 treatment patients will be reported to FDA for review to confirm the proposed dosing prior to commencing enrollment of the remaining subjects for a total of 60 patients."

The Seraph 100 filter has been designed and manufactured to reduce residual risks as much as possible to ensure safe usage. Literature search results concluded that heparin-coated medical devices are safe and decrease platelet adhesion without affecting the adsorption of major adhesive proteins. The efficacy, safety, and risk-benefit data of the studies suggest that Seraph 100 is also safe and potentially beneficial by reducing the rate of thrombosis, without its use entailing a risk for patients. The achieved results from the above-mentioned testing and studies support the performance and safety of Seraph 100 consistent with the intended use. ExThera Medical concludes that the known and potential benefits of Seraph 100, when used to treat patients with pathogen associated shock, outweigh the known and potential risks when used according to the intended use.",
