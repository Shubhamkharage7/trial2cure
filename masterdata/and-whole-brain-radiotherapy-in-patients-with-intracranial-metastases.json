            "detailedDescription": "In Part A, 10 subjects will receive MW151 in an open label evaluation. At least 5 of these subjects will be male. For each subject, safety and tolerability data for the first 24 hours will be reviewed prior to the continuation of dosing. Subjects will also be evaluated for safety during week 1, during week 2, and at week 4. Once the data from Part A have been reviewed by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) for males and females, an additional 30 subjects will be recruited to Part B. These subjects will also receive open label MW-151.\n\nIn both parts A and B subjects will take study drug (males), or the first daily dose of study drug (females) before WBRT which will be administered once a day (3Gy), five days a week (Monday to Friday) for two weeks, for total of ten treatments and 30 Gy."
