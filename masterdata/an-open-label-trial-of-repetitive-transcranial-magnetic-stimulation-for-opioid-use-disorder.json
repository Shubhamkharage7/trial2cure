The primary outcome will be the assessment of whether rTMS reduces substance use. Additional exploratory outcomes include the assessment of whether rTMS applied to the DLPFC provides neuromodulatory effects through the assessment of craving, inhibitory control, and functional connectivity via MRI. The targeted sample size for this open-label study, where all enrolled subjects will receive 9 sessions of active rTMS over 3 weeks."
