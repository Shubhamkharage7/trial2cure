This project utilizes a patient-centered observational design to recruit and assess older adults who are interested in using cannabis compared to a control group who is not interested in cannabis use. Investigators will gather data on both the beneficial and harmful effects of edible cannabis of varying composition (THC-only vs. CBD-only vs. THC+CBD), and will examine the process by which older adult cannabis users decide what type of cannabis product is preferred."
