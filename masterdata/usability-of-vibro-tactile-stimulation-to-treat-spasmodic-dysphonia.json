This work addresses a clinical need to develop alternative or auxiliary treatments for a rare voice disorder with very limited treatment options. Successful completion of the proposed work will be an important step in advancing laryngeal VTS as a therapeutic intervention for improving voice symptoms in SD."

The participants will be asked to apply for VTS at home over a period of 8 weeks. The participants will be asked to use this device for 3 days in the first week, 4 days in the second week, 5 days in the third week and 6 days in the fourth week.
