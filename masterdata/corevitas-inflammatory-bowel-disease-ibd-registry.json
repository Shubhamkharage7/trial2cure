            "briefSummary": "This prospective, non-interventional research registry is designed to study the comparative effectiveness and comparative safety of approved treatments for IBD in a cohort of patients cared for by gastroenterologists across North America. Secondary objectives include analyzing the epidemiology and natural history of the disease, its comorbidities, and current treatment practices.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of the CorEvitas Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Registry is to create a national cohort of patients with IBD. The diseases under study include Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Data collected will be used to better characterize the natural history of the disease and to extensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications approved for the treatment of IBD. This will be done through the standardized collection of validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities and adverse events, medication utilization patterns, and patient productivity measures.\n\nThe design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with IBD under the care of a certified gastroenterologist. Longitudinal follow-up data is collected from both patients and their treating gastroenterologist during routine clinical encounters using CorEvitas registry questionnaires. These questionnaires collect data on patient demographics, disease duration, medical history (including all prior and current treatments for IBD), smoking status, alcohol use, disease activity and severity, pain, as well as other clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities and adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, and other targeted safety outcomes.\n\nAfter the enrollment visit, IBD patients and physicians will complete the follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals, not to exceed 2 visits in any 12 month period.\n\nAdverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result of general questioning by the Investigator. During all CorEvitas related visits with the Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events."
