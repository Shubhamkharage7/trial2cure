Medical trainees (physicians who are residents or fellows), are eligible if they have at least one continuity clinic session per week on average in the study clinic. Trainees must have plans to be working in a study clinic for approximately 8 months or longer. They must be able to provide prescriptions for controlled substances (Schedule III) either directly or through their preceptor(s).\n\nPatient Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* The participant's PCP is enrolled in the study.\n* Age 18 years or older.\n* Spoken and written proficiency in language of study materials, as determined by patient self-report and research staff evaluation.\n* Moderate to severe substance use disorder for opioids, stimulants, and/or alcohol, (defined as meeting four or more DSM-5 criteria per substance as measured on the CIDI-adapted for DSM-5).\n* a) Patients having alcohol use disorder without an opioid or stimulant SUD are required to have current opioid or stimulant use, as measured on the TAPS tool or baseline monthly survey.\n* Current polysubstance use, defined as self-reported use of two or more substances of concern in the past 30 days, at least one of which is required to be an opioid or stimulant. Substances of concern include opioids (illicit opioids, nonmedical use of prescription opioids), stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine), alcohol (heavy drinking defined as more than 5 for men and 4 for women drinks on a single occasion), and benzodiazepines (nonmedical use). Nonmedical use includes using prescription medications more than prescribed, or that were not prescribed to the individual taking them.\n* Patients must report on the baseline monthly survey use in the past 30 days of at least one substance at or above the following thresholds: \\>10 days for opioids; \\>10 days for alcohol heavy drinking; \\>7 days for stimulants. These minimum thresholds reflect levels of use that are typical for individuals with moderate to severe SUD, and are lower for stimulants than for opioids and alcohol to reflect the different patterns of use that are observed in prior trials.\n* Access to a reliable cell phone or willing to accept a phone as part of the incentive for completing the baseline visit (as determined by patient self-report).\n* Able to provide sufficient contact information (minimum of one locator).\n* Willing and able to provide written informed consent.\n\nPCP Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Definite plan to resign from the clinic in the next eight months, per PCP self-report. Residents and fellows will need at least eight months before training completion to enroll.\n\nPatient Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Currently being treated with medication for OUD (MOUD), and do not have moderate to severe AUD or StUD\n* Initiated MOUD treatment (buprenorphine, methadone, or XR-NTX) within the 30 days prior to screening, per patient self-report. Because substance use may fall rapidly with the initiation of MOUD, patients who recently started MOUD may already be in the process of making changes to their substance use that are not attributable to the intervention.\n* a) Initiation is defined as starting a new MOUD treatment episode, after not receiving MOUD treatment in the prior 30 days\n* Initiated a SUD treatment program within the 30 days prior to screening, per patient self-report. Because substance use may fall rapidly with the initiation of a treatment program, patients who recently initiated treatment may already be making changes to their substance use that are not attributable to the intervention. SUD treatment program includes outpatient or residential programs for alcohol/drug treatment; does not include detox or short-term inpatient episodes (\\<15 days), or peer support (e.g., 12-Step Program such as AA/NA, Smart Recovery)\n* a) Initiation is defined as starting a new treatment episode, after not being in a SUD treatment program in the prior 30 days\n* Pregnancy, as determined by patient self-report.\n* Are currently in jail, prison, or other overnight facility as required by court of law or have pending legal action that could prevent participation in study activities\n* Definite plan to leave the area or the clinical practice within the next six months, per patient self-report.\n* Other factors that may cause harm or increased risk to the participant or close contacts or preclude the patient's full adherence with or completion of the study (e.g. unstable/severe acute mental illness).",
