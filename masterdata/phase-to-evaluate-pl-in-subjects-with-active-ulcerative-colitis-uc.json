The study treatment will be for 8 weeks. The study will measure safety and the body's ability to handle PL8177 and look at the improvement and healing of the intestine after 8 weeks of treatment. The study will include adult males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females with acute Ulcerative Colitis (UC).",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will have potential subjects participating for approximately 4 months: Subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility within 28 days prior to the first dose administration; Day 1 will be eligibility confirmation and in-clinic dosing; additional visits to occur at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Routine laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG will be measured as well as blood, stool and tissue samples obtained for biomarker and PK studies. Endoscopy is required at screening visit and week 8 visit. Patients will also be given an electronic diary to enter on a daily basis for the duration of their participation. Additional patient questionnaires will be done at clinic visits. Optional genomics testing will also be completed for this study to help look at genes and their effect on inflammation."
