In Phase Ia, using a 3+3 design, escalating doses of AVA6000 will be administered to patients with a range of solid tumour types to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). In Phase 1b, the selected RP2D dose will be assessed in one to three tumour types.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study investigating AVA6000 monotherapy administered intravenously (IV) in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic solid tumours.\n\nThe study will be conducted in two parts: Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) and Phase 1b (Dose Expansion):\n\nPhase 1a (Dose Escalation): The dose-escalation phase is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and MTD and/or RP2D of AVA6000, administered as monotherapy\n\nPhase 1b (Dose Expansion): The dose-expansion phase will comprise 1 to 3 expansion arms in specific tumour types to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVA6000 at the MTD or RP2D when administered as monotherapy. The tumour types to be explored in Phase 1b, will be determined based on evaluation of the Phase 1a data and the protocol will be amended accordingly."
