            "briefSummary": "When patients have surgery on the head and face, stitches are the standard way to close the wound. Wounds always result in a scar, but doctors are always looking for ways to reduce scarring. Several studies have been done to test ways to close wounds that reduce scarring. The most commonly performed closure technique uses running sutures, where a single strand of suture is continued along the length of the wound with a series of uninterrupted stiches. However, alternative closure techniques exist such as the running locking suture, which can offer advantages such as improved tension and thus reduce post-operative complications with better aesthetic outcome. In this study, half the wound will be stitched with standard running sutures and the other half will be stitched with running locking sutures. This will allow us to see if the side with running locking sutures heals with less scarring.",
            "detailedDescription": "Following cutaneous surgical procedures, scar formation is inevitable. Reducing the degree of scar formation and achieving the best aesthetic outcome remains prominent within the dermatological literature.\n\nWound closure can be achieved by a variety of suturing techniques. After the dermis is closed using deep sutures, the epidermis is closed with a second layer of sutures for additional reinforcement. Approximating the epidermis is commonly performed with running sutures, where a single strand of suture is continued along the length of the wound with a series of uninterrupted stiches.\n\nRunning locking sutures are another technique that can achieve secondary layer closure of wounds. Like the running suture, the first anchoring knot is made at one end of the wound, but rather than pulling all of the suture material through after completing the throw, a loop of suture is left from the beginning of the throw, and the needle is then passed through the loop of suture, locking the suture in place. This is repeated until reaching the end of the wound, where the suture material is then tied to the loop using an instrument tie for the final throw. This technique may achieve better hemostasis by improving eversion and providing more equal tension across all loops of the running suture.\n\nTo our knowledge, the impact of scar cosmesis and rate of post-operative complications using a running locking suture technique in comparison to using standard running sutures for primary linear repair of surgical wounds has not been studied. This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of an alternative suturing technique for epidermal approximation by using individuals as their own controls in a split-scar model."
