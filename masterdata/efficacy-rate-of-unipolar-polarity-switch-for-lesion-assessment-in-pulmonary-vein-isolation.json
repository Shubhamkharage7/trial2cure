            "detailedDescription": "One initial study reported that unipolar atrial EGM modification was a useful end point for RF energy delivery. They compared 2 groups of patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing PVI facilitated by an electroanatomic mapping system, merged preprocedural LA computed tomographic scan, and a circular mapping catheter.\n\nThey were the first to use intraprocedural electrogram morphology as a measure of lesion effectiveness in an attempt to achieve durable PVI. The technique, clearly led to shortened procedural time, radiation exposure, and superiority in outcomes, with the implementation of a reproducible, readily available intraprocedural tool that can be applied universally.\n\nAs there is scant data is this area with lack of randomized human trials, planned on building and further validating evidence from Bortone et al in demonstrating that loss of unipolar negative component during PVI can serve a great adjuvant tool for achieving durability of PVI with overall lesser procedural time and no significant increase in adverse events."
