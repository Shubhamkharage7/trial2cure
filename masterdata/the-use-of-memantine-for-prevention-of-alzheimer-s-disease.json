            "briefSummary": "As the US population ages, the prevalence of dementia is increasing, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent one. Solving the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) epidemic is likely to require preventive therapy beginning many years before symptoms are expected to be evident in at-risk individuals. AD is caused by the dysfunction, loss of synapses, and eventual neuronal death, which may occur up to 25 years before clinical symptoms appear. This study, based off of pre-clinical data, seeks to assess whether it is feasible to use memantine hydrochloride for the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "The use of memantine for prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is designed to assess the feasibility of the use of memantine hydrochloride for prevention of AD and provide design elements for a Phase 3 efficacy study.\n\nUp to 128 subjects will be enrolled/screened to achieve a sample size of 32 randomized participants with a 1:1 randomization allocation. The study population will include individuals, 50-65 years of age, who are APOE4 positive with a family history of Alzheimer's Disease who meet all other eligibility criteria.\n\nThe schedule of assessments includes screening/baseline, treatment period (including titration up/down) and follow up/end of study over 101 weeks for each subject. Study efficacy assessments are the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL), Cognitive Function Index, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Prevention Instrument Activities of Daily Living - Prevention Instrument and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Scale. Safety assessments include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Vital Signs, Physical/Neurological Exam, Electrocardiogram, Blood Chemistries, Urinalysis, Medical History, Assessment of Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications, MRI and PET imaging."
