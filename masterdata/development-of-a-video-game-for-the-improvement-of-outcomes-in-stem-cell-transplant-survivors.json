Develop a prototype intervention electronic game that implements a baseline testable feature set, including features for social networking within a virtual game space, managing an intermittent mediated reward cycle, goal setting and tracking, and collaborative problem solving.\n\nII. Evaluate the technical merit, feasibility, user perception and acceptance of the prototype system with adolescents and young adults (AYAs) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCTs) patients in recovery.\n\nIII. Based on the results of the prototype evaluation, enhance and complete development of the Stempowerment on-line intervention.\n\nIV. This is a single arm study with no comparison group; therefore, the purpose is to evaluate the impact of the Stempowerment intervention on\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients attend a focus group for up to 1.5 hours and provide feedback on design elements, specific desirable features, and preferences for the initial prototype.\n\nGROUP II: Patients have access to the game for 3 weeks and then provide feedback on problems or questions regarding the use of the prototype."
