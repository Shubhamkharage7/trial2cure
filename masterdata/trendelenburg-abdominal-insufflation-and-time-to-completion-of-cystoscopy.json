Abdominal insufflation (insufflation versus no insufflation).\n\nBoth interventions are used as usual care and depend on surgeon preference without evidence why one would be faster at completing the cystoscopy. Also note that these two interventions are performed multiple times during the surgery itself and outside the cystoscopy procedure routinely. The investigator's main objective is to assess which intervention or combination of interventions is more efficient."
