Participants with GAD scores of \u22658 will be considered to have anxiety and those with a PHQ score of \u226510 will be considered to have depression. All participants with screening questionnaire scores positive for anxiety or depression will be randomized to treatment with either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY). Screening with GAD and PHQ will be repeated post treatment at weeks 6, 12 and 24. The primary objective of this study is to assess for an improvement in GAD and PHQ scores among subjects treated with CBT compared to those treated with SKY. The secondary objectives are to assess for improvements in health-related quality of life, based on short IBD Questionnaire scores; assess for improvement in pain scores, based on the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form; and assess for improvement in fatigue scores based on the FACIT-Fatigue Scale, among subjects with poor scores at baseline following treatment with CBT or SKY."
