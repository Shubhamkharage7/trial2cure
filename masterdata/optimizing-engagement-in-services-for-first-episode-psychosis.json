Comparable family group sessions will also be delivered to participants in both conditions. It is expected that BA participants will show better engagement than TAU participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "After an initial pre-screen, screening, and pre-intervention assessment, enrolled participants will be randomized to either BA or TAU. The study intervention phase will last up to 6 months, during which time BA participants will receive up to 12 one-on-one BA sessions and TAU participants will receive the usual care (e.g., medication management and any other service \\[e.g., group counseling\\]). Participants will be assessed at post-intervention, 1-month-post-intervention, and 6-month-post-intervention. The primary objective of aim 1 is to examine whether BA for FEP improves engagement in services better than TAU among Latinos with FEP and their families. Secondary objectives of aim 1 are to examine whether BA participants show greater improvements in quality of life, symptoms (e.g., psychosis, depression), functioning, and recovery compared to TAU participants, and whether BA participants have greater remission rates than the TAU group at 1- and 6-month post-intervention. Additionally, the association between potential BA mediators and engagement will be examined to identify mechanisms of engagement. Potential predictors of engagement will also be examined."
