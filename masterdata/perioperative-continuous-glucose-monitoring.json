To assess how CGM technology could improve glycemic management in the perioperative setting, specifically in predicting and preventing hypoglycemic episodes as well as utilization for treating hyperglycemia with resultant improvement in patient morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and overall quality of life. CGM technology aids tremendously in data collection with recognition of glycemic patterns, as well as evaluating prediction of blood glucose changes including both hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events. The availability of such a large volume of glycemic data has been shown to make a tremendous impact in patient care, resulting in statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c, a decrease in hypoglycemia, a decrease in hospital admissions for diabetes complications, and improved overall quality of life and fear of hypoglycemia in patients using CGM technology."
