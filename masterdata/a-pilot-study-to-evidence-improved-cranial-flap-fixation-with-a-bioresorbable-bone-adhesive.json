The aim of this Pilot Study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the use of Tetranite for Cranial Flap Fixation (TN-CFF) to allow clinical study of the TN-CFF device in a greater number of patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary endpoint is safety during the post procedure follow up period. This endpoint will be evaluated through the rate of all serious adverse device and procedure related effects from the time of fixation to 6 months post-procedure. The secondary endpoints include efficacy evaluated through radiolucency data using CT imaging at the cranial flap cut lines and the change of radiolucency with respect to time, device related adverse events, flap immobility at time of fixation, six months and 12 months, evaluation of flap translation and patient reported outcome measures."

Note: Superficial penetration of mastoid air cells is not an exclusion if cells were appropriately sealed (e.g., bone wax).\n* Subject has clinically significant hydrocephalus or clinical evidence of altered CSF dynamics.\n* Subject has undergone a previous, open intracranial neurosurgical procedure in the same anatomical location. (Note: stereotactic biopsy was not exclusionary).\n* Subject requires a craniectomy (the bone flap is not replaced during the current surgery).\n* Subject had radiation treatment to the surgical site, or standard fractionated radiation therapy was planned post index-procedure. (Note: stereotactic radiosurgery prior to the planned index procedure was not an exclusion criterion.)\n* Subject has a condition with anticipated survival shorter than six months.\n* Subject has undergone chemotherapy treatment, excluding hormonal therapy, within three weeks prior to the planned index procedure, or use of intracavitary chemotherapy wafer (BCNU) was planned, or chemotherapy treatment was planned within two weeks after the index procedure was performed.\n* Standard use of peri-operative steroids (i.e., corticosteroids) is permitted. Chronic steroid use (defined as daily use of corticosteroids for \u2265 8 weeks) for the purposes of reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for cancer is not exclusionary unless the patient is deemed by the investigator to be suffering from steroid toxicity (i.e., Cushing's syndrome) manifested by symptoms and signs such as thin skin, striae, easy bruising, muscle atrophy, upper body obesity, severe fatigue, etc. Use of corticosteroids on a chronic basis (as defined previously) for purposes other than decreasing the symptoms of systemic chemotherapy is exclusionary unless those steroids were discontinued 4 weeks prior to the planned index procedure.\n* Subject receives warfarin, heparin, other anticoagulant agents on a daily basis and pre-surgical, standard of care drug wash-out did not occur.\n* Subject is pregnant, breast-feeding, or intended to become pregnant during the course of the study.",
