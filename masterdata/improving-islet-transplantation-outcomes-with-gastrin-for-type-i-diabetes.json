            "briefSummary": "This clinical study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Gastrin treatment with islet transplantation to help patients with difficult to control type 1 diabetes make insulin again and improve blood sugar control.\n\nThis study involves two investigational (experimental) products not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for any disease:\n\n1. Human allogenic islet cells (islet cells from a deceased, unrelated human donor)\n2. Gastrin-17 (Gastrin) - a hormone secreted by the gut",
            "detailedDescription": "Islet cell transplantation involves transplanting the cells that make insulin from a pancreas of deceased organ donor to a patient with diabetes. Because there is a limited supply of donor islet cells available, this study is testing whether Gastrin injections can help make a fewer number of transplanted islets work better.\n\nGastrin is a natural gut hormone that is present in the pancreas during its development in the embryo but not after birth, and is believed to participate in the formation of the normal pancreas. Several studies have tried to use gastrin to help grow insulin making islet cells in laboratory experiments or after transplanting islets in laboratory animals. In early clinical trials, diabetic patients treated with gastrin and other growth factors required less insulin after 4 weeks of gastrin treatment and the effect lasted more than 12 weeks after stopping treatment, suggesting that gastrin may have increased the number of cells that make insulin.\n\nThis study will evaluate whether taking Gastrin injections following a single islet transplantation is safe, improves how well the islet transplant works and/or helps increase the number of insulin-making cells in the islets.\n\nQualified participants will receive treatment with a single islet transplant and two rounds of gastrin treatment (twice daily injections for 30 days) with transplant and again 6 months later. Study participants will also take anti-rejection medications (to prevent the body from rejecting the islet cells) and other medications to guard against infection and support their health and/or the health of the transplanted islets. Participants will need to return to City of Hope in Duarte, CA for frequent follow-up visits for one year after transplant."
