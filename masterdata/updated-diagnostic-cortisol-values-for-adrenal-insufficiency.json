            "detailedDescription": "In this study, a cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test will be conducted by administering intramuscular cosyntropin into a subject's arm and measuring cortisol levels before and after injection. Cosyntropin tests are routine medical tests that are done in doctors' offices to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Cosyntropin is a synthetic version of a hormone, called ACTH, that is secreted by our bodies to help produce cortisol. Participation in this research will last about two hours.\n\nAim # 1:\n\nThe primary aim is to accurately re-define the cortisol threshold to diagnose adrenal insufficiency with cosyntropin stimulation test using the Alinity, monoclonal antibody, cortisol assay.\n\nAim # 2:\n\nThe secondary aims are to determine a basal, morning, cortisol level above which adrenal insufficiency can be ruled out using the Alinity cortisol assay and to compare diagnostic cortisol thresholds within the cosyntropin stimulation test between the Abbott Alinity assay and the Roche 2 assay."
