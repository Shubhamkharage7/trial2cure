            "briefSummary": "The Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) Autopsy Study is a cross-sectional study designed to define and characterize the epidemiology, natural history, clinical spectrum, and underlying mechanisms of post-acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a diverse population representative of the general COVID-19 population in the US. The autopsy study will characterize the pathology of PASC in (i) non-hospitalized patients who die 30 days or later from symptom onset of COVID-19, and (ii) hospitalized patients who die 30 days or later after discharge from a hospitalization for COVID-19. The study will include decedents who had previously fully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., \\>30 days from onset in non-hospitalized, or \\>30 days from discharge in hospitalized patients), and decedents who meet clinical criteria of PASC as defined by the recent World Health Organization publication (see Section 5.4 below). The autopsy study will also explore the pathology of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in a smaller subset of patients who died 15-30 days from symptom onset. This protocol defines the common set of clinical data elements, autopsy procedures for tissue collection, core measures, pathology protocols, shared pathology tissues, data elements, and methodology. Each investigator site is expected to perform autopsies on the decedents to address the pathophysiology of the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human health. The Consortium analysis plan aims to address research questions by incorporating: 1) tissue obtained from autopsies performed at each Phase II participant's site; and 2) tissue available from other pathology investigators/autopsy sites within the Consortium."
