Subjects will be treated according to the following process for lymphodepletion: Days -5, -4 and -3 Cyclophosphamide 250mg/m2, IV infusion over 30 mins, followed immediately by Fludarabine 25 mg/m2 IV infusion over 30 minutes.\n\nNXC-201 CART is administered on Day 0, after lymphodepletion.\n\nEnrolled subjects will receive a dose of NXC-201 CAR-positive (CAR+) T cells. Dose escalation and expansion will be guided by safety review committee."

Presence of other active malignancy that requires treatment with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer, treated early-stage prostate cancer provided that prostate specific antigen is within normal limit, or any completely resected carcinoma in situ; other indolent/completely resected malignancies may be discussed with the Principal Investigator (PI) and/or Co-PI.\n24. Subjects who have had a venous thromboembolic event requiring anticoagulation and who meet any of the following criteria:\n\n    1. Have been on a stable dose of anticoagulation for \\< 1 month (except for acute line insertion induced thrombosis).\n    2. Have had a Grade 2, 3, or 4 hemorrhage in the last 30 days.\n    3. Are experiencing continued symptoms from their venous thromboembolic event (e.g., continued dyspnea or oxygen requirement).\n25. Presence of non-AL amyloidosis.\n26. AL amyloidosis with isolated soft tissue involvement.\n27. Supine systolic blood pressure \\<100 mmHg or postural symptoms despite medical therapy.\n28. Subject is a woman who is pregnant, or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant.\n29.
