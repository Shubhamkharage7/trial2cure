            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to evaluate whether rtfMRI-nf training to increase the amygdala response to positive memories may serve as a stand-alone intervention for major depressive disorder",
            "detailedDescription": "Previous research has shown that real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training aimed at increasing the amygdala's response to positive autobiographical memory recall holds therapeutic potential for treating patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), as clinically significant decreases in clinician administered and self-report measures of depression severity were observed following two rtfMRI amygdala neurofeedback sessions. Furthermore, rtfMRI amygdala neurofeedback changed emotional processing towards a positive bias. The goal of the current study is to confirm the clinical efficacy of this intervention in a new sample of depressed participants. Thus, over the course of four years, we will conduct a randomized double-blind clinical trial examining the clinical and cognitive effects of amygdala rtfMRI-nf compared to yoked sham rtfMRI-nf (seeing the amygdala activity of another participant during training) in 200 participants with MDD from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Participants will undergo two rtfMRI-nf sessions. Half of the participants will receive amygdala neurofeedback and half will receive yoked sham neurofeedback. Participants will complete the BDI-II monthly for one year following completion of the neurofeedback intervention. The rationale for the proposed research is to provide new insights into possible mechanistic solutions for MDD, and to further guide development of this rtfMRI-nf intervention into a treatment for MDD."
