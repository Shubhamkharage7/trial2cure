            "briefSummary": "This project involves the research into understanding the functioning of co-located/partnering dental practices and federally qualified health centers/community health clinics in North Carolina and how dental health providers may play a role in facilitating HPV vaccination uptake for under-vaccinated populations in these co-located/partnering sites.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objective 1): To assess HPV-related Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC) knowledge, perceptions, practices and barriers of general dentists and dental hygienists in North Carolina (NC).\n\nObjective 2): To understand key infrastructure elements and policies, as well as HPV prevention strategies in place at East Carolina University School of Dental Medicine Community Service-Learning Centers (CSLCs) and their partnering Community Health Clinics/Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHCs).\n\nObjective 3): Develop and assess the feasibility of a model for collaborative and effective HPV prevention strategies between dental practices (CSLCs) and co-located Community Health Clinics (FQHCs).\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH1. It is hypothesized that HPV OPC knowledge, perceptions, and practices will be informed by level of HPV health literacy; where higher levels of HPV health literacy will correlate with higher levels of HPV prevention practices (i.e., oral cancer screening, education on HPV risk behaviors, HPV vaccine recommendation). The investigators expect to find gaps in one or more of the surveyed areas (knowledge, attitudes, societal norms, perceived behavior control, and current prevention practices) among dentists and dental hygienists. Last, the investigators expect to find barriers to HPV prevention practices among our sample.\n\nH2: It is hypothesized that there will be key infrastructure elements and policies identified through interviews that will both inhibit and facilitate the navigation of patients for HPV vaccination between dental clinics (CSLCs) and partnering health clinics (community clinics/FQHCs). The investigators also expect to find a variation of HPV prevention strategies currently being employed at CSLCs and partnering community clinic/FQHCs.\n\nH3: It is hypothesized that the investigators will employ the data identified in Objectives 1 and 2 to develop a feasible model for collaborative and effective HPV prevention between dental clinics (CSLCs) and health clinics (FQHCs). Specifically, the investigators will address barriers identified in Objective 2 and capitalize on the facilitators identified to develop a model of HPV prevention care and navigation between dental clinics (CSLCs) and health clinics (FQHCs). This model can then be evaluated for effectiveness and serve as a model for replication in other rural and under-resourced settings."
