            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder where red blood cells, that carry oxygen, are stiff and become stuck in small blood vessels. As a result, affected patients can experience severe pain and serious organ damage. SCD can be cured with a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), that is, when they receive blood stem cells from a family donor. But HCT can also have serious side effects, especially in people with organ damage. Researchers want to find ways to make HCT safer for everyone.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a new combination of drugs (briquilimab, abatacept, and alemtuzumab), used along with radiation, in people undergoing HCT for SCD.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 16 and older with SCD. They must be eligible for HCT and have a family member who is a good donor match. Donors must be aged 4 and older.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants with SCD will be screened. They will have blood tests and tests of organs including their heart and lung function. Donors will have blood drawn.\n\nParticipants with SCD will have a tube inserted into a blood vessel in their chest (intravenously). This line will remain in place up to 2 months; it will be used to draw blood and administer the donor cells and other medications.\n\nBriquilimab will be administered intravenously 1 time, along with other drugs used to prepare for HCT. Participants will receive abatacept 6 times, from just before they receive their donor cells until 6 months after. Participants will undergo radiation therapy and take other drugs that are standard for HCT. Most HCT recipients remain in the hospital for about 30 days after HCT.\n\nFollow-up visits will continue for 5 years....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nHaploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation offers a widely available curative option for individuals with sickle cell disease. The goal is to reverse SCD while avoiding unacceptable graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, infectious complications, and hyperinflammatory responses. We hypothesize that a moderate amount of immunosuppression will maximize efficacy while avoiding unacceptable toxicity.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n-Evaluate the regimen success rate where success is defined as successful engraftment (persistent donor chimerism and free of acute SCD complications) and absence of acute grade 3 or higher GVHD or moderate to severe chronic GVHD evaluated at 1 year posttransplant.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* Event-free survival and overall survival.\n* Incidence of recipient-type hemoglobin defined as HbS \\>10% when donors have HbAA and HbS \\>50% when donors have sickle cell trait (HbAS).\n* The proportion of patients with myeloid chimerism \\>= 95% at 1 and 2 years post-HCT.\n* Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD.\n* Prevalence of donor type hemoglobin at 1-year post-transplant in SCD patients who have not been transfused in the previous 3 months.\n* Incidence of viral reactivation and disease.\n* Incidence of autoimmune and hyperinflammatory complications.\n* Incidence of hematologic malignancies.\n* Transplant-related mortality.\n\nExploratory Objective:\n\n* Perform gene therapy research involving cell culture or genetic manipulation to produce normal or therapeutic hemoglobin on excess autologous CD34+ cells collected from recipients.\n* Evaluate the impact of this non-myeloablative conditioning regimen on organs including the heart, lung, kidneys, liver, brain, neurocognitive function, and endocrine organs\n* Evaluate the impact of this non-myeloablative conditioning regimen on quality of life.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\n-The percentage of SCD patients at 1 year (+/- 3 months) posttransplant who have not experienced graft failure and who are without severe graft-versus-host disease (defined as grade 3 and higher acute GVHD and moderate to severe chronic GVHD).\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n* Total hemoglobin and percent HbS levels\n* Percent donor myeloid chimerism and donor CD3 chimerism\n* Day of neutrophil engraftment\n* Day of platelet engraftment\n* RBC transfusion requirement\n* Rates of acute and chronic GVHD\n* Rates of viral reactivation and disease\n* Rates of autoimmune and hyperinflammatory complications\n* Transplant-related mortality\n* Non-transplant-related mortality\n* Rates of graft failure\n* Rates of leukemia and related disorders\n\nExploratory Endpoint:\n\nCompletion of gene therapy research involving cell culture or genetic manipulation to produce normal or therapeutic hemoglobin on excess autologous CD34+ cells collected from recipients.\n\nOrgan function and quality of life"
