Throughout the study, coagulation status will be determined by whole blood clotting time (WBCT), which will be measured primarily by the Perosphere Technologies' PoC Coagulometer and at selected timepoints using a manual testing method.\n\nThe study will be conducted in three separate cohorts; each cohort will evaluate the reversal of a different anticoagulant drug. Within each cohort, an initial group of subjects (Group 1) will be enrolled for evaluation of a target dose of ciraparantag. Depending on the efficacy and safety results from Group 1, a second group (Group 2) may be enrolled to evaluate a different dose of ciraparantag for that cohort."
