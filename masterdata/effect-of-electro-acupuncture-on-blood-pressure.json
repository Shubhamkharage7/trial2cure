            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to prove: (1) hypertensive response at rest and provoked by stress are decreased by EA; (2) The mechanisms of EA that reduces elevated blood pressure. EA inhibits the sympathetic nervous system, decreases blood pressure and reduces the oxygen demand. Our prior data in animals shows that improvements in cardiovascular function during myocardial ischemia, reflex hypertension and sustained hypertension are mediated by an EA-induced sensory neural reflex originating in somatic nerves to reduce sympathetic nerve activity. The specific aims of the present study will allow us to better understand and modulate the sympathetic nervous discharge activity that can cause hypertension during normal activity and stress in humans. The potential clinical application is the therapeutic value of EA in patients with hypertension.\n\nFurthermore, the study will also investigate gender differences in the blood pressure lowering effect of EA. In particular in middle-aged hypertensive women and men."
