Utilizing the functional electrical stimulation (FES) system for individualized dorsiflexor and plantar flexor assistance during gait cycles. The investigators will analyze the cycles with and without the FES system. Initially, the context-aware motion assessment and neuroprosthetic control in a clinic will transition to in-home settings as the study progresses, broadening its application for safe and effective use at home."
