            "detailedDescription": "This research is a prospective study with the purpose is to investigate the clinical outcomes following the transfer of a mosaic embryo (presence of both chromosomally normal and abnormal cells) that has been screened for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). PGT involves the biopsy and testing of a handful (3-6) of trophectoderm (pre-placental cells) from the embryo. Embryos that are screened as mosaic via PGT, as a standard, are not offered for transfer for pregnancy attempt. Publications have shown that mosaic embryos and mosaic fetuses can result in healthy live births (Wallerstein et al, 2015; Victor et al, 2019). Ongoing clinical outcomes are important to further understand the association between an embryonic mosaic biopsy of pre-placental cells and subsequent fetal chromosomal constitution. Implantation rates and live birth rates will be evaluated to help understand if mosaic embryos should routinely be offered for transfer to patients attempting pregnancy."
