            "detailedDescription": "This is a 48-week, open-label, single center pharmacist-run study to assess PrEP uptake and persistence among women at high-risk of HIV-1 acquisition in metro-Orlando at a community-based organization called Let's Beehive. All participants in the study will chose whether they want to start IM LA-CAB (with or without the oral lead-in) vs. daily oral TDF/FTC for PrEP. The study will include a Screening Phase (up to 56 days), and an open-label phase (Day 1 up to Week 48). Approximately 50 women defined as \"high-risk\" for HIV-1 infection who have a confirmed negative HIV test will be enrolled. All insured participants will be responsible for using their insurance plan to obtain coverage for their chosen PrEP medication, in addition to any labs required by the study. This expectation is clearly outlined in the informed consent. The study team will work with participants to minimize their co-pays for study medications and labs through the use of manufacturer and other external assistance programs. For participants who are under-or-uninsured, the study sponsor will provide financial coverage for approximately 20 participants (10 on LA-CAB and 10 on TDF/FTC) to receive PrEP medication and undergo study-required laboratory testing at no cost."
