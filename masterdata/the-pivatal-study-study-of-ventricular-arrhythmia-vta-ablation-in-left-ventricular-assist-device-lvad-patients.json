Comprehensive data on arrhythmia history, medication history will be collected in all randomized subjects. Antiarrhythmic medical therapy will be handled in a uniform pattern between the two arms. Randomized subjects will then be followed per routine schedules for post LVAD implant. Arrhythmia data, ICD therapy, additional procedures including repeat surgery, ramp echocardiographic tests, right heart catheterization and catheter-based VTA ablation will be collected. In addition, adverse events such as unplanned hospitalizations, emergency department visits, clinic visits, and all other aspects of health care utilization will be gathered. The planned average follow-up period will be 18 months."
