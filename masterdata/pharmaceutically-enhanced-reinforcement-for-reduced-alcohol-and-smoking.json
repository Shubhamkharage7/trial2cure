Contingency management is a powerful and cost-effective technique that has been used successfully for decades to promote abstinence from benzodiazepines, cocaine, tobacco, etc. Contingency management, and a non-contingent control condition will be used combined with varenicline (VC) and manualized counseling in the form of module videos."
