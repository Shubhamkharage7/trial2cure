            "detailedDescription": "TRANSFORM3 is a Quality Improvement initiative conducted in parallel to the current TRANSFORM CVRiD study and aligned with its goals of using a real-world population study to enable the American College of Cardiology Foundation (\"ACCF\") to better identify impactful ways to improve guideline directed medical therapy for patients. TRANSFORM3 is focused on improving GDMT use in underserved patients and patients with a history of health care disparities who have one or more of the following: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ASCVD/Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThere is a significant disconnect between increasing availability of effective and safe therapeutics that significantly reduce CV event risk in patients with Heart Failure, T2D and ASCVD, and Atrial Fibrillation-and clear guideline recommendations endorsing these therapies-but very low adoption in clinical practice with the majority of eligible patients that are most likely to benefit from these therapies not receiving them. A high proportion of patients have more than one of these conditions further reducing the chances of receiving optimal guideline directed medical therapy and avoiding the CV events they are designed to prevent."
