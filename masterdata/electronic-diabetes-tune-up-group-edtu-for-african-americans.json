To test the acceptability and feasibility of the electronic DTU intervention (eDTU) that has been adapted for cultural relevance and online delivery compared to waitlist control and the in-person DTU (iDTU). The hypothesis is that the adapted intervention will be culturally acceptable (by participant satisfaction scores) and well-subscribed (intervention attendance rates).\n2. To test differences in diabetes distress and A1c change scores between intervention (changes in T2 to T4) and waitlist control (change in T1 to T2) by intervention group (eDTU vs. waitlist control; iDTU vs. waitlist control). The hypothesis is that both the eDTU and iDTU groups will show significant improvements in diabetes distress and A1c compared to waitlist control. In order to conserve sample size and budget, participants in each intervention group will serve as their own waitlist control.\n\nSecondary Objective. The secondary aim of the study is to evaluate changes in depressive symptoms, diabetes self-efficacy, and general and diabetes-specific quality of life in intervention (T2-T3 \\& T4) compared to waitlist control (T1-T2). An exploratory aim will be to compare changes in eDTU to the iDTU pre/post intervention (T2-T3 \\& T4). The hypothesis is that both groups will show comparable improvements in diabetes distress and A1c."

After a 3-month waiting period, participants will complete baseline assessment (T2). The group intervention will then take place over the next 6 to 8 weeks. Immediately following completion of the intervention, participants will complete surveys (T3). A final assessment will be completed 3 months after baseline, approximately 4 to 6 weeks following the completion of the intervention (T4).\n\nThe participant will participate in one series of the DTU intervention either, in person or online, at the participant's choosing.

The intervention components integrate key strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective in previous studies: motivational interviewing and introduction to stages of change; diabetes education; cognitive behavioral therapy with a particular emphasis on identification of cognitive distortions, thought stopping and cognitive reframing; emotional regulation; social support and miscarried helping; and behavioral strategies to support diabetes self-management.
