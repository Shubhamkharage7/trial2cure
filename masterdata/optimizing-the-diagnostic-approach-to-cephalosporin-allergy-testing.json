            "briefSummary": "Cephalosporin antibiotics are commonly used but can result in allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. There is no clear diagnostic approach for cephalosporin-allergic patients, and guidance for the use of other antibiotics in allergic patients is based on side chain chemical similarity and limited skin testing evidence. This project includes a clinical trial and mechanistic studies to optimize the approach to cephalosporin allergy and advance future diagnostics.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nIn the United States, beta-lactam antibiotics are the leading cause of allergic reactions. Cephalosporin antibiotics, in particular, are the most common cause of drug-induced anaphylaxis and perioperative allergy. For penicillin allergy, the mechanism of allergy and the antigenic determinants are known; validated penicillin skin testing followed by drug challenge has a 100% negative predictive value to exclude an immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated reaction. For cephalosporin allergy, the antigenic determinants and mechanism are not known, and skin testing is not validated. The diagnostic test characteristics of skin testing with native cephalosporins remain unclear with no sensitivity nor specificity reported. Although beta-lactam cross-reactivity has been hypothesized to be from the similarity of the R1 side chains, rather than the beta-lactam ring, cross-reactivity estimates among beta-lactams vary. Furthermore, it is not known whether the variance in cross-reactivity is due to true allergy versus sensitization based on positive skin testing, given that drug challenges were not performed on skin-test-positive patients. While an IgE mechanism is assumed for cephalosporin allergy and supported by skin testing that has been positive, the biology has yet to be characterized, and some cephalosporin anaphylaxis can occur on the first exposure, which is inconsistent with an IgE mechanism. Given the complexity of cephalosporin structures and potential epitopes, there may be several distinct biologic pathways involved in cephalosporin allergy. Future diagnostics in cephalosporin allergy are reliant on determination of these biological pathways and finding key haptens.\n\nAims:\n\nCurrent national practice guidelines related to cephalosporin allergy assessment are considered conditional and based on low-quality evidence. The overall goal is to identify the optimal diagnostic approach to cephalosporin allergy and determine beta-lactam cross-reactivity, while discovering the mechanism and antigenic determinants of cephalosporin allergy to advance future diagnostics. The investigators will do this through a clinical trial that will generate empirical evidence through novel trial procedures, double-blind skin testing, and double-blind placebo-controlled drug challenges. Specific aims are: 1) To determine the optimal approach to cephalosporin allergy evaluation; 2) To assess beta-lactam cross-reactivity in cephalosporin-allergic individuals; and 3) To investigate the antigenic determinants and mechanism of cephalosporin allergy.\n\nStudy Overview:\n\nEnrolled and consented subjects will attend visit 1 for baseline screening, sample collection, double-blind skin testing to a beta-lactam panel, and a double-blind placebo-controlled challenge to their culprit cephalosporin antibiotic. Results of the culprit cephalosporin challenge determine subject's study timeline. Subjects confirmed as non-allergic to their culprit cephalosporin will return for visit 2 for venipuncture and blood collection, ending their participation in the study. Subjects who are confirmed as allergic to their culprit at visit 1 will return for three additional visits; visits 2 and 3 will include double-blind placebo-controlled challenges to a similar side chain and dissimilar side chain cephalosporin (as compared to the side chain of their culprit) to assess cross-reactivity. The order of these two challenges is randomized between visit 2 and 3, and the order of whether a similar or dissimilar side chain cephalosporin is challenged first (in visit 2) differentiates the comparator arms of this study. In visit 4, subjects from both comparator arms will undergo a double-blind placebo-controlled challenge to a penicillin to assess cross-reactivity between cephalosporins and penicillins. Completion of this penicillin challenge marks the end of participation for confirmed-allergic subjects. Venipuncture and sample collection will occur at each visit."
