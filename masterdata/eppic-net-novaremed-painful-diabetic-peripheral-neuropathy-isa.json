All participants in NIH-funded research must have a GUID. This study is using the Biomedical Research Informatics Computing System (BRICS) GUID platform to assign GUIDs. This ID should be generated at the time of Informed Consent since it requires several pieces of patient information (e.g., last name at birth, first name at birth, sex at birth, day, month and year of birth, city and country of birth, etc.). The GUID will be a combination of letters and numbers to form a unique identifier, e.g. TBIAC412JJK. Sites should maintain a list to link the GUID to the participant."
