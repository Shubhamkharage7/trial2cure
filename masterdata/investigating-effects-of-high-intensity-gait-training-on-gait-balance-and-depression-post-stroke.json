The study also aims to evaluate if participants' mental health, social support, and health literacy affect their attendance at physical therapy sessions.\n\nThe findings from this study will help the researchers and clinicians decide how to help people with stroke better. Further, the findings will determine how depressive symptoms, health literacy, and other factors such as language and education affect attendance to therapy.\n\nAbout 24 subjects will take part in this research."
