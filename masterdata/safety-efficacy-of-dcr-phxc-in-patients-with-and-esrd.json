Participants successfully completing the Day 180 visit will continue on to an extended follow-up period and receive open-label DCR-PHXC for an additional 3 years, or until DCR-PHXC is commercially available, whichever comes first. As participants in this extended treatment period will return to the clinic only every 3 months, participants and/or their caregivers may be trained in the at-home administration of DCR-PHXC or home health nurses may assist with administration of DCR -PHXC.\n\nThe total duration of the study is approximately 2 years from first participant, first visit, to last participant, last Day 180 visit, with up to an additional 3 years of extended follow-up."
