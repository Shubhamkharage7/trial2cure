Participants will stay on their established controller medications for COPD throughout the duration of the study, with the exception of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics used for acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD).\n\nThe total study duration for each part (Part A and Part B) is approximately 36 weeks:\n\n* 4-week screening period\n* 12-week treatment period\n* 20-week followup period"
