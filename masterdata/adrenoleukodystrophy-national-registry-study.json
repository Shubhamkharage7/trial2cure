            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, non-therapeutic protocol designed to create and maintain a registry of participants with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and known/presumed mutation for ALD. This study also involves maintaining a prospective biorepository to collect and store buccal swab, blood, stool and urine samples as well. In this protocol, pediatric (including infants), adolescents and adult patients with confirmed or presumed ALD (based on positive VLCFA testing and/or confirmed mutation) will be offered potential study participation. Additionally, presumed mutation for ALD (based on pedigree or confirmed mutation) will be offered potential study participation. After appropriate consent (online or in-person), subjects will be requested to provide a medical history (with authorization of release of medical records), longitudinal biospecimens, and permission to perform laboratory analyses on these samples. The overall goal is to understand the natural disease course in affected and unaffected patients (identified patients and relatives with a diagnosis of ALD), as well as women with ALD to assemble a resource of clinical, medical, and biological data from the participants. This study also aims to understand the outcomes of this disease, as well as possibly develop biomarkers to identify prognostic markers for disease progression, which may help develop effective interventions. The biospecimen bank and registry will provide access to samples and data for the ongoing studies as well as will provide an important resource for the future research."
