            "briefSummary": "This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial to test whether the group B meningitis vaccine 4 component Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B vaccine (BEXSEROTM) (4C-MenB), trade name Bexsero\u2122), currently approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for protection from Neisseria meningitidis infections, also protects from Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection using controlled human experimental infection to test protection. The information the investigator learn by doing this study may also help to develop a vaccine that protects individuals from having gonorrhea infection.\n\nThe study population will consist of male participants \\> 18 and \\< 36 years old, living in central North Carolina, in general good health without a history of 4C-MenB vaccination. Approximately 120-140 participants will be enrolled.\n\nParticipants will receive 2 doses of vaccine (2 doses of 4C-MenB or 2 comparator vaccines- seasonal influenza and tetanus/diptheria booster) as intramuscular injections, and then one intraurethral challenge with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Following the challenge, participants will cross-over and receive two doses of vaccines not received prior to challenge (2 doses of 4CMenB or the 2 comparator vaccines- seasonal influenza and tetanus/diptheria booster) All participants receive all vaccinations by the end of the study and all vaccines used in this study are licensed and FDA-approved.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a single-site, double-blind randomized controlled trial to test whether vaccination with 4C-MenB, BEXSERO\u2122 (approved for protection against invasive disease with group B Neisseria meningitidis), according to the FDA-approved schedule , provides protection from urethral infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the controlled human male gonococcal infection model. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: 1) initial vaccination phase, 2) Neisseria gonorrhoeae challenge phase, and 3) post-challenge vaccination phase.\n\nThe study intervention is vaccination with two doses of BEXSERO\u2122 and two commercially available FDA-approved vaccines that do not have relevance to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: quadrivalent influenza (FLULAVAL\u2122) and tetanus/diphtheria (TDVAX\u2122). At enrollment, participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the control vaccine arm or the experimental vaccine arm. All participants receive two immunizations prior to the bacterial challenge phase and two immunizations in the post-challenge phase. Individuals assigned to the experimental arm receive two doses of BEXSERO\u2122 prior to Neisseria gonorrhoeae challenge and control vaccines in the post-challenge vaccination phase. Participants assigned to the control arm receive FLULAVAL\u2122 and TDVAX\u2122 prior to challenge and BEXSERO\u2122 in the post-challenge vaccination phase. Primary and secondary outcomes are determined following bacterial challenge. This study design provides clinical equipoise, because all participants receive the known benefits associated with administration of BEXSERO\u2122 for protection against meningococcal disease.\n\nFor bacterial challenge, all participants receive a suspension containing 10\\^6 colony-forming units of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain FA1090 delivered to the anterior urethra. This dose has been shown to produce symptomatic gonococcal urethritis in 80-90% of unvaccinated, exposed participants within 5 days after bacterial inoculation. Participants are followed with daily visits to assess for development of urethritis and presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in their urine. Participants receive 100% effective antibiotic treatment when (1) requested by the participant regardless of signs, symptoms or positive cultures, (2) urethral discharge is observed by the examining clinician or reported by the participant, or (3) 10 days after urethral inoculation with bacterial product, regardless of infection status."
