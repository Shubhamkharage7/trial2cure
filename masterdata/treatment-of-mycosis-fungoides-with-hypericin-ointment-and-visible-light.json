Patients will treat all of their MF lesions (where accessible to light therapy), but 3 to 5 lesions will be identified and followed as \"Index Lesions\" that will be evaluated using the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score every 6 weeks for the up to 54 weeks of therapy. Patients will be treated until resolution, dropout for adverse events, or plateau of therapeutic response occurs. Changes in the skin scoring mechanisms such as the CAILs and mSWAT will be tabulated for each patient and assessed across all patients enrolled in the trial to determine the response profile of HyBryte and visible light treatment."
