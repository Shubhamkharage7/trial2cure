This telehealth platform will be pilot tested to evaluate its preliminary efficacy in terms of motivating engagement in medications for OUD (MOUD), as well as its feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction to both first responders/providers and participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of the study is to assess effects of enrollment in a comprehensive telehealth platform, in adults with moderate or severe opioid use disorder with a history of at least one opioid overdose. Thirty adults with moderate or severe opioid use disorder with a history of at least one opioid overdose will be enrolled and the primary endpoint will be attendance at first appointment for medication for opioid use disorder at 30 days.\n\nSecondary aims include assessing engagement in the first MOUD appointment at 90 days and self-report of the number of subsequent overdose events at 30 and 90 days. Exploratory aims include feasibility of intervention, readiness and intention to engage in treatment, acceptability and satisfaction of intervention, and comparison of MOUD engagement with data from previous in-person studies."
