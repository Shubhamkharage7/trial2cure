            "detailedDescription": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) make up a large range of malignancies that arise from neuroendocrine cells in multiple organs of the body. Hallet et al conducted a large population-based study that demonstrated that 21% of NET patients presented with metastatic disease and another 38% developed metastases after resection of the primary tumor (Hallet et al., 2015). This burden demonstrates the need for effective systemic therapy for advanced NETs. Options for systemic therapy include peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).\n\nA need for more prospective series are needed on treatment responses and survival outcomes related to gastroenteropancreatic primary NETs treated with PRRT was identified. Thus the purpose of this study is to collect clinical data related to treatment of gastroenteropancreatic primary NETs s with PRRT. Clinical data related to patient characteristics, treatment responses and survival outcomes related to the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic primary NETs with PRRT and on adverse events and complications related to PRRT treatment will be collected."
