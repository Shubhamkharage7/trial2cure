In this research study, we will use MRI and behavioral methods to assess how sensory interventions might change sensory brain structures, allowing us to better predict which sensory interventions might work best for whom."

The interveners will be occupational therapists who will be trained by Dr. Bodison to deliver the codified, intervention protocol to provide a personally customized set of therapeutically guided environmental interactions. Because, at its core, the intervention emphasizes playful interaction with a sensory enriched environment, the intervention room will be equipped with swings, scooter boards, climbing equipment, bolsters, and large carpeted barrels. Within this setting, using the codified manual of intervention developed by Dr. Bodison, the intervener will structure activities to provide tactile and proprioceptive input to address the child's individualized areas of need.",

The families of children will have access to transportation to attend intervention sessions 2 times per week for 16-weeks.\n2. Children who qualify will be verbal, and will speak and understand English. The native language of caregivers can include Spanish.\n3. Children who qualify will have sensorimotor delays as assessed by the study team using the standardized, norm-referenced assessments described in this research proposal (z-scores on 3 of 5 tests -1.0 or lower).\n\nExclusion Criteria: Children younger than 6 years of age or older than 8 years, 6 months of age will be excluded. Additional exclusion criteria include:\n\n1. Female children\n2. Auditory hyperresponsivity as assessed during screening procedures.\n3. Medical co-morbidities such as extreme prematurity (less than 28 weeks), blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy, Down Syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or head-injury with loss of consciousness.\n4. History of individual occupational therapy services in a clinical setting that includes sensory equipment.\n5. Non-removable metal in the head or body (e.g. dental fillings \\& braces, metal pins, screws or plates).\n6. Children unable to complete neurocognitive or sensorimotor testing.\n7.
