            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to identify sex-specific biomarkers that confer greater susceptibility for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and differentiate how treatment response varies by sex in people with Alcohol Use Disorder.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* How does trauma affect emotion regulation, inflammation, and limbic function, and what are the sex-dependent effects of NTX (Naltrexone) on these aspects?\n* What is the mechanism of Naltrexone (NTX), and how does it potentially moderate reductions in alcohol use through changes in or interactions between emotion regulation, inflammation, or limbic system function?\n\nParticipants will\n\n* Be consented and will undergo comprehensive screening for eligibility criteria\n* Complete behavioral assessments and neuropsychological assessments, as well as neurocognitive assessments and neuroimaging measures\n* Provide urine samples for a urine drug screen (UDS) and urine pregnancy test (for women), and have blood and a cheek swab collected and stored in the repository\n* Take a study drug once daily for 12 weeks and track drug usage and effects in a study journal\n* Undergo weekly assessment calls and bi-weekly medical follow-up safety exams\n\nResearchers will compare naltrexone to placebo in AUD to see if naltrexone is effective in reducing alcohol cravings and promoting abstinence.\n\nResearchers will also compare baseline measures between AUD and Healthy Controls.",
            "detailedDescription": "A twelve-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone (NTX) will be conducted in one hundred people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), fifty of which will be women. Fifty healthy participants will serve as controls for baseline measures. We will use validated measures to comprehensively assess trauma exposure including: military sexual trauma (MST), physical or sexual assault, combat exposure, intimate partner violence, and other traumatic events. Emotion regulation will be assessed with the Cognitive Emotion Regulation questionnaire and Difficulty in Emotion Regulation scale. Functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and during an emotion regulation task will assess limbic system connectivity and reactivity. Inflammation will be indexed with a multiplex panel assay of peripheral inflammatory markers. Days of alcohol use and average weekly standard drinks will be assessed at each time-point."
