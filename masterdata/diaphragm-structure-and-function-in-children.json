The participants will then perform a training program for the breathing muscles at home for 6 weeks. The research team will follow up each week via telehealth visits to support training. After the 6-week training program, participants will return in-person for a follow-up visit and will undergo the same series of assessments as the first visit."

In this type of training, airflow is occluded until the generated inspiratory pressure reaches the predetermined threshold, which can be set at increments of 8 cm H2O.\n\nDuring the first week of training, the target intensity will be set at 50% of baseline maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP.) During the second week, the target intensity will be set at 60% of baseline MIP. Beginning at the third week and for the remainder of the training program, the target intensity will be set at 75% of the participant's baseline MIP. The target volume will be 5 sets of 6 breaths per day (total of 30 breaths per day), separated by 1-minute rest breaks between sets. The frequency of training will be 5 days per week, for a duration of 6 weeks.",
