Electronic cigarette (e-cig) \"vaping\", while being promoted as a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, has disproportionately attracted adolescents and young adults (\"youth\"). This trial may help researchers understand how nicotine form, concentration, and flavor affects people's vaping behaviors and health.",
            "detailedDescription": "We will examine the influence of nicotine form and concentration, and e-liquid flavor on youth vaping behavior, nicotine uptake, abuse liability, toxicant exposure, and acute cardiovascular and pulmonary effects. Participants will complete 9 vaping sessions. Each vaping session will include a standardized, 5-minute, 10-puff vaping bout (30 seconds between each puff) followed by 30 minutes of ad libitum (as desired) vaping. During the first session, participants will use their own e-cig and e-liquid; for the following 8 sessions, participants will vape a study-provided e-cig and e-liquid."
