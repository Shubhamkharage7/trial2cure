The investigators will also attempt to measure the effect of adjunctive intrathecal clonidine on spinal and caudal blockade using EMG. This study also aims to quantify the impact of sevoflurane on basal muscle tone based on EMG changes. This study aims to generate pilot data on this subject to help design future studies.",
