            "briefSummary": "This study evaluates whether the utilization of integrated health services such as help with medications, muscle strengthening, balance training, pain management and home modification interventions can help improve older adults' ability to sleep, balance, walk, and take care of themselves after hospitalization.",
            "detailedDescription": "Currently, there is no evidence-based approach to improve post-hospitalization functional decline. CAPABLE uses a novel inter-professional team involving an occupational therapist, nurse, and handyman to improve ADLs in older adults post-hospitalization.\n\nIn a Center for Medicare \\& Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) demonstration project, CAPABLE demonstrated a 45% reduction of ADL difficulties in older adults from baseline to five months.The significance of this improvement could make the difference between aging at home independently and relocating to institutional care. While these results are encouraging, CAPABLE needs evaluation in real world health delivery contexts with more ethnic diversity.The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of CAPABLE in older adults in an active community health care program.\n\nInterventions: CAPABLE Intervention: Participants in the treatment group will receive up to 10 in-home sessions (\u22646 visits with an occupational therapist and \u22644 visits from a nurse)-and up to $1500 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component (education, assessment, and identification of functional goals, specific strategies tailored to goals and based on protocols). Usual Care Group: Participants in the usual care group will not receive visit from study clinicians and will continue to receive their usual VNSNY CHOICE benefits and healthcare. After baseline, all study participants will be reassessed at 20 weeks and possibly a third interview at 52 weeks. Assessments will be completed by a research assistant masked to treatment condition."
