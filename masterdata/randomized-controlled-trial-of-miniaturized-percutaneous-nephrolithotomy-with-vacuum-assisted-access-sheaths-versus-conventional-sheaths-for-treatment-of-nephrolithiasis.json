Both procedure types are commonly used in the treatment of kidneys stones and they have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of stones similar in size and location to your own.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study we aim to compare two variations of the miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy (Mini-PCNL) procedure which are both used for the surgical treatment of kidney stones. This procedure involves accessing the kidney via a small temporary tract that is placed through the patient's back during surgery. Both procedure types are commonly used in the treatment of kidneys stones and they have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of stones similar in size and location to your own.\n\nTwo procedure types will be investigated:\n\n1. Miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy performed using a 16 Fr (6 mm diameter) vacuum-assisted tube with suction capability to assess the kidney and extract the stone.\n2. Miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy performed using a 16 Fr (6 mm diameter) standard tube to assess the kidney and extract the stone.\n\nApproximately 90 people will take part in this study at Cleveland Clinic. The duration of the study will include the day of the surgery and following hospital stay until postoperative follow-up appointment with the surgeon approximately 4-6 weeks after the procedure."
