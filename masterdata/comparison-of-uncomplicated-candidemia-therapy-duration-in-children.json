            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare antifungal therapy duration in pediatric uncomplicated candidemia. The specific aims are:\n\n* Compare the desirability of outcome ranking in children with uncomplicated candidemia randomized to 7 additional days of antifungal therapy (standard-course) versus no additional antifungal therapy (short-course) after already receiving 7 days of echinocandin therapy.\n* Compare the 14-day desirability of outcome measure for subjects with a negative and those with a positive T2Candida\u00ae biomarker at day 7 of therapy within randomized groups.\n\nParticipants meeting eligibility criteria will be approached and consented between day 5 and 7 of primary systemic antifungal therapy. On day 7 of primary systemic antifungal therapy, inclusion and exclusion criteria will again be reviewed for consented patients and those still eligible will be randomized 1:1 to the two study arms. Researchers will compare no additional antifungal therapy (short-course) versus 7 additional days of systemic antifungal therapy (standard-course) in pediatric patients with uncomplicated candidemia who have already received 7 days of primary systemic antifungal therapy to see if shorter durations are as effective as longer durations in treating uncomplicated candidemia.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study will be addressed with a multi-center open label randomized controlled trial designed to compare no additional antifungal therapy (short-course) versus 7 additional days of systemic antifungal therapy (standard-course) in pediatric patients with uncomplicated candidemia who have already received 7 days of primary systemic antifungal therapy. The secondary objective of this study is an embedded observational biomarker study. This objective will determine if the novel T2Candida\u00ae biomarker performed at the time of randomization (i.e. Day 7 of systemic antifungal therapy) will be associated with patient outcomes assessed at Day 14. The results of the T2Candida\u00ae biomarker will not be available in real-time and thus will not impact the primary study objective. Eligible patients will be any hospitalized patient at a participating center with uncomplicated candidemia that is older than 120 days and \\<18 years of age at time of candidemia onset. Patients need to receive an echinocandin as their primary antifungal therapy for at least three days and continue systemic antifungal therapy (either with an echinocandin or step-down to an azole) for a total of 7 days from their first negative blood culture and have no evidence of metastatic foci of candidemia at the time of randomization. Patients with neutropenia or anticipated to have neutropenia during the study follow-up window will not be eligible. Patients can only be enrolled to the study once. This study population will serve as the source cohort for both study objectives. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of two study arms, short-course therapy or standard-course therapy. Patients will be followed for 21 days from the day of randomization (Day 7 to Day 28) to capture primary and secondary outcome measures."
