            "detailedDescription": "Single-blind, randomized (1:1) pragmatic trial comparing Beta-Blocker therapy versus Calcium Channel Blocker therapy in older adults with symptomatic SIHD and MCC with plans to initiate medical treatment with anti-anginal therapy.\n\nStudy Aims Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of anti-anginal medications to improve the symptoms, function, and quality of life among older adults with multiple chronic conditions presenting with stable angina. Aim 2: To compare the tolerability and safety of commonly used anti-anginal medications in older adults with multiple chronic conditions presenting with stable angina. Aim 3 (Exploratory): To compare the long-term effectiveness and safety of specific anti-anginal medicine treatment approaches in older adults with multiple chronic conditions presenting with stable angina. LIVEBETTER consists of 4 study visits during the 12-month follow-up period. Visits are comprised of an interview, six-minute walk, and medical record review. Medication dose and administration will be addressed as part of routine clinical care.\n\nThe importance of the knowledge gained includes the following:\n\n1. LIVEBETTER will produce randomized contemporary data on the safety and efficacy of BBs vs CCBs with the goal of filling that gap of evidence in the guidelines and informing clinical practice.\n2. LIVEBETTER will generate data on the quality of life, symptomatic, and functional outcomes most pertinent to older adults with multiple chronic conditions and stable angina.\n3. LIVEBETTER will provide the first quantitative data on caregiver burden in older adults with stable angina."
