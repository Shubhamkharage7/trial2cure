            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) and handheld ultrasound (HHUS) for the screening of women who have undergone breast reconstruction after breast cancer. Ultrasounds use high-frequency sound waves to create pictures of internal organs and tissues. ABUS has been found to be equal to HHUS for whole breast screening, but no data exist on its use for screening of reconstructed patients. This clinical trial evaluates the feasibility of using ABUS versus HHUS to screen women who have undergone reconstruction.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To show that ABUS reduces artifact compared to HHUS in terms of detection of the residual tissue in reconstructed nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) and skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate both the performance and interpretation times for ABUS and HHUS so that these factors can be considered when scheduling patients and for ease of implementation into practice.\n\nII. A short survey will be administered immediately after both ultrasounds performed to enrolled patients to assess their experience with HHUS and ABUS, specifically addressing their perceived comfort level on a numerical scale and if they would be interested in obtaining subsequent annual screening HHUS or ABUS.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. The appearance of native and reconstructed anatomy on ABUS and HHUS will be studied.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants undergo HHUS and ABUS in no required order over 1 hour.\n\nParticipants with ultrasound results indicating Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 or 5 (suspicious and needs biopsy) undergo biopsy within 30 days."
