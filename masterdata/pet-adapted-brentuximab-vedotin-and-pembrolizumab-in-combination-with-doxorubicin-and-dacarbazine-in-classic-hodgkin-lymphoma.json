Subjects who can father children and have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 effective contraception methods during the study and for 7 months following the last dose of study drug. Subjects who can father children must also be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time.\n8. The subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative must provide written informed consent. Cognitive ability will be assessed according to policy CLN0547.\n9.

Subjects with nonmelanoma skin cancer, localized prostate cancer, or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.\n3. Prior immunosuppressive chemotherapy, therapeutic radiation, or any immunotherapy (e.g., immunoglobulin replacement, other monoclonal antibody therapies) within 4 weeks of first study drug dose, unless underlying disease has progressed on treatment.\n4.

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (adjusted for hemoglobin) \\<50% predicted.\n12. Documented history of a cerebral vascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms consistent with New York Heart Association Class III-IV within 6 months prior to their first dose of brentuximab vedotin. See Appendix E\n13. Subjects with Child-Pugh class B or C hepatic impairment.\n14. Other serious underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair the subject's ability to receive or tolerate the planned treatment and follow-up.\n15. Symptomatic neurologic disease compromising normal activities of daily living or requiring medications. See Appendix G\n16. Grade 2 or higher peripheral sensory or motor neuropathy at baseline.\n17. Left ventricular ejection fraction \\<45% or symptomatic cardiac disease (including symptomatic ventricular dysfunction, symptomatic coronary artery disease, and symptomatic arrhythmias), or previous treatment with complete cumulative doses of doxorubicin or other anthracyclines.\n18.

Known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n22. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n23. Known hypersensitivity to any excipient contained in the drug formulation of brentuximab vedotin, any component of AD, pembrolizumab, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, filgrastim, or pegfilgrastim.\n24.
