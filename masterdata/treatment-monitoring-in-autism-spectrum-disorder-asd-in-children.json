Normal or corrected-to-normal vision with visual acuity and oculomotor function sufficient to watch short videos.\n3. Hearing adequate to hear information presented in age-appropriate videos of social interactions.\n4. For individuals who have autism spectrum disorder and/or related developmental delays, the subject must be established in treatment (e.g., a treatment plan has been developed and child is undergoing treatment or will immediately begin treatment) and intends to remain in treatment continuously throughout the duration of the study. Additionally, individuals must provide a diagnostic report documenting a positive diagnosis of ASD/DD available for review. If a report is not available, subjects must undergo diagnostic evaluation prior to enrolling into the study.\n5. For individuals who are typically developing, the parent, referring clinician and/or daycare center have indicated that the child is not suspected of, nor has he/she exhibited signs of, developmental delays. NOTE: If, at screening, the investigator suspects the typically developing (TD) subject of having a developmental delay (based on feedback from referring clinician and/or daycare center along with expert clinician opinion), the subject shall be screen failed. He/she should be referred for diagnosis and then may be re-screened for the study.\n6. Subject and parent (or legally authorized representative) are able and agree to attend each required study visit and complete the full battery of psychometric assessments and questionnaires (electronically or in-person where required).\n7. Subject's parent (or legally authorized representative) can understand information, instructions, and videos presented in the English language.\n8. Subject's parent (or legally authorized representative) can read and understand the Informed Consent Form (ICF).\n9. Subject's parent (or legally authorized representative) provides written informed consent allowing the child subject to participate in the study. NOTE: where able, the child subject should also provide assent.\n\nExclusion criteria (cohort 1a):\n\nSubjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible to participate in Cohort 1a:\n\n1. Severe hearing or visual impairment (e.g., congenital nystagmus, congenital cataracts, previous diagnosis of severe hearing deficits by otoacoustic emissions or auditory brainstem response), which in the opinion of the investigator, would limit the child from completing the EarliPoint eye-tracking procedure or clinical reference assessments.\n\n   Note: Corrective lenses are allowable up to a prescription of +/- 5.0.\n2. Subject has an uncontrolled seizure disorder.\n3. Subject is unable or unwilling to undergo DQSVE testing for up to 15 minutes per assessment (e.g., child has frequent tantrums and tantrums do not subside within 5 minutes).\n4. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject and/or parent (or legally authorized representative) are unable, unwilling, or unlikely to comply with all study required procedures and follow-up assessments or to complete the full battery of psychometric assessments (electronically or in-person where required).\n5.

Male or female individuals between the ages of 31-78 months (chronological age) at the time of consent who have autism spectrum disorder and/or related developmental delays or those who are typically developing.\n\n   Note: The EarliPoint system is currently configured to monitor children between the ages of 31-84 months. Therefore, at the time of enrollment, participants must be 78 months to facilitate monitoring through 6 months of follow-up.\n2.
