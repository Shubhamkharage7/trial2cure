(Primary Aim 1) Increase the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a universal firearm injury prevention intervention at three participating trauma centers in the mid-Atlantic states;\n2. (Primary Aim 2) Assess firearm injury prevention knowledge, attitudes, and safe storage practices among trauma patients treated within participating trauma centers."

During the first wedge, none of the participating trauma centers will receive ACTFAST. During the second wedge, the first trauma center completes the Adoption and Implementation period. Over the third wedge, the first center shifts to the Maintenance period, the second trauma center enters the Adoption and Implementation period, and the remaining cohort stays in the control condition. This pattern continues until all trauma centers have progressed from control condition through the active implementation period.",
