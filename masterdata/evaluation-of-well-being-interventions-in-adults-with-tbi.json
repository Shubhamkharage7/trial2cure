Preliminary evidence suggests that after a TBI, an individual can experience significant alteration to their personal identity and a perceived loss of their pre-injury self. By using this Signature Strength intervention, adults with moderate to severe TBI will be able to become aware of their most used \"signature\" strengths, explore how these strengths are used in everyday life, and apply them in future situations to bring well-being and to better cope with stressors."
