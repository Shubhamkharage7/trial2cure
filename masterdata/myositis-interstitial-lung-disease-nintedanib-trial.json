            "briefSummary": "This research study will evaluate safety and how well the study drug, nintedanib improve symptoms in participants with myositis associated interstitial lung disease (MA-ILD). Interstitial lung disease is a disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of cells structures between air sacs of the lungs resulting in thickening, stiffness and scarring of the tissues of the lung.\n\nThis study will enroll a total of 134 participants across 15 clinical sites located in the United States. A subset of participants will be enrolled remotely via telemedicine utilizing certified mobile home research nurses and various remote monitoring devices.\n\nThe research visits may include a physical exam, vital signs (such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc.), pulmonary function tests (PFT and/or home spirometry), Computerized Tomography (or CT) scans of the chest, blood draws, wearing a physical activity monitor and completing questionnaires. Some of these events may be done at home, at a local facility or remotely (via telemedicine).",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants enrolled in the study will receive either study drug or placebo for 12 weeks plus the participant's normal standard of care medication for the participant's disease. Placebo is an inactive substance that contains no medicine. Following the initial treatment phase, participants will receive the active study drug (nintedanib) for an additional 12-week period.\n\nNintedanib is a drug that is currently used and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and has been shown to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function among patients with IPF as well as interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. In addition, in March 2020, the FDA approved nintedanib oral capsules to treat patients with chronic fibrosing (scarring) interstitial lung diseases (ILD) with a progressive phenotype (trait)."
