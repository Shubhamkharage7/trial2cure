The main question it aims to answer is if this treatment is effective in reducing symptoms of depression.\n\nParticipants will attend six 90-minute weekly classes via an app on their phone, and will be asked to complete surveys every week. Participants can expect to be in the study for four months.",

OHDC originally comprised of 13 treatment modules focused on culturally relevant strategies to increase knowledge of depression and healthy coping behaviors aimed at reducing symptoms of clinical depression and improving health outcomes.\n\nThe Oh Happy Day Class-Digital Connections (OHDC-DC) comprise of 5 core elements of the OHDC-DC:\n\n1. 90-minute-weekly cognitive behavioral psycho-education classes over a 6-week period.\n2. Six classes will be offered and facilitated online in the computerized OHDC-DC.\n3. Participants will be encouraged to stay engaged between classes by digitally connecting on the app with the class content. On the app they will receive reminders and messages from staff and participants to stay digitally connected and engaged.\n4. Embedded in the classes and content is psychoeducation with an emphasis on educating participants about depression, raising awareness of mental illness with the goal of normalizing it and reducing stigma, and increasing healthy coping behaviors, and.\n5. The intervention will be delivered by a licensed mental health clinician."
