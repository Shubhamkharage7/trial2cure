            "briefSummary": "Neurogenic overactive bladder (NOAB), characterized by urinary frequency, urgency or urgency incontinence symptoms occurring during the storage phase of the bladder, is the most common urinary complaint in multiple sclerosis (MS). Current management options for NOAB in MS have limited efficacy and considerable adverse effects, which underscores the significance of this study and highlights the need for better, less invasive therapies. This novel study investigates brain therapeutic targets that could shift the focus of NOAB management in MS from a bladder-centric focus to brain restoration; specifically modulating the brain regions identified in the prior functional magnetic resonance imagining studies. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation that can modulate neurons (excite or inhibit) to improve the connectivity of the regions of interest (ROI). The preliminary data demonstrate, for the first time, significant improvement in bladder symptoms in ten women with MS who have voiding dysfunction following multifocal transcranial magnetic stimulation without any treatment-related adverse effects.\n\nThis randomized double-blind, sham-controlled single center clinical trial with an optional open-label extension (OLE) phase is designed to evaluate the effects of targeted rTMS in women with MS and NOAB by investigating restorative reorganization of brain function The main purpose of this study is to determine the effects of individualized repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for improving overactive bladder symptoms such as urinary frequency and urgency with or without incontinence in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients will undergo initial screening that includes a demographics information, physical exam, past medical and surgical history, medication list, urine pregnancy test (female subjects with childbearing potential), and completion of questionnaires to confirm the eligibility of patients. All eligible patients will be required to complete a functional MRI scan followed by locating the regions of interest through neural navigation system and finally receiving 10 treatment sessions.\n\nSince this is a randomized trial, some patients will receive active treatment/ therapy sessions while others will only receive sham or placebo treatments. The total duration to complete all treatment sessions and follow up visits is approximately 4-5 months.",

Investigators will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims:\n\nAim 1: To determine the clinical effects of neuronavigated and multifocal active/sham rTMS in women with MS and NOAB Aim 2: To assess the neuroimaging restorative effects of neuronavigated active/sham rTMS in women with MS and NOAB Aim 3: To assess the long-term safety and therapeutic effects of repeated rTMS in women with MS and NOAB who participate in the OLE phase (which subjects from both groups will be invited to enter at the 3-month follow up).\n\nEfforts to improve the current knowledge of brain contribution to lower urinary tract function and the development of an individualized, noninvasive, and effective treatment modality at the level of the brain will greatly impact the quality of life for individuals with MS and subsequently others with OAB, whether neurogenic or non-neurogenic"
