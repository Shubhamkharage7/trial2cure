            "briefSummary": "Youth exposed to early life adversity (ELA) are known to be at greater risk for depression and suicidality and account for almost half of the youth suffering from psychiatric diseases today. Youth exposed to ELA consistently report symptoms of anhedonia as well as dysregulated positive affect. The present project will test the efficacy of PAT in a sample of ELA-exposed adolescents in order to determine whether PAT increases positive affect, and subsequently symptoms of depression. For this pilot, the investigators will recruit 22 adolescents exposed to two or more childhood adversities (ACEs) who do not currently have major depressive disorder, and randomize them (1:1) to either participate in PAT or a waitlist control condition. At study enrollment, then 4-, 8, and 12-months thereafter the investigators will measure positive affect and depressive symptoms (including anhedonia). The results of this study will be used to inform whether PAT has the potential to prevent major depressive episodes among adversity-exposed youth."
