The overarching goal is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the adjunct application of PRP in the fibromuscular connective tissue (the site of anterior tissue plication) at the time of anterior colporrhaphy (the site of highest recurrence risk) in women undergoing native tissue vaginal prolapse repair, to promote tissue healing and regeneration, thus to improve surgical outcomes."
