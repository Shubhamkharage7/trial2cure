To evaluate the safety and efficacy of portal vein stenting in patients with portal vein (PV) stenosis and gastrointestinal malignancies, including quality of life measurements.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Stent patency and duration of clinical success related to the intervention. II. Compare the efficacy of portal vein stenting on liver volumes, nutritional status, and laboratory values relative to patients with portal vein stenosis/thrombosis who do not undergo portal vein stenting.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT A: Patients complete a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire at 2-4 weeks and then 6-8 weeks after portal vein stenting procedure. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.\n\nCOHORT B: Patients' medical records are reviewed retrospectively."
