            "detailedDescription": "Participants of this pilot clinical trial will be randomized in a blinded 2:2 crossover manner to receive placebo and sitagliptin 100 mg/d (DPP4 inhibitor), in random order. Subjects will receive each intervention for seven days, with a study day on day 7. Each intervention will be separated by a 4-week washout period. Each subject will have up to four separate visits: 1) DXA, echocardiogram, 2) cardiac MRI, 3) mixed meal during placebo, 4) mixed meal during sitagliptin.\n\nThe study will include 10 cases and 10 controls. Among these, there will be five heterozygous cases and five matched controls with elevated blood pressure (history of blood pressure 130/80 on more than one occasion or prior diagnosis of hypertension by a medical provider) and five cases and five controls without hypertension."
