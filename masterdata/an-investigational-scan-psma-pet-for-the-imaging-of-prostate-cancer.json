Patients receiving systemic therapy undergo an additional 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MR scan 12 weeks after initiating therapy. Patients may also undergo CT and bone scan during screening.\n\nAfter the completion of study, patients are followed up at 60 days, 6 months, and annually up to 5 years or until time of first progression."
