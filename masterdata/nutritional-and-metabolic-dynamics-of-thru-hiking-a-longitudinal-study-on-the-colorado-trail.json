            "briefSummary": "Thru-hiking the Colorado Trail presents distinct challenges owing to its diverse landscapes and high altitudes. The study aims to delve into the physiological and nutritional facets of extended wilderness trekking among thru-hikers. Activities encompass participant recruitment from the Colorado Trail Foundation community, baseline and post-trail assessments including blood lipid panel analysis and anthropometric measurements, data collection during the trail period involving recording daily mileage, exertion levels, and dietary intake, rigorous statistical analysis to explore correlations among various parameters, and adherence to ethical considerations including obtaining formal approval and ensuring informed consent procedures are followed to safeguard participants' rights and privacy. Through this endeavor, the study seeks to offer insights into the metabolic responses and cardiovascular implications associated with thru-hiking, shedding light on the interplay between diet, lifestyle factors, and metabolic health in challenging environments.\n\nThe specific aims include examining the metabolic responses and cardiovascular implications associated with thru-hiking, exploring correlations between dietary intake and blood lipid profiles, and elucidating the interplay between lifestyle factors and metabolic health in demanding environments. This study is not limited to program evaluation, quality assurance, or improvement activities within a specific department or setting but rather seeks to contribute to scientific knowledge and inform evidence-based recommendations for individuals engaging in thru-hiking or similar high-intensity activities."
