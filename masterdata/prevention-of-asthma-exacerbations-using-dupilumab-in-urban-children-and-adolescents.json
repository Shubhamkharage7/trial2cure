Approximately 240 participants will be randomized 2:1 to one of two study arms: 1) guidelines-based asthma treatment + dupilumab, or 2) guidelines-based asthma treatment + placebo. Study treatment will continue for 1 year with an additional 3 months of follow-up following completion of study treatment.\n\nAn initial Screening Visit will be followed by a 4-week run-in period. After the run-in, participants who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms and receive their first injection. Over the next 2 weeks, participants will return to the clinic for 3 early treatment response visits. Participants will receive injections of dupilumab or placebo administered subcutaneously every two weeks (Q2W) over 12 months. Each participant will have Evaluation and Management (E\\&M) visits every 3 months where their asthma and rhinitis will be assessed and adjustments made to their medications based on asthma guidelines.\n\nParticipants will be asked to monitor and self-report cold symptoms throughout the treatment period. Participants will be asked to complete up to three paired cold visits. At the time of a cold, participants will be asked to come into the clinic for collection of blood and nasal secretions for associated mechanistic studies. Approximately three days after the clinic visit, participants will complete symptom assessments and will be asked to collect nasal samples at home."
