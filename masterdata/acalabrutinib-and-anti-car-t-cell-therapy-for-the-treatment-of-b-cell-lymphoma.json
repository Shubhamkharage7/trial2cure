Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking key pathways needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with axicabtagene ciloleucel is engineered to target a specific surface antigen on lymphoma cells. Acalabrutinib may enhance the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nBeginning up to 3 weeks and at least 24 hours prior to leukapheresis, patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive axicabtagene ciloleucel intravenously (IV) at 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5 years."
