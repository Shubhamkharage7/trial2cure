The first technique will include SGRT, but with the assistance of implanted fiducials. Subjects will be treated with a breath hold technique utilizing SGRT, but will also be imaged during treatment with fiducial match. The second technique will utilize SGRT for breath hold treatments without the assistance of implanted fiducials/continuous imaging.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study's primary objective is estimate the incidence of SBRT and fiducial-related pulmonary toxicities for subjects treated with SBRT who have tumors that move \u2265 1 cm in 3 different cohorts: 1) free breathing with SGRT 2) breath hold utilizing SGRT only; 3) breath hold utilizing SGRT in combination with implanted fiducials. Secondary objectives also include Estimate reliability of gated SBRT treatments utilizing SGRT vs. SGRT with fiducials estimating local control for SBRT in subjects treated in the three different cohorts, estimating overall survival, and evaluating quality of life. A safety objective of estimating acute and long-term grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicities attributed to SBRT/fiducial implantation in subjects treated in the three different cohorts will also be explored."

Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of fiducials in combination with SBRT in subjects \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\n3. ECOG Performance Status of \u2264 2.\n4. Stage IA-IIB (T1a-T3bN0) presumed non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoid tumors, or lung metastasis that have \u2265 1 cm of respiratory associated motion measured on 4DCT at time of simulation for SBRT with or without respiratory motion suppression techniques. Histologic confirmation of malignancy is encouraged but not required. Primary or metastatic tumor \u2264 7 cm.\n5. Subjects may be receiving systemic chemotherapy or other systemic agents prior to enrollment, but these agents must be stopped during SBRT treatments.\n6. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to day 1 of treatment. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause).\n7. The effects of radiation on the developing human fetus are not well described. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and non-sterilized men who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. FCBP must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a failure rate of \\<1% per year when used consistently and correctly) from the time of informed consent until 5 days after last dose of SBRT. Contraceptive methods with low user dependency are preferable but not required.\n8. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nSubjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:\n\n1. Prior radiation to the chest that would overlap with the current radiation fields and determined by the treating physician to impede the treatment of the study malignancy.\n2. Active ongoing pulmonary infection or pneumonitis that is requiring active treatment with antibiotics or steroids. Prior pneumonitis from drug or other therapies that has been treated within 15 days of first day of treatment.",
