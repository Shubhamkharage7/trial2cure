            "briefSummary": "Constipation is a very common problem. Western style toilets that are nearly universal in the United States require the person to sit on the toilet. However, results from uncontrolled studies suggests that a squatting posture (as prevalent in many foreign countries) may be better at facilitating evacuation compared to a Western style commode. One uncontrolled, unpublished study suggests that a footstool improved bowel symptoms in nearly 98% of 153 constipated participants. Hence, the investigators propose to evaluate the benefits of a footstool on symptoms and anorectal functions in constipated patients. Hypothesis: the regular squatting assist device (7 inches) but not a sham device (2 inches tall) will improve symptoms of constipation."
