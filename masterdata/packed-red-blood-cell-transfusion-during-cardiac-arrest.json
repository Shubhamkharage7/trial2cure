The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of PRBC transfusion during cardiac CA to help optimize the methods required to augment cerebral and other vital organ oxygen delivery during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The secondary objectives are to assess the effect of PRBC transfusion during prolonged cardiac arrests on cerebral oxygenation, end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to discharge, biomarkers of neural injury and inflammation, and neurological outcomes at hospital discharge, 30 days post-CA, and 90 days post-CA."
