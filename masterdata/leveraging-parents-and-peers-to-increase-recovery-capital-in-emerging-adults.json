            "briefSummary": "Emerging adults (EAs; aged 18-26) are the highest-risk population for poly-substance use (misuse of more than one drug), compared to all other age groups and are the least-served population for substance use services. The overarching purpose of this pilot study is to assess whether an innovative services package, Launch, can reasonably work (is feasible) and whether providers and participants like it (acceptability). Launch works with both EAs and a supportive parent (or parental figure) and delivers peer recovery support services (PRSS) to EAs while helping parents use an effective, evidence-based program called contingency management, adapted for EAs, at home with their EA child. This study will also lay the groundwork for a future large-scale trial of Launch services.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of the study is to investigate a scalable service that can be used in rural communities called Launch. Launch is an innovative adaptation of current evidence-based services for Emerging Adults (EAs), ages 18-26 years old with polysubstance use (poly-SU); with a particular emphasis on increasing their recovery capital. Recovery capital is the resources available to promote substance use recovery (e.g., vocational/educational skills, recovery-supportive community). Launch leverages (1) parents of EAs and (2) peer recovery support services (PRSS), while ensuring services are equitable and scalable by using digital technology and existing substance use services infrastructure. Participants will be 48 families that include an EA struggling with poly-SU and a parent or parental figure supportive of their EA child's recovery journey. Families will be randomized to one of three conditions detailed further in the attached materials that include either: (1) Virtual Parent Contingency Management for Emerging Adults (CM-EA) Coach for parents only, (2) In-Person PRSS for EAs only, or (3) a combination of Virtual Parent CM-EA Coach for parents and In-Person PRSS for EAs. Quantitative and qualitative measures will assess the feasibility and acceptability of Launch. Additionally, payors/providers of substance use services will be interviewed in this study with the aim of improving future uptake and implementation of the service should it be deemed effective.\n\nThe aims of the study are as follows:\n\n1. Adapt and evaluate the Launch parent coach and PRSS training protocols/adherence tools.\n2. Assess the feasibility and acceptability of (a) a virtual study protocol for recruiting, assessing, and retaining parents and EAs and (b) Launch components.\n3. Determine from payors and providers the data needed for future funding and delivery of Launch, as well as develop a site recruitment pool for a rigorous R01 trial."

Additionally, parents are trained to complete functional analyses in collaboration with their EA to identify the EA's triggers for poly-substance use and negative behaviors.
