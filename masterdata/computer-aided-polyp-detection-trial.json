The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the novel Pentax Discovery CADe system (Discovery-AI) against pre-recorded videos of colon polyps of various size, shape and pathology while using videos of normal colon segments as controls from two different institutes.",

Final results of polyp histology were also collected. The video library was then independently reviewed for quality assessment by 3 experienced gastroenterologists. Videos that passed the initial quality assessment were then independently evaluated using the Discovery-AI system.\n\nAim of the study was to evaluate overall performance of Discovery-AI system for polyps of various size, morphology and pathology utilizing a prospectively developed video library."
