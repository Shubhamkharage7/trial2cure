This study will compare the effectiveness of two brief suicide prevention interventions that have been adapted for use with this population to use in primary care via telehealth and will recruit youth from primary care clinics in Texas metropolitan areas. The primary study outcome is suicidal ideation. Each clinic will be randomly assigned to deliver one of the two study interventions."
