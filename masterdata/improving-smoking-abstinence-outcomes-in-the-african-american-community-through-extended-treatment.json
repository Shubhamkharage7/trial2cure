A two-arm, randomized design will be used to evaluate the efficacy of extended (6 months) bupropion treatment compared to standard (7 weeks) bupropion treatment. Baseline randomization stratified by gender and cpd (\u226410, \\>10cpd) will assign participants (N=500) to receive extended treatment (EXT; 24 weeks of bupropion, n=250) or standard treatment (ST; 7 weeks of bupropion, n=250). All participants will receive culturally-relevant, individualized smoking cessation counseling, including support for medication adherence, and will be followed through Month 12."
