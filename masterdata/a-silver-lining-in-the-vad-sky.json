            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized trail (RCT) of a driveline management protocol. The study will be initiated at UCSF from January 1st 2022 to December 31st 2022 as a pilot to be extended to other sites with the ultimate goal to develop a multi-center RCT. The driveline dressing protocol studied will include a silver-based dressing barrier as well as a dressing change protocol and material designed to reduce the risk of driveline dressing induced dermatitis and allergies. Assessment will include DLI rates, DLI speciation, dermatitis rate, comfort, ease of use, compliance and cost",
            "detailedDescription": "This prospective research clinical trial will be conducted in a single academic medical center. The enrollment period will be between January 1st, 2022 and December 31st, 2023. The initial follow-up period will be closed on December 31st 2023 with a continuation of the follow-up until December 31st 2024. Patients will be selected from current LVAD patients followed by our medical center clinic and from patients implanted with LVAD at our center during the study enrollment timeframe. Patients will be randomly assigned to the control protocol and the silver protocol. Both protocols will be taught to the patients and nursing staff by the VAD coordinators. The comparative evaluation will be done through adverse event collection, driveline culture results, patient survey and DL photos at specific intervals.\n\nInterventions A new driveline dressing kit will be trialed on patients randomized to the intervention arm of the study. Both arms will have a regular dressing kit and a sensitive dressing kit.\n\nThe trial arm kits include:\n\n1. For standard dressing: a silverlon antimicrobial patch, CHG swabs for cleaning, an occlusive dressing with window, and driveline anchors. The driveline dressing change frequency will be weekly.\n2. For sensitive skin dressing: a silverlon antimicrobial patch, Providone/iodine swabs for cleaning, an occlusive dressing with window, and sensitive driveline anchors. The driveline dressing change frequency will be weekly.\n\nThe control arm kits include:\n\n1. For standard dressing: No antimicrobial barrier, CHG swabs for cleaning, an occlusive dressing with window, and driveline anchors. The driveline dressing change frequency will be every 96 hours.\n2. For sensitive skin dressing: No antimicrobial barrier, Providone/iodine swabs for cleaning, an occlusive dressing with window, and driveline anchors. The driveline dressing change frequency will be every 96hr."
