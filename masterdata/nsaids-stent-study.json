            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot study to (1) evaluate the effect of Ketorolac on inflammatory response and its impact on stent related symptoms in patients undergoing stent placement procedure and (2) assess feasibility of recruitment, randomization, assessment procedures and implementation of the study intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "Ureteral stent is routinely placed following ureteroscopic procedures to aid in urinary drainage post-operatively. Up to 80% of patients, however, experience stent-related symptoms (SRS) including lower abdominal pain, burning with urination, blood in urine and voiding symptoms affecting activities of their daily living. Intra- and/or post-operative therapeutic options are limited and most are initiated following the ureteral stent placement when the inflammatory process has already begun from ureteral manipulation, further limiting their efficacy. We, therefore, hypothesize that pre-operative intravenous administration of Ketorolac, with its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, will reduce the inflammatory process during ureteral manipulation and reduce SRS.\n\nThe eligible patients undergoing ureteral stent placement will be randomized 1:1 into either intervention or control group. Subjects in the intervention group will receive intravenous injection of 1 ml of Ketorlac 30 mg/ml, whereas subjects in the control group will receive 1 ml of 0.9% injectable normal saline, prior to the start of the procedure. A panel of plasma inflammatory markers will be drawn and assessed pre- and post-operatively as well as at the time of stent removal as an objective measures for inflammation.\n\nA follow-up telephone call will be made by the nursing staff on post-operative day one to check on patient status and to re-educate the patients to follow the protocol.\n\nTo assess SRS, all participants will complete the AUA Symptom Score Questionnaire and the Analog Pain Scale prior to the procedure. On post-operative day 1 and at the time of stent removal (prior to the stent being taken out), participants will complete the USSQ1 and the AUA Symptom Score. At the time of subsequent follow up visit, participants will complete the USSQ2 and AUA Symptom Score."
