            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a brief, episodic future thinking (EFT) intervention in a substance use treatment setting serving returning citizens with substance use disorders (SUD).\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Determine preliminary implementation potential of the EFT intervention, including acceptability and feasibility of conducting the intervention.\n2. Examine the preliminary effectiveness of this approach, with a specific focus on patient outcomes, including changes in delay discounting, treatment retention, treatment motivation, and substance use.\n\nParticipants will be asked to participant in pre and post assessment questionnaires, participate in a single-episode brief intervention followed by tailored phone call follow-ups.",
            "detailedDescription": "Returning citizens with substance use disorders (SUD) are at the greatest risk for overdose in the first two weeks following the transition from incarceration. Thus, the reentry period is of specific importance for ensuring individuals are engaged and retained in specialized intervention services. Individuals also face numerous, and highly impactful, decisions during this period. They are required to navigate complex tasks (finding employment, securing housing), often with limited financial and social supports. Of particular concern, recent research suggests that the reentry period, often characterized by instability and limited resources, may reinforce a decision-making approach that favors meeting immediate needs relative to engaging in long-term planning. This focus on attaining smaller but immediately available rewards relative to larger, delayed, rewards (known as delay discounting), in turn, has been associated with a number of negative health outcomes, including substance use and poor treatment outcomes (higher dropout and lower motivation). In other words, the reentry context may create an environment which reinforces individuals' tendencies to engage in short-term, reward-seeking behaviors (e.g. substance use, skipping treatment appointments) at a time when their decisions have highly significant consequences (relapse, recidivism). This study will examine the efficacy of implementing a low-cost, brief intervention (Episodic Future Thinking) targeting the reduction of delay discounting with the reentry population to inform broader public health efforts aimed at reducing substance misuse and improvements in treatment outcomes."
