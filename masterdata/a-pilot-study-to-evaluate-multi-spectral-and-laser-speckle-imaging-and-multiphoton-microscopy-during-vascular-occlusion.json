A pressure cuff occlusion will be used to stimulate blood flow dynamic that these instruments are designed to sense. The researcher currently plan to assess only basic feasibility of the imaging instruments.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary reason for including pressure cuff occlusion in this protocol is to test the performance of Multi-Spectral Imaging and Laser Speckle Imaging can measure in the full range of vascular conditions ranging from ischemic (under-perfused or unsaturated) to hyperemic (over-perfused and over-saturated).\n\n1. Modulated Imaging a non-contact optical imaging technology can detect the concentration of total hemoglobin, deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin in absolute amounts in units of millimoles / unit volume of tissue measured.\n2. Laser Speckle Imaging a non-contact optical imaging technology consists of a coherent light source, camera, and image acquisition system. This image device can measure and compare relative flow in vasculature at varied time points."

Time series of optical sections (two-dimensional x-y images parallel to the skin surface of about 250x250 \u00b5m2) at the same depth will be obtained before, during and after the arm occlusion. The images will be based on two-photon excitation of endogenous fluorophores (NADH). To quantify the fluorescence signal, which will provide information about changes of cellular metabolism, we will use the integrated brightness of each image (same rectangular area for all images) as a measure of the signal. The integrated brightness is defined as the sum of pixels weighted over the brightness values (or gray values) of the pixel. A statistical plan is not appropriate at this stage of the pilot study.",
