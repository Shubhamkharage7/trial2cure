The study comprises 2 parts: a Phase 1 Dose Escalation and a Phase 2 Dose Expansion. The Phase 1 will investigate the safety and tolerability of PBI-410 and identify one or more recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) (if one exists). Phase 2 will investigate the preliminary efficacy of PBI-410 in signal-finding expansion cohorts."
