The study will consist of initial screening tests and diagnostics to determine eligibility, followed by outcome measure testing and treatment.

The Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 49) will involve using the digital therapy at home. Midpoint (Day 25) assessments will be conducted on-site to assess key outcomes. Final Post-Treatment (Day 50) assessments will be conducted on-site to assess key outcomes."
