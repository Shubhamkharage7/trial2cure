            "detailedDescription": "Hematology laboratories rely on flow cytometry technology (in addition to classic hematological methods) to aid in screening, diagnosing, and monitoring patients with hematological disorders. High speed and broad applicability of flow cytometry allows for the diagnosis. Currently, there are no consensus panels being used; consequently, the leukemia \\& lymphoma (L\\&L) testing remains a single-vial antibody being used, with various in-house laboratory developed tests (LDTs) being used to test patient specimens. Furthermore, the analysis of flow cytometer generated data is not standardized and requires a high level of expertise and training for interpretation of complex data. Therefore, optimized and standardized immunostaining protocols for the diagnosis, classification, and prognostic sub-classification of hematological malignancies are needed.\n\nEnrollment will occur at up to 8 investigational sites . Data will be acquired from Eligible remnant/leftover specimens on the BD FACSLyric flow cytometer and evaluated by site personnel and expert analysts .\n\nThe final diagnosis and the affected cell population will be determined by site standard of care .\n\nAnalysis of data will evaluate identification of 1) normal vs abnormal cell populations and 2) BCP-ALL, AML, and less certain diseases by the expert \\& site analysts as compared to the final diagnosis."
