The AI model will determine the percentage of tumor and necrotic tissue in each image. Histology assessment will be made in the same manner to determine AI model outcome.\n* Age \u2265 18 years at the time of consenting\n* Life expectancy \u2265 3 months\n* Platelet count \\>50,000/mm3 within 6 weeks of screening\n* INR \\<1.5 within 6 weeks of screening\n* If taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation medication, it must be able to be discontinued 48 hours prior to the procedure or at the discretion of the PI (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, LMWH preparations)\n* ECOG performance status \\<= 2 within 6 weeks of screening.\n* Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal participants. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply: Women \\<50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization. Women \u226550 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization.\n* All lines of prior systemic therapy are permissible. Standard concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy are permissible.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, interstitial lung disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant or nursing women; women of childbearing potential unless using effective contraception as determined by the investigator.\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\<1000 mm3 within 6 weeks of screening\n* Active infection",
