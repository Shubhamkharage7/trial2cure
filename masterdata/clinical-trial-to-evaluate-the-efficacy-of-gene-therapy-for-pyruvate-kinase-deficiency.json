Liver biopsy is required when liver iron concentration (LIC) is \u226515 mg/g on T2\\* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of liver.\n   2. If a liver biopsy has been performed less than 6 months prior to enrollment, it does not need to be repeated.\n4.

Patients with creatinine above ULN may be eligible pending documentation of a glomerular filtration rate \u226560 mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation (Stevens 2006), or 24-hour urine collection.\n11. Pulmonary dysfunction as defined by either:\n\n    1. Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks (in absence of acute infection) OR\n    2. Clinically significant pulmonary disease that may impair ability to tolerate study procedures and treatments.\n12. Any medical or other contraindication for leukapheresis as determined by the treating Investigator.\n13. Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Investigator renders the patient unfit for trial participation or at higher than acceptable risk for participation.\n14. Poor functional status evidenced by Karnofsky Index \\<70 in subjects \u226516 years old and Lansky Play-Performance Scale \\<70 in subjects \\<16 years old.\n15. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug within 14 days before the informed consent signature. Participation in observational studies is allowed. Patients who are receiving mitapivat in non-investigational settings are eligible provided they discontinue mitapivat at least 90 days prior to the start of mobilization.\n16. Pregnant women or women with a positive serum pregnancy test at screening or breast feeding or planning to become pregnant within the next 24 months. Female participants or female partners of male participants not willing to use highly effective contraceptive methods during the complete study period.\n17.
