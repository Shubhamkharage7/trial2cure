            "detailedDescription": "This interventional, comparative effectiveness study investigates the impact of integrating the first newborn outpatient provider and lactation consultant visits, potentially reducing appointments for new mothers while ensuring early lactation support. The outcomes, including breastfeeding continuation rates and maternal satisfaction, will be measured against the conventional separate visit model. The ultimate goal is to prolong breastfeeding duration, enhance care quality, improve efficiency, and enrich patient experience."
