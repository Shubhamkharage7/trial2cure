            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMen who are treated for prostate cancer often develop urinary leakage (incontinence). An experimental device that uses electrical impulses to stimulate pelvic floor muscles and surrounding tissues may help.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if the Elidah device can reduce urinary incontinence after prostate treatment.\n\nEligibility:\n\nMen aged 18 years and older who have had moderate urinary incontinence for at least 6 months after treatment for prostate cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be in the study for about 9 weeks. They will be screened. They will have a physical exam with urine tests.\n\nThe Elidah device consists of a Controller and a GelPad. The Controller sets the strength of electrical impulses. The GelPad is placed against the skin under the pelvis.\n\nParticipants will be given an Elidah device and taught how to use it at home.\n\nThey will use the device once a day for 20 minutes at a time; they will do this 5 days a week for 6 weeks.\n\nParticipants will complete a daily log. They will record the strength of electrical impulses (0-35); the number of incontinence episodes; the type of incontinence episode; and the number of used pads.\n\nParticipants will do a pad weight test. For 3 days before and 3 days after using the Elidah device, they will collect all of their used pads for each 24-hour period into a sealed plastic bag. They will also collect a second set of bags that contain dry versions of each product used.\n\nParticipants will have clinic visits after using the device for 3 weeks and after finishing the 6 weeks of treatment.\n\nParticipants will complete 15-minute questionnaires.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Urinary incontinence is a common side effect of prostate cancer therapy that can negatively impact the quality of life.\n* Standard treatment includes an initial course of pelvic floor muscle exercises followed by surgical therapy if urinary incontinence persists.\n* Although pelvic floor muscle exercises can be successful in reducing urinary incontinence, compliance with exercises is poor.\n* The Elitone (registered trademark) device was recently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in women with stress urinary incontinence. This device provides a surface electrical muscle stimulation device designed to contract the pelvic floor muscles and has been shown to reduce incontinence in women using the product.\n* Recently, the electrode component (GelPad) of the device has been adapted for use in men by the manufacturing company, Elidah. The male version of the device is named the Elidah device.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To describe the efficacy of the Elidah device on male urinary incontinence\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Participants must be male.\n* Participants must have a history of urinary incontinence for at least 6 months after prostate cancer treatment.\n* Participants must have at least one of the following types of urinary incontinence:\n\n  * stress urinary incontinence, defined as involuntary loss of urine on effort or physical exertion (e.g., sporting activities), or on sneezing or coughing;\n  * urge urinary incontinence, defined as a compelling need to urinate, due to pain or an unpleasant sensation, that is difficult to defer.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a phase II trial testing the efficacy of the Elidah device in people treated for prostate cancer with stress and/or urge urinary incontinence.\n* Prior to treatment, participants will undergo baseline assessments including 24-hour pad weight testing and questionnaires relating to incontinence and quality of life.\n* Participants will self-administer the Elidah device treatment for 20 minutes per day, 5 days per week during a 6-week period in the at-home environment. Participants will maintain a Daily Log to record usage of the Elidah device, urinary leaks, and use of pads during each week of treatment.\n* Following 6 weeks of therapy, participants will undergo re-evaluation of symptoms and urinary incontinence via questionnaires and testing with the 24-hour pad weight test."
