            "detailedDescription": "This outcome evaluation will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the Whole Health Lifestyle Care for Reproductive Well-being Pilot Program (\"Lifestyle Care for Fertility\" or LCF) and collection of health behavior and patient-reported outcomes. Secondarily, it will also examine the longitudinal changes in health behaviors and patient-reported outcomes of participants in the Lifestyle Care for Fertility program\n\nThe Lifestyle Care for Fertility program serves women who have a fertility-related diagnosis. The program consists of an individual Integrative Health and Medicine (IHM) consultation with a CWH IHM provider, 4 Shared Medical Appointments (SMA), and 4 individual Health and Wellness Coaching (HWC) sessions. The SMA sessions occur at the UH CWH Beachwood office conference and movement rooms. The HWC sessions are virtual. The consultations are either virtual or in person at UH CWH Beachwood. Topics include meditation, sleep, yoga/exercise/movement, acupuncture, and nutrition\n\nParticipation in the program is not contingent on participation in the outcome evaluation. Patients with a uterus aged 18-50 who have a fertility-related diagnosis are eligible to participate in the program. Participants in the outcome evaluation will be a subset of the participants in the program who give their consent to researchers to collect survey and EHR data.\n\nThe outcome evaluation will collect data at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and before, after, and in between each of the 8 weekly sessions. Data collected at baseline include demographics, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 8a, Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS-4), Infertility Self Efficacy Scale (ISE), and current Health Behaviors (HB). The HB survey will be administered between Sessions 1-8, as well as after Session 8, to observe any longitudinal changes. Patients will complete the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 8a, PSS-4, and ISE at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Pre- and post-session data includes 0-10 NRS ratings of stress, energy, focus, well-being, perceived support (post-only), and satisfaction (post-only). Additionally, participants will complete a satisfaction survey post Session 8. All data will be collected in REDCap via a text message or email link sent to the participant. Research staff will review the participant's medical record to collect data on the participant's demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline, and to collect chemical pregnancy data at six months after the 8 sessions have been completed. Attendance data about participants will also be collected."
