            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests proton beam radiation therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have undergone surgical resection and have lymph nodes involving the middle of the chest. Proton therapy is a type of radiation treatment that kills cancer cells while avoiding surrounding healthy tissue. Proton beam therapy is sometimes used after cancer surgery to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence (coming back). Giving proton beam radiation therapy may work better than conventional radiation treatment after surgery in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the safety of proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) for resected N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To measure the radiation dose to the circulating immune compartment and explore its association with clinical endpoints.\n\nII. To assess the efficacy of PBRT for resected N2 NSCLC.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo radiation treatment planning and then undergo proton beam radiation therapy on study. Patients also undergo collection of blood samples.\n\nPatients are followed up for 24 months after first dose of radiotherapy."
