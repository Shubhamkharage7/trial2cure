            "detailedDescription": "Obesity is an ongoing epidemic and a serious public health problem. Recent insights into the involvement of the circadian system (i.e., an internal biological rhythm) in energy expenditure and appetite control offer a new perspective to understand the relationship between dietary composition and weight management. Particularly, dietary composition may impact whole-body physiology in part through changes in the circadian system. The study protocol is designed to test the effects of dietary composition, on the rhythms of food intake and appetite regulation, and rhythms of energy expenditure. This study seeks to understand the relationship between dietary composition and weight control in order to lay the groundwork for evidence-based dietary intervention to combat obesity."
