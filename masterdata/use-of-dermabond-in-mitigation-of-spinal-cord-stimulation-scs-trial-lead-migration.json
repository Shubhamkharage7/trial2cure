Migration (or movement in the epidural space after placement) of the leads can result in up to 2.49 mm to 3.24 mm migration in the leads depending on trial length . During the trial the leads remain outside of the skin and can be prone to migration. The leads are typically secured in place with suture, tape, or a combination of both. This study will evaluate the amount of movement based on the method of being secured at the time of placement"
