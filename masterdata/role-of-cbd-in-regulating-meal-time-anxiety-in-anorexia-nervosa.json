            "briefSummary": "No studies of cannabidiol (CBD) have focused on Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Dose, side effects, tolerability, acceptability of pure CBD in AN must be established. The current study is an important first step in the investigation of CBD for AN. Cannabis products have been recently legalized in many states, and CBD in particular has been shown to reduce anxiety. Therefore, CBD may represent a promising new treatment for AN. The endocannabinoid system is involved in the regulation of functions relevant to eating disorders. Furthermore, data suggest that eating disorders are associated with alterations of the endocannabinoid system. Prior attempts to target the endocannabinoid system in AN have focused on CB1 receptor agonists that can increase anxiety. Moreover, CBD may be particularly beneficial in decreasing anxiety in AN via its action at serotonin receptors. Lastly, the impact of CBD on eating behavior and weight in AN must be determined. The current study seeks to explore these hypotheses using the aims in the following section."
