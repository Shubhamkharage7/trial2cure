            "briefSummary": "Reducing Opioid Mortality in Illinois (ROMI) is 5-year research study led by the University of Chicago in partnership with the University of Illinois at Chicago's (UIC) Community Outreach Intervention Projects (COIP), the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) and the American Institutes for Research (AIR). ROMI aims to understand and test strategies for linking individuals with a history of opioid use disorder who are released from Illinois jails and prisons to substance use treatment. ROMI is one of twelve grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) to support research on quality addiction treatment for opioid use disorder in criminal justice settings nationwide.",
            "detailedDescription": "This NIDA-funded multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of an established, intensive case management model for study participants who are awaiting release from four jails and two prisons across Illinois. The investigators seek to demonstrate that a unified case management approach can improve treatment engagement and retention among individuals who face high risks of opioid use disorders, overdose, and related harms. The investigators will examine the impact of case management and peer recovery coaching on participants' engagement with treatment and harm reduction interventions. The investigators will also study secondary outcomes including insurance enrollment, re-arrest, use of mental health services, and more.\n\nROMI will enroll at least 300 individuals with opioid disorders in the CMPR group, and at least 300 participants in the naloxone-only across five geographically distinct sites of care. All participants will receive harm reduction resources. The investigators hypothesize that the treatment group will display declines in opioid use, re-arrest, self-reported syringe sharing, and overdose risk behaviors relative to the control groups. The investigators will also examine differences between urban - rural and rural differences in treatment engagement and retention engagement, retention, and downstream outcomes across treatment arms. Aside from demonstrating these treatment impacts, the investigators will guide, document and evaluate ROMI's implementation efforts to ensure consistency across sites across sites and to inform future replication of the model in different settings or for different populations. (Edited 11/27/23 to reflect changes in recruitment from 500 in each treatment arm to 300)"

Where beneficial and desired by the clients, PRCs will accompany clients to provider and select service appointments to promote engagement and retention. CM/PRC teams will provide OEND upon community re-entry. The teams will provide follow-up phone calls and home visits to facilitate service linkages. Contact frequency will depend on clients' individual barriers (e.g., transportation, homelessness), but will include at least weekly in-person or telephone check-ins for first six months, reduced to monthly check-ins after that.",
