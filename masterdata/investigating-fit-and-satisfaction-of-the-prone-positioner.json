The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the fit and satisfaction of the device?\n* Does the device fulfill the goal of allowing infants with trachs participate in tummy time\n* What aesthetic feedback will the study team receive on the prone positioner from families, therapists, and nursing staff.\n\nParticipants will be placed in the Prone Positioner, they will be monitored for their comfort/satisfaction with use, and how well they are able to be receive ventilation while in the device. Parents of these infants, as well as healthcare providers, will be surveyed on thoughts/suggestions for the Prone Positioner.",
            "detailedDescription": "A trained member of this study staff will be always present in the patient room during the fit test. For the fit test, a therapist from the study team will takes measurements of the infant and then place the infant in the prone positioner device. At no time will the baby be left alone or unsupported by staff. The study team will assess the physical fit, ease of getting the infant in and out of the device, and the patient's tolerance to being in the positioner.\n\nParents/guardians will be able to be present while the patient is in the device (if the parents are available and present at the time of fit testing) and immediately following the patient's removal from the device, the parents will be asked to complete a paper survey. The survey will ask for their perceptions of the device, initial reactions, and other qualitative data collected during the fit test. Healthcare providers who are not part of the study team will also be surveyed to obtain their thoughts/opinions on the device as well."
