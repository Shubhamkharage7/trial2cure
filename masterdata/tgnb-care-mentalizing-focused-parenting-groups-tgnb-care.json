The study team hypothesizes that the adaptation and implementation of the CARE intervention will be found to be feasible and acceptable for study participants.\n* To assess whether self-reported parenting stress and stressors, parental acceptance, parental reflective functioning, parent positive feelings, and perceived interpersonal support improve among study participants following the 12-session, mentalizing-focused, group parenting intervention. The study team hypothesizes that the CARE treatment group adaptation will show improvements across these outcomes.\n\nCaregivers will be asked to complete surveys at baseline (T0), following their first session (T1), and at post-intervention (T2). A feedback interview will also be completed at T2."
