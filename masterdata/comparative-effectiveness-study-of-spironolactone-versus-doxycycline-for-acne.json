            "briefSummary": "Acne is common illness of adolescents and young adults which is associated with substantial morbidity. While topical treatments are often sufficient for mild acne, moderate to severe acne often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, hormonal therapies such spironolactone, and isotretinoin. Sebum overproduction is fundamental to the pathogenesis of acne with associated disordered keratinization and subsequent microbial colonization and inflammation resulting in the clinical manifestations of acne. Given the influence of hormones on sebum production, therapies that address these underlying hormonal factors such as spironolactone and oral contraceptive pills represent an underutilized treatment option for women with acne and could help decrease the use of long-term oral antibiotics in this patient population. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of spironolactone versus doxycycline hyclate (tetracycline class antibiotic) for women with acne."
