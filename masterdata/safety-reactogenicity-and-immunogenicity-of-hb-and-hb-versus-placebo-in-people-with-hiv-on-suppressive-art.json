            "briefSummary": "This is a study of HB-502 and HB-501 alternating 2-vector therapy in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who are taking antiretroviral treatment (ART).\n\nThe benefits of available ART are short-lived and eventually there is a return of rapid HIV replication and higher viral copy number after a period of initial improvement of infection. The study treatment made of HB-502 and HB-501 is designed to train the body to recognize and fight parts from substances found in HIV.\n\nThis trial studies the safety, tolerability, and ability of HB-502 and HB-501 to stimulate an immune response against HIV in people living with HIV.\n\nParticipants will receive the study treatment by injection into the muscle every 8 weeks for a duration of 24 weeks, which is followed by another 24 weeks to continue looking closely at the safety profile and anti-HIV immune reaction after the last dose of study treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a first-in-human Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of HB-502 and HB-501 alternating 2-vector therapy in participants with HIV who are in overall good health and on suppressive ART. The study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of HB-502 and HB-501 alternating 2-vector therapy.\n\nHB-502 and HB-501 are genetically engineered replicating vectors based on the arenaviruses Pichinde virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, respectively. The HB-502 and HB-501 vectors have been engineered to deliver HIV antigens derived from parts of key, immunogenic regions of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) proteins that are highly conserved within HIV-1 clade B variants. The designed immunogens differ from each other by their amino acid sequence allowing for coverage of \\>80% of circulating HIV-1 viral variants.\n\nTwo different dose levels (Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2) of HB-502 and HB-501 alternating 2-vector therapy or placebo will be administered intramuscularly every 8 weeks for 24 weeks (i.e., 4 doses at Weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24), which is followed by a 24-week follow-up period.\n\nIn total, approximately 30 participants aged 18 to 65 years will be enrolled in this study to receive HB-502 and HB-501 alternating 2-vector therapy or placebo.\n\nAbout 5 Investigators and study sites in the United States are expected to participate in this study."
