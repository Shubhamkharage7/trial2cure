            "detailedDescription": "This is a staged, non-randomized, open-label, single group, interventional study to be conducted at up to 25 investigational sites to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Thermedical Ablation System with the Durablate Ablation Catheter (investigational device) in subjects with recurrent, sustained, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to drug therapy and conventional catheter ablation.\n\nSubjects will be consented (enrolled) and screened prior to the study ablation procedure. 154 subjects will have a study ablation procedure with the investigational device. Follow-up will occur at 7 days, 30 days, 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe single arm design of the proposed study reflects the nature of the study population. The Thermedical Ablation System was designated as a Breakthrough technology in part because no currently approved device specifically treats this refractory patient population."
