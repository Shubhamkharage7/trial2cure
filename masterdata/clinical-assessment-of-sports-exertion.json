            "briefSummary": "The Clinical Assessment for Sports Exertion (CASE) addresses the physical performance of athletes by quantifying physiological and symptomatic responses to dynamic exertion. The CASE is highly sport-specific as it tests multiple body positions that mimic requirements typical of individual and contact sports activities including soccer, gymnastics, cheerleading, swimming, and basketball. It was developed by clinicians at the Baylor Scott and White Sports Concussion Program in an effort to identify specific system impairments in athletes who were unable to successfully demonstrate readiness for return to play protocols. Like the other published forms of concussion exertion testing described above, the CASE is a provocative exercise test that may also prove to be useful in making informed return-to-play decisions based upon the athlete's symptomatology."

Responses to physical activity will be measured through physiologic markers (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, rate of perceived exertion, dyspnea). Additionally, participants will be monitored for any changes in symptoms that occur during or after physical activity as measured by the modified PCSS symptom inventory.",
