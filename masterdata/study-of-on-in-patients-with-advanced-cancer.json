If the patient is eligible, they will start to receive ON 123300 as capsules every day. On day 1 and Day 8 of the study, patients will be required to provide eight blood samples to allow measurement of the amount of drug in their blood. Three ECGs will also be performed during this time. Patients will continue to receive ON 123300 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician decision to stop.\n\nThe first group of patients will receive 40mg of ON 123300 daily, the next group 80mg of ON 123300, the 120mg, etc. until the correct dose has been determined for future studies.\n\nPatients will visit the clinic on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9, then weekly for the first month, then every two weeks for two more months, then every month."
