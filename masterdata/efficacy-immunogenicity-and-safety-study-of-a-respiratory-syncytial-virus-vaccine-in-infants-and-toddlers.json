The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Toddler (RSVt) vaccine administered by intranasal route compared to placebo.\n\nEligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 intranasal administrations of either the RSVt vaccine or placebo.\n\nStudy duration will be 24 months for each participant. The safety follow-up will start after the first vaccination and up to the end of the study.",
