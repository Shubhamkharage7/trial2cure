            "detailedDescription": "Hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia will be referred to the study team for potential recruitment. Initial screening will take place using the existing medical record and in collaboration with the treating team. The study consists of 3 randomly assigned arms of varying dosages of the study drug\n\nAll procedures, with the exception of drug dosing and option sample analysis, align with the subject's standard of care. Prior to initiating study drug, the subject's standard of care labs, imaging and oxygen requirements will be reviewed.\n\nSirolimus will be administered as an oral medication. Subjects who are discharged prior to receiving 14 days of study drug will be provided with enough study drug to finish at home.\n\nOn-study evaluation includes measurement of vital signs and laboratory studies before and after a patient has received sirolimus while inpatient. As part of routine care, subjects will be seen daily while in the hospital and will be monitored through blood tests for general health as well as renal function. Vital signs will be monitored daily while in the hospital, physical exams, assessment of COVID-19, and CT scans or chest x-rays as necessary for routine care.\n\nSubjects will return to clinic at 12 weeks for routine lab work and imaging as a part of study follow-up and will be assessed for pulmonary fibrosis at this time.\n\nAdditionally, University of Chicago Medicine patients will have the option to allow investigators to use leftovers from tubes of blood drawn for clinical tests that would otherwise be discarded. This will apply to any blood collected during that respective hospital stay as well as up to 1 year after study enrollment."
