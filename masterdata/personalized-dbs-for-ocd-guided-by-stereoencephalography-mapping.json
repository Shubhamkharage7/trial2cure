            "briefSummary": "This is a double-blinded, randomized, crossover study design for SEEG-guided 4-lead DBS for treatment-refractory OCD, followed by open label stimulation for an additional 6 months. The study will be conducted in 3 stages: Stage 1 will consist of SEEG brain mapping and optimization of stimulation parameters. Stage 2 will consist of 4-lead DBS surgery with bilateral IPGs and further optimization of stimulation parameters. Stage 3 will be randomized, crossover treatment, followed by open label treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study consists of 3 stages.\n\nIn Stage 1, the investigators will implant SEEG depth electrodes into various components of the CSTC OCD circuit such as the OFC, ACC, VC/VS, BNST, and amSTN. The investigators will perform extensive stimulation mapping to identify anatomical sites and stimulation parameters that improve symptoms. The investigators also intend to record abnormal local field potential (LFP) activity during periods of varying intensities of spontaneous and provoked OCD symptom severity and will determine if therapeutic stimulation can normalize abnormal neural activity associated with OCD symptoms.\n\nIn Stage 2, the investigators will use the information obtained during the SEEG Invasive Monitoring phase (Stage 1) to inform the placement of 4 DBS leads using the Medtronic Percept Implantable Pulse Generator system. DBS leads will be targeted to regions identified, in Stage 1, as being associated with symptomatic improvement and OCD-related neural activity. During this phase, the investigators will perform DBS programming to systematically change stimulation parameters to find parameters that optimally relieve patients' OCD symptoms.\n\nIn Stage 3, the investigators will then carry out a randomized, controlled, crossover trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and initial efficacy of our SEEG-guided DBS approach for treatment-refractory OCD."
