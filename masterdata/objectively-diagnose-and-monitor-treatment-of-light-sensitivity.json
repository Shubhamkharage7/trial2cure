The patient's responses will be measured with videography facial muscle electrical responses Electromyogram (EMG) measured from surface skin electrodes and retinal electrical responses (EMG) or electroretinogram (ERG) recorded from a portable hand-held device). Simultaneously, patient's will have their heart rate and skin conductance objectively monitored using wristwatch devices (E4, Empatica). If successful, this will open an immediate new way to objectively assess the mechanisms that lead to light sensitivity, and provide an approach to effectively treat, and manage the symptoms of light sensitivity and headache from different causes, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and migraine."
