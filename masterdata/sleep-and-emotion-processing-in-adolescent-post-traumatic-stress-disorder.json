            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to characterize the role of sleep, emotion processing, and daily affect in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and whether improving sleep quality using slow wave activity enhancement will impact next-day affect in youth.\n\nParticipants will attend 4 study visits:\n\n* A clinical and trauma assessment visit\n* A testing day that may include cognitive testing, surveys, and an MRI.\n* An overnight sleep study following one week of at-home sleep recordings with the device in the sham condition\n* An overnight sleep study following one week of at-home sleep recordings with the device in the sleep enhancement condition",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study, researchers aim to characterize sleep and explore its relationship to emotion processing and daily affect in 165 youth spilt into 3 groups. Researchers will use advanced sleep assessment methodologies including: (1) high-density EEG (256 channels) in the laboratory to explore the regional distribution of sleep before and after an emotional learning task and; (2) a sleep-wearable EEG recording headband, SmartSleep, to record sleep longitudinally at home. Using SmartSleep's sleep enhancement algorithms, researchers will determine whether the deepest sleep, slow-wave activity (SWA) of non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep, can be reliably increased in all youth."
