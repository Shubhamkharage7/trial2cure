            "briefSummary": "Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with liver disease \\[1\\]. Increased activity and presence of vasodilators such as nitric oxide in cirrhotic patients leads to vasodilation, especially in the splanchnic circulation, resulting in hemodynamic changes that precipitate renal injury \\[1\\]. Patients may present with elevated serum creatinine (Cr), benign urine sediment, and low urine sodium \\[1\\].",
            "detailedDescription": "There are two main classifications of HRS: HRS-AKI (previously known as type 1 HRS) and diuretic-resistant ascites (previously known as type 2 HRS) \\[1\\].\n\nThe ultimate treatment for patients with HRS is to improve hepatic function via treatment of underlying etiology or liver transplantation; however, this is not always immediately possible due to the high demand for liver transplantation among other factors \\[1\\]. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can also be considered, especially in patients with severe electrolyte derangements such as hypokalemia or pulmonary edema, that are not responding to medical therapy \\[1\\]. Often, CRRT is used as a bridging therapy to stabilize patients until they are optimized for receiving a liver transplant \\[1, 2\\]. CRRT, however, comes with its own risks and disadvantages such as hypotension and increased risk of cardiac adverse events \\[2\\]. In certain cases, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) can benefit patients with HRS by reducing portal pressure resulting in increase in renal perfusion \\[1\\]."
