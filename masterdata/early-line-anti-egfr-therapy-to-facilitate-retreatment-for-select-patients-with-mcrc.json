Histologic confirmation of a colorectal primary tumor is acceptable if accompanied by radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.\n\n  * For Cohort A: Participants must enroll for study treatment in the first or second-line metastatic setting. Participants may receive 1 month of standard chemotherapy in the metastatic setting and still be eligible to initiate protocol therapy in the first-line setting. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy does not count as a line of therapy even if given in the setting of metastatic disease (oligometastatic), unless disease recurrence was noted within 6 months of completing the last dose of the adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy.\n  * For Cohort B: Participants must have had at least stable disease (per treating physician) on a prior EGFR inhibitor containing regimen and it must be at least 4 months since the prior anti-EGFR inhibitor treatment was completed. Participants previously enrolled in Cohort A can later enroll in Cohort B should the eligibility criteria be met.\n  * For Cohort C: Subjects must have had prior FOLFOX +/- VEGF inhibitor with no prior use of irinotecan or anti-EGFRi. If patients had prior FOLFOX and were treated on cohort A (of this study) they can cross-over to cohort C if other eligibility criteria are met at the time of cross-over.\n* Evaluable disease according to RECIST v1.1. Participants do not have to have measureable disease.\n* Participants with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis at least 4 weeks prior to study registration, have been off of corticosteroids for \u2265 2 weeks, and are asymptomatic.\n* Demonstrate adequate organ function; all screening labs to be obtained within 7 days prior to registration.
