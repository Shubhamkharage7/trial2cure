Group 1: Active tAN + Morphine\n2. Group 2: Sham tAN + Morphine\n\nMorphine dosing for all infants will be managed by using the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS), recorded every three hours.\n\nAfter the participant exits the inpatient treatment phase of the study, they will enter the neurodevelopmental follow-up phase. The participant's parent or legal guardian will be contacted at 3, 9, 18, and 24 months of age to complete the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) and the Sensory Profile 2 (SP-2). At 24 months, participants who fail in any sub-domain will be referred to their primary care physician for further neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development III (BSID-III) or other neurodevelopmental assessment."
