            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial will be a comparison between personalized recommended caffeine dosing regimen versus the standard recommended caffeine dosing regimen for sustaining performance during sleep deprivation and minimizing side effects and subsequent sleep disruption. The questions this study aims to answer are: Whether the personalized caffeine recommendations improve vigilance, sleepiness, and cognition after total sleep deprivation, compared to standard recommendations; Whether the personalized caffeine recommendation better addresses the physical and emotional side effects of total sleep deprivation, compared to standard recommendations; And whether personalized caffeine recommendations aids in better recovery sleep after total sleep deprivation, compared to standard recommendations.\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n1. Complete a 13-day at-home portion, wearing an actigraph watch to measure activity and sleep, and complete motor vigilance tests up to six times a day.\n2. Complete a 4-day in-lab portion, where participants will have to complete one night of baseline sleep, undergo 62-hours of total sleep deprivation, and then complete one night of recovery sleep.\n3. During the in-lab portion of the study, participants will be asked to complete more motor vigilance tests.\n\nResearchers will be comparing the personalized caffeine recommendation group against the standard caffeine recommendation to see if it is better at addressing each of the main questions.",
            "detailedDescription": "This clinical trial will be examining whether the 2B-Alert Caffeine Optimization algorithm provides greater performance optimization, side effect minimization, and quality of recovery sleep during sleep deprivation compared to the standard published recommendations for caffeine use. The objective of this clinical trial will be to conduct a head-to-head comparison between the 2B-Alert app versus a commonly recommended caffeine dosing regimen for sustaining optimal performance during sleep deprivation and minimizing side effects and subsequent sleep disruption. The specific aims are to: Determine the effectiveness of 2B-Alert versus standard caffeine dosing on psychomotor vigilance, subjective sleepiness, and cognition on single and multiple nights of sleep deprivation; Determine the effectiveness of 2B-Alert versus standard caffeine dosing at mitigating physiological and emotional side effects; Determine the effectiveness of 2B-Alert versus standard caffeine dosing at minimizing disruptions in recovery sleep.\n\nThis clinical trial will consist of three phases. Phase 1 includes the enrollment visit where participants will come into the lab, complete baseline personality and mood testing, and be given the actigraph watch and phone with the 2B-Alert app. Then the participant will undergo 13-days of at-home psychomotor vigilance testing and sleep data collection.\n\nPhase 2 begins with the participant arrives at the lab for the 4-day in-lab portion of the study. During this phase the participant will complete a night of baseline sleep using polysomnography to collect sleep data. At the end of baseline sleep, the participant will begin the 62-hour sleep deprivation portion. During the deprivation portion, data will be collected periodically on the participants psychomotor vigilance. After 37-49 hours of continuous sleep deprivation participants will be administered either caffeine gum or placebo gum.\n\nThere are four different experimental conditions and one control condition that determines the ratio of caffeine gum to placebo gum that is administered to participants:\n\n1. Standard Caffeine Dose Both Nights (200mg/2 hr. up to 800mg/24 hr.)\n2. Optimized Caffeine Dose Both Nights (0-300mg/2 hr. up to 800mg/24 hr.)\n3. Placebo Dose 1st Night/Standard Caffeine Dose 2nd Night (0mg) / (200mg/2 hr. up to 800mg/24 hr.)\n4. Placebo Dose 1st Night/Optimized Caffeine Dose 2nd Night (0mg) / (0-300mg/2 hr. up to 800mg/24 hr.)\n5. Placebo Dose Both Nights (0mg) Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 5 conditions, so 20% of the study population will be in each condition.\n\nAfter the 62-hour period of total sleep deprivation, participants will complete Phase 3, a night of recovery sleep; During this phase, participants' sleep data will be collected using polysomnography. After the night of recovery sleep participants will remain in the lab for further psychomotor vigilance testing. Once this is complete individuals will be released from the lab and their participation will be complete."
