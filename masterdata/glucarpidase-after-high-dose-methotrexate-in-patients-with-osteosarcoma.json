Glucarpidase may reduce the levels of methotrexate in patients' blood and lead to shorter hospitalizations and a reduction in toxicities.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the rate of completion of 4 planned high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) doses when glucarpidase is administered after each dose.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the length of hospital stay (LOS) associated with methotrexate (MTX) clearance following administration of glucarpidase 24 hours after HDMTX.\n\nII. To assess the LOS associated with all causes following administration of glucarpidase 24 hours after HDMTX.\n\nIII. To assess the impact of glucarpidase administration on HDMTX efficacy. IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of 4 doses of HDMTX administered with glucarpidase in an adult osteosarcoma population.\n\nV. To assess the efficacy of glucarpidase flat dose of 1,000 units.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive standard of care HDMTX intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on day 1 of weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10. After 24 and 48 hours after the start of each HDMTX infusion, patients also receive glucarpidase IV over 5 minutes in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 32 weeks."
