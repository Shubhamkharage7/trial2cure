Following a series of clinical assessments, participants will perform a reward-based decision-making task while electroencephalography (EEG) is collected.\n\nThen, all participants will take part in a single-session 90-minute BA intervention; half of the participants will receive delta-beta tACS during the final 30 minutes of the session and half will receive an active sham stimulation. Participants will return two weeks later for another task-based EEG. Four weeks after the intervention session, they will receive self-report questionnaires via email to complete online."
