The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n* Is micropatch transdermal delivery dependent on the metronidazole product formulation?\n* Is transdermal delivery dependent on micropore lifetime of the skin after micropatch application?\n\nParticipants will be divided into groups based on metronidazole product (gel or cream).\n\n* The metronidazole product will be applied to micropatch-treated skin in study period one. Measurements of the skin barrier will be made before and after micropatch treatment.\n* Daily blood samples will be collected for up to 5 days after the micropatch and metronidazole are first applied.\n* Following a one-week washout period, the same study process will be repeated except that metronidazole product will be applied to skin without micropatch pretreatment."
