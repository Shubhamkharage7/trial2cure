We will assess muscle functional (i.e., cross-sectional area and intramuscular fatty content) using computerized tomography, quadriceps muscle strength using an isokinetic dynamometer, a battery of performance-based physical function, self-reported physical function and quality of life, and biomarkers of inflammation using blood serum. Feasibility assessment will be done by looking at safety (i.e., adverse events), compliance, and attrition rate."
