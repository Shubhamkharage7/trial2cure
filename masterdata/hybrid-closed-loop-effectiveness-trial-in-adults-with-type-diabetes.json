            "briefSummary": "Minoritized individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have approximately 2% higher average A1c levels and twice the rate of hospitalizations, complications, and mortality as their white counterparts. However, the efficacy trials establishing the benefits of hybrid closed loop (HCL) pump therapy in T1D have been in more socially advantaged and predominantly non-Hispanic white patients. Use of this technology by individuals with T1D from underserved communities remains very low.\n\nThe investigators plan to conduct a randomized effectiveness trial - with broader eligibility criteria (including markedly elevated A1c) and longer follow up than the previous HCL efficacy trials - to evaluate the benefits, safety risks and treatment complications of HCL use in underserved adults with T1D. A comprehensive mixed-methods approach will be implemented to capture information about the user experience.\n\nParticipants will be randomized (3:1 ratio) to one of three FDA-approved HCL systems or continuous glucose monitoring and multiple daily injection therapy. Subjects will be followed for 9 months to collect data on effectiveness (glucose % time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL and % time \\< 70 mg/dL), safety (diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia events) and patient experience using the systems (including benefits and burdens, the impact of life stressors on HCL use, and how the match between HCL system functionality and the individual's needs and expectations impacts on user experience)."

Most recent eGFR \\<30 ml/min is exclusionary (within last 2 years is acceptable);\n* Active cancer treatment;\n* Extreme visual or hearing impairment that would impair ability to use CGM and pump;\n* Cognitive concerns;\n* Significant psychiatric diagnosis or substance abuse disorder that in the investigator's opinion impairs ability of the individual to participate.",
