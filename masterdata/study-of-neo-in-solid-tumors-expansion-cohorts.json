Subjects will be treated with NEO-201 at the RP2D (1.5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks in combination with pembrolizumab, given 1 day after the NEO-201, at 400 mg IV every 6 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "The experimental drug called NEO-201 (the \"study drug\") is a monoclonal antibody that is being tested and is not approved for use in the United States by the FDA.\n\nAs stated above the RP2D was determined at 1.5 mg/kg and in the current Expansion Phase it will be administered in combination with pembrolizumab. .\n\nA safety lead in will be conducted in the first 3 to 6 subjects to evaluate toxicity prior to expanding accrual. The safety lead-in will be 42 days in length, consisting of 1 dose of pembrolizumab and 3 doses of NEO-201 followed by a 2-week assessment for safety, in subjects with any of the expansion cohorts' targeted disease types. The third patient in the safety lead in must complete the 30-day assessment (1 dose of pembrolizumab and 3 doses of NEO-201 followed by a 2-week safety evaluation) and be evaluated for toxicity prior to treating additional patients.\n\nFollowing completion of the lead-in, expansion cohorts will accrue subjects with NSCLC, HNSCC, cervical and uterine cancers who progress on frontline therapy."

Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Subject has other serious medical illness, including a second malignancy, or psychiatric illness that could, in the Investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects due to NEO-201 is unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with NEO-201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with NEO-201.\n\nAdditional Exclusion Criteria for Expansion Cohorts\n\nBecause patients in the expansion cohort will be receiving pembrolizumab, the following additional exclusion criteria apply:\n\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to start of study therapy.\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Subjects who experienced severe or life-threatening immune-related AEs with prior immune checkpoint therapy requiring medical intervention (steroid or immunosuppressant drugs) and permanent discontinuation of therapy, will be excluded.
