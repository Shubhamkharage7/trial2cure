            "briefSummary": "Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder with a heterogenous presentation, lack of clear understanding of pathophysiology and only partially effective treatments. First-line antipsychotic drugs block dopamine, but many people continue to suffer from persistent positive or negative symptoms that cannot be fully treated with available medications. Recently, our group has found that dietary modulations have efficacy comparable to antipsychotic medications and that determining which patients could benefit from a personalized treatment framework is critical.\n\nThe ketogenic diet consists of low-carbohydrate, moderate protein and high fat intake inducing a state in which ketone bodies in the blood provide energy to the cells. In pharmacologic mouse models a ketogenic diet regimen resulted in complete restoration of normal behaviors, independent of strict caloric restriction and other work has suggested that a ketogenic diet may improve schizophrenia like deficits in rodents. An open label ketogenic diet study in the 1950s reported improvement in schizophrenia symptom. At least 7 additional case reports have found robust improvements or complete resolution of schizophrenia symptoms. Recently a retrospective study found robust and significant improvements in schizophrenia symptoms in 10 schizoaffective disorder patients treated with a ketogenic diet. In addition to psychiatric symptoms, improvements in metabolic outcomes have been demonstrated. However, to date, there have been no published double blind randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of a ketogenic diet since few sites can conduct inpatient trials and have observation and control for food intake"

The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucination, and grandiosity. The rater enters a number for each symptom construct that ranges from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). The score ranges from 18-126, with the higher the number the worse the symptoms.",
