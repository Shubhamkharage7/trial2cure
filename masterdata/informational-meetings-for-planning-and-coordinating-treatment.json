The investigators hypothesize that goal alignment will improve quality of life outcomes, in particular for those patients who reach end of life. Findings from the proposed research will provide essential information to promote communication practice standards that can be rapidly translated into practice to improve outcomes for children, particularly those who reach end of life, and parents.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel communication intervention on quality of life outcomes in children with high-risk cancer. The intervention includes a series of tailored discussions delivered by the child's primary physician/nurse dyad that begins at diagnosis, and integrates visual aids to facilitate conversations with parents about prognosis, hopes, and goals-of-care across the cancer continuum. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will foster alignment of goals of care between providers and parents across the cancer continuum, leading to improved quality of life outcomes. Outcomes include: Enrollment in home hospice care, high-intensity medical interventions, child pain and emotional distress, parental hope, parental uncertainty and distress."
