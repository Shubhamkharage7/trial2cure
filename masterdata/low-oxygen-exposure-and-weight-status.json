            "briefSummary": "The objective of the proposed double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial is to evaluate changes in body weight and composition, assess determinants of energy balance (intake and expenditure), and measure modulators of energy balance, following 8 wk of calorie restriction (-500 kcal/d) in combination with either overnight exposure to normobaric hypoxia (8 h/night, 15% FiO2, \\~2640 m) or normoxia (8 h/night, 21% FiO2), using a commercially available, in-home tent system, in adults with obesity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Obesity and associated metabolic conditions are a significant public health burden, costing the U.S. \\~$150 billion annually. Obesity is both a disease, affecting 1 in 3 Americans, and a risk factor for other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and 13 forms of cancers. Diet and exercise are the cornerstone of obesity prevention and treatment. However, a considerable number of individuals are non-responsive to existing weight-loss interventions and obesity rates continue to rise. Therefore, non-conventional approaches are needed to supplement current weight-loss strategies. Daily exposure to low-oxygen conditions may aid in current weight- loss strategies. Moderate (1500-3500 m) and higher (\u2265 3500 m) altitude environments are naturally hypoxic due to the lower atmospheric pressure (for reference, Denver, CO is \\~1600 m and Mt. Hood in Oregon is \\~3500 m). Studies show that sea-level natives exposed to moderate- or high- altitude continuously for 5 or more days lose weight, which is a consequence of prolonged reductions in blood and tissue oxygenation that lead to increased energy expenditure and decreased appetite. However, implementation of hypoxia as a means for weight loss has been limited, to date, by the logistical constraints of traveling to remote locations or access to an altitude chamber. A safe, less expensive, and more logistically feasible alternative is the use of commercially available, low-oxygen systems at sea level, which create a normobaric hypoxic environment. Whether in-home, overnight, normobaric hypoxic exposure, compared to normobaric normoxic exposure, promotes body mass loss in adults with obesity remains unknown. Furthermore, determinants of energy balance, including energy intake and expenditure, and their relative contribution to normobaric hypoxia-induced weight loss have not been investigated. The objective of the proposed double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial is to evaluate changes in body weight and composition, assess determinants of energy balance (intake and expenditure), and measure modulators of energy balance, following 8 wk of calorie restriction (-500 kcal/d) in combination with either overnight exposure to normobaric hypoxia (8 h/night, 15% FiO2, \\~2640 m) or normoxia (8 h/night, 21% FiO2), using a commercially available, in-home tent system, in adults with obesity. Chronic (8 weeks), overnight (8 hours/night) low oxygen exposure may provide a non-conventional approach to supplement current weight-loss strategies, inform new strategies to accelerate weight loss, aid long-term weight management efforts, and benefit metabolic health in individuals with obesity."
