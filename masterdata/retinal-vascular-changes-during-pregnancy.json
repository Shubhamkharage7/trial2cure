            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to better understand how the back part of the eye-called the retina and the choroid-changes during pregnancy. Specialized photos of the eye will be taken at three different timepoints: early in pregnancy (first or second trimester), late in pregnancy (third trimester), and after delivery. This imaging is non-invasive and does not require contact with the surface of the eye. The photos taken will allow assessment of specific parameters, like blood flow and the health of specialized cells that support vision. Understanding how the eyes change during pregnancy may help guide how retina specialists understanding of retinal disease during pregnancy and better inform pregnancy outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pregnancy is a unique human condition marked by changes throughout the body, including changes in hormone levels, blood volume, blood pressure, and blood clot formation. These changes impact the eye as well, particularly the back part of the eye, called the retina and the choroid. Pre-existing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure are known to affect the retina, but this impact may be increased by during pregnancy. In addition, new eye conditions may develop. The purpose of this study is to better understand how the retina and choroid changes during pregnancy."
