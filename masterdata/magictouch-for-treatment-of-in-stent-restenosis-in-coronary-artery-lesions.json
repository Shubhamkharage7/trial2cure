            "briefSummary": "A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Two-Arm, Single-blind Superiority Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of the MagicTouch\u2122 Sirolimus- Coated Balloon in the Treatment of Coronary Drug-Eluting Stent In-Stent Restenosis.\n\nSubjects with prior DES implantation presenting with ISR lesions undergoing PCI will be randomized into two groups: treatment with the MagicTouch\u2122 sirolimus-coated balloon or POBA on a 2:1 basis. Approximately 492 subjects will be enrolled in the randomized study in a maximum of 50 study sites located in the United States.\n\nThe goal is to establish the safety and efficacy of the MagicTouch\u2122 sirolimus- coated balloon in treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR).",
            "detailedDescription": "All subjects providing informed consent will have their medical history reviewed and will undergo a physical examination, laboratory screen, and a standardized 12-lead ECG within 7 days of procedure. Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test within one week prior to the procedure. If subjects meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study, they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups, and will then undergo treatment with MagicTouch\u2122 sirolimus-coated balloon or POBA of the target ISR lesion, per trial protocol.\n\nOne pre-procedure and all post-procedure biomarker blood draws will be sent to a central core laboratory for analysis of troponin T. Evaluation of post-procedural biomarker blood draws in local laboratories are not mandated but may be performed as part of standard of care.\n\nDuring the index hospitalization, patients will undergo a clinical assessment and 12-lead ECG; and they will have cardiac biomarkers drawn before the intervention to establish baseline biomarker level and confirmation that the biomarkers are falling. At least one post procedure biomarker (core lab) will be drawn at a minimum of 4 hours after PCI as part of the assessment of periprocedural myocardial infarction and significant periprocedural myocardial injury (at 6-8 hour intervals depending on whether the patient remains admitted). If no procedural complications have occurred and there are no signs of ischemia on post-procedure ECG or clinical assessment, the patient may be discharged per local practice and no additional biomarker levels need to be drawn (beyond the protocol-mandated core laboratory draw at a minimum of 4 hours). If the patient remains admitted cardiac biomarkers (core lab) should be drawn every 6-8 hours until at least 2 total post-procedural core laboratory biomarker draws have passed or clinical standard-based biomarker levels have peaked per local labs or the patient is discharged.\n\nAfter hospital discharge, subjects will be followed at 30 days (+1 week), 6 months (+2 weeks), and 12 months (+1 month) and then 24, 36, 48 and 60 months (+1 month) post procedure. Yearly vital status information will be collected by telephone follow-up. At the 12-month visit, subjects will undergo 12-lead ECG, blood count, coagulation profile and blood chemistry tests. New and ongoing AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed.\n\nAll elective angiograms performed on the target vessel during the 12-month follow-up period should be preceded by a physician evaluation, during which the physician will indicate whether the subject's clinical status warrants revascularization, i.e. the subject has clinical evidence of ischemia."

Known allergy to the study device components or protocol-required concomitant medications:\n\n    - sirolimus (as well as other limus drugs, analogues, or similar compounds), aspirin, clopidogrel and prasugrel and ticagrelor, heparin and bivalirudin, or iodinated contrast that cannot be adequately pre-medicated\n21. Any co-morbid condition that may cause non-compliance with the protocol (e.g. dementia, substance abuse, etc.) or reduce life expectancy to \\<24 months (e.g. cancer, heart failure, lung disease, severe valvular disease)\n22. Patient is participating in or plans to participate in any other investigational drug or device trial that has not reached its primary endpoint\n23. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding (women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within one week before index procedure)\n24. Women who intend to become pregnant within 12 months after the index procedure\n25. Patient has received an organ transplant or is on a waiting list for an organ transplant\n26. Patient has received chemotherapy within 30 days before the index procedure or scheduled to receive chemotherapy any time after the index procedure\n27. Patient is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy or has known life-limiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease. Inhaled steroid and steroid use for contrast- allergy prophylaxis or treatment are allowed\n\nAngiographic Exclusion Criteria (visual estimate) (all must be absent for the patient to be eligible):\n\n1. More than 1 ISR lesion in the target vessel in segments that cannot be treated by a single 40 mm length DCB (see Angiographic Inclusions #5 and #6 above)\n2. Unprotected left main lesions \\>50% or left main intervention\n3. Primary PCI for STEMI\n4. Coronary artery disease judged more suitable for surgical revascularization per guidelines and local heart team discussion\n5. Another lesion in either the target vessel or non-target vessel is present that requires or has a high probability of requiring PCI within 12 months after the index procedure\n6.
