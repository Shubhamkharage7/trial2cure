The investigators will enroll 224 older adults with hypertension to identify those who are nonadherent for one hypertension medication. The participants will be randomized to one of two groups (112 per group) to use the blood pressure system for 6-months. Both groups receive information about high blood pressure and medications. One group will also receive strategies that can be used to take medications and manage blood pressure. Both groups will complete a mid-assessment at 3-months and a post-assessment at 6-months."
