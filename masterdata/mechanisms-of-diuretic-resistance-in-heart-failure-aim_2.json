            "briefSummary": "This study will employ a randomized order, double-blind, repeated measures dose ranging design. This design was chosen in order to generate multiple within-subject serial loop diuretic dose response exposures. The overall study schema will include 75 heart failure (HF) patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "The protocol will begin with pre-study determination of diuretic response at the screening visit via administration of 10 mg IV bumetanide infused over 1 hour and measuring peak Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa), 1-hour post completion of infusion. Participants will begin a study diet provided by the metabolic kitchen five days prior to the first study visit with randomized treatment (Day 0). Participants in balance will present to the study site Day 0 and receive their first randomized dose of bumetanide (1.25mg, 2.5mg, 5mg, or 10mg) and undergo the bio-specimen collection protocol. They will return every 3 days, allowing 2 full days washout, to receive the other doses in random sequence.\n\nTotal sodium output in response to a loop diuretic differs based on Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). However, a diuretic responsive participant with normal or severely reduced GFR each will achieve a similar peak FENa of approximately 20% with high dose diuretic. In a cohort of 109 hospitalized diuretic resistance (DR) HF patients that received 12.5mg bumetanide, a peak FENa \\<5% occurred in 66% patients. The mean FENa in this group was 2.6 \u00b1 1.3 %, thus FENa \\<5% is common and a clinically relevant threshold for DR, and thus was chosen as the threshold to define diuretic resistance for the proposed study.\n\nParticipants will be asked to follow the study diet as the design seeks to decrease the variability of diuretic response introduced by variations in dietary sodium intake. For the current study, a four-gram sodium (0.8 g/kg protein) diet will be utilized. Four grams was chosen since, in prior experience, this is the average pre-study sodium intake of outpatient HF study participants and thus will facilitate rapid transition into balance."
