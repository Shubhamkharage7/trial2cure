The survivorship app provides survivors access to their treatment history and follow-up recommendations, improves knowledge of their diagnosis, treatment, risks, and recommended follow-up care by using a message notification. The ability to quickly connect and establish care planning may enhance adherence to recommended follow-up.",

To determine the difference in survivor/caregiver knowledge and understanding of diagnosis, treatment information, and follow-up needs using the survivorship app.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To validate the usability and effectiveness of the survivorship mobile application.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants are seen in the survivorship clinic and receive education about potential late effects and the survivorship application on study. Participants then use the survivorship app for 4 months on study."
