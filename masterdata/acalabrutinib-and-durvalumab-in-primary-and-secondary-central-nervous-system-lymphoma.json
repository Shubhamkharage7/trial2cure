            "briefSummary": "BTK inhibition and checkpoint blockade are promising classes of therapy for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and have demonstrated efficacy with acceptable toxicity. A multidrug approach may carry a higher chance of durable efficacy in this aggressive disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Given the poor outcomes and limited options for patients who are not candidates for high-dose methotrexate, the investigators seek to evaluate the combination in this patient population.\n\n08/30/2022: The study was originally designed for those with primary and secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. However, the first three patients who were enrolled all had secondary CNS lymphoma and most had germinal center phenotype disease with double hit phenotypes. In these three patients, two dose limiting toxicities were seen including 1 patient with grade 4 neutropenia at the time of disease progression and one with pneumonia in the setting of disease progression and worsening of existing heart disease. The third patient came off for clinical progression within cycle 1. Given the lack of response in patients with secondary CNS lymphomas, who do not exhibit the same biology as primary CNS lymphoma patients, Amendment 3 updates the study to only include patients with primary CNS lymphomas."

Participants must be off P450/CYP3A inhibitors and inducers prior to starting the study drug.\n\nNote: Study therapy may be started after 5-half-lives or 7 days (whichever is shorter) have surpassed since last administration of a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer/inhibitors.\n\n* Use of systemic immunosuppressant therapy, including cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and other such medications, or chronic administration of \\> 10 mg/day of prednisone or the equivalent.
