            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, sequential group study to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of pretomanid in the following groups of participants: 1) participants with severe renal impairment including those with end stage renal disease (ESRD) not on dialysis, and participants with mild or moderate renal impairment, designated as Groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively; and 2) participants with normal renal function matched to the above renal impairment groups, designated as Groups 1A, 1B, and 1C, respectively.\n\nThe study will be conducted following a reduced PK study design in Part A. Part A will enroll participants from Group 1A (i.e., 6 healthy matched controls) and Group 2 (i.e., 6 participants with severe renal impairment and ESRD, not on dialysis). A decision to proceed to Part B will be made after the PK of pretomanid, and safety in participants enrolled in Part A have been reviewed. If Part A demonstrates at least a 50% increase in pretomanid area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in Group 2 (severe renal impairments and ESRD, not on dialysis) relative to the exposures in Group 1A (matched participants with normal renal function), then the reduced PK study will extend to the full PK study to enroll participants into Part B (i.e., to investigate mild and moderate renal impairment). All Part B groups (1B, 1C, 3, and 4) will be enrolled concurrently.\n\nIf the reduced PK study shows at least a 50% increase in AUC in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with ESRD not yet on dialysis relative to the matched healthy controls, a \"full PK\" renal impairment study in patients with all intermediate levels of renal function impairment should be conducted. Otherwise, no further study is recommended.\n\nThe approximate patient involvement will be 3 months. The primary objective is to evaluate the PK profiles of pretomanid in plasma and urine after a single oral dose of 200 mg in participants with renal impairment compared to matched healthy controls.",
