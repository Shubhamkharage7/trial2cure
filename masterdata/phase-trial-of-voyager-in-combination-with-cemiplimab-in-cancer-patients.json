Seropositive for and with evidence of active viral infection with HBV.\n7. Seropositive for and with active viral infection with HCV.\n8. Known history of active or latent TB.\n9. Any concomitant serious health condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the patient at undue risk from the study, including uncontrolled hypertension and/or diabetes, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization within 3 months) or neurological disorder (e.g., seizure disorder active within 3 months).\n10. Prior therapy within the following timeframe before the planned start of study treatment as follows:\n\n    1. Small molecule inhibitors, and/or other investigational agent: \u2264 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n    2. Chemotherapy, other monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, or other similar experimental therapies: \u2264 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n    3.
