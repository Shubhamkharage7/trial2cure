            "briefSummary": "Teleconsultation, or the use of video telecommunications technology to deliver expert recommendations for care remotely, has been used to improve the safety and quality of emergency care for children in hospital-based acute care settings by providing real-time access to remote pediatric physician experts. Whether extending teleconsultation as a patient safety intervention to emergency medical systems (EMS) outside hospitals can similarly benefit sick and injured children in the community is unknown. Advances in mobile technology have made teleconsultation more accessible and affordable for EMS systems. However, this intervention has been underutilized by EMS partially due to the lack of prehospital research supporting its efficacy for pediatric applications.\n\nIn prior simulation studies, the investigators found high intervention acceptance among key stakeholder groups (pediatric emergency physicians and paramedics), and demonstrated that it was feasible to integrate video communication into prehospital clinical workflows involving critical care delivery in high-risk pediatric scenarios. These initial simulation studies were conducted in a controlled prehospital setting in static ambulances using infant simulator manikins to minimize risk to children and providers. Demonstrating feasibility and acceptability with real children in moving ambulances is the next step to build the necessary evidence base to support future planned prehospital efficacy trials with children.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that remote respiratory assessment of children by medical control physicians (expert physicians) using a mobile teleconsultation platform is acceptable to users (physicians and transport providers), and technically feasible in real transports.",
            "detailedDescription": "An open-label, nonrandomized, pilot feasibility trial will be conducted of children with respiratory distress transported by the Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) critical care transport team that also serves Boston Medical Center (BMC). Transport providers will initiate a video-call from the ambulance to medical control physician on call who will be at a geographically distant location. The physician will view streamed video of the child and complete a brief respiratory assessment checklist tool to determine video quality, a feasibility measure.\n\nThe investigators will measure acceptability (primary outcome) and feasibility (secondary outcomes) on a validated questionnaire administered to users after each call. In this pilot study, efficacy will not be tested; all decision making will occur according to usual care protocols."
