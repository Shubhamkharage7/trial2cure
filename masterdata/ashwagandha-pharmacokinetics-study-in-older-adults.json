Participants will be randomized to one of two dose sequence groups. There will be two four-week study periods separated by a two-week washout period. During each study period, participants will attend a 13-hour pharmacokinetics study visit and return for 24- and 48-hour blood and urine collections. After the 48-hour visit, they will continue taking Shoden\u00ae at the administered dose (240 or 480 mg) for four weeks, at which time they will return for a follow-up visit."
