            "detailedDescription": "This randomized phase II design provides a fairly rapid way to determine which of two potential neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimens holds the most promise for evaluation in a subsequent phase III trial against standard of care adjuvant immunotherapy. The AFT-16 trial of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in this setting provided proof of concept for safety of the neoadjuvant approach and for outcomes that compare favorably with standard of care therapy. The field of lung cancer immunotherapy is evolving rapidly and since the start of AFT-16 not only has adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab become standard of care, but combination immunotherapy with tiragolumab and atezolizumab for NSCLC has received breakthrough therapy designation. Safety of combination immunotherapy and radiation has been established in several trials, but the safety and efficacy of dual immunotherapy is not yet known. In a group of patients who can be but often are not cured with current therapies, establishment of a strategy that could increase cure rate is urgent. This randomized phase II trial can be advocated to determine the best of the two arms for further study with slightly inflated type I error rate"

Patients may be eligible despite not meeting this additional tissue requirement at the discretion of the AFT Study Team. If institutional policy prevents the submission of a block, refer to the Correlative Science Manual (CSM) for alternative submission instructions.\n4. If archival tumor tissue is unavailable or is determined to be unsuitable for required testing, tumor tissue must be obtained from a biopsy performed at screening. Questions about biopsy adequacy should be directed to the study team. No active autoimmune disease or uncontrolled infection\n5. FEV1 \u2265 1.2L or \\> 40% predictive\n6. No underlying heart or lung disease precluding treatment per protocol.\n7. Measurable (RECIST v1.1) stage IIIA, IIIB or IIIC disease per AJCC 8.\n8. Patients must be considered unresectable or inoperable. Patients who decline surgery for stage III NSCLC are also eligible.

Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test.\n17. Non-pregnant and non-nursing. The effect of atezolizumab and tiragolumab on the fetus is unknown.\n18. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs, as defined below:\n\n    * Women must remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab, and 6 months after the final dose of paclitaxel, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, carboplatin or cisplatin. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n    * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\u2265 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., M\u00fcllerian agenesis). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.\n    * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n    * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n    * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free of menses \\> 1 year.\n\n    Women who would like to become pregnant after study treatment discontinuation should seek advice on oocyte cryopreservation prior to initiation of study treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to treatment with carboplatin.\n19. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n    * With a female partner of childbearing potential, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period, for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, and for 6 months after the final dose of paclitaxel and/or carboplatin. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n    * With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, and for 6 months after the final dose of paclitaxel or carboplatin to avoid exposing the embryo.\n    * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n    * Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 6 months after the last dose of study therapy Men who would like to father a child after study treatment initiation should be advised regarding the conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility resulting from chemotherapies used in this study.\n20.

History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced), organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.\n25. Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications.\n26. Active tuberculosis.\n27. Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study.\n28. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before Cycle 1, Day 1 or anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study.\n\n    o Patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist\u2192) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or at any time during the study.\n29. Illness or condition that may interfere with a patient's capacity to understand, follow, and/or comply with study procedures.\n30. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and IL-2) within 4 weeks or 5 drug-elimination half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.\n31. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor- TNF-\u03b1 agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\n    * Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after Medical Monitor confirmation has been obtained.\n    * Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n32. Tumors with known EGFR mutations or ALK fusion positive/mutations. However, tumors do not need to be tested specifically for these alterations for trial eligibility.\n33. Positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin M (IgM) test at screening.\n\n    o An EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test should be performed as clinically indicated to screen for acute infection or suspected chronic active infection. Patients with a positive EBV PCR test are excluded.\n34. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-TIGIT, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies procedures.\n35. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to interferon \\[IFN\\]-\u03b1 or interleukin \\[IL\\]-2) within 4 weeks or 5 drug-elimination half-lives of the drug (whichever is shorter) prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.\n36. Treatment with investigational agent within 42 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 (or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer).\n37. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, or anti-tumor necrosis factor \\[anti-TNF\\] agents) within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.\n\n    1. Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled.\n    2. The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed.\n    3. The use of prednisone premedication required prior to iodinated contrast for CT scans is allowed.\n38. History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.",
