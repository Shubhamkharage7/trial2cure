            "detailedDescription": "The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, study intervention, and evaluation of blood markers (blood draw), body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and surveys at study entry and follow-up visit.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Aerobic and resistance exercise, or 2) Usual care.\n\n* Aerobic and resistance exercise - virtually supervised 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise performed at home via Zoom.The exercise group will be asked to perform exercise at home with virtual supervision, including aerobic exercise. The exercises will be performed three times per week for 16 weeks, and virtually supervised by a professional exercise trainer.\n* Usual care - maintenance of baseline exercise levels for 16 weeks with an offer to perform the same exercise program after 16 weeks. The usual care group will be asked to maintain their current exercise levels and will be offered the same exercise intervention after the completion of the study.\n\nAll participants will undergo two testing visits throughout the 16-weeks of the study period, with the exercise group part-taking in 1 additional testing visit at week 8 to assess aerobic fitness and muscular strength only.\n\nParticipants will be on the research study for 4 months. It is expected that about 62 people will take part in this research study"
