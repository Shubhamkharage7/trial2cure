It is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of S. hominis A9 (ShA9) topical application as a treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD). The trial will enroll adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis who are culture positive for S. aureus colonization. The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of ShA9, compared to placebo (vehicle), to prolong the period of atopic dermatitis control over 12 weeks after conclusion of an initial two-week period of co-treatment with topical corticosteroids (TCS).",
            "detailedDescription": "Protocol ADRN-14 TIME-2 is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo/vehicle-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ShA9 topical application as a treatment for AD. This study will aim to enroll up to 86 participants; participants must be 12 years of age or older, have AD, and test culture positive for S. aureus (SA+) on their lesional skin.\n\nAn individual participant's involvement in this study will take approximately 20 weeks to complete, including approximately 2 weeks of screening, 14 weeks of treatment, and 4 weeks of safety follow-up.\n\nAn initial screening visit will be conducted to evaluate eligibility, including by assessing skin swabs collected from each participant for S. aureus positivity. SA+ participants will then begin an approximately 14-day period of standardized skin care by using over-the-counter products (e.g., Dove soap, Cetaphil moisturizer) which will be distributed from the study clinic. This is done to establish an informative baseline and allow for washout of any prohibited medications.\n\nParticipants who continue to meet eligibility criteria will then be randomized 1:1 to use either ShA9 gel or placebo (vehicle) gel for treatment of AD. Following randomization, for two weeks, each participant will receive co-treatment using TCS together with their assigned study product (active or placebo). Participants will then continue using their assigned study product without TCS for 12 more weeks. Participants will be seen in clinic approximately every 4 weeks during this time for sample/data collection and safety monitoring. Participants may be seen in clinic for additional visits to address any skin exacerbations while enrolled.\n\nParticipation concludes with a 4-week safety follow-up period during which use of ShA9 or placebo (vehicle) gel is halted. Participants will return to using over-the-counter products that will be distributed from the study clinic as needed, continuing to avoid prohibited medications and will be monitored for skin exacerbations or other adverse events."
