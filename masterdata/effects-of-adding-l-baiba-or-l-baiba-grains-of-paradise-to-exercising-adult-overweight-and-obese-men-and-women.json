            "briefSummary": "The goal of this intervention study is to examine changes in body composition, weight loss, and cardio-metabolic risk factors after adding supplementation of L-Beta aminoisobutyric acid (L-BAIBA) and Grains of Paradise to exercise in overweight and obese men and women. Participants will supplement for 8 weeks and complete a 8 week exercise protocol.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be conducted using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. Eligible study participants will be randomly assigned to one of three supplementation groups: placebo (resistant starch) supplementation + exercise group, 500 mg BAIBA supplementation + exercise group, and a 500 mg BAIBA supplementation + 40 mg Grains of Paradise + exercise group. After signing an IRB-approved consent form, prospective participants will be scheduled for a screening visit where they will have their eligibility finalized through completion of a peak VO2 assessment using a motorized treadmill and metabolic cart. Eligible participants will then be fully explained the study and scheduled for a baseline testing session (week 0). Prior to scheduling this visit, participants must complete a 4-day food record. Once a food record is completed, participants will observe an overnight fast and be scheduled to complete the testing session between the hours of 0600 - 1000 hours. Upon arrival, changes in medical status, medications, and dietary supplements will be confirmed before having their body mass and hemodynamics assessed. After hemodynamic assessment, participants will have the first of two resting metabolic rate measurements completed before having a venous blood sample collected for evaluation of health markers (complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panels, and lipid panels). Participants will then use an electronic tablet and complete the Profile of Mood States and visual analog scales to evaluate perceptions of energy, focus, attention, hunger, appetite, and concentration. Participants will then be given their daily dose and a timer will be started. From there, participants will have their waist circumference, body water (BIS), and body composition (DEXA) assessed. After completion of these, participants will then wait in the laboratory until an hour has passed and will have a second resting metabolic rate measurement completed. After the second resting metabolic rate measurement, participants will have a second venous blood sample collected to evaluate changes in glycerol. All participants will be given instructions and meal plans as well as be offered weekly educational sessions on how to restrict calories and meet protein goals throughout the study protocol. Participants will complete five days per week of exercise consisting of a mixture of walking and resistance training. Daily compliance to the exercise and supplementation groups will be monitored weekly for an 8-week period. Participants who complete at least 80% of their assigned workouts will be considered compliant and will be scheduled for follow-up visits after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of supplementation.\n\nParticipants will be asked to follow an 8-10 hour dry fast and to refrain from caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and exercise (excluding the 30 min daily walk) for 24 hours prior to each study visit."
