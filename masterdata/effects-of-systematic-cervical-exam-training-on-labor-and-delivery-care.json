To enhance accuracy and precision among healthcare providers working on Labor and Delivery we have created a high fidelity cervical exam simulator. All providers working on Labor and Delivery Repetitive will be required to practice on the simulators until a pre-specified level or accuracy is achieved. We will prospectively and retrospectively assess the number of cervical exams a women receives and the discrepancy between exams performed by 2 different providers both before and after the training is instituted."
