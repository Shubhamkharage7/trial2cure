            "detailedDescription": "Investigators will study the DNA and RNA in tumor cells and blood cells to look for changes that may be related to the development of the tumor, as well as changes that may influence how the tumor responds or doesn't respond to treatment. Normal blood cells will be studied to compare to the tumor cells. Investigators will also look at basic information about the treatment received and how the tumor responds, i.e. what kind of chemotherapy, surgery, radiation treatment, or other therapy the participant received, whether they had serious side effects, and how well the tumor responded to the treatment.\n\nAs part of regular medical care, tumor will be obtained to determine the type of cancer. For participants who consent to this study, leftover tumor tissue not needed for diagnosis or regular medical care will be studied at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital where scientists will look for changes in the genes of the tumor cells. No additional surgeries or procedures are needed for this study. A small amount of blood (2-3 tablespoons) will be collected and analyzed to determine if the genetic changes in the tumor cells are also found in the blood cells. Small children (\\<42 lbs.) will have a smaller amount drawn (1-2 tablespoons)."
