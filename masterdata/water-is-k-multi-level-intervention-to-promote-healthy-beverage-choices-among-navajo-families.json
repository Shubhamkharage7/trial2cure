            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to understand if a cultural intervention for Navajo families will improve healthy beverage habits, health outcomes, and family cohesion. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does Water is K'\u00e9 results in healthier beverage habits among children aged 2 to 5, compared with children in a control group?\n* Does the intervention improve the health of other family members?\n* How does the intervention affect family well-being?\n\nParticipants will take part in a four-month program at the early child education site (such as a Head Start or the Bureau of Indian Affair's Family and Child Education or FACE Program) where the child is enrolled. They will take part in lesson plans, a social media campaign, and a family water access plan. Researchers will compare the participating families with families at wait-list early child educations sites. We will collect information through surveys, health measurements, and qualitative interviews and compare results to learn if Water is K'e improves health behaviors, health outcomes, and family cohesion.",
            "detailedDescription": "Water is K'\u00e9 is a culturally-grounded, family-based intervention designed to promote healthy beverage consumption among Navajo families. Delivered by early child education (ECE) staff, Water is K'\u00e9 includes three strategies: promoting Din\u00e9 (Navajo) culture through intergenerational sharing, increasing health literacy about water and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and increasing drinking water access in both home and ECE settings. Activities consist of a lesson plan for children and caregivers, a tailored access plan to promote confidence in water quality at home and ECE sites; and a social media campaign. Water is K'\u00e9 is guided by the conceptual framework of the Navajo Wellness Model, addressing four aspects: spiritual; sustenance; family and kinship (K'\u00e9); and the environment. The intervention's goal is to promote healthy behaviors and intergenerational sharing of cultural teachings about water, resulting in better health among family members and greater family cohesion overall.\n\nThis prospective cluster-randomized trial evaluates the impact of Water is K'\u00e9 on healthy beverage consumption, health outcomes, and family cohesion. A total of 25 ECE sites will be enrolled in the study, serving in the waitlist group for one year, and then the intervention group the following year based on random assignment. Stepwise roll-out will ensure adequate bandwidth to support intervention sites, while also gathering control data from waitlist sites. Primary caregivers will consent for themselves and the child who is enrolled in the ECE program; other family members will be invited to enroll in the study as well. Each site will enroll approximately 11 families per year, resulting in a total enrollment of 440 families (220 in the intervention group, 220 in the control group) and follow them for 12 months to evaluate the impact on behaviors (beverage consumption patterns) and health outcomes (body mass index, A1c among adults living with diabetes or pre-diabetes) of children and adults. In addition, convergent parallel mixed methods will be used to explore whether Water is K'\u00e9 results in greater family cohesion through intergenerational cultural continuity. Specific aims are:\n\n1. Evaluate the impact of Water is K'\u00e9 on children aged 2 to 5. Hypothesis: participating children will have healthier beverage habits and body mass indices compared with children in the control group.\n2. Evaluate intervention impact on the health of other family members. Hypothesis: participating individuals will have healthier beverage habits and body mass indices compared with the control group.\n3. Evaluate the intervention's impact on family well-being. Hypothesis: participating families will have stronger family cohesion through strengthening of intergenerational cultural continuity compared with families in the control group."
