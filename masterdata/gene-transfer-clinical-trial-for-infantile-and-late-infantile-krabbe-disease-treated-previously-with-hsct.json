Presence of any neurocognitive deficit, motor deficit, or brain damage not attributable to Krabbe disease\n6. Signs of active infections or disease from cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, EBV, hepatitis B or C, and HIV or other viruses excluding rhinovirus from RVP and asymptomatic norovirus presence in stool. Patients showing HIV positive results will be excluded from the study.\n7. Active bacterial or fungal infection documented the preceding 7 days.\n8.
