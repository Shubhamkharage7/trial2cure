            "briefSummary": "Youth represent the largest proportion of new HIV infections in Colorado, reflective of their inadequate access and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis(PrEP)for HIV prevention. Colorado's 2019 HIV/AIDS Prevention Program state-wide review of PrEP barriers showed PrEP eligible individuals do not access PrEP services due to lack of interest, not wanting referral to a navigator, and low estimation of HIV risk. The overall goal is to provide youth at higher risk for HIV with an effective youth informed telemedicine delivery of PrEP (TelePrEP) that addresses PrEP barriers and contributes to ending the HIV epidemic in Colorado. The primary objective will be proportion of youth retained on PrEP 12 months after initiation. The hypotheses are that a TelePrEP model for youth will be acceptable and feasible and will result in successful initiation, persistence and retention on oral PrEP."
