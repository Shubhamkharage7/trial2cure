            "briefSummary": "Neuroinflammation is a significant component of Frontotemporal Disorder (FTD). Our preliminary unpublished data demonstrated that regulatory T cells (Tregs) have a compromised phenotype and reduced suppressive function in FTD patients, skewing the immune system toward a proinflammatory status and potentially contributing to disease progression. Low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) is now viewed as a very promising immunoregulatory drug with the capacity to selectively expand and restore functional Tregs. Our preclinical data also demonstrated synergistic effect of interleukin-2 and abatacept (CTLA4-IgG) in remodeling immunologic pathways. Abatacept is an FDA approved medication that has been indicated as a monotherapy or concomitantly with other anti-inflammatory drugs to modulate inflammation in autoimmune disorders. This study is a phase I, open-label study to assess safety and tolerability of low dose IL-2 plus abatacept immunotherapy in FTD individuals. In the first part of this study, 5 FTD patients will be recruited. These five individuals will receive subcutaneous abatacept (125 mg) followed by five-day-courses of IL-2 (1MUI/day) every four weeks for a total of 21 weeks (part-1 of the study). If the treatment strategy is safe and well-tolerated, up to 5 additional FTD subjects will be recruited to receive subcutaneous abatacept (125 mg) followed by five-day-courses of IL-2 (1MUI/day) every two weeks for a total of 21 weeks (part 2 of the study)."

Known to be pregnant or lactating, or positive pregnancy test at screening ; This study allows enrolling women of childbearing potential and the treatments may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study.
