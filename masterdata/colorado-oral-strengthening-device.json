            "briefSummary": "University of Colorado is looking for adults with Parkinson's disease to participate in a research study. The study aims to explore how a novel low technology device can achieve an increase in tongue strength comparable to standard of care exercise using tongue depressors but with the kinematics and simple biofeedback of existing high cost devices. Research has shown that tongue resistance exercises paired with biofeedback have resulted in improved tongue strength to support chewing, control of food and liquid in the mouth, and propulsion of material for a swallow.",
            "detailedDescription": "When an individual contacts the PI or the department research coordinator, a preliminary screen will be administered for any obvious exclusion. If there are no exclusions, the first visit will be scheduled. At this initial visit, a full description of the study and exercise protocol will be provided. A health history questionnaire and an EAT-10 questionnaire will be administered.\n\nIf consent is obtained, baseline tongue strength will be measured using the IOPI device. Individuals with Parkinson's will be randomized to exercise with the COSD or with the tongue depressors. Those who will use the COSD will be start with no less than 60% max strength and receive an exercise log. Those using the tongue depressors will also receive an exercise log.\n\nAll participants will receive a full demonstration of the exercise and will be asked to return the demonstration.\n\nThe second visit will be scheduled for all participants the following week. At that time, the EAT-10 and tongue strength will be re-assessed. The exercise logs will be reviewed to ensure compliance. Participants using the COSD will be issued a new device that is no less than 80% of their max strength.\n\nThe third visit will be scheduled the following week (week 3). The EAT-10 questionnaire and tongue strength will be reassessed. The exercise log will be reviewed for compliance. COSD will be inspected for any signs of wear and a new one will be issued if the device appears worn.\n\nThe last 2 visits will be scheduled during weeks 6 and 8 of the exercise protocol. The EAT-10 and tongue strength will be re-assessed, and the exercise log will be reviewed for compliance. The COSD will be inspected for any signs of wear and a new one will be issued if the device appears worn. In addition, during the final visit, all participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their satisfaction with the exercise device they were assigned. The COSD will be collected at that visit."
