            "briefSummary": "The goal of this fully decentralized, randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of two educational interventions for individuals with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). The primary objective of the study is to determine which intervention leads to higher rates of evidenced-based health screenings for NF1 patients in primary care settings.\n\nAdults with NF1 and parents/guardians of children with NF1 from across the U.S. who do not go to a specialized NF clinic and who have an upcoming annual wellness visits scheduled with a primary care provider (PCP) are eligible to enroll in the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background: The majority of individuals with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) in the United States lack access to specialized NF1 clinics and consequently don't receive care aligned with national recommendations. To address this gap in care, researchers are evaluating two interventions to determine which one helps people get recommended NF1-related health screenings at their annual wellness visit with a primary care provider.\n\nMethods: Participants (adult patients or parents) who enroll in the study will complete baseline survey assessments before their PCP visit and then be randomized to one of two groups. Both groups will be given letters, one for themselves and one for their clinician, that describe NF1 care recommendations. After attending their annual wellness visit, all participants will be asked to complete a follow-up survey. A small subsample of participants will also be asked to do a qualitative interview."
