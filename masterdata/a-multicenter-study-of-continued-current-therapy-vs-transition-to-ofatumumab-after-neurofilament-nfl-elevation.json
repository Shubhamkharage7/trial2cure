This study will also look at whether an elevated serum neurofilament light (NfL) level predicts enhanced benefit from a switch to ofatumumab.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, prospective study of up to 150 relapsing-remitting MS participants/ The study is looking to see if patients who have not had a relapse in the past year would benefit from switching to ofatumumab.\n\nAfter giving consent, participants will have a 1 week screening/qualification period. If they qualify to continue, they will start a a six month run-in period during which lab samples will be collected. Patients that are relapse-free during the run-in period will continue into next period of the study in which they will be randomized to either ofatumumab or continued therapy for the next 15 months. Every 3 out of 5 randomized participants will be selected to wear a digital study watch to collect physical activity, sleep, and vitals during this 15 month period. The study watch will be worn 24 hours a day, 7 days a week but can be removed during showers/bathing. At the end of the 15 month period, a study completion visit will be held.\n\nThe total study duration is 21 months plus 1 week for screening/qualification."
