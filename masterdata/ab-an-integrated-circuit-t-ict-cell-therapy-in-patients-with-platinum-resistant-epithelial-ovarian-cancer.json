            "briefSummary": "This is a multi-center, open-label phase 1 dose escalation trial that uses a modified 3+3 design to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AB-1015 cell product. Backfill cohorts will enroll additional subjects at doses deemed to be safe for a total enrollment of up to 12 subjects per each backfill cohort on the protocol.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is intended for the patients who have been diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer that either came back or did not improve after platinum treatments (platinum resistant). The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using a new treatment called Integrated Circuit T (ICT) cells (AB-1015 cells) in patients with ovarian cancer. This treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe goal of this study is to calculate the maximum tolerated dose of the AB-1015 cells. T cells are part of the immune system that protect the body from infection and may help fight cancer. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a genetic circuit/logic gate put in them that makes them able to recognize alkaline phosphatase, germ line/placental (ALPG/P) and mesothelin (MSLN), 2 proteins on the surface of tumor cells. These logic-gated T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill cancer cells while sparing normal healthy tissues from toxicity.\n\nThe AB-1015 cells are given intravenously, after completing 3 rounds of conditioning chemotherapy administered over 3 consecutive days. Conditioning chemotherapy prepares the body to receive the AB-1015 cells. If they continue to meet the eligibility criteria, AB-1015 cells will be given to them 2 days after the last conditioning chemotherapy round. A single infusion of the AB-1015 cells will be given to the subject intravenously.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed with serial measurements of safety, tolerability and response.\n\nThis is a research study to obtain new information that may help people in the future."
