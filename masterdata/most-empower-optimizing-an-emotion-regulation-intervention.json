Investigators hope to learn more about wellness and health-related quality of life among young adult cancer survivors by promoting well-being and teaching skills for healthy coping and mood management.",
            "detailedDescription": "The EMPOWER Intervention is composed of five components:\n\n1. Noting daily positive event, capitalizing on and savoring positive events, and gratitude.\n2. Mindfulness\n3. Positive Reappraisal\n4. Focusing on personal strengths, setting and working toward attainable goals\n5. Small of Kindness\n\nFor subjects who do not receive EMPOWER components or only receive some of the EMPOWER components, they will be given inert content. The inert content will cover Cognitive changes during Cancer, Diet, Weight Management, Financial Literacy and Sun Protection. The trial is a composed of a full factorial design with 32 (2X2X2X2X2) experimental conditions. Adolescents and Young Adults will receive 0, 1,2,3,4 or 5 Empower components.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n\u2022 Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to positive affect among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.\n\nSecondary Objective\n\n* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to depression and anxiety among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.\n* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to life satisfaction and general self-efficacy among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\n* Summarize adherence and retention by participants over the course of the EMPOWER intervention.\n* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to physical functioning, fatigue, satisfaction with social roles and responsibilities.\n* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to health behaviors (diet, exercise, sedentary behavior, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking).\n* Examine the trajectory of change in positive affect, life satisfaction, general self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors post intervention by intervention component.\n* Examine coping self-efficacy as a mediator of the relationship between EMPOWER intervention components and positive affect, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety.\n* Examine potential moderators (age, gender, social support, general self-efficacy, stressors, and positive events) of the relationship between EMPOWER intervention components and positive affect, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety."

Adolescents and young adults cannot skip ahead, but they can return to old lessons or exercises if they choose. Most exercises are done in a \"diary\" format in which past responses are displayed next to their new ones, so that every time they visit that exercise they see their growing list of past positive experiences. Participants will be permitted up to 8 weeks to complete this self-guided intervention.",
