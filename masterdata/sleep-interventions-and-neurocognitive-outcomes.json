            "briefSummary": "This protocol focuses on the effect of sleep interventions on improving sleep and building cognitive/brain resilience in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and sleep disturbance. Two sleep interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) and acoustic slow-wave activity enhancement (SWAE), will be utilized in a pilot randomized clinical trial in which participants are randomized to different treatment groups (CBTI or SWAE). Participants will be assessed over a 6-month period in order to examine the impact of sleep treatments on neuropsychological outcomes and cognitively mediated everyday functioning.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study has the goal of understanding the effect of sleep interventions on improving sleep and building cognitive/brain resilience in older adults. To implement this, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial in which fifty older adults (with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and sleep disturbance) will be assigned to different treatment groups to test the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) and acoustic slow-wave activity enhancement (SWAE) over the course of 6 months. CBTI is a psychotherapy intervention designed to address maladaptive cognitive and behavioral patterns associated with sleep and bedtime. SWAE is administered through a non-invasive headband that detects and amplifies endogenous slow-wave activity using playing acoustic stimulation (\"pink noise\"). Group differences will be compared on the changes in cognitive performance and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (phosphorylated tau). The investigators will also explore potential mechanisms behind the relationship between sleep and cognition/biomarkers by investigating a range of objectively measured sleep metrics (e.g., sleep architecture, sleep duration, arousals) along with APOE genotype and depressive symptoms."

Participants must have capacity to provide informed consent.\n8. Have access to stable internet connection.\n9. A family member or other individual who is in contact with the subject and consents to serve as informant during the study; this can be a telephone informant in the case of subjects who do not have a live-in informant\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Diagnosis of stroke or excessive risk of CVD\n2. Neurologic disease including movement disorders, MS, epilepsy, and TBI (with greater than 15 min loc)\n3. Untreated diabetes\n4. Active treatment of cancer\n5.

Presence of sleep disorders other than insomnia (moderate-severe sleep apnea, REM-behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm disorder). Mild sleep apnea will not be exclusionary.\n7. Current DSM-5 Axis I psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, substance/alcohol use disorder, or bipolar disorder\n8. Use of antidepressants with known large anticholinergic properties will be excluded. These include: amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepine, imipramine, isocarboxazide, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, tranylcypromine trimipramine, and phenelzine. Other medications are allowed during the study and are not exclusionary.\n9. Participants taking medications with benzodiazepines properties will be excluded. These include: diazepam, quazepam, estazolam, alprazolam, clorazepate, clorazepate, oxazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, flurazepam, triazolam, temazepam, and midazolam.\n10. Participants with moderate to severe depression (Geriatric Depression Scale\\>8) will be excluded from the study and will be encouraged to seek treatment for their symptoms.
