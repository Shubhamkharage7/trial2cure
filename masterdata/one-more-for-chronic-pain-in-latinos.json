Participants will also be guided through a mindful pain management practice in which they will learn to deconstruct pain into sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components. The second segment will focus on managing the negative thoughts and emotion that can amplify pain with mindful reappraisal, as well as learning to focus on increasing the positive emotions that can attenuate pain with mindful savoring.",
