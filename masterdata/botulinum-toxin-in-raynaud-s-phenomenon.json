The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Botulinum toxin (BT) in the treatment of treatment refractory RP by objective and subjective measures.",
            "detailedDescription": "Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP) is the most common vasospastic (i.e. conditions where small blood vessels near the surface of the skin have spasms that limit blood flow) disorder encountered by hand surgeons with an estimated prevalence of 5% in the general population. The clinical manifestations are broad, and can range from minor pain, cold sensitivity and color changes to impaired hand function, intolerable pain and tissue loss/digital ulceration. Treatment algorithms include activity modification and medical therapies. However, refractory RP can warrant surgical intervention, such as peri-arterial sympathectomy, of which has significant associated morbidity. While the exact mechanism is still being elucidated, several retrospective reviews have demonstrated efficacy of BT in the treatment of RP. Specifically, increases in post treatment perfusion have been demonstrated and clinical evidence of improvement in pain scores and tissue loss are reported. However, the literature varies in regard to injection technique (location and dose) and duration of action.\n\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of BT in the treatment of treatment refractory RP by objective and subjective measures. This study will perform a single-site double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating two different doses of BT (10 units and 20 units) injected into each patient's fingers of both hands versus injection of a normal saline control, given that there is currently no widely accepted standard of care for the treatment of BT. Following injection, patients will be evaluated in regular intervals to assess for impact on finger temperature, oxygenation, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), and effect on tissue loss.\n\nThe study will take place under Emory University School of Medicine, specifically the Upper Extremity Division. Patients may also be originally seen under the Rheumatology Division and subsequently referred to the Upper Extremity Division for study participation. In total, the study aims to recruit 36 patients. There will be no outside recruitment or advertisement materials. With this research study, the study team seeks to establish a standardized injection technique and dosage for this disease and to determine duration of symptom alleviation."
