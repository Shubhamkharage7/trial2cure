            "briefSummary": "This study will explore potential links between atopic dermatitis and food allergy. This information will be useful to determine atopic dermatitis and food allergy share unique biochemical or genetic identifiers useful for diagnosing and treatments in the future.\n\nThis is a mechanistic study consisting of obtaining blood and skin samples from participants at baseline. Individuals may also undergo a clinically indicated oral food challenge and have blood and skin samples collected at various times during the oral food challenge. This study will create a molecular map of the pathology of atopic dermatitis and food allergy. This information will be deployed to evaluate the hypothesis that atopic dermatitis and food allergy share unique genetic transcriptional signals in which the study team can then further analyze pathological pathways and cell types.",

A transepidermal water loss monitor will be applied to participant's arm with a sticky pad and will stay on the arm for the challenge. Food doses will be given in small amounts that increase in size up to a defined single serving of the food based upon the participants age/size. The OFC will proceed until a full dose is consumed without symptoms, or until anaphylaxis occurs. Depending upon the participant's reaction to the oral food challenge, the participant may be requested to return the next day for a research visit that would take less than an hour.
