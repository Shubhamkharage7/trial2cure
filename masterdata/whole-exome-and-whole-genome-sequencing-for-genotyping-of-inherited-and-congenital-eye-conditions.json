            "briefSummary": "Objective: The objective of this study is to identify genetic causes of inherited eye conditions through whole exome or whole genome sequencing. This includes identifying mutations in known genes or novel genes for recognized conditions, as well as identifying mutations in novel genes for previously uncharacterized genetic conditions involving the eye.\n\nStudy Population: We plan to recruit 1,685 participants, to include both participants with an eye condition under study and unaffected family members. Ideally unaffected family members will be parents of an affected participant.\n\nDesign: Most affected participants will be recruited from existing studies at the NEI. These include, but are not limited to, the Screening Protocol (08-EI-0102), the NEI Ocular Natural History protocol (16-EI-0134), the Genetics of Inherited Eye Disease protocol (15-EI-0128) and the Pathogenesis and Genetics of Microphthalmia, Anophthalmia and Uveal Coloboma (MAC) study (13-EI-0049). Unaffected family members will be invited to participate once an affected relative is determined eligible for participation. Offsite affected and unaffected participants will also be enrolled. If a participant is self-referred or referred to the study by an outside provider, screening will determine whether participation is offered.\n\nOffsite participants will be screened via phone or secure videoconference, and records will be requested for evaluation of affected participants.. Both affected and unaffected eligible participants will undergo genetic counseling and will provide a blood sample and/or saliva sample for exome or genome sequencing. Biological relationships may be confirmed prior to exome or genome sequencing. Sequence data will be analyzed for primary variants and secondary findings, unless participants choose to opt-out of secondary analysis and reporting. All sequence variants deemed clinically relevant will be validated in a CLIA-certified laboratory and the results will be returned to the participant in-person, secure video conference, or by telephone.\n\nOutcome Measures: This is an etiologic study that will generate molecular information about previously-recognized conditions for which participants did not have a molecular diagnosis, as well as molecular information for previously uncharacterized conditions involving the eye.",
