            "briefSummary": "The overall goal of this study is to respond to the urgent need for an effective suicide prevention strategy for Black youth by examining the effectiveness of a systems-level strategy to recognize and respond to suicide risk among Black adolescents who present to emergency departments (EDs). The proposed strategy, WeCare, combines combines three components: (1) universal screening using the Computerized Adaptive Screen for Suicidal Youth (CASSY), (2) a brief intervention designed for Black youth with elevated suicide risk in for ED settings, Connections for Safety (CFS), that combines safety planning and strategies to support linkage to outpatient mental health services, and (3) supportive text messages to youth and parent/caregivers for six weeks following the youth's ED visit. Study objectives are (1) to integrate input from multiple stakeholders to inform and facilitate WeCare implementation, and (2) to use a hybrid one effectiveness-implementation design to evaluate its effectiveness.",
            "detailedDescription": "From 1991 through 2017, suicide attempts increased by 73% among Black high school-aged youth, and suicide attempts requiring hospitalization increased by 122% for Black high school-aged boys. These alarming findings, in part, led to the creation of the Emergency Taskforce on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health and their subsequent report, Ring the Alarm: The Crisis of Black Youth Suicide in America, and passage of the Pursuing Equity in Mental Act. These all highlight the urgent need to improve suicide risk detection, treatment, and prevention among Black youth.\n\nWe propose to respond to these challenges and the urgent need for an effective suicide prevention strategy for Black youth by examining the effectiveness of an \"easily implementable,\" \"systems-level\" strategy to recognize and respond to suicide risk among Black youth who present to EDs. WeCare combines (1) CASSY, a universal screening; (2) CFS, an intervention with elements from SAFETY-Acute (SAFETY-A), an evidence-based, family-centered intervention to safety planning for children and adolescents; (3) Safety Planning Intervention (SPI), a brief ED-based intervention of a written list prioritizing coping strategies and sources of support to alleviate a suicidal crisis; (3) Making Connections Intervention (MCI), a mental health engagement intervention for Black adolescents and their parents; and (4) a follow-up text messaging support system for youth and parents will be introduced for enhanced feasibility.\n\nThis study is a randomized clinical effectiveness trial with 2,200 Black youth at risk for suicide to examine the effectiveness of WeCare. Youth, ages 12 to 19 years, enrolled from two hospital EDs in New York City, will be assessed on enrollment for risks associated with suicide. Moderate/high-risk youth will be randomly assigned to WeCare vs. usual services. Survey assessments will be conducted at 3- and 6-month follow-up, with medical record review through 12 months to examine the effectiveness of WeCare and mediators of WeCare effects. The objective is to increase risk identification, treatment referral and engagement, and, in turn, reduce suicidal ideation and behavior among Black youth."
