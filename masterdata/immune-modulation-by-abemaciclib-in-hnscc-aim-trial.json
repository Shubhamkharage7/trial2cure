Paired, pre- and post-surgical tumor specimens permit ex vivo analysis of target modulation in both tumor and the tumor microenvironment - providing insight into mechanism of action and paving the way for rigorous companion biomarker development. Clinical activity is assessed by quantitative change in tumor size (\u2206T), which is correlated to hypothesis-driven genomic and immune biomarkers of interest.\n\nInvestigators hypothesize that abemaciclib will significantly reduce tumor burden as measured by \u2206T. Further, investigators will test the primary biomarker hypothesis that the clinical activity of abemaciclib is associated with an increased proportion of tumors that are T-cell inflamed. Investigators will evaluate tumor-intrinsic, tumor microenvironment (TME), and microbiome biomarker hypotheses in specific genetic contexts, including tumors with specific classes of tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations, p16 loss, and/or CCND1 amplification."

Males who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential should apply highly effective contraception during the study as defined below, in order not to father a child in this period.\n    3. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and through at least 3 weeks after the final dose of abemaciclib. Highly effective contraception is defined as:\n\n    i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. \\[Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\\].\n\nii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.\n\niii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). \\[For female study subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\\] iv. Use a combination of the following (both 1+2):\n\n1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.\n\nv. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not allowed as abemaciclib may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.\n\nvi. Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.\n\n11.
