            "briefSummary": "Inguinal hernias are a common surgical problem. Best management of occult inguinal hernias, defined as hernias unable to be felt on physical exam, is unknown. From prior studies we know that most inguinal hernias will eventually become symptomatic and require surgery (70%). However, doing a repair on a very small, occult hernia may open the patient up to surgical complications, like chronic pain, earlier than necessary. This will be a multi-center randomized controlled trial of surgical repair versus expectant management of occult inguinal hernias. Patients undergoing laparoscopic unilateral inguinal hernia repair will be included. At the time of surgery, the surgeon will determine if there is an occult hernia contralateral side. If present, patients will be randomized to repair of the occult side or expectant management of the occult side. After 1 year post-operative data has been assessed, a decision tool will be created and administered to patients to aid in their decision making about treatments for their hernia."
