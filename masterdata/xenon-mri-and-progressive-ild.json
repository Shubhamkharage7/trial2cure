Patients who meet criteria for ILD-progression (defined below in inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be consented prior to the initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy. Subjects will undergo an approximately hour long comprehensive MRI protocol, including administration of multiple doses of hyperpolarized 129Xe. The subjects will have this initial study prior to initiation of anti-fibrotic therapies and repeat MRI studies at 3, 6 and 12 months following the initiation of therapy. If subjects do not decide to initiate anti-fibrotic therapy per discussion with their physician, then the 3, 6 and 12 months repeat studies will initiate based on time after enrollment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The XENON ILD study is a single arm, un-blinded study at Duke University enrolling patients with non-IPF PF-ILD. Patients who meet criteria for ILD-progression (defined below in inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be consented prior to the initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy.

The subjects will have this initial study prior to initiation of anti-fibrotic therapies and repeat MRI studies at 3, 6 and 12 months following the initiation of therapy. If subjects do not decide to initiate anti-fibrotic therapy per discussion with their physician, then the 3, 6 and 12 months repeat studies will initiate based on time after enrollment. We plan to consent 75 subjects with PF-ILD who are candidates for anti-fibrotic therapy to slow ILD progression. We will ensure that the study will include at least 38 subjects who start anti-fibrotic therapy after baseline first MRI scan and continue the therapy until his/her 3 month repeat MRI scan. This will be obtained by a pre-specified increase in the number of subjects until the 38 subject criteria is completed. Subject will not be excluded from the study due to stopping anti-fibrotic therapy for any reason during the study.\n\nAdditional studies including pulmonary function studies, plasma and serum for biomarkers, whole blood for DNA (baseline visit only), whole blood for RNA, exhaled breath for biomarkers, 6 minute walk distance and a HRCT (only at the screening visit, 6 month visit, and 12 month visit) will be performed to determine how 129Xe MRI performs relative to standard of care evaluations for PF-ILD patients. Finally, following the study visits the research team will prospectively follow the patients' clinical course through periodic reviews of the medical record."
