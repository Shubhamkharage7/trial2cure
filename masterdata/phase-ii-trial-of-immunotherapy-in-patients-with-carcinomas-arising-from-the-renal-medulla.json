ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria. In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria recorded between Day 1 of the study and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Our goal is to significantly improve the ORR compared with the historical ORR of 29% achieved in our institution using conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* To determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of nivolumab plus relatlimab in patients with RMC. Efficacy will be measured by overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to ORR, duration of response, and the disease control rate (DCR).\n* To evaluate potential biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment response, as well as tumor antigen-specific immune responses, such as antibody and T cell responses, as surrogates for anti-tumor activity."
