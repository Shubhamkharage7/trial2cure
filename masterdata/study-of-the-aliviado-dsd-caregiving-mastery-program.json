Involvement of family caregivers may aid prevention, early detection, and management of DSD. The purpose of the proposed study is two-fold. First, the investigators will develop a family-centered, mHealth-enhanced DSD caregiving mastery program (\"Aliviado DSD Caregiving Mastery Program\") through a 5-week co-design workshop with 8 family caregivers (Aim 1). The investigators will adapt/refine the existing clinician-centered DSD contents and an mHealth app from the evidence-based \"Aliviado Dementia Care\" program for use by family caregivers to support their day-to-day implementation of DSD detection, prevention, and management tasks in the community. Second, the investigators will pilot test the full Aliviado DSD Caregiving Mastery Program with 30 family caregivers of PLWD at high risk for delirium, assessing feasibility, acceptability, app usability, and preliminary program impact (Aim 2)."
