The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is it feasible to conduct a KAP study with this population?\n* What is the safety and tolerability of KAP in this population?\n* How prevalent is existential distress in this population?\n\nParticipants will undergo KAP administered as standard of care at the HMHI Park City Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy Clinic and will complete health assessments over the course of the study, as well as during the therapy."
