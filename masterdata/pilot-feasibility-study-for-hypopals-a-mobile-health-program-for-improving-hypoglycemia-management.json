The goal of the current study is to make sure that HypoPals runs smoothly, users find the intervention useful, and the way the researchers conduct the final study will be correct (i.e., there is a need for 'pilot testing' the developed technology and research methods).\n\nAll participants will receive basic hypoglycemia education text messages, and then be randomized to one of the four experimental conditions: Hypoglycemia Symptom Detection Training, Education Plus, both Symptom Detection Training and Education Plus, and usual care. Participants may receive additional interventional text messages based on the experimental condition participants are assigned to.\n\nThe study may terminate after collecting sufficient data to evaluate the primary outcome (i.e., determining the number of participants recruited to reach 20 participants who complete the intervention)."
