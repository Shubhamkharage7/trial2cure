An online decision support tool will be field tested that provides patients facing a decision about contralateral prophylactic breast cancer (CPM) with evidence-based information about the expected incidence of contralateral breast cancer and the life expectancy benefit of CPM. The tool will be designed for use in clinical settings and viewed jointly by the patient and physician as part of a shared decision making process around CPM.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients use decision making tool during consultation with breast cancer surgeon and complete questionnaires before and after consultation."
