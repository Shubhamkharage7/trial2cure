We hypothesize that administration of belantamab mafodotin as part of autologous stem cell transplant consolidation and maintenance will be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in comparison to historical data."

Subjects with positive testing for hepatitis B core antibody but no evidence for active infection by nucleic acid-based testing may enroll if they agree to hepatitis B prophylactic therapy and monitoring for HBV re-activation for the duration of the study.\n* Participant must not have positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C RNA test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. NOTE: Participants with positive hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative hepatitis C RNA test is obtained.\n* Participant must not have evidence of active HIV infection.
