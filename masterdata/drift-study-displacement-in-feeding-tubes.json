            "briefSummary": "The proposed study will use an electromagnetic placement device (EMPD), Cortrak\\* 2 Enteral Access System (EAS\u2122), Avanos Medical, to verify feeding tube (FT) position on a daily basis to assess for migration. The EMPD provides real-time FT placement data. A sensor located on the distal end of the FT guidewire communicates with a receiver unit which sits on the patient's abdomen. Three visual insertion tracings with varying views (anterior, lateral, and depth/cross-section) can be saved and printed for comparison.",
            "detailedDescription": "Two previous studies have been completed with similar methodology. A pilot study of 50 subjects was performed using the original Cortrak\\* (2 insertion views) and found only minimal forward migration. No reverse migration was reported in one study.\n\nA pilot study of 20 patients with 62 feeding tube assessment identified 8 migration events (5 retrograde and 3 forward), these events only occurred within the small bowel. Based on this data, a recommendation could be made that there is no need to check feeding tube placement routinely every four hours. However, due to the small sample size, additional research is needed to confirm this finding. It is also unknown if there may be more migration with positioning changes, for example, up in the chair or prone position.\n\nThe proposed study will use an electromagnetic placement device (EMPD), Cortrak\\* 2 Enteral Access System (EAS\u2122), Avanos Medical, to verify FT position on a daily basis to assess for migration. The proposed study will take place in critical care units at Parkview Health. The primary aim will be to determine if replication of the pilot study results in similar findings. Investigators will also explore other factors that may be associated with FT migration, such as patient mobility (ambulation or sitting at bedside or prone position) and transporting out of the critical care unit for diagnostic procedures. Researchers anticipate that results from this study will provide a better understanding of FT position and migration over time and ultimately influence recommendations for practice for frequency of routine FT verification. Standard of care for assessing feeding tube placement location every 4 hours will remain in place. The study will add an additional assessment for feeding tube location daily. This study will expand on the findings from the initial pilot study with a larger sample size."
