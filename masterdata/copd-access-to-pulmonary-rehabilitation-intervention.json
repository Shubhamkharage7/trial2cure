            "briefSummary": "Persons with COPD have significant functional disability but cannot access rehabilitative treatment at hospital-based conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs. This project will determine whether an Internet-mediated, pedometer-based walking program can increase physical activity in persons with COPD who qualify for but cannot access PR, compared to usual care. This proposal has high potential to deliver an immediate solution to a pressing clinical need. The proposed research addresses Rehabilitation R\\&D Service's current priority area of improving disabled Veterans' health-related quality of life by reducing disease burden and maximizing functional recovery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs are highly effective and the standard of care in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PR faces two significant problems: (1) most patients with COPD who would benefit from PR cannot access it, and 2) there is no effective long-term strategy to maintain physical activity (PA) and benefits after completing PR. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a technology-mediated intervention to increase PA in persons with COPD who qualify for but cannot access conventional, hospital-based PR. COPD is a leading cause of death in the United States; an estimated 16 million Americans have COPD. Despite maximal medical therapy, patients with COPD characteristically experience breathlessness, which leads to a downward spiral of sedentary behavior, physical inactivity, deconditioning, and functional disability. Low physical activity is associated with poor outcomes in COPD--increased risk of acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, and death, independent of lung function. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend regular PA for all patients with COPD. Conventional, supervised PR programs clearly reduce breathlessness, and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity. However, PR programs face significant challenges of access and adherence. The investigators developed Every Step Counts (ESC), a technology-mediated intervention based on the Behavioral Theory of Self-Regulation, to target sedentary behavior, promote PA, and alleviate deconditioning. ESC couples a website with a pedometer to directly monitor step counts. The website provides individualized step-count goals, iterative feedback, education on disease self-management, motivation, and an online community of social support. In two randomized studies in Veterans with COPD, the investigators demonstrated ESC's safety, feasibility, and efficacy to increase PA. Accessible via the internet and available at any time from home, ESC could be an ideal low-cost platform to address the limitations of conventional PR. The investigators hypothesize that ESC may be an efficacious strategy to promote PA in the many patients who cannot attend a PR program.\n\nPrimary Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of a web-based intervention, ESC, to increase PA (measured directly with an accelerometer and a questionnaire that assesses intensity), compared to usual care, in persons with COPD who are referred to or eligible for conventional PR but who cannot access it.\n\nSecondary Aim 2: Estimate the effect of the ESC intervention on (a) exercise self-efficacy, (b) HRQL, (c) dyspnea, (d) depression, and (e) risk of acute exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations, compared to usual care.\n\nAll study visits are performed either in-person or remotely starting September, 2021."
