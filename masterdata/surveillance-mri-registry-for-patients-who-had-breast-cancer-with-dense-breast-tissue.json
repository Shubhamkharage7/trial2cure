To determine the incidence of interval cancer.\n\nII. To compare participants with personal history of breast cancer, age 50 and under, who did not receive surveillance MRI.\n\nIII. To determine positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of surveillance breast MRI in this population.\n\nIV. To compare the tumor biology of breast cancer detected on breast MRI.\n\nV. To determine the participants experience with MRI i.e. willingness to return for testing with breast MRI.\n\nVI. To evaluate the reasons women refuse breast MRI for the surveillance of recurrent disease or secondary breast cancer.\n\nVII. To determine the patients' interest in having procedural hypnosis to improve patient reported acceptance of breast MRI among participants."
