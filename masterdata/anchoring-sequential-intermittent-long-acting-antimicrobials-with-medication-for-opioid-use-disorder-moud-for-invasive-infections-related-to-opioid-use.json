We aim to determine the efficacy of an alternative strategy using intermittent outpatient oritavancin therapy dosed weekly combined with initiation and continuation of medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder for completion of antimicrobial therapy in a 12 week prospective, open-label study. Patients hospitalized for a drug use related infection and thought to need prolonged parenteral antimicrobial therapy will be assessed by a substance use consultant and Infectious Diseases service. If they are not on Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD), they will be assessed for initiation of MOUD. A collaborative multidisciplinary discharge planning process will be initiated and will involve linkage to care. If they have an infection with a gram positive organism, and are thought to be clinically stable for hospital discharge, they will be assessed for appropriateness for oritavancin and first dose will be administered prior to discharge. They will have an intake into an opioid treatment program where they can access collocated services and will be discharged with linkage to care through a peer recovery coach. They will be assessed in this collocated clinic post discharge for optimization of MOUD and progress of infection and subsequent dose/s of oritavancin will be administered. Patients will be followed for 12 weeks for cure/completion of therapy and MOUD outcomes."
