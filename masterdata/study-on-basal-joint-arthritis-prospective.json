            "briefSummary": "The data in this prospective registry will be used 1) to define which surgical and nonoperative techniques are most effective at providing pain relief, restoring function, are cost effective, and patients are satisfied with their outcomes; and 2) to design focused clinical questions regarding the optimal treatment of basal joint arthritis of the thumb in future randomized controlled trials. There are no interventions or changes in patient care associated with this study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Basal joint arthritis of the thumb is a common condition associated with considerable morbidity. Many non-operative and operative treatments have been described but few multi-center prospective evidence based trials comparing standard treatments have been done. This continuing search for consensus of best clinical practices has been reviewed in a thorough meta-analysis of operative treatments for basal joint arthritis. Through the systematic collection of data regarding patient-specific characteristics, treatment interventions, and longitudinal functional outcome measurements the investigators believe patient outcomes and satisfaction can improve through the elucidation of risk factors for disease progression, and the timing and selection of treatment modalities, either conservative or surgical, for any particular patient. The establishment of a multi-center clinical registry will greatly facilitate these goals.\n\nThe study hypothesizes that there exist effective non-operative and operative treatments for certain patient populations with basal joint arthritis of the thumb. There also exists a functionally superior, cost effective, and low risk non-operative or minimally invasive operative treatment regime to alleviate pain and slow the progression of disease in those with less advanced disease. Likewise, there is significant functional, health utility, and economic advantage to surgically treating advanced basal joint arthritis with one of the popularized procedures currently in practice."
