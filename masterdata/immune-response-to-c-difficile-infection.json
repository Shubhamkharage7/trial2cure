This could lead to new and effective approaches to the treatment or prevention of Clostridium difficile colitis that act downstream of fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) or next generation probiotics. Successful fecal microbial transplantation will restore protective immunity to recurrent C.difficile infection.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study includes one cohort of hospitalized patients with acute CDI who may require diagnostic colonoscopy, a second cohort of outpatients with recurrent CDI scheduled for FMT and a third cohort of inpatients with past history of CDI without recurrence.\n\nBlood samples and discarded stool samples for research will be obtained from adult hospitalized patients. Biopsies and brushing samples for research will be obtained from patients requiring diagnostic colonoscopies for clinical care. Follow-up will include phone contact at 60-90 days to determine relapse or mortality in acute CDI patients.\n\nBlood and colonic biopsies and brushing samples will be obtained from patients undergoing FMT for recurrent CDI and again after 60 days from convalescent patients.\n\nBlood and biopsies taken for research purposes at each colonoscopy will be analyzed for: cytokines and chemokines, gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry and high dimensional flow-cytometry."
