The participants are SJLIFE study participants and may have a hard time exercising (exercise intolerance) due to side effects of cancer treatment received as a child.This study is being done to determine if a personalized exercise plan will help childhood cancer survivors who have exercise intolerance become more active.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nTo achieve the goal of this study, we propose the following three Objectives:\n\nPrimary Objective 1:\n\nTo determine the efficacy of an individually tailored, home-delivered aerobic and strengthening intervention to improve exercise capacity in survivors of childhood cancer with exercise intolerance (peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) \\<85% of age and sex predicted).\n\nPrimary Objective 2:\n\nTo determine the effects of an individually tailored, home-delivered aerobic and strengthening intervention on measures of cardiac, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neurosensory function in survivors of childhood cancer with exercise intolerance.\n\nPrimary Objective 3:\n\nTo determine the effects of an individually tailored, home-delivered aerobic and strengthening intervention on emotional health, participation in family and community activities, quality of life, and cognitive function in survivors of childhood cancer with exercise intolerance.",
