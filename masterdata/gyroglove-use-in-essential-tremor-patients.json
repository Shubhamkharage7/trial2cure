All gloves will be retrieved and returned to GyroGear after closure of the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "All participants will attend 2 in-clinic assessment sessions (Baseline (day 0), Follow-up (day 14)) after screening visit. The baseline session will last approximately 120 minutes whilst the 2-week assessment will last approximately 60-80 minutes. At baseline assessment, participants will perform protocol-specific activities with both investigational devices (i.e. GyroGlove and Placebo).\n\nIn addition to in-clinic assessments, participants will complete self-assessments at Day -3 prior baseline visit (i.e. Day 0,) and at Day 5 and 10 from baseline (i.e. Day 0), when they started using GyroGlove at home.\n\nAll participants will be blinded at the baseline (Day 0), as assessments will be performed with GyroGlove and a placebo device in a pre-defined sequence. Each participant will act as the control for him/herself and will be blinded to the interventions order.\n\nThe sequence of interventions in the study has been pre-defined, owing to the potential for longitudinal effects of wearing the device interfering with the accurate study outcome measurement."
