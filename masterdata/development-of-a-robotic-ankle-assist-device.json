            "briefSummary": "The overall objectives of this work is to establish feasibility of a robotic ankle assist device (RAAD) to improve mobility in free-living settings and to establish the RAAD as an effective tool to provide increased dose and precision of targeted ankle therapy. The first specific aim is to complete a personal-use feasibility analysis of ankle mobility assistance. It is hypothesized the children will be able to safely walk faster and travel farther in the community when using the RAAD device vs. without the device. The second specific aim is to gather feedback to design and prototype a minimum viable product for use in clinical and community settings. The third specific aim is to quantify the potential for the RAAD system to increase the effectiveness of clinical gait therapy. Individuals with CP will complete three training sessions: RAAD assistance, RAAD resistance and standard of care. Muscle activity and step activity will be measured during each session. It is hypothesized that the RAAD assistance and resistance therapy will improve ankle plantar-flexor muscle activity and treatment session quality compared to traditional physical therapist-guided gait training. The fourth specific aim is to assess the benefits of repeated gait training with RAAD assistance and resistance. Individuals with CP will participate in a 4-week assistance or resistance intervention and mobility outcomes will be quantified pre and post intervention. It is hypothesized that both assistance and resistance training will improve mobility outcomes."
