            "detailedDescription": "Lower limb sprains and strains are three-times more prevalent than any other acute injury in the Armed Forces, with lateral ankle sprains being the most common injury sustained during active-duty. Many individuals who experience an ankle sprain will go on to develop chronic ankle instability. Training and rehabilitation programs that incorporate proprioceptive training are particularly effective at improving outcomes and reducing re-injury rate. However, current programs do not help individuals \"train to the tasks\" that will be encountered once those individuals leave physical therapy. The proposed intervention evaluates the use of a rocky, uneven terrain treadmill that specifically targets aspects of the real-world environment for restoring and improving short-term function and performance and reducing the long-term risk of re-injury. This trial will randomly allocate 312 individuals with ankle sprains and chronic ankle instability to standard of care physical therapy or the standard of care supplemented with the uneven treadmill intervention. Patient reported outcome, performance measures, and biomechanical measures of muscle activations and plantar pressures will be evaluated. Patient reported outcomes and reinjury rates will be tracked for 18 months."
