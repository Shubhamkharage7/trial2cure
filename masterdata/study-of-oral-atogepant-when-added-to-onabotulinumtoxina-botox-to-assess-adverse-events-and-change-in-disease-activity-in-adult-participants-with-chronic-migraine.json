The study will assess safety and tolerability of atogepant when added to BOTOX, as well as prospectively evaluate the efficacy of add-on atogepant for migraine prevention. Adverse events and change in disease activity will be monitored.\n\nAtogepant is an investigational drug being developed to prevent chronic migraine. Approximately 75 adult participants will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in the United States.\n\nAll participants will receive atogepant oral tablet once a day (QD) during the 24-week treatment period, in addition to their standard of care Botox.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires."
