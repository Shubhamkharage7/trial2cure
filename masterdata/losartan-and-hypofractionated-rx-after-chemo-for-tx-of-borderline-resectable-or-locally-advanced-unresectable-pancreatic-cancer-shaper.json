            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects of losartan and hypofractionated radiation therapy after chemotherapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that may or may not be removed by surgery (borderline resectable) or has spread from its original site of growth to nearby tissues or lymph nodes and is not amenable to surgical resection (locally advanced unresectable). Losartan may improve blood flow and allows for better tissue oxygenation. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving losartan and hypofractionated radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer compared to hypofractionated radiation therapy alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the safety of losartan potassium (losartan) in combination with hypofractionated radiation treatment for patients with stable or locally progressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) after induction chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety of losartan in combination with HRT for patients with stable or locally progressive PDAC after induction chemotherapy.\n\nII. To assess the efficacy of losartan in combination with HRT for patients with stable or locally progressive PDAC after induction chemotherapy.\n\nIII. To assess the rate of hypotensive adverse events grade \\>= 3.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess patient reported quality of life.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nBeginning day 1, patients receive losartan potassium orally (PO) once daily (QD). Beginning day 14, patients also undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy over 15 fractions 5 days a week for up to 3 weeks. Patients continue to receive losartan potassium PO QD during radiation therapy and for 28 days after completion of radiation therapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 and 84 days, every 3 months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for up to 36 months."
