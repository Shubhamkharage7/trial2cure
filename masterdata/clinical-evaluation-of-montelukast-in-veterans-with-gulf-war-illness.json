            "briefSummary": "The study addresses the pre-clinical promise of Montelukast (MLK) for improving brain function in veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI). MLK, a US Food and Drug administration (FDA)-approved drug for asthma, has shown efficacy in an animal model of GWI to improve cognitive and mood function through modulation of leukotriene signaling and suppression of neuroinflammation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background: Approximately 30% of Gulf War Veterans (1990-1991) suffer from Gulf War Illness (GWI), a chronic condition characterized by disabling symptoms in multiple domains. Animal models and human data suggest a prominent neuroinflammatory basis for many of the symptoms of GWI. Preliminary data from an established GWI rat model demonstrates the involvement of increased leukotriene signaling in the brain and its potential as a marker of neuroinflammation when detected in neuron- and astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles present in the peripheral blood. MLK, an FDA-approved drug for asthma, has shown efficacy in an animal model of GWI to improve cognitive and mood function through modulation of leukotriene signaling and suppression of neuroinflammation. MLK has a strong safety record and has been recognized for its potential as a modulator of neurodegeneration in human disease and is, therefore, a promising intervention for GWI.\n\nHypothesis/Objective: Examine the impact of MLK on cognition, quality of life, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in Veterans with GWI and test for changes in brain-specific leukotrienes (markers of neuroinflammation) detectable in the extracellular vesicles circulating in the peripheral blood.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of MLK on cognitive function, functional status and mood in veterans with GWI using validated neurocognitive and self-reported measures consistent with the GWI Common Data Elements.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To examine the antiinflammatory effects of MLK on the brain. The investigators will evaluate neuron-derived extracellular vesicles and astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles in blood samples from Veterans with GWI receiving MLK or placebo treatment.\n\nStudy Design: 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 80 Veterans who meet both the Kansas and Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition of GWI and report cognitive dysfunction treated with either: 1) two capsules of 20 mg of MLK or 2) two capsules of matched placebo taken daily for 10 weeks. Participants will be recruited to participate at Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) in Houston, TX, using best practices including Veteran community outreach and engagement, active recruitment from local and national VA databases, and a strong social media presence. Participants will be screened for eligibility by phone and attend only two in-person evaluations (self-reported instruments, blood draw, and neuropsychology tests) with regular phone contact throughout study enrollment. Blood specimens will be obtained, and plasma processed at MEDVAMC, and shipped to Texas A\\&M University College of Medicine (TAMU-COM) for specialized assays. Data will be maintained, managed and analyzed by the MEDVAMC team in collaboration with the TAMU team.\n\nImpact: The findings from the proposed research will advance the understanding of the pathophysiology, validate the use of extracellular vesicle assays as a biomarker of central nervous system inflammation, and advance a potential treatment (i.e., MLK) for a specific putative underlying mechanism of GWI. The short-term impact will be an important validation of the theory of neuroinflammation as central pathophysiology of GWI through the tested hypotheses. The longer-term impact of the proposed work includes a relatively short timeline to the use of MLK as a specific treatment for GWI. Because MLK is already FDA approved and safe, if findings from this project support the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MLK in Veterans with GWI, a definitive randomized controlled trial confirming its efficacy would be warranted."
