The investigators want to learn of there are patient-specific systemic metabolomic profiles (substances detected in blood or urine) that lower the risk for hypoglycemia. Metabolomic analyses will be used to discover biological markers that could predict who is most likely to get diabetes complications, and how these risks might be changed, for example, by developing treatments targeted specifically to those biological markers. The investigators also plan to describe the relationship between metabolomic profiles, psychosocial states and cognitive function."
