            "detailedDescription": "The Networked Neuroprosthesis(NNP) is an implantable, configurable neuromodulation platform that provides functional movement by the coordinated activation of peripheral neural pathways activating innervated paralyzed muscles, and sensing of physiological signals. The NNP-UE Configuration activates nerves of the upper extremity (arm and hand), and senses voluntary motion and/or electromyogram (EMG) in order to provide hand grasp.\n\nThe proposed work is focused on restoration of hand and reaching functions for people with cervical level spinal cord injury. For individuals who have sustained this injury, restoration of hand function is their top priority, and existing alternatives are limited. Neuroprosthesis are the most promising method for significant gain in hand and arm function."
