We will conduct a randomized clinical trial to compare a sample of 80 youth (ages 11 to 17) with migraine receiving the online tailored adherence intervention to 80 youth in an attention control group. We will test whether adherence to healthy habit (hydration, regular meals, exercise, sleep) recommendations serves as a mechanism for improved headache outcomes. Clinically meaningful outcomes will be assessed by reliable, valid, and sensitive measures. The primary outcome (i.e., number of headache days) will be assessed via online daily diary pre- and post-intervention, with additional follow-up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life and migraine disability."
