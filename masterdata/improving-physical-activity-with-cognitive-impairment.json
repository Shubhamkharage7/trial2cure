            "briefSummary": "Individuals with mild cognitive impairment are often physically inactive and at risk for progressing to dementia. Physical inactivity is considered a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Therefore, interventions must be developed to foster sustainable improvement in daily physical activity. To address this problem, our pilot study aims are directed at assessing the feasibility and preliminary improvement of physical activity following the use of a mobile-health technology physical activity behavior change intervention. Similar interventions have shown to be very effective in older adults without cognitive impairment. We specifically focus on the subtype of amnestic mild cognitive impairment since this subtype often progresses to Alzheimer's Disease, a leading cause of death in the US. Improving physical activity is one approach to reduce the progression to Alzheimer's Disease and subsequently lower mortality. To increase the impact of the intervention, participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment will be recruited along with a primary caregiver (dyads). Thirty dyads will be recruited and randomized to either an intervention group (15 dyads) or usual care group (15 dyads). The intervention group will receive a 12-week mobile-health technology physical activity behavior change intervention structured to improve physical activity. The intervention is unique in the combination of established behavior change theories and techniques and remote delivery for individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. This pilot study is designed to assess the feasibility of the intervention by examining participant and primary caregiver retention, intervention session attendance, intervention acceptability and safety, and qualitative perspectives. Secondly, this pilot study will assess preliminary improvement in physical activity (i.e., daily steps). Improvement will be determined based on significant changes in participants' daily steps observed via accelerometry post-intervention in the intervention group compared to the usual care control group. The results of this study will support future work (K-award and R01 submissions) to explore efficacy and larger-scale implementation to reach rural and underserved areas of Nebraska and beyond.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a telerehabilitation physical activity behavioral (TPAB) intervention for improving habitual physical activity in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n\nAmnestic MCI is considered a precursor to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the sixth leading cause of death in the US.1 Additionally, loss of independence and cognitive function is one of the most feared aspects of aging for older adults.2,3 One way to promote independence is through physical activity. Physical inactivity is highly reported in those with MCI4 and is a modifiable risk factor for those with dementia.5,6 Therefore, strategies to combat the loss of physical independence and cognition are of high economic and quality of life priority.\n\nHome-based physical activity behavior change methods have successfully improved physical activity in healthy older adults7-10 but have had limited use in individuals with MCI.11 This study will determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the TPAB intervention in individuals with amnestic MCI and caregivers to provide the groundwork to ascertain clinical implementation. In this randomized controlled clinical research study, we will assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the TPAB intervention in individuals with amnestic MCI. The TPAB intervention consists of 12 telerehabilitation sessions (30 min) over 12 weeks. Primary caregivers will be included during all intervention sessions based on dyadic approaches demonstrating higher physical activity invention success in individuals with MCI compared to individual recruitment.12 The TPAB intervention group will include 15 dyads of patients with amnestic MCI and their primary caregivers. The TPAB intervention is an evidence-based intervention designed to improve daily steps in older adults with medical complexities.13-15 It combines strategies such as problem-solving11, action planning16, and motivational interviewing17 that are evidenced to improve physical activity in individuals with MCI.11,16,17 The TPAB intervention will require a wearable sensor (Fitbit) and a home-based tablet/laptop to allow real-time activity feedback and video interface between participants and the interventionist. The TPAB intervention is novel in combining theories and techniques and remote delivery for individuals with amnestic MCI. The control (CTL) group will include 15 dyads of individuals with amnestic MCI and their primary caregivers that will receive usual care over the 12 weeks. Outcomes for both groups will be assessed before the intervention (baseline) and at the end of the intervention (POST). The specific aims are:\n\nAim 1: Determine the feasibility of the TPAB intervention for individuals with amnestic MCI and their primary caregivers by measuring 1) participant retention, 2) attendance, 3) acceptability (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory18), 3) safety (adverse event tracking), 4) semi-structured interviews.\n\nAim 2: Examine the preliminary effects of TPAB on physical activity engagement among MCI participants when compared with the CTL group.\n\nHypothesis 2.1: Individuals with amnestic MCI will make significant (p\\<0.05) gains in accelerometer-assessed (activPAL) physical activity (daily steps) from baseline to POST compared to the CTL group.\n\nClinical Impact: This study addresses two significant clinical gaps for amnestic MCI rehabilitation: 1) lack of evidence-based rehabilitation strategies to improve habitual physical activity; and 2) barriers to remotely promote habitual physical activity. Lastly, this project will bring together an interdisciplinary team (physical therapist (RH), exercise scientist (DE), and neuropsychologist (VP)) of investigators at Creighton University and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)."
