Intraoperative imaging will be performed using an intraoperative optical imaging devices and wide-field imaging devices.\n\nBack table imaging of the resection tissue (ex vivo) will be also performed with the wide-field device. Ex vivo imaging of the specimens prior to and during pathological assessment will be performed using the non-invasive, close field imaging device that does not violate or destroy the tissue. Additional imaging devices used solely on the back table are not included in this record, as the data is collected is not used for medical decisions and such devices are therefore not interventions.\n\nPediatric subjects will be followed for 30 days following their study infusion with scheduled follow up visits on the day of surgery (Day 1 5), Day 15, and Day 30."
