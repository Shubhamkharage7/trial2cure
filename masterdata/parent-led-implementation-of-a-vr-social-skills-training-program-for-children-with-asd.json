The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of treatment with Floreo Building Social Connections (BSC) on the AIM, a parent report survey that assesses core symptoms of ASD. The secondary objective is to explore the changes in social skills over time by using a multimethod outcomes battery. The Investigators will evaluate the effect of treatment with Floreo BSC on the Childhood Autism Rating Scales (CARS-2) in the study patient population. Additional secondary objectives include evaluation of the effects of treatment on adaptive skills as measured by the Vineland-3. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and utilize the VR program at clinic and at home."

Response options range from \"never\" to \"always\" for the frequency dimension and \"not at all\" to \"severely\" for the impact dimension.
