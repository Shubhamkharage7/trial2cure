            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, open-label navigational investigation designed to evaluate the feasibility of using molecular profile-based evidence to determine individualized cancer therapy for patients with aggressive malignancies. This is a non-randomized, histology-agnostic trial. Although there will be a case mix of histologies, the investigators now know that individual histologies are composed of a heterogeneous mix of molecular alterations. It is not clear whether one case mix is better or worse than another. Thus, the investigators are testing a strategy of molecular matching that may apply across different cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eligible and consented patients, if not already performed, will have their tumor tissues/blood molecularly profiled. Patients will be stratified into Group 1 (treatment na\u00efve, localized/unresectable/medically unfit for surgery), Group 2 (treatment na\u00efve, metastatic), and Group 3 (prior treated). Based on multiomic profiling, matched therapy, if available, will be recommended by the Molecular Tumor Board. Patients who receive the recommended matched therapy are designated to Arm A. Otherwise, those that receive the unmatched therapy (i.e., treating physician's choice of therapy) or have no molecular alterations are designated to Arm B. The study feasibility will be measured by the ability to enroll patients, the acceptable turnaround time and the actionable information obtained from multiomic profiling, and the viability of identifying and delivering the matched therapy."

Tissue and/or blood is to be procured based on clinical discretion and discussion with the patient.\n13. Pregnancy It is not known what effects matched therapy has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus. Therefore, female subjects participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male subjects should avoid impregnating a female partner. Non-sterilized female subjects of reproductive age and male subjects should use effective methods of contraception through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified below.\n\n    Female participants: A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n    * Not a female of childbearing potential (FCBP), defined as all female patients that were not in post-menopause for at least one year or are surgically sterile, OR\n    * An FCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test and agree to use at least one form of pregnancy prevention during the study for at least one month after treatment discontinuation unless otherwise noted by the agent(s) USPI or IB, which the FCBP must follow.\n\n    Male participants: A male participant, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy), must use a form of barrier pregnancy prevention approved by the investigator or treating physician during the study and for at least one month after treatment discontinuation and refrain from donating sperm during this period unless otherwise noted by the agent(s) U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI) or investigator's brochure (IB), which the male participant must follow.\n14. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.\n15. Patients presented at Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) up to two weeks prior to signing consent are eligible to be treated on study based on the MTB recommendations and do not need to be represented at MTB prior to starting therapy on trial (unless six months elapsed between consent and start of study treatment).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA potential study subject who meets any of the following exclusion criteria is ineligible to participate in the study.\n\n1. Two oncologists disagree on prognosis or resectability.\n2. Severe or uncontrolled medical disorder that would, in the investigator's opinion, confound study analyses of treatment response (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease or active, uncontrolled infection, psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements).\n3. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or any patient with childbearing potential not using adequate pregnancy prevention.\n4. Whole brain radiation or stereotactic radiotherapy to CNS metastases within 14 days prior to start of study treatment.",
