The goal is to characterize changes in performance to aging and task experience in a group of older subjects.\n\nIn Group B, the investigators will compare the performance of normal participants (N = 100, age range 18 to 89) on computerized and manually administered cognitive tasks.\n\nIn Group C, the investigators will gather normative data from participants across the age range (N = 100, ages 18 to 89) for three days at enrollment, to better characterize test-retest reliability scores on Day 1 tasks.\n\nIn Group D, the investigators will evaluate the performance of healthy older participants (N = 1200, age range 60 to 89 years) for three days at enrollment and then at 6-month intervals for three years thereafter. In the aim of better understanding health disparities in cognitive testing, this group will be divided into four cohorts: 300 African American participants; 300 Asian American participants; 300 Latino English-speaking participants; and 300 Latino Spanish-speaking participants, who will complete a Spanish translation of our computerized cognitive tests."
