Developing a patient decision aid may help patients with medullary thyroid cancer make well-informed decisions about their cancer care and be able to discuss their preferences with their doctors.",

To evaluate the acceptability and usability of the decision aid prototype from patients/survivors, caregivers and providers in a real world environment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants use decision aid and complete questionnaire."
