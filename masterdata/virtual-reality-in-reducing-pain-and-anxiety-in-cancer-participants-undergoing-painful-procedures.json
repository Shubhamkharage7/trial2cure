To estimate differences between the two arms in terms of pain and anxiety. II. To document any adverse events that could possibly be attributed to the VR intervention.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Explore the use of biomarkers as a tool to reflect the impact of intervention.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants undergo VR intervention peri-procedure (bone marrow biopsy or lumbar puncture) lasting until completion of the procedure.\n\nARM II: Participants receive standard of care during procedure (bone marrow biopsy or lumbar puncture)."

The headset will be attached by a wire to a laptop which will power the headset and provide content. A remote control will be available for assistance in setting up or stopping the content in the case of an event. The VR content will consist of meditation and relaxing techniques through visual and auditory input which can last up to one hour.
