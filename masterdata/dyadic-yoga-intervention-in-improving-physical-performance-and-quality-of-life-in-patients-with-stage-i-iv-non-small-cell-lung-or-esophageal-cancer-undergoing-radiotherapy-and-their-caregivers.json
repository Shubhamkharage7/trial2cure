            "briefSummary": "This trial studies how well dyadic yoga intervention works in improving physical performance and quality of life in patients with stage I-IV non-small cell lung or esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and their caregivers. Dyadic yoga intervention may help to improve physical function, fatigue, sleep difficulties, depressive symptoms, and overall quality of life for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and/or their caregivers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To examine the extent to which the yoga program improves patient physical performance (i.e., 6-minute walk test \\[6MWT\\]) as compared to the education group.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To examine the extent to which the yoga program improves patient and caregiver quality of life (QOL) (SF-36) compared to the education group.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore if, compared to the education group, the yoga program improves symptom burden, reduces inflammatory cytokine and cortisol rhythmicity dysregulation, and improves dyadic symptom management skills at the end of treatment, which will in turn mediate intervention outcomes at the subsequent follow-up assessments.\n\nII. To explore if baseline factors such as depressive symptoms moderate the treatment response. We also seek to explore if baseline factors such as depressive symptoms moderate the treatment response.\n\nQUALITATIVE OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To understand the patient and caregiver experience of cancer, cancer treatment, and experience in the behavioral interventions, and explore emerging themes as possible mediators. We would also like to understand participants feedback on participating in this intervention via mobile application (app) delivery.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients and caregivers are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients and caregivers undergo dyadic yoga intervention session involving physical exercises and relaxation techniques over 60 minutes each for up to 15 sessions.\n\nGROUP II: Patients and caregivers undergo dyadic education program session focusing on strategies of how to manage patient and caregiver symptoms over 60 minutes each for up to 15 sessions.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up every 2 weeks for 3 months and then every month for up to 6 months."
