The primary outcome will be biochemically (cotinine)-confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (PPA) at end of treatment (8 weeks). Secondary outcomes will be percent days smoke-free, time to relapse, and rated treatment satisfaction.\n\nAim 2 of this study is to explore sex/gender differences in treatment effects for smoking cessation. Given established sex/gender differences in smoking behavior and cessation,randomization will be stratified by sex/gender and we will measure effects of sex/gender on outcomes. Effect sizes will be estimated for smoking outcomes by sex.\n\nOutcomes will be evaluated for those who complete enrollment, defined as those who complete study onboarding."
