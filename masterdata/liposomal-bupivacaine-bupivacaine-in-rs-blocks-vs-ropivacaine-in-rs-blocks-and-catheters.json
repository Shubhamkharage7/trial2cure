This study will examine the difference in the highest, lowest, average, and current pain scores reported at the end of 24-48 postoperative hours using the brief pain inventory-short form (BPI-SF).\n\nParticipants will be randomized to either receive a single dose of liposomal bupivacaine/bupivacaine mixture intraoperatively at the end of surgery through bilateral rectus sheath blocks (LB/B group) or to receive the standard of care ropivacaine intraoperatively at the end of surgery through bilateral rectus sheath blocks with the insertion of bilateral RS catheter for continuous ropivacaine infusion plus repeated daily boluses (Catheter group; standard care). They will be assessed for a difference in postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, hospital and PACU length of stay, patient's satisfaction, and quality of recovery. Additionally, we will examine the resources consumed by each intervention, including the medication cost (ropivacaine vs. LB/bupivacaine mixture), block and catheter supply, hospital length of stay, and anesthesia billing time."
