            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of elamipretide in subjects with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The main questions it aims to answer are: what is the rate of change in the macular area of photoreceptor loss in subjects who receive a daily dose of elamipretide compared with those who receive a look-alike substance that contains no active drug, and what is the safety and tolerability of elamipretide daily subcutaneous injections. Participants will receive either once daily subcutaneous doses of 40mg elamipretide or placebo and the two treatment groups will be compared.",

Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to once daily SC doses of 40 mg elamipretide, or placebo for 96 weeks of treatment by a central randomization and stratified by SD-OCT device type (Heidelberg SPECTRALIS\u00ae, ZEISS CIRRUS\u00ae) and baseline macular area of photoreceptor loss, defined as an ellipsoid zone-retinal pigment epithelium (EZ-RPE) thickness of 0\u03bcm assessed by SD-OCT and ellipsoid zone (EZ) mapping (High Strata \u2265 5.1mm2, Low Strata \\<5.1mm2).\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* Evaluate the efficacy of once daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of elamipretide in subjects who have dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Secondary Objectives\n* Evaluate the safety and tolerability of once daily SC injections of elamipretide\n* Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of elamipretide and its metabolites"
