ADNI4 continues the previously funded ADNI1, ADNI-GO, ADNI2, and ADNI3 studies that have combined public/private collaborations between academia and industry to determine the relationships between the clinical, cognitive, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the entire spectrum of AD.",
            "detailedDescription": "The ADNI4 Study is a multi-center, non-randomized, natural history, non-treatment study. 1,150 participants will be enrolled across three cohorts: cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (DEM).\n\nParticipants between the ages of 55-90 (inclusive) will be enrolled at 59 sites in the United States and Canada. Approximately, 750 participants will be newly enrolled into the ADNI4 Study, while 750 participants will be rollover participants, continuing their participation from previous ADNI studies. Clinical/cognitive, imaging, biomarker, and genetic characteristics will be assessed across the three cohorts.\n\nParticipants enrolled in the ADNI4 Study will undergo longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessments, computerized cognitive batteries, biomarker and genetic tests, PET (amyloid and tau) and MRI scans and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collection for up to 5 years.\n\nFor more information, please visit the ADNI4 Study website: https://www.adni4.org/"

Research suggests that current perceived stress can affect neurocognitive functioning (Lupien et al., 2009). Thus, measuring current stress in the present study is an important element of study procedures. The PSS measures current stress levels and stressful experiences in the last month. It asks about experiences such as feeling in control of one's life, feeling the ability to be productive, feeling overwhelmed, and being upset by unexpected events (Cohen, Kamarck, \\& Mermelstein, 1983). These items are rated on a Likert scale of 1-5, with 1 representing \"Almost Always\" and 5 representing \"Almost Never.\" In scoring, the scale is reverse coded where appropriate, such that a low score is indicative of a lower level of perceived stress.",
