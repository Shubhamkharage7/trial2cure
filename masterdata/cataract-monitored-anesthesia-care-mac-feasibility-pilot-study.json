Participants will be asked to respond to several surveys throughout the study on their experience and to assess outcomes of interest.",

Participants having first eye cataract surgery will be randomized to receive an oral benzodiazepine (intervention) or an oral placebo pill (control). The primary goal of this study is to compare differences in patient satisfaction, quality of recovery and surgical outcomes in participants receiving oral sedation versus oral placebo for cataract surgery. The secondary goals of this study are to assess success with recruitment, intervention fidelity, adherence to interventions and participant retention after interventions. Participants will be asked to respond to several surveys at key study timepoints regarding their sedation experiences and to assess outcomes of interest."
