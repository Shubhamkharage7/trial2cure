            "detailedDescription": "The study population will consist of 50 participants with non-metastatic, early-stage invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Eligible patients will include those with a biopsy proven invasive breast cancer or DCIS, greater than or equal to 18 years of age, undergoing breast conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy at UW Health with an indication for WBI with tumor bed boost. Selection need for boost and radiation treatment field design and pre-tx imaging are at the discretion of the treating provider.\n\nAccrual will occur over 5 years at UW Health. Participants will complete 5 treatment visits and 7 study visits over the course of approximately 5.5 years. Research-related outcome measures - MD assessments (e.g., cosmesis) PROMs, and AEs -- will be assessed prior to treatment start, at the 6-week follow-up visit, as well as at 12-, 24-, 36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up visits. Study participation ends after completion of the 60-month follow-up visit.\n\nObjective\n\n\u2022 To assess two-year cosmetic outcomes in patients treated with ultra-short WBI with a SIB.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To assess PROMs via BREAST-Q in patients treated with ultra-short WBI with SIB.\n* To assess acute toxicities in patients treated with ultra-short WBI with SIB.\n* To assess late toxicities in patients treated with ultra-short WBI with SIB.\n* To assess ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence in patients treated with ultra-short WBI with SIB.\n* To assess overall survival (OS) in patients treated with ultra-short WBI with SIB."
