The treatment consists of standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) which is FDA approved and is standard treatment for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Participants will receive immunotherapy (cemiplimab) which activates the body's immune system to attack cancer cells. Cemiplimab is FDA approved for treatment of skin cancer but not for pancreas cancer. Participants will also receive Motixafortide, a new medication which has shown in the laboratory to help immunotherapy work better. Motixafortide has been tested together with immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab), and chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil and liposomal Irinotecan) and was deemed safe to test additional patients. Motixafortide has not been tested with the specific immunotherapy (Cemiplimab) and chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) which participants will receive and is being tested in this clinical trial.",

This is a Phase 2 open-label, multi-center study for patients with treatment-na\u00efve metastatic PDAC. The goal of the study is to assess the preliminary efficacy of a CXCR4 antagonist (motixafortide), (cemiplimab), gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel compared based on the response rate to historical controls in first line metastatic PDAC. Subjects will be treated with 5 days of motixafortide daily alone in the priming phase, followed by motixafortide twice a week, cemiplimab once every three weeks and and standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel)."

Grade \u2265 3 hemorrhage or bleeding event within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n24. Prior autologous stem cell, allogeneic stem cell, or solid organ transplantation\n25. History of other malignancy Patient may not have a history of malignancy other than PDAC within two years prior to screening, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5- year overall survival of \\> 90%), such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer.\n26. Recent vaccination: Patients may not have been treated with a live, attenuated vaccine within four weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipate the need for such a vaccine during treatment with cemiplimab or within five months after the last dose of cemiplimab.\n27. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n28. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drug excipients\n29. Recent immunosuppressive treatment: Patients may not have been treated with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, calcineurin inhibitors, and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents) within two weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipate the need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during the course of the study, with the following exceptions:\n\n    a. Patients who received a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication are eligible for the study after approval from the Principal Investigator.\n30. Pregnancy: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events to the fetus. Breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to start of treatment because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment.\n31. Other contraindicated conditions Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n32. Uncontrolled psoriasis, porphyria, proximal myopathy or neuropathy\n33. Severe depression Subjects hospitalized for depression within the past two years, or who have prior suicidal attempts will be excluded.\n34. Has received transfusions of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1.\n35. Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study if receiving equivalent to \u2264 10 mg of prednisone daily (10mg prednisone is equivalent to either cortisone - 50mg; hydrocortisone - 40mg; triamcinolone - 8mg; prednisolone - 10mg; methylprednisolone - 8mg; betamethasone - 1.5mg; or dexamethasone - 1.5mg). Patients receiving \\> 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for greater than five days within 28 days of starting study related therapy are not eligible. Steroids administered prior to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel should be administered as per standard institutional guidelines.",
