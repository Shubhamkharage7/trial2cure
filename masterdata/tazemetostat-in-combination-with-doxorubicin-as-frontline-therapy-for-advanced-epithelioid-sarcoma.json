Epithelioid sarcoma is an ultra-rare sarcoma of the soft-tissue.\n\nPart 1 of this trial will evaluate the safety and the level of the study drug that the study drug combinations can be tolerated (known as tolerability). It is also designed to establish a recommended study drug dosage for the next part of the study.\n\nPart 2 will evaluate and compare for each of the study drug combinations how long participants live without their disease getting worse.\n\nThe study drug is called tazemetostat. The study will test tazemetostat in combination with doxorubicin compared to placebo (dummy treatment) in combination with doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is a current front line treatment for epithelioid sarcoma",

The phase 3 portion of the clinical trial aims to compare tazemetostat + doxorubicin to the current front-line standard treatment, single-agent doxorubicin + placebo, when used as first-line treatment in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic ES."
