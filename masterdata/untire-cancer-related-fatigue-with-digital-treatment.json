            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm, pilot study evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a self-managed digital therapeutic application, the Untire App, for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue in the Colorectal (CRC) cancer patient community.\n\nThe Untire app was developed by Psychology Oncologists and combines proven treatments for Cancer Related Fatigue like cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness exercises, physical activities, education, and positive tips. The Untire app helps a patient recognize and learn about daily behaviors, fatigue levels, and energy levels. The Untire app has been tested on all different cancer types globally and has been proven to decrease fatigue and improve overall quality of life but this is the first-time investigators are examining the strengths and weaknesses of using the Untire app as a digital treatment plan for Cancer Related Fatigue.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study interventions including smartphone app use and evaluations with questionnaires and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will be in this research study for up to 12 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 60 people will take part in this research study."
