            "detailedDescription": "Firearms are the leading cause of death for U.S. youth; 60% due to homicide. This study will test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention at reducing risky firearm behaviors among a high-risk community sample of youth (age 16-24) that report past 3-month firearm carriage and smartphone ownership. The behavioral intervention consists of 3 remotely delivered therapy sessions integrating motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and care management (CM), supported by a smartphone APP that facilitates therapist contact, conducts automated daily assessments, delivers between session tailored therapy content, delivers just-in-time Global Positioning System (GPS)-triggered notifications upon entry into high-risk locations, and aids with utilization of local resources. Recruitment will proceed in two high-risk communities (Flint, Saginaw), including through the main Emergency Departments/trauma centers that are located in both cities. Given elevated rates of firearm violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to community services, the proposed intervention, if found to be efficacious, has the potential for significant public health impact."
