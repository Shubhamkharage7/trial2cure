            "briefSummary": "Studies indicate that up to 75% of women will experience pain sometime during their pregnancy. Recent recommendations by the FDA recommended that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS) medications be avoided during pregnancy. This recommendation limits the pain medications available for use during pregnancy.\n\nAntidotal evidence suggests that the FDA cleared Soovu pulsed heat device may produce pain relief during pregnancy. This study tests the Soovu device's ability to provide pain relief during pregnancy and up to one month post-partum and may eventually offer a safe nondrug option to treat pregnancy related pain.\n\nThis is an observational pilot study\n\nThe primary objective and hypothesis of this study is that the use of the Soovu pain management device will produce a significant reduction of pain when comparing pre versus post treatment pain.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pain associated with pregnancy occurs in approximately 60 to 70% of women. The mechanism of action of pulsed heat and TRPV-1 blockade is expected to be relevant in this population based on the etiology of their pain, and should help reduce their pain. In addition, there have been several pregnant women who have used the device to treat their pain associated with pregnancy. Their use was driven partly based on the FDA's recommendation to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications limiting medication options. Based on these antidotal experiences and feedback, as well as the device's mechanism of action, this study is proposed.\n\nThe study is a pilot observational study that will provide results to support a larger more rigorous and involved clinical trial.\n\n1. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the Soovu Pain Relief device is effective in reducing pain associated with pregnancy in the 2nd and 3rd trimester and in the first month postpartum.\n2. The secondary objectives include testing whether the study device reduces the effects of pain on physical function and the satisfaction and opinions of both subjects and providers on the effectiveness and usability of the study device. Subjects will also be asked about and needed pain medication use and their experience with the device if they used it during delivery.\n\nStudy design This is a single center nonrandomized non blinded pilot study on the effects of the Soovu Pain Relief device in pregnancy associated pain. 25-35 subjects are planned in the study which covers the 2nd and 3rd trimester and one month post-partum. Subjects will be referred to the study by their care providers or via posters in the clinic. Each subject who enters the study will receive a Soovu Pain Relief device with instructions on its use. All subjects will continue to receive their usual care. There are no visits associated with involvement in the study. Subjects can elect to use the device to treat their pain during the study and will record their pain level pre and post use. The data is collected via the phone app that controls the device. Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.\n\nThe total duration of the study is expected to be 14 months. 6-7 months for subject recruitment and 7 months for final subject follow-up.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is the difference between the numerical pain score (0-10) pretreatment versus post treatment. Pain relief is the primary outcome measure as related to the study pain management device.\n\nSecondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints include whether the study device reduces the effects of pain on physical function and the satisfaction and opinions of both subjects and providers on the effectiveness and usability of the study device. The physical function questionnaire is a well validated instrument form the PROMIS outcome library and is a measure of function not necessarily pain. The usability and satisfaction evaluations help determine subject and provider acceptance of the device and can lead to product improvements.\n\nThe primary outcomes measure is pain level pre versus post treatment with the Soovu Device on a 0-10 point numeric scale. The data will be modeled as a repeated measures ordinal regression (primary choice), or a repeated measures model on a continuous response.\n\nAnalysis of Secondary Endpoints Changes on the PROMIS pain interference short form measure given on a monthly basis during the study will be analyzed using a Anova repeated measures technique.\n\nSubject satisfaction with the experimental Soovu device at monthly intervals and one month post-partum if indicated (Likert scale) will be tabulated and represented as a mean value with standard deviations. Subjects will also be asked whether they needed any supplemental pain medications and the name or type of medications.\n\nProvider assessment and opinions of device (Likert scale) at study conclusion and one month post-partum. The results will be tabulated and represented as a mean value with standard deviations."
