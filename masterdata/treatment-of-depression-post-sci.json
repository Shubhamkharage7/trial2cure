            "briefSummary": "Depression is more common after a spinal cord injury (SCI) than in the general population. Unfortunately, it is unknown how depression is typically treated in individuals with SCI or if commonly used treatment methods are effective. This study will investigate the safety and impact of a novel method for treating depression called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation. Fourteen individuals with a cervical or thoracic level SCI and depression will complete an approved treatment plan using rTMS. Participants will be treated using rTMS five days a week for four weeks. After four weeks of treatment, the study team will review the safety of rTMS and assess changes in depressive symptoms. If the results are positive, larger studies can be designed to develop better treatment options for individuals with SCI and depression."
