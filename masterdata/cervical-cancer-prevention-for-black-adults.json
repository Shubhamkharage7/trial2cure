            "detailedDescription": "In phase 1, the investigators will conduct a cross-sectional survey with 150 Black men and women to examine factors impacting cervical cancer screening. Also, as part of phase 1, Aim 2 employs focus groups and a quantitative Health Belief Model checklist with 30 participants to guide development of a tailored intervention. In phase 2, Aim 3 will assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Health is Wealth: A Cervical Health Program intervention among 30 African American and 30 Sub-Saharan African immigrant women."
