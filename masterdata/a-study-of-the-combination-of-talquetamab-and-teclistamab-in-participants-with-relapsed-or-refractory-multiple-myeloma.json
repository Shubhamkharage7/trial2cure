            "detailedDescription": "Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by production of monoclonal proteins (M proteins), which are comprised of pathologic immunoglobulins (Ig) or fragments of such, which have subsequently lost their normal function. Rationale for combining talquetamab and teclistamab is the targeting of multiple proteins on the surface of multiple myeloma cells resulting in cell lysis. This study consists of 3 periods: screening phase (up to 28 days), treatment phase (start of study drug administration and continues until the completion of the end of treatment \\[EOT\\] visit); and a post-treatment follow-up phase (after end of treatment and up to 16 weeks after last dose of study drug(s) for each participant). End of study is defined as 2 years after the last participant has received his or her initial dose of the treatment combination. Total duration of study is Approximately 5 years. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points during this study. Participants safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study."
