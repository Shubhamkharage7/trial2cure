            "detailedDescription": "Visit 1:\n\nAfter reviewing and signing consent, subjects will be screened for the study. Screening will consist of the following:\n\n* Complete International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire.\n* Record medical history, concomitant medications\n* Measure height and weight, calculate BMI\n* Vitals\n* Draw blood for total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone\n* Query subject regarding the presence of genital rash or lesions. Subjects will be asked, \"do you have a rash or lesion on your penis or surrounding area?\"\n\nIf the IIEF score is abnormal, subjects will be advised to contact their primary care provider.\n\nEach subject will be contacted by phone with their blood results. If abnormal subject will be given the recommendation to contact his primary care provider.\n\nIf an abnormal finding is identified during screening, such as an abnormal STOP-bang score, subject will be given the recommendation to contact his primary care provider.\n\nIf the subject has no primary care provider, contact information for primary care will be given.\n\nSubjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study, into either Sequence One or Sequence Two. Once enrolled, subjects will be asked to not modify their dietary habits throughout the duration of the study other than during the two evenings and two full days when food is provided (see below).\n\nSequence One:\n\nVisit 2:\n\nSubjects will return to the study center in the morning after having fasted (other than consuming water) since 11pm the night before. They will have been asked to not brush their teeth or use mouthwash and/or other breath fresheners that morning. Anthropomorphic and blood pressure and heart rate recordings will be made. Saliva will be stored for NO measurement. Blood will be drawn and stored. Urine will be collected and stored.\n\nSubjects will be taught how to use the Rigiscan\u2122 device. Subjects will receive one plant-based dinner (food will be provided by Montefiore-Einstein Food Services.) Subjects will then leave the study center and they will consume their usual diet until 5pm. For the rest of the evening until 11pm they will consume only the dinner provided. Water will be the only beverage allowed after 5pm. Dinner should be consumed at 8:30pm EST. Subjects will text pictures of everything they consume (eat or drink) after 5pm to Dr. Ostfeld or to a study representative and s/he will have text or verbal contact with the subject at least once that evening. That night, subjects will do a Rigiscan\u2122 assessment overnight at their home. The time the subject goes to bed and the time the subject wakes up for the day should be recorded. The subject agrees to be in bed with Rigiscan\u2122 on (other than for emergency or needed trips to the bathroom) for at least seven hours.\n\nVisit 3 Subjects will return to the study center the morning after the Rigiscan\u2122 assessment and bring the Rigiscan\u2122 device with them. They will have been fasting other than drinking water since 11pm the night before. They will have been asked to not brush their teeth or use mouthwash and/or other breath fresheners that morning. Anthropomorphic and blood pressure and heart rate recordings will be taken. Saliva will be stored for NO measurement. Blood will be drawn and stored. Urine will be collected and stored.\n\nSubjects will then receive one full day of plant-based meals (food will be provided by Montefiore-Einstein Food Services.) Subjects will be encouraged to eat breakfast at the study center after the initial anthropomorphic measures are made, saliva is obtained, and blood is drawn. Subjects will text pictures of all they consume during that day to Dr. Ostfeld and/or to a study representative and s/he will have text or verbal contact with the subject at least twice during that day. Dinner should be consumed at 8:30pm, EST. Subjects will fast other than water after 11pm. That night, subjects will do a Rigiscan\u2122 assessment overnight at their home. Black coffee and/or tea is permitted only before noon. The time the subject goes to bed and the time the subject wakes up for the day should be recorded. The subject agrees to be in bed with Rigiscan\u2122 on (other than for emergency or needed trips to the bathroom) for at least seven hours.\n\nVisit 4 Subjects will return to the study center the morning after the Rigiscan\u2122 assessment and bring the Rigiscan\u2122 device with them. They will have been asked to not brush their teeth or use mouthwash and/or other breath fresheners that morning. Anthropomorphic and blood pressure and heart rate recordings will be taken. Saliva will be stored for NO measurement. Blood will be drawn and stored. Urine will be collected and stored.\n\nThere will then be a washout period for 8-12 days and subjects will be instructed to return to their usual dietary habits during this washout period. Number of days of the washout period will be recorded.\n\nVisit 5 After the washout period, subjects will return to the study center in the morning after having fasted (other than consuming water) since 11pm the night before. They will have been asked to not brush their teeth or use mouthwash and/or other breath fresheners that morning. Anthropomorphic and blood pressure and heart rate recordings will be taken. Saliva will be stored for NO measurement. Blood will be drawn and stored. Urine will be collected and stored.\n\nSubjects will receive one animal-based dinner (food will be provided by Montefiore-Einstein Food Services.) Subjects will then leave the study center and they will consume their usual diet until 5pm. For the rest of the evening until 11pm they will consume only the dinner provided. Water will be the only beverage consumed after 5pm. Dinner should be consumed at 8:30pm, EST. Subjects will text pictures of all they consume (eat or drink) after 5pm to Dr. Ostfeld or to a study representative and s/he will have text or verbal contact with the subject at least once that evening.

The time the subject goes to bed and the time the subject wakes up for the day should be recorded. The subject agrees to be in bed with Rigiscan\u2122 on (other than for emergency or needed trips to the bathroom) for at least seven hours.\n\nVisit 6 Subjects will return to the study center the morning after the Rigiscan\u2122 assessment and bring the Rigiscan\u2122 device with them. They will have been asked to not brush their teeth or use mouthwash and/or other breath fresheners that morning. Anthropomorphic and blood pressure and heart rate recordings will be taken. Saliva will be stored for NO measurement. Blood will be drawn and stored. Urine will be collected and stored.\n\nSubjects will then receive one full day of animal-based meals (food will be provided by Montefiore-Einstein Food Services.)

The subject agrees to be in bed with Rigiscan\u2122 on (other than for emergency or needed trips to the bathroom) for at least seven hours.\n\nVisit 7 (End of Study) Subjects will return to the study center the morning after the Rigiscan\u2122 assessment and bring the Rigiscan\u2122 device with them. They will have been asked to not brush their teeth or use mouthwash and/or other breath fresheners that morning. Anthropomorphic and blood pressure and heart rate recordings will be taken. Saliva will be stored for NO measurement. Blood will be drawn and stored. Urine will be collected and stored.\n\nSequence Two:\n\nSequence Two is identical to Sequence One, except that the order of the plant-based and animal-based meals is reversed."
