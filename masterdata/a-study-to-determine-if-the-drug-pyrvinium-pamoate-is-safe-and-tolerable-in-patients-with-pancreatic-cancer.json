To determine the safety and tolerability of pyrvinium pamoate (PP), dosed orally, in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that are surgical candidates.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assessment of PP's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile and bioavailability in humans.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients receive pyrvinium pamoate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 3 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care surgery.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every week for up to 4 weeks."
