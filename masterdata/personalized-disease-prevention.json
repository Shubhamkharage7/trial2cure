The study seeks to enroll 600 patients and 60 primary care providers. Half of providers will be assigned to an intervention to utilize the decision tool with approximately 10 high-priority patients each (patients of particular interest to the research study, on whom follow-up outcomes will be collected), and half will be assigned to usual care.\n\nSurveys will be administered at baseline and approximately 6 months later; electronic health records data on preventive service utilization will be collected; and optional qualitative interviews may be conducted.",

Half of providers will be assigned to an intervention to utilize the decision tool with approximately 10 high-priority patients each (patients of particular interest to the research study, on whom follow-up outcomes will be collected) and half will be assigned to usual care. It is hypothesized that quality-adjusted life expectancy will increase by more in high-priority patients who receive the intervention, as compared with a control group.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary objective: To measure whether use of individualized preventive care recommendations is likely to help patients live a longer, healthier life.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n1. To measure whether use of individualized preventive care recommendations is likely to help patients live a longer life\n2. To assess comprehension of the decision tool\n3. To assess readiness to change\n4. To assess use of shared decision-making\n5. To measure outcomes for specific preventive services"

            "eligibilityCriteria": "Provider eligibility criteria. Any attending physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant practicing in internal medicine or family medicine.\n\nPatient eligibility criteria. This study define 2 types of patients, \"eligible\" patients and \"high-priority\" patients. \"Eligible\" patients are a broadly-defined group of patients of the intervention arm providers, for whom the providers will be able to access individualized preventive care recommendations. Eligible patients are subject to a waiver of informed consent. \"High-priority\" patients are a more narrowly-defined subset of eligible patients, who will be contacted by the study team for follow-up.\n\nEligible patients will have the following inclusion criteria:\n\n1. A provider assigned to the intervention arm of the RCT is the patient's primary care physician (PCP) of record in the EHR.\n2. Aged 40-75 years.\n\nHigh-priority patients are defined as eligible patients who also meet all of the following inclusion criteria:\n\n1. A modifiable lifestyle factor with a large impact on quality-adjusted life expectancy, assessed by \u22651 of the following:\n\n   1. current smoker\n   2. BMI \u226530.0 kg/m\\^2\n   3. BP \u2265140/90 mmHg\n   4. 10-year ASCVD risk \u226510%\n   5. HbA1c \u22659%\n   6. alcohol/week \\>4.2 oz (98 g) for female or \\>8.4 oz (196 g) for male\n2. Eligible for a high number of preventive services, assessed by \u22653 of the following. Factor(s) used to satisfy criteria 1 also count toward satisfying criteria 2:\n\n   1. current smoker\n   2. BMI \u226527.0 kg/m\\^2\n   3. systolic BP \\>130 mmHg\n   4. 10-year ASCVD risk \u22657.5%\n   5. HbA1c \u22657.5%\n   6. alcohol/week \\>4.2 oz (98 g) for female or \\>8.4 oz (196 g) for male\n   7. Overdue or due soon for colorectal cancer screening, as of date that study team confirms \"high-priority\" eligibility criteria\n   8. Overdue or due soon for lung cancer screening, as of date that study team confirms \"high-priority\" eligibility criteria\n   9. Overdue for breast cancer screening for \u22651 year, as of date that study team confirms \"high-priority\" eligibility criteria\n   10. Overdue for osteoporosis screening for \u22651 year, as of date that study team confirms \"high-priority\" eligibility criteria\n3. Ongoing primary care in the health system, defined as \u22652 visits with a primary care provider in the prior 730 days.\n\n   1. The term \"primary care provider\" is defined as an attending physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant in the Department of Internal Medicine or Department of Family Medicine with an established patient panel.\n   2. The term \"visit\" is defined as an in-person or virtual visit encounter.\n4. An eligible encounter with the patient's primary care physician (PCP) of record in the EHR. \"Eligible encounter\" is defined as follows:\n\n   1. An annual wellness visit (sometimes called a physical) with scheduled length of 40 minutes, or for some practice sites or departments, 30 minutes. These encounters typically focus on preventive care and are more likely to allow enough time to engage in shared decision-making.\n   2. For patients without an annual wellness visit in the prior 2 years, a visit with scheduled length at least 30 minutes, or a shorter length directly related to at least one service relevant to the research study (e.g., the EHR notes field indicates that a patient is scheduled for a follow-up of hypertension).\n\nEligible patients have the following exclusion criteria, defined as \u22651 of the following:\n\n1. Cancer in the past 3 years (other than non-melanoma skin)\n2. Diagnosis of alcohol abuse in past 3 years\n3. History of myocardial infarction\n4. History of stroke\n5. End-stage renal disease\n6. Moderate-severe congestive heart failure (moderate-severe may be ignored if needed to facilitate automatic data extraction)\n7. Moderate-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (moderate-severe may be ignored if needed to facilitate automatic data extraction)\n8. Other comorbidity with limited life expectancy, in the opinion of \u22652 members of the study team.\n9. Inability to communicate or limited communication (speaking, reading, writing) in the English language.\n\nIn addition to the above, high-priority eligible patients also have the following exclusion criteria, defined as \u22651 of the following:\n\n1. Known current pregnancy.\n2. Known acute care need that is likely to limit time available for discussion of preventive care.\n3. The first primary care encounter since a hospitalization, surgery or emergency department utilization.\n\nThere will be no exclusion from the study on the basis of race or ethnicity.",
