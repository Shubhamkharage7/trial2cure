            "briefSummary": "Researchers are creating real-time epidemiology registry to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 subject risk assessment scores based on recording of symptoms, biomarkers, chronic illness and mental health assessments with digital technology using wearables and mobile app tools. Researchers aim to study in Phase 1, epidemiological variations in COVID-19 presentation in both PCR positive and negative subjects in the registry. Assessment of variables, predictive modeling of variables that impact severity of COVID-19 positive and negative subjects and assessment of predictors for post COVID-19 complications. In Phase 2, 2700 subjects with COVID-19 positive test will be studied in the intervention group comparing ECL-19 vs placebo with primary end point of hospital admission assessment. Treatment strategy for PCR positive COVID-19 subjects in the registry who are in Stage I of the disease process with ECL-19 drug compared to placebo in reducing hospital admissions",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators aim is to create a real time COVID-19 Coromec epidemiology registry to assess the feasibility of monitoring subject infection progress using Vitalbeat digital therapeutics monitoring platform for remote patient monitoring and integrated chronic disease management with mobile app, AI-bot, IoT wearables and cloud computing algorithms developed by health technology company Aventyn, Inc., in collaboration with Intel Corp., clinicians and scientists from Baylor Heart, Abrazo Health, Karolinska Institute, Dignity Health. Coromec registry is a real time epidemiology solution deploying Vitalbeat for pandemic public health stakeholders to enable immediate reporting, assess subject risk prediction for COVID-19 avoiding hospitalization.\n\nThe digital health technology aims to assess predictors of risk and predictors of preventing COVID-19, assess what preventive strategies are being used and the efficacy of treatment strategies for avoiding hospitalization. The platform launched globally and is available on the public internet at www.coromec.org\n\nUsers can self-report symptoms, mental health assessment, chronic illness status and vital sign measures on a daily basis for risk assessment and preventive treatment with a variety of digital tools by downloading Coromec mobile app, access interactive chatbots and the Coromec real time epidemiology website Researchers aim to study ECL-19 as a drug treatment in stabilizing the endothelium as the first line of approach in COVID 19 positive subjects that may quickly restore their glycocalyx and endothelium thus avoiding hospitalizations and progression of disease with ECL-19\n\nA validated approach would enable vulnerable subjects and communities access to pandemic care. Registry data can assist public health scientists in further studies and enable global registries in future pandemic emergencies to help better understand use of digital tools, intelligent algorithms and predict risk outcomes with targeted novel treatment strategies"
