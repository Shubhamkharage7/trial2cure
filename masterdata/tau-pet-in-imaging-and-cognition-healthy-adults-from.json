            "briefSummary": "The investigators aim to use the new PET radioligand, 18F-MK-6240, to detect tau pathology in cognitive healthy and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) elders. The investigators will then examine the interactions between differential tau burden and performance on cognitive tasks, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural activation patterns, and other cognitive and behavioral measures. By investigating these relationships, the investigators hope to understand the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of tau deposition found in specific brain regions in cognitively normal/mildly cognitively impaired adults. Furthermore, the study aims to examine how the presence of tau may contribute to the risk of subsequent cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and dementia.",
            "detailedDescription": "Many cognitively healthy older adults have, upon post mortem evaluations, been found to have varying amounts of neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and beta-amyloid plaque deposits, which are the hallmark brain pathologies known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease and various other dementias. While some with these pathologies may not clinically express cognitive decline or dementia in their lifetime, human post-mortem studies suggest that increasing neurofibrillary tangle density correlates with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.\n\nImaging tauopathy in-vivo provides an opportunity to examine neurocognitive correlates of differential levels of tauopathy in the brain, allowing to further qualify pre-clinical states of cognitive impairment. The investigators aim to investigate possible protective mechanisms, such as cognitive reserve, that may modulate the relationship between tauopathy and cognitive decline."
