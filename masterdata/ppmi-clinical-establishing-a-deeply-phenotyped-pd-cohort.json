Participants in PPMI may be asked to be enrolled in other PPMI program protocols, but depending on their method of recruitment, participants may be enrolled sequentially in varying order, as appropriate. PPMI participants may also be asked to participate in additional PPMI program initiatives (as they are developed), which may only involve a subset of PPMI participants based on their cohort designation and/or site location."

Confirmation that participant is eligible based on \\*Screening SPECT imaging.\n\n   * Screening SPECT Imaging eligibility:\n\nBased on the results of the SPECT imaging test, Prodromal participants eligible to continue their participation in PPMI Clinical will be asked to return for their PPMI Clinical baseline visit. Neither the participant nor the site investigator will be made aware of the participant's DAT status during the study.\n\n* It is anticipated that approximately 6,000 participants will complete a screening visit to undergo DAT imaging. Approximately 2,000 participants will be eligible to continue their participation in PPMI Clinical (those not eligible to proceed will remain in PPMI Remote, as applicable).\n* All participants with DAT deficit will be eligible to continue their participation in PPMI Clinical. It is estimated that about 75% of eligible participants will have a DAT deficit (defined by a hybrid of visual assessment and quantitative striatal specific binding analysis).\n* Some participants without DAT deficit will also be eligible to continue their participation in PPMI Clinical. These participants will be chosen based on DAT binding that is reduced from age expected but it not outside the normal range and/or from individuals with high-risk of PD including RBD, LRRK2, GBA, SNCA, or rare genetic variants (such as Parkin or Pink1) that do not demonstrate DAT deficit. It is estimated that about 25% of eligible participants will not have a DAT deficit.\n* It is anticipated that approximately 30% of the PPMI Clinical prodromal participants with DAT deficit will phenoconvert to motor parkinsonism during a 3 to 5-year follow-up.\n\n7.5.2 Exclusion Criteria (Prodromal)\n\n1. Clinical diagnosis of PD at screening, other parkinsonism, or dementia.\n2.

Any other medical or psychiatric condition or lab abnormality, which in the opinion of the investigator might preclude participation.\n6. Currently taking levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, amantadine or another PD medication, except for low-dose treatment of restless leg syndrome (with permission of medical monitor).\n7. Has taken levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors or amantadine within 60 days of Baseline visit. except for low-dose treatment of restless leg syndrome (with permission of medical monitor).\n8.
