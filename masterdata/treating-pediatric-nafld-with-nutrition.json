            "detailedDescription": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in children, estimated to be present in 5-10% of all children in the United States. NAFLD is a growing cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is not yet an FDA approved treatment for NAFLD. Guidelines recommend improvement in diet at the first line of treatment; however, there is no consensus as to what that diet should be. General health guidelines recommend nonfat or low fat dairy over whole dairy after age 2. Limited studies have suggested that whole dairy may be better for people with NAFLD.\n\nThis study will test the effect of whole dairy on liver fat in children age 10-17 with NAFLD. As a baseline, the investigators will measure liver fat (using MRI) at 2 time points separated by 12 weeks to establish the current amount of liver fat. The children will be instructed to incorporate 2 \u00bd servings of whole dairy (as milk and/or yogurt provided by the study will provide) into their daily diet. After 12 weeks, the investigators will measure liver fat with MR and labs to assess safety and further evaluate the liver."
