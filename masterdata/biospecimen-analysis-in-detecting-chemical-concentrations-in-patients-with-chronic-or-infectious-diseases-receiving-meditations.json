Wearable sweat sensors are capable of monitoring electrolytes and metabolites (sodium, potassium, glucose, lactate, etc.) for health monitoring and disease diagnosis. Designing wearable sweat sensors capable of providing information regarding drug administration may be challenging due to ultralow concentrations in biofluids. This trial seeks to determine if the use of a smart wristband can accurately measure the levels of chemicals and substances in sweat.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare novel, home-based methods of quantitating medication concentrations in either saliva or sweat to the 'gold standard' of liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry of plasma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare novel home-based methods of quantitating substances in either saliva or sweat to the 'gold standard' in plasma.\n\nII. Assess the ease of obtaining home-based samples.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of sweat samples via Macroduct Sweat Collection System 3710S and saliva and blood samples within 24 hours after medication administrations. Patients also complete questionnaires over 5-10 minutes and have medical charts reviewed.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up periodically."
