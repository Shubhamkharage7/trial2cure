The researchers want to find out whether PET/MRI scans done after the injection of this investigational tracer are more accurate than the usual imaging scans used to locate deposits of prostate tumor cells. The researchers will study how the tracer travels through your body and where it is distributed. This study is the first time that this tracer will be used in people who are undergoing surgery for prostate cancer."
