            "briefSummary": "The overall goal of this research is to test a new model of speech motor learning, whose central hypothesis is that learning and retention are associated with plasticity not only in motor areas of the brain but in auditory and somatosensory regions as well.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1 involves tests of speech motor memory retention following disruption of left hemisphere brain activity in either auditory, somatosensory or motor cortex or to a control site (hand area motor cortex right hemisphere). Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) is delivered following adaptation to altered auditory feedback to assess its effects on the retention of new learning.\n\nAim 2 assesses the temporal order in which plasticity occurs in cortical motor and sensory brain areas during speech motor learning.\n\nIn Aim 3, resting-state fMRI will be interleaved with speech motor adaptation. For information specific to each aim, please refer to the below corresponding, separate, clinicaltrials.gov records: unique IDs: 2000037622_a for Aim 1, 2000037622_b for Aim 2 and 2000037622_c for Aim 3."
