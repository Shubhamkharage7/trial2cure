The model, is currently implemented at the UAMS, but as of yet to be adapted for Pacific Islanders. Centering Pregnancy replaces the individual prenatal care visit with a group model for obstetrically low-risk women. This model provides substantially more health promotion content than the traditional one-on-one prenatal care model. The intervention occurs from week 14 of pregnancy through birth, following the same same schedule as individual care. Group visits are 90-120 minutes each and follow a unique structured curriculum that incorporates standards of care. In the group setting, credentialed prenatal providers conduct a one-on-one assessment with each patient (30 min) and then facilitate group discussions on the topics of pregnancy, using adult learning principles (60-90 min).",
