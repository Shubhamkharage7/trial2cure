SNAP includes two sessions with a needs assessment and tailored care plan and a supportive mobile app after completion of radiation to promote uptake of recommended medical and supportive care. The study aims to evaluate the effects of SNAP on symptom severity in patients and caregiver burden in caregivers. Secondary outcomes include psychological distress (anxiety and depression), healthcare utilization (receipt of recommended care) and unmet needs and self-efficacy in HNC survivor-caregiver dyads. Participants will complete surveys at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months post randomization with validated PROMs, and receive intervention modules at the end of radiation and month 3. Participants in the SNAP group will also receive mobile app support.",
            "detailedDescription": "The SNAP Intervention includes two care planning modules, a caregiver visit (module I) during the end of radiation treatment and a dyad-focused (survivor and caregiver) visit (module II) at 3 months. Each SNAP module includes 3 components including: 1) an in-clinic needs assessment, 2) a tailored care plan and 3) text-based e-monitoring at home. In both modules, a care plan is generated with algorithm-triggered messages and referrals to recommended care matched to endorsed concerns. Care plans are reviewed and barriers are addressed. Referrals are finalized with an Advanced Practice Provider (APP). SNAP Participants leave with a personalized binder including the survivorship care plan and referrals. SNAP Participants use an e-monitoring App and receive twice weekly engagement prompts for 6 weeks. Usual Care (UC) participants will receive caregiver education and dyadic survivorship education visit at the end of radiation treatment and 3-months post-randomization, respectively, with printed materials from the National Cancer Institute."

Care plans and referrals are reviewed with an Advanced Practice Provider. Barriers to uptake are addressed, goal-oriented action planning is refined with brief mobile app training.
