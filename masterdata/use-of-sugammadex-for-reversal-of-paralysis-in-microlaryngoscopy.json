Group 1 will receive reversal with neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg)\n\nGroup 2: Inhaled anesthetics: sevoflurane at 1 MAC, remifentanil and intubation with rocuronium at 0.6 -1.2 mg/kg (vitals maintained within 20% of baseline). Group 2 will receive reversal with sugammadex 4mg/kg\n\nBoth groups will receive standard anti-nausea prophylaxis - Ondansetran and Decadran intraoperative.\n\nAfter induction, the amount of inhaled anesthetic and remifentanil used will be titrated based on hemodynamic parameters (maintained within 20% from baseline) and a BIS monitor.\n\nAll subjects will have TOF testing done every 5 minutes throughout the procedure and tabulated in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).\n\nAt the end of the procedure patient will be extubated when the subject meets the following criteria:\n\nTidal volume : \\> 5 cc /Kg Respiratory rate: \\>8 /min O2sat \\> 95% ON 100% inspired oxygen\n\nWith vitals at 20% of baseline. Extubation will begin when the surgeon states, \"We are done\". This usually coincides with the withdrawal of the scope. The start and end times for extubation will be recorded in the Electronic Medical Record.\n\nThe PACU nurses will evaluate ALDRETE discharge criteria and make a note in the electronic medical records for the subject discharge time from PACU. The nurses in PACU will be the only evaluators of the subject who will be blinded to the two groups"
