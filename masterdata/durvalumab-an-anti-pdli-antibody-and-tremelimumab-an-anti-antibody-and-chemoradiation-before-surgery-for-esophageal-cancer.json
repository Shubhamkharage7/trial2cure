The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this combination has on the patient and cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients will undergo a baseline PET/CT scan prior to receiving mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy (bolus 5-fluorouracil or -FU 400 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 70-85 mg/m2 and infusional 5-FU 1,200 mg/m2/day \u00d746 hours) q14 days \u00d72, followed by repeat PET scan.\n\nTwo weeks after the second dose of mFOLFOX6, patients receive 1 dose of durvalumab 1,500 mg. and tremelimumab 300 mg. Two weeks later, all patients will initiate radiation (1.8 Gy/fraction \u00d723 fractions Monday through Friday for total dose of 41 Gy). PET responders receive concurrent chemotherapy with oxaliplatin 70-85 mg/m2 q14 days \u00d73 doses with either infusional 5-FU 300 mg/m2/day \u00d796 hours or capecitabine 825 mg/m2 BID Monday through Friday throughout the radiation period. PET non-responders receive concurrent carboplatin AUC 2/paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 weekly \u00d75 with concurrent. All patients receive a second dose of durvalumab 1,500 mg q28 days after the first dose.\n\nPatients undergo surgical resection 6-10 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. In the adjuvant setting, patients who have undergone R0 resections will receive tremelimiumab 300 mg \u00d71 and durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks \u00d76 doses starting within 12 weeks of surgery.\n\nRadiation will be administered starting \u226514 days after the first durvalumab treatment; it will commence on a Monday or Tuesday and continue weekly from Monday through Friday (except for public holidays)."
