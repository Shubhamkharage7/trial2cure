After 4 cycles, subjects will continue maintenance treatment with durvalumab plus monalizumab every 4 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, decision to stop study treatment, or withdrawal of consent. Patients who have received one prior cycle of treatment before enrolling on the study will receive a total of 4 cycles with monalizumab, durvalumab, and chemotherapy. There will be a safety lead-in phase, including 6 to 12 patients, to confirm the safety of the proposed dose of monalizumab to use in combination with chemotherapy and durvalumab."

Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy.\n4. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n5. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. NOTE: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable.\n6.

Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 7 days before the first dose of monalizumab and 'on-study' durvalumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\n    * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent\n    * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication), and for prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea/vomiting per institutional standards.\n11. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. NOTE: Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving study treatment and up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n12. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.\n13. Patients who have received prior one dose of durvalumab along with chemotherapy:\n\n    * Must not have experienced a toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of prior immunotherapy.\n    * Must not have experienced a \u2265Grade 3 immune related AE or an immune related neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior immunotherapy.

History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n17. History of allogeneic organ transplantation.\n18. Treatment with any investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration or concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless observational in nature.",
