Despite being both required and a collaborative approach to service planning, CFT meetings are implemented with questionable fidelity and consistency, rarely including children and families as intended. By inclusion of child and family voice, the AAR-enhanced CFT should lead to increased fidelity to the CFT intervention and greater levels of parental satisfaction with the service and shared decision-making, thus resulting in enhanced follow-through with Action Plans and linkage to mental health care for children.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed project will address the following aims:\n\nAim 1. Conduct a qualitative needs assessment targeting the ongoing implementation of the CFT services intervention in a large, publicly funded, CWS. A qualitative inquiry consisting of interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders will result in the preparation of an action plan to address identified gaps between the current and desired CFT services intervention outcomes.\n\nAim 2. Adapt and tailor the AAR implementation strategy to address the CFT services intervention needs.\n\nAim 3. Assess mechanisms of the AAR team effectiveness intervention for CFT implementation."
