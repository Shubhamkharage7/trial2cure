The specific aim of the study is to assess the impact of changes in e-liquid pH on nicotine pharmacokinetics, cardiovascular, and subjective effects of e-cigarettes.",

Three e-liquid pH conditions will be assessed on all participants: 5, 7, and 9.\n\nHypothesis 2a: The rate of systemic nicotine absorption is inversely related to e-liquid pH and results in lower peak blood nicotine levels at higher pH.\n\nHypothesis 2b: Heart rate acceleration will decrease and subjective measures of sensation in the throat, reward, and satisfaction will increase with increasing e-liquid pH."
