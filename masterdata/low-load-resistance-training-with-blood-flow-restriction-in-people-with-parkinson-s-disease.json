            "briefSummary": "The study's objective is to determine the feasibility of low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction in people who have advanced Parkinson's disease and impaired mobility using a mixed-methods convergent parallel design in a single cohort. The study's long-term goal is to develop clinically feasible exercise interventions that are effective at improving mobility, participation, and quality of life for people with advanced Parkinson's disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will use a mixed-methods convergent parallel design to determine the feasibility of low-load BFR training in 20 people with advanced PD symptoms and impaired mobility (Hoehn and Yahr Stage \\[H\\&Y\\] 3-4). All participants will receive low intensity resistance training (20-30% of 1RM) with BFR targeting knee extensor, ankle plantarflexor, and elbow extensor muscles 2x/week for 8 weeks. Intervention will be delivered by a physical therapist with specialized training in BFR. Pre-defined feasibility criteria will be assessed in the primary aim. Outcomes assessed before and immediately after the 8-week intervention will include quantitative muscle strength and mobility assessments, and quantitative and qualitative data on health-related QOL.\n\nAim 1: Determine low-load BFR training feasibility based on the following quantitative and qualitative criteria: 1) enrolling 20 participants, 2) retaining \u226580% participants, 3) obtaining \u226580% intervention adherence, 4) having no serious intervention-related adverse events, and 5) quantitatively and qualitatively measured acceptability.\n\nAim 2: Determine changes in 1) knee extensor, ankle plantarflexor, and elbow extensor muscle strength using fixed myometry and 2) instrumented functional mobility (30-second Sit-to-Stand, Timed up and Go, self-selected walking speed, and Berg Balance Scale) using a system of inertial measurement unit wearable sensors.\n\nExploratory Aim: Understand health-related QOL changes using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) and semi-structured interviews to elucidate how components of the intervention translate into QOL changes through a mixed-method analysis of PDQ-39 constructs of mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, social stigma, social support, cognition, communications, and bodily discomfort."

The pressure cuff will be placed at the most proximal portion of the limb and dosed following standard BFR guidelines: 1 set of 30 reps, then 3 sets of 15 reps at 20-30% 1RM with a minimum of 60% and a maximum of 80% limb occlusion pressure. At 60-80% limb occlusion pressure there is diminished venous outflow to induce the necessary metabolic effect while still allowing arterial flow for safety.
