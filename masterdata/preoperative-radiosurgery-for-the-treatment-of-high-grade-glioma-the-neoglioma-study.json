            "briefSummary": "This phase I/IIA trial finds out the possible benefits and/or side effects of radiosurgery before surgery (preoperative) in treating patients with high grade glioma. Radiosurgery uses special equipment to position the patient and precisely give a single large dose of radiation to the tumor. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving pre-operative radiosurgery may improve the odds of brain tumor control and reduce treatment-related side effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety of preoperative radiosurgery in the treatment of patients with biopsy-proven high grade glioma prior to conventional therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Acute clinical toxicity profile using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 (defined as within 4 weeks of completion of postoperative radiotherapy.\n\nII. Radiographic tumor control at 12 months following surgery (per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology \\[RANO\\] criteria).\n\nIII. Rate of pseudoprogression at first post radiation scan (RANO criteria). IV. Overall survival at 12 months following surgery.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluation of the tumor repair pathways triggered by radiation, tumor vascular changes, tumor microenvironment immune profiling, cell cultures, and the creation of orthotopic xenograft models for future study.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT A: Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic biopsy. Patients then undergo radiosurgery over 1 fraction. Within 14 days, patients undergo surgery. Within 4-6 weeks, patients then receive standard of care radiation therapy over 30 fraction and temozolomide daily with or without tumor treating fields (TTF) at the discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist.\n\nCOHORT B: Patients undergo surgery. Within 4-6 weeks, patients then receive standard of care radiation therapy over 30 fraction and temozolomide daily with or without TTF at the discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist.\n\nAdditionally, patients undergo MRI and blood sample collection and optional biopsy on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for up to 5 years."
