A sample of urine from the same void will be obtained for further testing by the healthcare provider (HCP) study technicians.\n\nThe HCP technician will then test the volunteer's sample with a second investigational HPT, a professional use pregnancy test and a HPT, the results of which will be used to provide the volunteer with her pregnancy test result. During technician testing, the volunteer will complete the device usability and leaflet comprehension questionnaires.\n\nTrue pregnancy status will be determined by laboratory tests and clinical information."
