            "detailedDescription": "Tracheal intubation (TI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is frequently complicated by adverse safety outcomes such as adverse tracheal intubation associated events, multiple TI attempts, and oxygen desaturation. Investigators have developed, refined, and tested a Personalized INtubation Safety (PINS) Bundle that targets a prospective and individualized approach to TI planning and management. The Prospective Intubation Safety (PINS) Bundle addresses 5 core evidence-based domains that are individualized to the patient to develop a prospective, personalized and comprehensive multidisciplinary TI plan: (1) patient risk assessment; (2) treatment threshold for intubation; (3) premedication (promoting paralytic medication); (4) equipment (promoting video laryngoscope); (5) provider selection and escalation plan.\n\nThis is a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of NICU patients who are intubated across 8 participating hospitals to determine if the PINS Bundle, compared to no PINS Bundle, reduces the incidence of adverse tracheal intubation associated events.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the PINS Bundle to decrease adverse TI safety events. The secondary objectives are 1) to evaluate if the impact of the PINS Bundle on adverse TI safety events varies based on provider skill, and 2) to determine the impact of the PINS Bundle on NICU clinical outcomes of extubation failure, duration of intubation, NICU mortality, and intraventricular hemorrhage."
