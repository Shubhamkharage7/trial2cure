During their participation, patients will answer questions about their psychiatric and daily functioning, have blood drawn, and have their body composition analyzed (similar to stepping on a scale).",

Outcome measures will record a variety of assessments related to participants' psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and biological outcomes."
