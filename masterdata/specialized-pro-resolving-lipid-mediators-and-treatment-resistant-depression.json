            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on the production of anti-inflammatory effects and clinical improvement in people with depression who have not responded well to standard antidepressant treatment. The main questions it seeks to answer are:\n\n1. Do omega-3 fatty acids added to ineffective antidepressant treatment increase production of compounds that reduce inflammation?\n2. Is the increase in these anti-inflammatory compounds associated with a stronger antidepressant effect?\n\nParticipants taking antidepressants that have not worked completely will be assigned at random for a 12-week period to one of the following:\n\n1. an omega-3 preparation\n2. an inactive placebo\n\nDuring the course of the study, blood tests will be obtained for compounds associated with inflammation, and questionnaires to measure clinical improvement in depressive symptoms will be administered.",
            "detailedDescription": "This R33 application builds directly on a previous collaborative R01 (NCT00517036) and UG3 (NCT02553915) grants. The investigators will carry out a 12-week, randomized placebo-controlled, double-masked, augmentation trial of 4 g/day eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched omega-3 treatment in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD), an inadequate response to antidepressants (treatment-resistant depression \\[TRD\\]), body mass index (BMI) \\>25 kg/m2 and \u2264 40 kg/m2, and inflammation (high sensitivity C reactive protein \\[hs-CRP\\] \u2265 3 mg/L and \u2264 10 mg/L). It is hypothesized that 4 g/day of EPA-enriched omega-3 will: 1) Significantly increase plasma 18-hydroxy eicosapentaeoic acid \\[18-HEPE\\] concentrations compared to placebo (primary biological endpoint); 2) produce significantly greater increases in plasma 18-HEPE concentration since baseline for sustained MADRS responders (those with at least 50% reduction since baseline in MADRS scores at both treatment week 8 and week 12) than for (a) unsustained/non-responders to EPA-enriched n-3 as well as (b) placebo-supplemented sustained responders (secondary biological endpoint)."
