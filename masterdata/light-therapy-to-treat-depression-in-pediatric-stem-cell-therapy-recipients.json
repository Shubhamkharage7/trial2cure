Participants that get HSCT's often get depression and/or suffer from depressive symptoms, tiredness, and sleep disturbances.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of BL therapy for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To evaluate the temporal effect and magnitude of BL vs. DL therapy on depression in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT.\n* To evaluate the efficacy of BL therapy for the treatment of fatigue in children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n* To evaluate the response of BL therapy versus DL on sleep quality.\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\n* To compare incidence of positive delirium screenings between those receiving BL therapy versus DL\n* To evaluate participant and caregiver perceptions of the acceptability, ease of use, and risks/benefits of the use of Light Therapy Glasses during HSCT utilizing qualitative interviews.",
