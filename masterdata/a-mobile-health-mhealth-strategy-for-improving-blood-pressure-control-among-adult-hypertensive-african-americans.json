            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, proof of concept study, which we will use to assess for initial evidence of efficacy and technical feasibility of adding the USeeBP mHealth app as an adjunct to the UCM-RPM program.\n\nThis study integrates the USeeBP app into the existing UCM-RPM clinical pathway. Regular UCM-RPM program activities include monitoring home blood pressure (BP) measurement flowsheets, performing patient telephone and EPIC MyChart message outreach, and making medication adjustments. USeeBP is a secure, chat-based smartphone application. The app connects to a patient's electronic BP cuff (eCuff) via Bluetooth and sends BP data to the UCM-RPM program (rather than using the companion app to the eCuff that is used in the UCM-RPM program). The USeeBP app also allows the patient to set BP check and medication reminders, as well as provides patient education and opportunities to participate in healthy behavior challenges.\n\nThe primary study goal is to measure the effect of the USeeBP mobile app on home BP. Serial home blood pressure measurements will be collected at multiple time points. We hypothesize that there will be a decrease in BP across the study period."
