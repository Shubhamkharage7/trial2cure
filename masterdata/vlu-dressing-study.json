In the month prior to screening visit 1 subject was enrolled in any other research protocol for treatment of Study Ulcer.\n9. The Subject has been diagnosed with malignant disease not in remission over the 5 years immediately preceding screening visit 1.

Study ulcer area has been treated with radiation therapy at any time.\n11. In the opinion of PI the subject has a medical condition such as autoimmune, renal, hepatic or hematologic disease that makes the subject an inappropriate candidate for participation in study.\n12. In the month preceding screening visit 1 Study Ulcer has been treated with advanced tissue engineered devices matrix based devices (e.g., Apligraf, Dermagraft, Oasis).\n13. Subject is diagnosed with New York Heart Association Class III and IV congestive heart.\n14. Failure: Class III: Symptoms with moderate exertion or, Class IV: Symptoms at rest.\n15. Subject is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus that is poorly controlled and shall be defined as hemoglobin A1C \\>10%.\n16.
