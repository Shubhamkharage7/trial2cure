Fifteen milliliter blood sample will be collected during three independent visits over a period of approximately 3 months. These samples will be processed to separate plasma from red blood cells and frozen until assays are performed. Standardized immunoassay methods and LC/MS based methods will be adopted to assay a series of biomarkers in these samples. These data will be correlated with currently used diagnostic biomarkers."
