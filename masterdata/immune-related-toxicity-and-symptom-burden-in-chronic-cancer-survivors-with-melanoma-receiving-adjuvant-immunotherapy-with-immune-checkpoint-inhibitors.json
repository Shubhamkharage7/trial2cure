Information collected in this study may help doctors to learn more about the side effects caused by immunotherapy, and to learn if there are any relationships between these side effects and immune and genetic biomarkers found in the blood that may be related to patient's reaction to immunotherapy.",

Determine the detailed clinical characterization including timing, severity, and phenotype of immune related adverse events (irAEs) in chronic survivors with melanoma from initiation of adjuvant checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) therapy through 24 months of follow-up.\n\nII. Longitudinally assess patients-reported outcomes (PROs) that measure symptom burden (such as fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance) and quality of life (QOL) in those patients, compared to patients with similar disease stage who opt for active surveillance.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Longitudinally evaluate the correlation of changes in immune analysis (immune cells and cytokines) in peripheral blood samples with timing, severity, and phenotype of irAEs, symptom burden, and QOL in those patients, compared to patients with similar disease stage who opt for active surveillance.\n\nII. Determine whether specific immune-related genetic polymorphisms are associated with the development of irAEs and symptom burden in melanoma patients receiving adjuvant CPI therapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo medical assessments and blood sample collection, and complete questionnaires at baseline, 1 (optional), 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months."
