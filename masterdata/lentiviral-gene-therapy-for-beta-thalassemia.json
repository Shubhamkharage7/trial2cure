            "briefSummary": "The main goal of this study is to find out if the blood disorder called transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia can be safely treated by modifying blood stem cells. This is done by collecting blood stem cells from the subject, modifying those cells, adding a healthy beta globin gene, and then giving them back to the subject. It is hoped that these modified cells will decrease the need for blood transfusions. The gene modified blood stem cells are called CHOP-ALS20 (\"study drug\"). This experimental gene therapy has not been tried on human beings before and is not FDA approved.",
            "detailedDescription": "Beta thalassemia major is a hereditary blood disorder that requires lifelong regular transfusions and is associated with significant morbidity, early mortality, and decreased quality of life. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is potentially curative but limited availability of suitable donors as well as risks of graft versus host disease limit its applicability. Gene addition of a functional beta globin gene may be an alternative treatment option.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the safety of treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a novel lentiviral vector (ALS20) in subjects 18 to 35 years old with transfusion dependent beta thalassemia.\n\nThe secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a novel lentiviral vector (ALS20) in subjects 18 to 35 years old with transfusion dependent beta thalassemia.\n\nStudy Design: This is a single arm pilot, phase 1/2 study of up to 12 subjects ages 18 to 35 years who have transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (genotypes \u03b20\u03b20, \u03b2+\u03b20, \u03b2+\u03b2+, \u03b2E\u03b20, \u03b2E\u03b2+, dominant \u03b2 thalassemia). The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of infusing autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced with the novel lentiviral vector ALS20 that encodes the human \u03b2A-T87Q-globin, following myeloablative conditioning with busulfan.\n\nThe main risks of this study involve risks of the genetic modification of the stem cells and the busulfan chemotherapy conditioning. Genetic modification of blood stem cells may increase the risk of blood cancer. The main risks of busulfan conditioning include prolonged low blood counts, liver injury, infertility, and cancer. There also is a risk of failure of the modified blood stem cells to grow."
