Thereafter, each group will have an individualized schedule of follow-up telephone calls and visits.\n\nScreening for the study and participation in the study intervention can be completed in-person or from your home, if you do not live in the area.",
            "detailedDescription": "Interested participants and their study partner will be enrolled after an evaluation to determine cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The evaluation, either in person or remote, will include cognitive testing, clinical and neurological evaluation, a review medical records and medical history and an examination as deemed necessary by a dementia physician. Eligible participants will undergo baseline testing including linguistic analyses and will be randomly assigned to one of 3 intervention groups. Participants and their study partners will be contacted at least once every three months for cognitive testing and medical review. Contact with the music therapy team will occur up to twice per week but not less than once per month, for the first six months study enrollment."
