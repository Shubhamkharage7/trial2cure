            "briefSummary": "The increased prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) and associated overdoses and adverse events has led to a substantial increase in the number of patients being seen at emergency departments (ED). Thus, the ED may be an ideal location for identifying patients in need of OUD treatment and can serve as the first touch point in the OUD continuum of care to promote medication assisted treatment initiation. Contingency management (CM) is an effective method for promoting treatment initiation and adherence that has not been thoroughly evaluated for this purpose. The primary aim of the current study is to develop and assess the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of a protocol for delivering CM to increase combined buprenorphine + nalaxone (referred to as BUP hereafter) initiation and continuous adherence for OUD in an existing ED \"bridge\" program (e.g., Bridge plus CM; B+CM) relative to standard care. Secondary objectives include identifying behavioral and neuropsychological correlates to treatment outcomes, including delay discounting, reinforcer demand, and neurological soft signs."
