Females of childbearing potential must have (before starting treatment) a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14 days prior to and again within 24 hours prior to starting Isatuximab and with each cycle of study treatment. Females of childbearing potential must refrain from becoming pregnant and commit to either apply highly effective method of birth control (two reliable methods of birth control) or continue abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during study period and for at least 5 months after last dose of Isatuximab. Patients who receive Lenalidomide should continue to follow REVLIMID REMSTM requirements.\n10. Men of reproductive potential must agree to follow accepted birth control methods and refrain from sperm donation for the duration of the study and for at least 5 months after last dose of Isatuximab. Patients who receive Lenalidomide should continue to follow REVLIMID REMSTM requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Progression of myeloma, as defined by the IMWG criteria (Appendix C), prior to initiation of maintenance therapy\n2. Patients receiving any other investigational agents within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug prior to initiation of study intervention. Exceptions can be granted after discussing with PI.\n3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to any of the study drugs. Hypersensitivity or history of intolerance to steroids, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, sodium stearyl fumarate, histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt), arginine hydrochloride, poloxamer 188, sucrose or any of the other components of study intervention that are not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers or would prohibit further treatment with these agents.\n4. Known hypersensitivity or desquamating rash to either thalidomide or lenalidomide.\n5. Participants must not have an active infection requiring treatment.\n6. Participants must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, an uncontrolled hypertension (systolic \\>170, diastolic \\>100 despite antihypertensive therapy), symptomatic congestive heart failure (Class III or IV as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system), acute coronary syndrome, liver cirrhosis, and/or cognitive impairments/psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. PI is the final arbiter of this criterion.\n7. Major surgery within 4 weeks before initiating study treatment.\n8. HIV-positive patients and/or active hepatitis A, B or C infections.",
