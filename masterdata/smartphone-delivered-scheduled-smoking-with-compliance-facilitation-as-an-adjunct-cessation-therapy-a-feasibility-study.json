We will pursue the following aims:\n\nAim 1:\n\nDevelop the COSSR app and evaluate the app's usability. In this aim, our first objective is to develop the COSSR app, and our second objective is to evaluate the app's usability, making sure that our app's core features are working, such as generating personalized smoking schedules, recording smoking, and taking carbon monoxide (CO) measures using the portable CO devices. We will recruit 15 participants from across the state of Texas to test our app for 4 weeks.\n\nAim 2:\n\nEvaluate COSSR's preliminary effects on smoking cessation. In this aim, we will recruit participants (n=60) remotely from across the entire state of Texas to evaluate COSSR's effects on smoking cessation. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the control or the COSSR group. Both groups include the usual care treatment (self-help material and nicotine patches). In the COSSR group, they will use the app to reduce their smoking before quitting, and use 3-week pre-cessation nicotine patches."
