Secondary Objectives\n\n   1. To compare the operational features of the two devices, reflected in the success rate of examination and number of effective examinations.\n   2. To compare LSM obtained from each device with liver stiffness estimated by APRI, FIB-4, and SAFE scores.\n   3. The number of adverse events, serious events, and percentage of subjects with events will be calculated for AE, SAE, AE of special interest, and AE leading to study withdrawal."
