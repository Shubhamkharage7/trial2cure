            "briefSummary": "Participants with known or suspected hydrocephalus will receive brain scans using the Hyperfine, low field strength, portable, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system in addition to their scheduled outpatient standard of care clinical computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using the Hyperfine system in an outpatient setting and to compare its diagnostic performance to standard clinical imaging.\n\nOutpatients with other known or suspected neurological disorders or conditions prompting routine clinical brain imaging with MRI or CT will also be enrolled and the diagnostic performance of low field scans compared to that of the same day standard of care clinical imaging.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) causes the fluid-filled spaces of the brain, the ventricles, to become enlarged. Enlarged ventricles and increased intracranial pressure can cause headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, cognitive impairment, gait disturbances and in severe cases even brain herniation or death. A tube or shunt can be inserted into the ventricles to drain the CSF either outside the body temporarily or into the abdominal cavity for long-term treatment. Sometimes such shunts need to be adjusted or replaced if fluid re-accumulates. Medical imaging scans, either computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used to diagnose hydrocephalus in adults and children.\n\nThe purpose of this pilot study is to assess the performance of a newly developed, portable, low-cost MRI machine (Hyperfine MRI) in diagnosing and following patients with hydrocephalus in comparison to routine clinical CT or MRI. Outpatients with known or suspected hydrocephalus with or without ventricular shunts will be recruited to undergo Hyperfine MRI in conjunction with their routine clinical imaging. We will evaluate both the feasibility and acceptability of using the Hyperfine unit in the outpatient setting as well as the performance of Hyperfine MRI images in identifying hydrocephalus and other key brain imaging features relative to routine CT and MRI.\n\nOutpatients with other known or suspected neurological disorders or conditions prompting routine clinical brain imaging with MRI or CT will also be enrolled and the diagnostic performance of low field scans compared to that of the same day standard of care clinical imaging."
