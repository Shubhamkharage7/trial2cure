These cultures may then be used for drug screenings and to create patient-derived xenografts, or for comparisons between tumor and non-tumor patients. Other biological samples may be collected.\n\nAdditionally, saliva samples may be obtained from the parents of pediatric patients with CNS tumors, and biological samples may be collected from pediatric patients without a CNS tumor who are undergoing a neurological procedure. These samples may be used for comparison with samples from patients with CNS tumors."
