The use of other chemotherapeutic agents or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during study with the following exceptions (1) intrathecal chemotherapy for prophylactic use or for controlled CNS leukemia. (2) use of hydroxyurea for participants with rapidly proliferative disease or for control of counts during differentiation syndrome. (3) use of steroids for treatment of differentiation syndrome.\n3. Participants with any severe gastrointestinal or metabolic condition which could interfere with the absorption of oral study medications.\n4. Participants with concurrent active malignancy under treatment.\n5. Known active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.\n6. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n7. Participant has an active uncontrolled infection.\n8. Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study entry: myocardial infarction, uncontrolled/unstable angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification Class \u2265 II), life-threatening, uncontrolled arrhythmia, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack.\n9. QTc \\>450 msec for males and QTc \\>470 msec for females using the Fridericia Formula using an average of the 3 Screening EKGs.\n10. History of or any concurrent condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that in the Investigator's opinion might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate.\n11. Clinically active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.\n12. Participants on immunosuppressive therapy post-HSCT at the time of screening (must be off all systemic immunosuppression therapy for at least 2 weeks and calcineurin inhibitors for at least 4 weeks). The use of topical steroids for cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or stable systemic steroid doses less than or equal to 20 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) daily are permitted.\n13.
