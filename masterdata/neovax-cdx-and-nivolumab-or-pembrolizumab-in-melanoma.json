            "briefSummary": "This research study is studying the drugs called NeoVax (a new type of personalized neoantigen vaccine) in combination with CDX-301 and Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for melanoma.\n\nThe names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Personalized Neoantigen peptides (which combined with poly-ICLC make the vaccine NeoVax)\n* Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol)\n* CDX-301\n* Nivolumab (Opdivo)\n* Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine if it is possible to safely administer a personalized neoantigen vaccine (NeoVax) in combination with the study drug CDX-301 and Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab against melanoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of someone's own melanoma. The study will also be determining what the appropriate dose of CDX-301 to be given in combination with NeoVax and Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved personalized neoantigen peptides, poly-ICLC , or CDX-301 as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe FDA has approved Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab as a treatment option for melanoma.\n\nIt is known that melanoma cancers have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells.It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help someone's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the melanoma to come back in the future.\n\nThe personalized Neovax vaccine will be made of protein fragments, called peptides, from an individual's mutated melanoma tumor cells mixed with Poly-ICLC. Poly-ICLC is a drug that binds proteins on the surface of certain immune cells and helps to activate the immune system.\n\nCDX-301 is a drug involved in regulating the activity and proliferation of a type of cell named dendritic cell. Dendritic cells are key in enhancing the activation of the immune system in response to the NeoVax vaccine, so the immune system has a better chance to recognize the tumor cells and attack them.\n\nNivolumab and Pembrolizumab are antibodies that prevent cancer cells from suppressing one's immune response so that their body can attack and kill the cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side effects and their disease does not get worse for a maximum of 2 years and will be followed for 5 years since study therapy initiation\n\nIt is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study\n\nCelldex Therapeutics is supporting this research by providing CDX-301."

Approved contraceptive methods include for example: intra uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male condoms, or female condom with spermicide. Spermicides alone are not an acceptable method of contraception.

Given the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the prevention of COVID-19 is ALLOWED in this study.\n\n* History of severe allergic reactions attributed to any vaccine therapy for the prevention of infectious diseases\n* Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger\n* A condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses \\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Corticosteroids used as pre-medication for imaging studies are allowed.\n* Test positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection\n* Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n* Known sensitivity or allergy to Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, or CDX-301\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection requiring treatment, symptomatic\n* Any underlying medical condition, psychiatric condition or social situation that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise study administration as per protocol or compromise the assessment of AEs\n* Planned major surgery (except for surgery for resection of melanoma if applicable).\n* Patients with known mutations/amplifications in Flt-3\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Nivolumab, personalized neoantigen peptides and poly-ICLC are agents with unknown risks to the developing fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Nivolumab, personalized neoantigen peptides and poly-ICLC, nursing women are excluded from this study\n* Individuals with a history of an invasive malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances: a) individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; b) individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated - carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity or cervix, localized prostate cancer, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n* Prisoners, or subjects who are compulsory detained are not eligible to participate",
