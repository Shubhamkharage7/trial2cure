Based upon the FDA label, successful protocols used for intraoperative fluorescence-guided visualization for glioma resections, and on drug company current dosing recommendation for this study, patients will be administered 20 mg/kg body weight of 5-ALA orally at 3-4 hours prior to surgery. The use of 5-ALA fluorescence will be relevant for evaluating the resected tumor per gross margins and identifying further areas of fluorescing tissues beyond the gross tumor margins.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Demonstrate the feasibility of 5-ALA-aided fluorescent visualization of STS versus surrounding tissues.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Demonstrate the efficacy of tumor and surgical margin resections by a gross and histological analysis of fluorescing and non-fluorescing samples immediately after removal.\n\nII. Assess the safety profile of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) for STS utilizing 5-ALA.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients will be administered 20 mg/kg body weight of 5-ALA orally at 3-4 hours prior to surgical resection. Intraoperative fluorescence-guided visualization will be used for evaluating the resected tumor per gross margins and identifying further areas of fluorescing tissues beyond the gross tumor margins."
