            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study will evaluate a comprehensive ED-based intervention for moderate to severe AUD combining SBIRT with ED-initiated MAUD. It is an extension and a novel application of a highly effective ED intervention model that has been successfully developed and broadly disseminated for other conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and more recently opioid use disorder. No prospective randomized controlled trials of ED-initiated medications for the treatment of AUD, with or without psychosocial interventions, have been published to date. If found efficacious this novel intervention model has a potential to increase AUD treatment participation rates among individuals with AUD who frequently receive care in the ED. The proposed study will evaluate two ED-based interventions that have a potential to be broadly disseminated to narrow the gap between treatment need and treatment access.\n\nStudy participants will be identified through targeted screening for DSM-5 criteria for moderate to severe AUD and the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Therefore, the Screening component of the SBIRT intervention in the proposed RCT will be conducted before eligible ED patients who are interested in study participation are consented and randomized. This study will compare outcomes among individuals who are initiated on MAUD treatment in the ED, including AUD treatment with naltrexone, with ancillary support of gabapentin to assist with withdrawal symptoms.\n\nHypothesis 1: The rates of AUD treatment engagement will be higher among patients receiving SBIRT+ED-MAUD.\n\nHypothesis 2: Those randomized to SBIRT+ED-MAUD will have greater reductions of heavy drinking days.\n\nThis study is not designed to change the FDA labeling of gabapentin."
