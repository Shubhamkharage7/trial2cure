These visits will take place approximately 2-3 months after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (visit 1), 6 months after diagnosis (visit 2), and 12 months after diagnosis (visit 3).\n\nComprehensive clinical evaluation and symptom characterization, quantitative lung CT image analysis and pulmonary function testing, and quality of life questionnaires will be obtained at each visit. Bronchoscopy with BAL (collected at visits 1 and 3 only) and blood samples (collected at all visits) will dissect the dynamic immunological and molecular signatures in the respiratory tract and in the circulation longitudinally. We will also perform highly sensitive viral reservoir or remnant assays to address the potential contribution of viral factors in regulating chronic lung conditions post-acute COVID-19."
