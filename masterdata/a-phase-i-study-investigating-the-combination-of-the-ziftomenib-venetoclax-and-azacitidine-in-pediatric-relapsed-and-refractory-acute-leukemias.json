History of or any concurrent condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that in the Investigator's opinion might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate.\n12. Clinically active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.\n13. The use of topical steroids for cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or stable systemic steroid doses less than or equal to 20 mg of prednisone daily are permitted.\n14.
