            "detailedDescription": "Data shows that sildenafil (SIL) is an effective therapy in SSc-PAH. SIL has been safely used in many patients with various vascular and cardiovascular diseases over the past three decades. Randomized controlled trial data for SIL shows improvement in 6MWD, hemodynamics, and even evidence of cardiac remodeling in PAH and SSc-PAH patients. Based upon these data, SIL may be an effective therapy in SSc-MEP. This study will help determine whether sildenafil could be a good treatment for patients with scleroderma that have mildly elevated pulmonary pressures."
