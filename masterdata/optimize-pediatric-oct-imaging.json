The objective of this pilot study is to compare a new contact OCT system (Theia Imaging) with an investigational noncontact OCT system (Duke Biomedical Engineering) to assess their ability to image the pediatric retina.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the contact OCT system is superior in imaging larger areas of the retina (larger field-of-view), while it has similar resolution to image the retina substructures (non-inferior image quality).",

The objective of this pilot study is to compare a new contact OCT system (Theia Imaging) with an investigational noncontact OCT system (Duke Biomedical Engineering) to assess their ability to image the pediatric retina.\n\nThe investigators plan to enroll 10 healthy adult volunteers and 20 pediatric patients in clinic or undergoing examination under anesthesia. This is an observational study. There are no known risks associated with handheld OCT imaging and no adverse events identified imaging with our prior investigational imaging with the same system. There is a risk of corneal abrasion with the contact imaging system (Theia imaging), however, this system is used in the setting of other contact imaging systems (such as RetCam fundus photography).\n\nImaging data will be downloaded to a secure server for protocol image processing, segmentation, and analysis per protocol in the Duke Advanced Research in SD/SSOCT Imaging (DARSI) Laboratory."

The Theia 1 widefield imaging system is a light weight, high speed (300 kHz), wide field of view (110\u00b0) OCT system that address the limitations of current commercial OCT systems. The system is cart mounted, enabling portable, bedside imaging. The system uses a 300 kHz swept source laser operating in 1060nm regime. The Theia system follows the same safety standards as all applicable laser safety standards (ANSI z80.36 or ISO 15004) as the currently approved prior OCT devices. This nearly 10-fold increase in acquisition speed dramatically reduces imaging time and enables acquisition of full retinal volumes in infants. The 110\u00b0 field of view is provided via a re-usable contact lens that can be sterilized between imaging sessions.",
