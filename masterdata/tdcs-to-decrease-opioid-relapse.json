In Phase I, the EEG provided validation of expected changes in these networks following tDCS stimulation of the DLPFC. In this current phase (II), the investigators will perform a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) (active vs. sham control) to address long-term neurobehavioral outcomes, including opioid relapse, craving, and sustained EEG changes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators will perform an RCT in 100 opioid dependent participants who recently initiated buprenorphine or methadone. Participants will be randomized to receive five sessions of tDCS+CCN priming stimulation vs. sham tDCS+CCN priming. Participants will be assessed three times using electroencephalographic (EEG), once prior to tDCS+CCN priming, right after the completion of 5 sessions of tDCS+CCN priming (one week later), and again 10 weeks later.\n\nThis phase will address long-term (3- and 6-month) neurobehavioral outcomes, including opioid relapse, craving, and sustained EEG changes during a paradigm that challenges networks associated with craving (CR) and cognitive control (CCN). During the 24 weeks of buprenorphine or methadone maintenance treatment, the investigators will examine our primary clinical outcome, relapse (opioid use on \\>4 days per month and having an opioid positive urine screen), as well as days of opioid use."
