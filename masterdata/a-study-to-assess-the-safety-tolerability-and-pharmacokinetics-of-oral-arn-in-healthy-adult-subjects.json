The SAD portion of the study will enroll approximately 40 subjects for a total duration of 6 weeks. A cohort of 8 subjects in the SAD portion of the study will be selected to assess food effect (including relative bioavailability). The MAD portion of the study will enroll approximately 24 subjects for a total duration of 10 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind study of ARN-75039 or placebo given as single and multiple escalating doses in normal healthy subjects. The study will be conducted in three parts: Part 1 will be a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study enrolling approximately 40 subjects for a total duration of 6 weeks. Part 2 will be a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study enrolling approximately 24 subjects for a total duration of 10 weeks, and part 3 will be a selected SAD cohort in a fasted state to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of ARN-75039, enrolling approximately 8 subjects from a selected SAD cohort for a duration of 6 weeks. The dose escalation will be performed in a step-wise manner. Dose escalation stopping rules will be used to determine whether or not investigation of a higher dose level will proceed per protocol. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by periodic measurement of vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, blood laboratory analyses and occurrence of adverse events (AE). PK blood samples will be collected at pre-specified time points for noncompartmental data analysis. The PK parameters include but are not limited to: Cmax, Tmax, AUC, CL, and t\u00bd. For determination of the food effect, for selected PK parameters (e.g., Cmax, AUC0-\u03c4, and AUC0-\u221e), comparisons between the fed and fasted conditions will be made."

Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection on Day -1.\n7. Consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice within 72 hours prior to Day 1 or during the study.\n8. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year of Screening in the opinion of the investigator, or a positive test for drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or Day -1.\n9. Use of any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications, including food supplements, vitamins, herbal medications (e.g., St. John's wort), and cannabis, with the exception of contraceptive medications and as needed (prn) acetaminophen or paracetamol (not exceeding 2 grams/day) within 7 days prior to study drug administration and through the EOS visit.\n10. History of malignancy, except adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix.\n11. Smoking greater than 20 cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos or E-cigarettes per week in the 3 months prior to study drug administration or during the study.\n12. Any female who is pregnant or breastfeeding, or any female who is planning to become pregnant during the study and safety follow-up period.\n13.
