The aim of this study is to perform a cluster randomization of four racially diverse churches or senior centers to either the standard F\\&S! program, or the combined HAIL Online Platform + F\\&S! program to examine the efficacy of the HAIL online platform + F\\&S! program for older adults in black communities.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is randomized clinical trial of cluster randomization evaluating the efficacy and feasibility of the HAIL online platform + F\\&S! program. We will enroll four cohorts (i.e., at two racially diverse churches or senior centers) for a total number of 120 participants. We will use a phone screen to assess participants' eligibility and explain the study procedures. Eligible individuals will then be given a link to complete an e-Consent in REDCap. Those randomized into the intervention group will also receive instructions on how to access the HAIL online platform to complete assessments as part of the baseline visit. Participants in both the intervention and comparison groups will complete the 8-week F\\&S! exercise program which will be delivered in-person as well as remote. Participants in the intervention group will have access to the adjunct HAIL online platform during the F\\&S! program, and then continue to use the HAIL online platform during the 3-mo follow-up."

The landing page has a navigation bar on the left to access 1) the study assessments; 2) the F\\&S! exercise program participant manual; and 3) information on how to contact study staff. The goal of this adjunctive HAIL online platform is to support the continuation of exercise in the follow-up period once the 8-week F\\&S! exercise program is over.
