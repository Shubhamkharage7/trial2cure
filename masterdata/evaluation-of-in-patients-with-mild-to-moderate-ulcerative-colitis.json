A diagnosis of UC (documented or confirmed at screening) will be eligible provided they have mild-to-moderate active UC extending \u2265 15 cm from the anal verge.\n4. At screening/baseline, a Modified Mayo Clinic Score (MMCS) from 4-9, a rectal bleeding subscore \u2265 1, and a Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Subscale (MCES) score \u2265 2 determined by central reading.\n5. Patient has a negative urine drug screen (e.g., amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, opiates, methadone) at Screening.\n6. Patient has a negative alcohol breath test at Screening.\n7. Female patients who have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and who agree to use adequate birth control methods throughout the entire study (and extension, if applicable) or who is post-menopausal (i.e., amenorrhea \u2265 1 year) or who have been surgically sterilized.\n8. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential who agree to use adequate birth control methods throughout the entire study (and extension, if applicable) or who have been surgically sterilized.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Diagnosis of severe UC, defined as the presence of \u2265 6 bloody stools daily with one or more of the following: (1) oral temperature \\> 37.8\u00b0C or \\> 100.0\u00b0F; (2) pulse \\> 90 beats/min; (3) hemoglobin concentration \\< 10.5 g/dL; or erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR) \\> 30.\n2. Patients treated with oral mesalamine \\>2.4 g/d, systemic steroids or rectal steroids within 4 weeks prior to randomization, rectal mesalamine (within 2 weeks), immunomodulators or immunosuppressant drugs, including, but not limited to, IL-6 inhibitors, TNF inhibitors, anti-IL-1 agents and JAK inhibitors within 5 half-lives prior to randomization, antibiotics, anti-diarrheals (within 2 weeks), drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers) (within 4 weeks) or administration of any investigational drug (within 4 weeks). Because SPH3127 is a direct renin inhibitor with the potential to reduce blood pressure, other classes of antihypertensives (e.g., calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, diuretics, direct vasodilators, alpha blockers, central \u03b12 antagonists) (within 4 weeks) will also be excluded. Drugs, herbal medicines and substances that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 (e.g., ritonavir, itraconazole, grapefruit juice) (within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) will be excluded.\n3. History of colectomy or partial colectomy, colorectal dysplasia, Crohn's disease, toxic megacolon, or bleeding disorders.\n4. A stool sample positive for enteric pathogens, including Clostridium difficile.\n5. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\< 60.\n6. Patients with hepatic impairment or history of liver cirrhosis.\n7. Serum creatinine \\> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \\> 2 times the upper limit of normal.\n8. Serious underlying disease other than UC.\n9. Previous participation in clinical trials with SPH3127\n10. Known hypersensitivity to tablet ingredients or history of a significant allergic reaction to any drug as determined by the investigator.\n11. Known seropositivity or positive test at screening for an active viral/bacterial infection with:\n\n    * Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (except seropositivity due to HBV vaccination)\n    * Hepatitis C virus\n    * Human immunodeficiency virus\n    * COVID-19 (only active infection excluded)\n    * Tuberculosis\n12. Known clinically relevant immunological disorders.\n13. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions.\n14. History of malignancy, unless deemed cured by adequate treatment with no evidence of recurrence for a minimum 3 years before screening; completely eradicated non-melanoma skin cancer (such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) is not exclusionary.\n15. Clinically relevant abnormalities detected on ECG regarding either rhythm or conduction (e.g., QTcF \\> 450 ms or a known long QT syndrome). A first-degree heart block or sinus arrhythmia will not be considered a significant abnormality.\n16. Low blood pressure at screening (i.e., SBP \\< 90 mmHg or DBP \\< 60 mmHg).\n17. Clinically relevant abnormalities detected on vital signs prior to dosing.\n18. Significant blood loss (including blood donation \\> 500 mL) or transfusion of any blood product within 12 weeks prior to the IP administration or scheduled transfusion within 4 weeks after the end of the trial.\n19. Treatment with any drug known to have a well-defined potential for toxicity to a major organ in the last 3 months preceding the initial investigational product (IP) administration.\n20. Concurrent participation, or participation within 30 days prior to the IP administration or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug (whichever is longer), in any drug/device or biologic investigational research trial.\n21. Women who are breastfeeding.\n22. Vaccination (including influenza and COVID-19) within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n23. History of drug or alcohol abuse.\n24. Is an investigator, sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist, trial coordinator, or other staff of a relative who is directly involved in the conduct of the trial.\n25. Any condition or circumstances that in the opinion of the investigator may make a subject unlikely or unable to complete the trial or comply with trial procedures and requirements.",
