            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a double-blind, randomized phase II clinical trial of brain-directed stereotactic radiation with or without AGuIX (Activation and Guidance of Irradiation by X-ray) gadolinium-based nanoparticles in the management of brain metastases at higher-risk of local recurrence with radiation alone.\n\nThe study agent (AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles) has two main parts. The first is gadolinium, also known as \"contrast,\" which is typically injected into a vein during a MRI scan. The second part is a nanoparticle (linked to the gadolinium) that may make focused radiation work more effectively. The AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles are deposited within the brain metastases via the bloodstream and then the brain metastases are radiated.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles as a treatment for any disease. AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles have been tested in other studies for safety and efficacy in patients with brain metastases who are also receiving radiation.\n\nThis study seeks to determine whether AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles improve outcomes relative to placebo.Participants will be \"randomized\" into one of the study groups:\n\n* Group A: Radiation plus AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles\n* Group B: Radiation plus placebo\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nNH TherAguix, the manufacturer of the AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles, is supporting this research study by providing the AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles that will be evaluated in this study.\n\nNH TherAguix is also covering the cost of the study.\n\nIt is expected that about 134 people will take part in this research study."

For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of the therapeutic component of study participation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who cannot undergo a brain MRI\n* Participants who cannot receive gadolinium\n* Participants with widespread, definitive leptomeningeal disease\n* Patients requiring radiation to either \\>10 targets (if na\u00efve to whole brain radiation) or \\>20 targets (if whole brain radiation has been given previously) per the discretion of the treating clinician and/or study PI\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential deleterious effects of gadolinium on the developing fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, women who are breastfeeding are not eligible for this study\n* In cohorts who have received prior brain-directed radiation, patients are not eligible for this study if they have active (at the time of protocol screening) brain metastases that require radiation that are in or within 1.0cm of the brainstem, eyes, optic nerves, or optic chiasm if the juxtaposed organ at risk (i.e. brainstem, eyes, optic nerves, or optic chiasm) has previously received either \\>6.0 Gy in a single fraction or, if prior radiation was fractionated, a cumulative dose in 2.0 Gy equivalents, using an alpha/beta ratio of 2, of \\>40.0 Gy. In addition, all patients who have had prior brain-directed radiation, regardless of technique/dose/fractionation, are not eligible for the study until written approval is provided by the study/site PI",
