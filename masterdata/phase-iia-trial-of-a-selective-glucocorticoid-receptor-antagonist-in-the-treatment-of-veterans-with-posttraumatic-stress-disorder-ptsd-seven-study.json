            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIa clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of CORT108297- 180mg daily for 7 days for PTSD symptoms in Veterans. Each of the two sites will enroll 44 Veterans with chronic PTSD. Participants first will undergo screening procedures, including a clinical psychological interview, self-report questionnaires, blood draw, and medical evaluations. If eligible, they will be randomized to either CORT108297 or placebo. The same procedures will be repeated at several in-person and virtual visits before, during and after taking the study drug or placebo for seven days. The key outcome measures will be obtained at baseline, day 7, 28, and day 56.\n\nThere is large body of evidence demonstrating that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is associated with alterations in the stress hormone cortisol. There is also evidence that medications that block cortisol may be beneficial for treating PTSD and depression. This study will test a medication, CORT108297, which is from a new class of cortisol blockers which have no effect on other hormones. CORT108297 has been shown to have efficacy in preclinical CNS models and was well tolerated and safe in Phase I healthy volunteer studies making it a candidate for further development. Thus, the goal will be to complete a Phase IIa proof of concept trial of CORT108297 to focus on safety and tolerability and obtain pilot efficacy data to inform the design of future clinical trials."
