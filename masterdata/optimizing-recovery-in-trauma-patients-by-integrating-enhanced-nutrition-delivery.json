Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either enhanced nutrition or control arm. Subjects randomized to the enhanced nutrition arm will receive oral nutrition supplements (ONS) up to 3 times per day while in the hospital and for 4 weeks after discharge. Subjects in the standard of care arm will receive normal nutrition recommendations from their clinical providers. Participants in both groups will undergo non-invasive tests that measure how much energy (calories) they are using, body composition, and muscle mass.",

Enhanced protein supplementation supports patients from ICU admission to 4-weeks post-hospital discharge, providing a comprehensive and personalized plan of care carried to completion.\n\nSubjects will be randomized 1:1 to enhanced nutrition or control arm. Subjects randomized enhanced nutrition oral nutrition supplements (Fresenius KCAL shakes) up to 3 times per day while in the hospital and for 4 weeks after discharge. Subjects in the standard of care arm will receive normal nutrition recommendations from their clinical providers.\n\nParticipants in both groups will undergo non-invasive tests that measure how much energy (calories) they are using, body composition, and muscle mass. They will also be asked to complete walking and strength tests, and surveys about quality of life.These will be done at hospital admission, day 14 or hospital discharge, and at a one month post-discharge follow-up visit."
