Given the impact on quality of life, there is a great need for therapies focused on cognition. In this study, we will test the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a novel Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy (VRCT) for AD developed by ClarityTek, Inc. The VRCT will focus primarily on skills that impact instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., taking medications, shopping). Thirty-six individuals with mild to moderate AD/ADRD will be enrolled and will utilize the VRCT over seven weeks within their home. Enrollment will occur in cohorts of 12 individuals, so that the VRCT can be revised and optimized based on the results, prior to the next cohort. We will also hold Expert Focus Groups with clinician specialists to obtain feedback for improvement."
