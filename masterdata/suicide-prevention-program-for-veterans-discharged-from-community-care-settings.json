The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n* Does BESST combined with standard care improve suicide-related outcomes among this population compared to standard care alone?\n\nParticipants will be assigned by change to a treatment group. Some will receive the BESST intervention combined with standard care, and some will receive standard care alone. All participants will be in this research study for up to three months.\n\nThose receiving the BESST intervention will have:\n\n* 1 one-hour brief educational session;\n* Seven follow-up check-ins (\\~30 minutes each)\n\nAll participants will have three assessment interviews where they will be asked about their mental health and treatment received outside of the VA.\n\nThe investigators will compare participants assigned to the BESST intervention combined with standard care vs participants assigned to standard care alone to see if the BESST intervention improves suicide-related outcomes."
