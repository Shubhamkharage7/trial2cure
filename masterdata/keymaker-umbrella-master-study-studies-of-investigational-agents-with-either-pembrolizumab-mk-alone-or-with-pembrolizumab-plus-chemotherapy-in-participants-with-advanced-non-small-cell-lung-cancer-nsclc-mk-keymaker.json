This pembrolizumab NSCLC umbrella master protocol uses a platform design and consists of this master screening study and three substudies. Each substudy will enroll a different population of NSCLC participants.\n\nThe goal of this umbrella master protocol is to screen potential participants with NSCLC for enrollment into 1 of 4 substudies. Participants must first enroll in this pembrolizumab master protocol study and undergo screening for NSCLC that will be used to assign them to participation in 1 of 4 pembrolizumab substudies.",
