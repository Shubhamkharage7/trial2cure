            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the lung function effect from orally inhaled BGF delivered via HFO propellant is equivalent to the lung function effect from orally inhaled BGF delivered via HFA propellant in participants with COPD. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 15 to 16 weeks and consist of:\n\n1. A screening and placebo run-in period of approximately 2 weeks prior to first dosing\n2. Three treatment periods of approximately 4 weeks each (one period for each of 3 study interventions)\n3. A final safety follow-up visit via telephone contact approximately 1 to 2 weeks after the final dose administration Participants will be provided with rescue SABA (albuterol or salbutamol) to be used as needed throughout the study. Participants will attend in-clinic study visits approximately weekly during the screening/run-in period (Visits 1, 2, and 3), then every 4 weeks (Visits 4, 5, and 6) to receive take-home study treatment, measure their lung function, and assess their health and safety",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase III, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centre, 4-week, 3-way crossover pharmacodynamic study to assess the equivalence of BGF MDI HFO compared with BGF MDI HFA in participants with COPD. To demonstrate assay sensitivity, BGF MDI HFA will be compared to placebo MDI HFA for superiority in lung function, both pre- and post-dose.\n\nEligible participants are between 40 and 80 years of age, inclusive, who have an established clinical history of COPD as defined by the ATS/ERS. Participants are required to have an FEV1/FVC ratio of \\< 0.70, have a post-bronchodilator FEV1 \u2265 40% and \\< 80% predicted normal value, have a blood eosinophil count \\< 300 cells/\u03bcL, and be current or former cigarette smokers with a history of at least 10 pack-years. Participants must not have had a COPD exacerbation treated with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 4 months prior to initiation of screening, and must not have had a COPD exacerbation that required hospitalisation within 12 months prior to initiation of screening. Eligible participants are those on treatment with LABA, LAMA, LAMA/LABA (open or fixed-dose combination), ICS/LABA (open or fixed-dose combination) inhaled maintenance therapies, or SABA, SAMA, or SAMA/SABA scheduled or as-needed inhaled therapies, or who are na\u00efve to COPD therapy.\n\nThis study will be conducted at approximately 95 sites globally. After screening, participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive study interventions in one of 6 possible treatment sequences."

Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational \\[15:32\\] \u0141ubian, Dominika amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of contraception.

The documentation on male sterility can come from the site personnel's review of participant's medical records, medical examination and/or semen analysis or medical history interview provided by her or her partner. Informed Consent 11 Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix A which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol.\n\n   Other Inclusion Criteria 12 Participants with calculated eGFR \\> 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the CKD-EPI formula.\n\n13 Participants who demonstrate acceptable MDI administration and spirometry techniques.\n\n14 Participants who remain compliant with placebo run-in administrations, defined as \u2265 80% of planned doses over the last 7 days prior to Visit 3, based on ePRO diary data.\n\n15 Participants who are willing to remain at the study centre as required per protocol to complete all visit assessments.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nMedical Conditions\n\n1.
