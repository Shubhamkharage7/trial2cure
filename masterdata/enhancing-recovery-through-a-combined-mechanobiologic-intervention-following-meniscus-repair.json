            "detailedDescription": "Arthroscopic meniscal procedures are the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure in the U.S. affecting 15% of Americans ages 10-65 years. Meniscus injury is also known to increase the risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). The current randomized clinical trial will test a novel mechanobiologic intervention after meniscal repair that combines an oral senolytic fisetin and real-time biofeedback program to restore joint loading and subsequent return to activity. The premise for this program is derived from growing evidence that under-loading early after an orthopedic surgery is a major contributing factor to future PTOA development. Despite the need to assess how much force the patient can produce in various exercises to better inform progression and progress, clinicians still have few tools. By providing the realtime feedback during all exercises, the program will promote the recovery of muscle function as well which is critical for normal joint loading.\n\nThe study will 1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the mechanobiologic intervention following arthroscopic repair of meniscus tears, 2) determine if the mechanobiologic intervention improves physical function, patient reported outcomes, loading and muscle strength, and biomechanical symmetry in comparison to standard of care physical therapy and oral placebo, and 3) compare cartilage composition at 1 year after meniscus surgery between the mechnobiologic intervention and a control group treated standard of care physical therapy and oral placebo."
