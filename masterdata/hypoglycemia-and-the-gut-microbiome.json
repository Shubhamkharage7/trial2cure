Specifically, integrative analysis of dietary consumption, anthropometrics, physical activity and gut microbiota composition can be used to predict postprandial glycemic excursions. The investigators hypothesize that individualized assessment of glycemic responses to food, together with analysis of the gut microbiome, will allow the design of a personalized dietary approach to minimize glycemic excursions for patients with post-bariatric and other forms of largely postprandial hypoglycemia. Identification of factors predictive of glycemic excursions and subsequent hypoglycemia may ultimately allow individuals to tailor their diet towards foods which would not induce hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent hypoglycemia."
