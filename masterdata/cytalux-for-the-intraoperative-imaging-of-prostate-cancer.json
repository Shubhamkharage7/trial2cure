            "briefSummary": "This study is being done to compare how much using Cytalux\u2122 (pafolacianine) with NIR (Near InfraRed) fluorescent imaging improves the detection of malignant (growing in an uncontrolled way) tissue in adult subjects undergoing prostatectomy and lymph node dissection for biopsy confirmed prostate cancer.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the targeted imaging agent pafolacianine (Cytalux) for use in ovarian cancer (2021) and lung cancer surgery (2022.)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open label trial in up to 15 subjects with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer (PCa) who have been scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with or without robotic assistance, with pelvic lymph node dissection. This is a non-intervention trial to assess the accuracy of an imaging agent, folate targeted fluorescent dye (pafolacianine), during a standard of care radical prostatectomy.\n\nQualifying subjects will be Grade Group 3 to 5 (\\>/= cT3) with either suspected extraprostatic disease (EPD) (extracapsular extension (ECE) and/or seminal vesicle infiltration (SVI)), or suspected lymph node metastasis (clinical stage cN1, or by magnetic resonance imaging (mriN+), or by Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET+).\n\nWhether using an anterior or a posterior approach, the tissues planned for removal will be visualized first under normal light, and their locations marked on a provided template. All additional suspicious tissue or nodes will be similarly marked, whether removed or not. Prior to removal, the field must be illuminated with Near Infrared light (NIR) and fluorescent tissues must be marked on the template. This may proceed in an iterative fashion, switching from first normal light to NIR as the surgical field expands.\n\nNIR imaging must be conducted in the timeframe of one hour to twenty-four hours following IV infusion of pafolacianine. Lymphatics to be examined are, at a minimum, the external iliac, internal iliac and obturator fossa, and common iliac. Fluorescence positive nodules and nodes will be removed at the surgeon's discretion and sent as labeled (specimen number, tissue, location) specimens to pathology without designation of florescence. Ink dots should ideally be applied to the spot suspected of being cancerous."
