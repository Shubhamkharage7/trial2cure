This comparison will enable the investigators to determine if the chatbot system can improve rates of recommendation for genetic testing among patients at elevated risk of harboring a familial cancer syndrome in an all-Medicaid gynecology clinic. Furthermore, the investigators aim to evaluate facilitators of inequity in regard to patient access to and utilization of genetic testing services."
