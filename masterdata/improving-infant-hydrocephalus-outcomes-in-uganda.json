Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) with Choroid Plexus Cauterization (ETV/CPC) is an alternate treatment to give patients a shunt-free life. In this study, the investigators aim to optimize the metrics of evaluation as quantitative prognostic indicators of treatment response and long term outcomes."
