            "briefSummary": "This study investigates the feasibility of a gait-retraining program for older adults with knee osteoarthritis. The study will enroll 40 participants, with 20 receiving a gait retraining intervention and 20 receiving a graded walking program without gait retraining.",
            "detailedDescription": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition affecting \\~12% of older adults in the United States and is a leading cause of disability. Knee pain is a common clinical manifestation that leads individuals with OA to seek medical care. Current rehabilitation approaches (e.g., bracing, taping, foot orthoses, strengthening, etc.) aim to reduce knee joint loading, a well-accepted risk factor for knee OA and pain, but are not always effective. Altering gait mechanics to reduce knee loading has also been suggested. Gait retraining studies for individuals with knee OA have focused on increasing trunk lean and toe out angle to reduce the knee adduction moment (a surrogate measure of joint loading). However, these strategies create an abnormal gait pattern and may not be the best long-term solutions due to the potential injury to other joints which may limit their overall effectiveness and applicability to clinical practice. Impact loading, another mechanical factor related to knee OA, has been reduced using gait retraining strategies in runners with knee pain. It is unknown if gait retraining strategies to decrease impact loading can reduce symptoms of knee OA. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a gait retraining program focusing on decreasing impact loading in individuals with knee OA.\n\nAt baseline, following 8 intervention sessions, and at 1-month follow-up, participants will complete questionnaires, undergo three-dimensional gait analysis, and assessment of pressure pain threshold.\n\nNote: For participants enrolled during COVID-19 outbreak, only questionnaires will be collected at follow-up assessments."
