This study, which will take place at NYU and Bellevue Medical Center, and participating external sites. May have concurrent enrollment with the HARP Main Imaging (NCT02914483). Additionally, a sex, group of age and race matched disease controls 'CATH-NOCA' composed of women and men with stable angina referred for cardiac catheterization, will be enrolled. Blood obtained during the initial catheterization and 2 months post-MI will be utilized for platelet testing."
