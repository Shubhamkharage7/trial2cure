            "detailedDescription": "Rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT), is a chronic degenerative process which causes both shoulder pain as well as limited range of motion. It is currently estimated that approximately 5% of RCT is being managed surgically, which highlights the importance of effective non-operative treatment strategies.\n\nThe advent of platelet rich plasma (PRP), a sample of blood drawn from a patient and concentrated to include mainly platelets and potent inflammatory mediators which promote healing, has shown promise as another treatment modality when injected at the site of tendon damage. Placenta-derived decellularized connective tissue matrix (CTM) may represent an alternative therapy for RCT. Placenta-derived biologics can be administered as an injection and have been shown to promote tenocyte proliferation and to reduce inflammation in vitro, thus potentially accelerating and enhancing tendon healing.\n\nThis study is being conducted to determine if injection of CTM Boost is non-inferior to injection of PRP with regard to pain and function at Month 6 post-injection in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy."
