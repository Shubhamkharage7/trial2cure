Recent small pilot programs have demonstrated that these patients may be safely included in home OPAT programs when they are provided with medications for opioid use disorder such as suboxone or methadone. However nothing is known about the effect of additional social support services including case management and health coach navigation on the feasibility and acceptibility of home OPAT programs for persons who inject drugs. This observational study will provide pilot data on the feasibility of such a program in anticipation of a larger scale trial."

Patients being considered for discharge on OPAT to any of these locations are eligible for inclusion.\n* History of injection opioid use within the last 1 year\n* Evaluated by the joint toxicology/psychiatry addiction medicine consult service during the current inpatient admission\n* Started or maintained on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) of either methadone, buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone during admission to Barnes-Jewish Hospital\n* Have a scheduled follow-up for continuation of medications for opioid use disorder in place prior to discharge. For patients on methadone this should include a scheduled appointment at a methadone clinic, or for patients on buprenorphine this can include a plan for ongoing buprenorphine/ buprenorphine-naloxone based therapy at the Washington University Infectious Diseases Clinic.\n* Have met with a health coach or a member of the Bridge To Health team during their inpatient hospitalization and agree to ongoing supportive counseling after discharge.\n* Be willing and able to attend in-person clinic visits within 60 days post-discharge at the Washington University Infectious Diseases Clinic.\n* Have a working phone number with active voicemail, running water and electricity.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prisoner status\n* Unable to provide own informed consent\n* Current homelessness\n* Other house-hold members reported as having active untreated substance use disorders\n* Unable to attend outpatient appointments.
