The IS does not include a battery but receives energy pulses transmitted by an Activation Chip (AC) which is attached to an adhesive Disposable Patch (DP) and placed on the patient's skin under the chin. Stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve causes the tongue muscles to contract with the intention to maintain an open airway."
