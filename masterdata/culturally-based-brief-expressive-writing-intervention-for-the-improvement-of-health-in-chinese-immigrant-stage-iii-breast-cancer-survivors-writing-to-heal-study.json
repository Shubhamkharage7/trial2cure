To characterize how acculturation moderates the effects of expressive writing interventions.\n\nIII. To identify mechanisms explaining the benefits of the interventions using mixed methods.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I (CONTROL): Patients write about facts regarding their cancer diagnosis and treatment for 3 weekly 30-minute sessions.\n\nARM II (SELF-REGULATION): Patients write about stress and coping, emotional disclosure, and benefit finding for 3 weekly 30-minute sessions.\n\nARM III (SELF-CULTIVATION): Patients write about positive thoughts and feelings regarding their breast cancer experience for 3 weekly 30-minute sessions.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 weeks and at 6 and 12 months."
