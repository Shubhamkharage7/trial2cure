These collections are included in the Study Calendar (section 4.6). Blood tests are routinely performed on a weekly basis for patients receiving systemic therapy and we will make all attempts to coordinate biospecimen collection for study purposes with biospecimen collection for standard clinical care in order to minimize patient inconvenience.\n\nEach specimen will be analyzed in the Stable Isotope \\& Metabolomics Core Facility of the Diabetes Research Center under the direction of Dr. Irwin Kurland.
