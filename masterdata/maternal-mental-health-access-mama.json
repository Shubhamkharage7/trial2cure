The plan is to enroll 120 at-risk pregnant and postpartum women from rural, urban, and Latino populations. Using a randomized preference design to also evaluate patient and sociocultural factors in participation and symptom trajectory.\n\nUsing the Implementation Research Logic Model, the team will evaluate the implementation feasibility and acceptability of a remote-access and on-demand MBCT PD prevention intervention that is integrated within maternal clinical care settings using an existing patient portal. Successful achievement of the study aims will result in a refined implementation protocol for future studies that are sufficiently powered to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated Digital Mental Health Technology and to estimate the cost/benefit ratio",
            "detailedDescription": "This type1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation project is conducted within healthcare settings and underserved populations (rural, urban, and Latino) and for individuals who are at risk for perinatal depression (PD), which allows the team to refine the approach in preparation for a future effectiveness trial for the prevention of PD in diverse communities using accessible Digital Mental Health Technology (patient education portal, FB discussion boards, synchronous videoconference support sessions). The plan is to adopt a randomized preference trial design to assess the impact of patient preference and sociocultural factors (including race, ethnicity, and geographic residence) on engagement and preliminary results. This information is crucial for a subsequent trial and for ultimately taking the intervention to scale. The study design using the IRLM reflects scientific rigor that can be reproduced by other investigators. The implemented strategies specifically developed to optimize implementation success, and to measure the implementation outcomes of these strategies and include valuable input from key informants, stakeholders, and the Community Advisory Board at regular intervals throughout the project time period."
