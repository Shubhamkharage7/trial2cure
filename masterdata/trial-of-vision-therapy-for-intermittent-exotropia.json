            "detailedDescription": "Vision therapy (VT) is a commonly prescribed treatment for children with intermittent exotropia (IXT). The effectiveness of VT as a treatment modality for children with IXT is unknown because previous studies have largely limited observational or retrospective case series without comparison groups. The objective of this multi-centered pilot randomized trial of VT for IXT compared to observation is to 1) determine the short-term effectiveness of VT on distance intermittent exotropia and 2) determine the feasibility of recruitment and retention of children aged 8 to 16 years old with IXT to participate in a randomized trial of 20 weeks of in-office VT. The results of this trial will provide the needed information to plan and conduct a large-scale randomized trial to determine short-term and long-term effectiveness of VT for IXT in children, with the full-scale randomized trial helping to fill in the gaps in scientific knowledge concerning VT as a treatment for IXT."
