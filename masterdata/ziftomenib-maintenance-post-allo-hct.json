            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test the safety, effects, and recommended dose of an investigational drug, ziftomenib, in addition to the standard treatment on blood cancer with Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (allo-HCT). This study plans to learn more about ziftomenib, which targets and inhibits negative interactions within cancer cells related to AML, when given after allo-HCT, to determine if it improves outcomes following allo-HCT.\n\nThe name of the study drug involved in this study is:\n\n\u2022 Ziftomenib",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, phase I study of ziftomenib as maintenance therapy following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This study is testing whether ziftomenib, combined with the standard allo-HCT treatment, is safe and effective in treating blood cancer. This study will test if ziftomenib improves outcomes after allo-HCT.\n\nThe study drug is given after the allo-HCT, in combination with standard treatment and aftercare.\n\nThis study consists of 2 parts:\n\nPart A (Dose Escalation): The investigators are looking to find the highest dose of the study intervention that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study intervention. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated. Once determined, this highest dose will then be used in the dose expansion part of the study.\n\nPart B (Expansion Cohort): Participants will be treated at the respective dose as determined during Part A(Dose Escalation).\n\nZiftomenib administered after allo-HCT may work to enhance graft-versus-leukemia effects, selectively target residual leukemic cells, or suppress leukemic stem cells, among other mechanisms. The U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) has not currently approved ziftomenib as a treatment for any disease but it is being studied in Phase 1/2 interventional clinical trials for participants with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThe estimated length of the study is 2 years. Participants will begin treatment 30 to 90 days after allo-HCT, and treatment will continue for up to 12 months. Then they will be followed for 12 to 24 months after study treatment ends.\n\nIt is expected that about 22 people will take part in this research study."
