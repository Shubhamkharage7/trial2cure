            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, single-arm, quality improvement initiative for the use of a standardized educational intervention on germline testing in black patients with prostate cancer to improve the rates of germline genetic testing among those recommended for testing. Patients who consent to the study will undergo a one-on-one in-person education session regarding the rationale and the benefits/risks of germline testing.\n\nThe educational intervention will occur with a clinical research coordinator who will be trained to educate on germline testing in prostate cancer. At the start of the session, the patient will be given a short questionnaire to assess their understanding about germline and genetic testing, along with a Family History questionnaire.\n\nFollowing the educational intervention, the patient will be asked to complete a short patient education and satisfaction questionnaire.\n\nIf a patient wishes to proceed with testing, they will sign the standard consent to proceed with germline testing via a commercial assay. Upon a patient deciding to pursue testing, testing will consist of a prostate cancer germline panel with a commercially available blood or saliva-based assay. Upon receipt of the results, the coordinator will alert the patient's clinician, who will then share the results with the patient either in clinic or by phone. If the results show a pathogenic germline mutation, the patient will be referred to see Henry Ford Health genetics clinic for consultation with a genetics counselor.\n\nIf a patient pursues genetic testing, following receipt of results, the patient's clinicians will be asked to complete a short survey on to assess how the results of germline testing affected the patient's current and future management."
