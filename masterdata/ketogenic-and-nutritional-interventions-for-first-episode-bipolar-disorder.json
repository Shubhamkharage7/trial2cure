            "detailedDescription": "Several lines of evidence show energy metabolism and redox dysregulation in bipolar disorder and psychotic disorders. Ketogenic interventions targeting energy metabolism are promising therapeutic approaches to improve mood and psychosis in bipolar disorder and other psychotic disorders. Early intervention is also critical to helping people achieve their goals for recovery after a first episode. Investigators aim to use multimodal imaging and metabolic measures to study the effects of a ketogenic diet intervention on energy metabolism and psychiatric symptoms in individuals with first episode bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder. This 12-week randomized controlled trial will assess the benefits of a ketogenic diet in combination with treatment as usual compared to a standard diet. Investigators will measure the effects of nutritional ketosis on brain redox and energy metabolism and other neurometabolic markers using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, investigators will measure the effects of the ketogenic diet on mood and psychotic symptoms and metabolic measures such as insulin resistance."
