The proposed intervention, the Personal Patient Profile - Bladder Cancer (P3-BC), will be the first intervention to address these issues. Results of this pilot randomized feasibility study will provide evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of the P3-BC and will guide further refinement of the tool for a larger experimental trial, with potential dissemination of the program via the Internet and hand-held computing devices."
