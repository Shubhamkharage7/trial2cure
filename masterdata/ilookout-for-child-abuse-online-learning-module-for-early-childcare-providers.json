Delivered via a learning management system to early childhood professionals who work with infants and young children, this study assessed iLookOut's effect on 1) knowledge about reporting suspected child abuse; 2) attitudes toward reporting suspected child abuse; and 3) preparedness to protect children at risk.\n\nFindings from Phase 1 were that iLookOut will improved knowledge, changed attitudes, and increase self-reported preparedness of early childhood providers to report suspected child abuse.\n\nPhase 2 of this trial is an open-enrollment study that records pre-/post- data on the same measurements as Phase 1, and is available for use (free of charge) for all childcare providers in Pennsylvania at https://www.ilookoutforchildabuse.com.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite their daily interactions with young children, little research has been conducted into early childhood professionals' (ECPs') knowledge of, and attitudes towards, reporting of child abuse/neglect. This study:\n\n1. Evaluates the effectiveness of the online learning module, iLook Out for Child Abuse, created to train and inform early childhood providers about reporting suspected child abuse;\n2. Identifies early childhood providers' current knowledge regarding Pennsylvania law on mandated reporting of suspected child abuse;\n3. Explores the factors influencing early childhood providers' current knowledge and attitudes;\n4. Evaluates the impact of an online educational program on early childhood providers' knowledge, attitudes, and patterns of decision-making regarding mandated reporting of suspected child abuse;\n5. To explores the factors influencing the impact of an online educational program on early childhood providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding mandated reporting of suspected child abuse"
