Implantable shunts, the gold standard treatment, often fail, leading to multiple trips to the emergency room and repeat surgeries. There is no technology available today that can easily assess CSF flow in shunts wirelessly, bedside, and without capital equipment until now.\n\nFlowSense, is a wireless, noninvasive thermal flow sensor that can be mounted on a patient's neck overlying the shunt to detect the presence and magnitude of CSF. Similar in size to a bandage, it is composed of soft, silicone with no hard edges. Data is wirelessly transmitted to a custom designed mobile app. With FlowSense, monitoring of shunt function can occur in clinics, in-patient settings, and emergency departments, thereby reducing unnecessary imaging, hospital length of stay, and readmission costs.",

Neurosurgically implanted shunts, the standard treatment, often fail. Patients with failed shunts show nonspecific symptoms, including headaches, dizziness and nausea.
