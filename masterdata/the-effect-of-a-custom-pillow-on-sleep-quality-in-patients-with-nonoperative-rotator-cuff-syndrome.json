Informed consent will be obtained. There will be two groups of patients in this study; those that receive the pillow sleep aid (the intervention group) and those that do not (the control group). The pillow sleep aid that will be investigated in this project is the \"MedCline Shoulder Relief System,\" a product of Amenity Health Inc.. The pillow will be delivered to the intervention group at no cost. Patients in both groups will be prescribed the same physical therapy protocols. At the end of the trial period, patients in the control group will be offered the option to receive a pillow. Those that accept will be surveyed at similar intervals as the original intervention group."
