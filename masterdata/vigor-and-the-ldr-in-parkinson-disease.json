            "briefSummary": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a common disorder in which reduced speed of movement results from inadequate brain production of the chemical dopamine. The most effective treatment for PD is the drug levo-dopa, which partially replaces brain dopamine. Despite decades of successful use, how levo-dopa improves speed of movement in PD is not understood. This observational study recruits participants who have been prescribed levo-dopa by their treating physicians. Before their first dose, immediately after their first dose and later, when their dose has been stabilized, they will engage with the research team to participate in a few simple experiments to measure speed, grip strength, tremor, and stability (on and off of treatment). The purpose of these experiments is to understand how levo-dopa treatment in Parkinson disease enhances movement speed. An important but not understood component of levo-dopa action, the Long Duration Response (LDR), lasts for days to weeks. A basic function of dopamine signaling in the brain is modulation of motivation - the coupling between effort and action values. These experiments will determine if the LDR is associated with relative normalization of motivation function in the brain. The motivation behavior of recently diagnosed PD participants will be examined before and after treatment with levo-dopa to determine if the magnitude of the LDR is correlated with improvements in motivation behavior.",
            "detailedDescription": "Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) is the standard symptomatic treatment for early to moderate Parkinson disease (PD). In early to moderate PD, the most important DRT component is the Long Duration Response (LDR), a pharmacodynamic effect that builds up over the course of days-weeks and can be induced by dopamine agonists. Despite its effectiveness, DRT actions are poorly understood and the basis of the LDR is unknown. As the LDR wanes in advancing disease, PD patients develop troublesome motor fluctuations and increasing disability. Improved understanding of the LDR has the potential to prolong the duration of its effects and could have a significant positive effect on clinical practice.\n\nThe kinetics of the LDR suggest long-term plastic changes in striatal function. Recent studies of striatal dopamine actions in PD subjects and experimental animals indicate that striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission regulates \"vigor,\" the force, velocity, or amplitude of actions. Vigor is closely allied to the concept that striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission mediates motivation, which involves the assessment of act utility and the appropriate scaling of actions to perceived rewards. Recent theoretical and experimental results suggest that tonic striatal dopamine signaling, mimicked by dopamine agonist administration, is a key determinant of movement vigor. Convergent clinical pharmacologic and experimental data lead to a strong hypothesis that the LDR results from chronic DRT partially restoring motivational coupling of effort to perceived reward and movement vigor. Prior experiments examining vigor in PD subjects did not take the LDR into account, resulting in incomplete examinations of the role of vigor deficits in PD.\n\nRecent non-human primate work on the control and vigor of saccadic eye movements indicates the existence of basal ganglia circuit changes that stably encode motor action values for prolonged periods. Striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission is critical for establishing this remarkably stable form of value-action coupling. This phenomenon is a plausible circuit level mechanism underlying the LDR.\n\nOur long-term goal is to understand the clinically relevant actions of DRT. The primary objective of our proposal is to test the hypothesis that the LDR results from partial restoration of normal action vigor by reinstating the link between motivation and effort. Our secondary objective is to explore potential mechanisms underlying the LDR. The rationale for these experiments is that better understanding of the LDR, a clinically crucial component of DRT action, will lead to improved symptomatic therapy.\n\nWe will study recently diagnosed PD subjects. All subjects will undergo standard evaluations of clinical, cognitive, and motivational features. Subjects will perform incentive motivation tasks assessing movement vigor in response to monetary incentives. Two complementary tasks, one based on modulation of movement velocity and one based on modulation of grip strength, will be employed. To assess whether the recently described stable action-value coupling for saccades is relevant to the LDR, subjects will perform a task that measures saccadic eye movement vigor in response to stable value signals learned prior to LDR induction. Subjects will perform all tasks before and after LDR induction in both the \"practical off\" and post-acute treatment states.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To use incentive motivation tasks to evaluate the coupling between motivation and movement vigor in recently treated PD subjects before and after LDR induction.\n\nHypothesis 1A: LDR induction will result in partial restoration of movement vigor in response to monetary incentives in PD subjects in the \"practical off\" state.\n\nHypothesis 1B: The magnitude of partially restored movement vigor in response to monetary incentives will correlate with reduced bradykinesia in PD subjects in the \"practical off\" state.\n\nHypothesis 1C: Identical effects will be found with an incentive motivation task based on movement amplitude and one based on grip strength.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To use a saccadic eye movement task to assess saccadic eye movement vigor in response to stable value signals in recently treated PD subjects before and after LDR induction.\n\nHypothesis 2: LDR induction will result in partial restoration of saccadic eye movement vigor in response to previously learned stable value signals in PD subjects in the \"practical off\" state.\n\nValidation of our hypotheses would have considerable impact by identifying a specific functional process underlying the LDR and a potential mechanism of the LDR. This will facilitate research into LDR mechanisms, provide a rational basis for developing valid animal models of the LDR, and open a new path towards improved symptomatic management of PD."
