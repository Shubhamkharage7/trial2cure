The investigators are planning to administer the demographic questionnaires and psychological instruments to Veteran participants before the healing intensives. Psychological instruments will be administered immediately pre-intervention, pre- and post-session for each session, post-intervention, 90, 120 and 360 days post-intervention. The primary aim is to assess for statistically significant changes pre- to post session and pre- to post-intervention."
