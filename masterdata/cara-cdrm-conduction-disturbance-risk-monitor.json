            "detailedDescription": "Data to be collected during the study procedure for both stages:\n\n1. Pre-procedure:\n\n   1. Demographics, medical history, cardiac history, medications\n   2. Cardiac CT raw data to be collected from all the pre-procedure CT scans performed in Medical Centers and from out-of-hospital sources (if available).\n   3. In hospital 12 lead ECG\n2. Procedure:\n\n   During the procedure, the 12 lead ECG will be recorded processed, and displayed on the Cara monitor that is connected to Norav NR-1207-3 ECG Holter System. The Hemodynamic and Fluoroscopy monitors will be recorded on a commercially available video recorder.\n3. Post-procedure (in hospital)\n\n   1. After the procedure patients will continue to be connected to a commercially available to a commercially available 14 days ambulatory Holter monitor (AEM) (e.g. Bittium Faros\u2122 ; MoMe\u2122 Kardia) and will remain with the patient after the discharge for 14 days.\n   2. Hospital standard 12 lead ECG will be recorded after the procedure, downloaded and collected by the study team.\n4. Post-procedure - out of hospital:\n\n   At discharge, patients will stay connected to the ambulatory Holter monitor (AEM) (Bittium Faros\u2122; MoMe\u2122 Kardia ) for 14 days post-procedure. Holter will be collected from patients at the end of the 14-day recording and its data downloaded and collected.\n\n   Patients will be followed according to the current medical practice.\n5. Follow-up according to the current medical practice a. 30 days follow-up hospital visit: i. Cardiac echo (if available) ii. 12 lead ECG b. 6 month - Clinical FU phone call c. 12 months Clinical FU phone call\n\nConduction Disturbances (CD) outcome will be subdivided into:\n\n1. PPM or High-Grade AV Block (HGAVB)\n2. All other new onset (or deterioration) of CD that are not listed in #1\n3. No new onset CD"
