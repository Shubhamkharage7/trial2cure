The investigators will use a novel application of a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, adapted to a screening validation study. The investigators will conduct a large-scale study to validate the TAPS-ESP against established diagnostic and biomarker metrics, replicating the design of the seminal English-language TAPS study."

TAPS-ESP scores will be validated against the modified World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) including alcohol, tobacco, and 9 substance categories. The CIDI items mapped to the diagnostic criteria for each substance will serve as the primary criterion standard for validation of the TAPS-ESP. For detecting CIDI-derived substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis, we will examine TAPS-ESP cut-points for the 4-item screener and the assessment in detecting problem severity defined by CIDI for detecting different tiers of substance use: Problem use (1+ criteria), SUD (2+ criteria), and moderate-to-severe SUD (4-11 criteria).
