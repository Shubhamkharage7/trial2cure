            "briefSummary": "This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Maya Perinatal Cognitive Behavioral Skills App, a novel app for pregnant and postpartum individuals experiencing difficulties with mood, anxiety, or stress. Participants will complete the 12-module app to learn evidence-based strategies previously shown to help manage mood and anxiety. Assessments will include app feedback questionnaires, feedback interviews, a daily symptom tracker, and symptom measures. The study investigators hypothesizes that participants will find content to be helpful in developing skills to manage anxiety and mood difficulties during the perinatal period, and that the app interface, session structure, and pacing will be acceptable and feasible for this population. It is further hypothesized that increased Maya Perinatal Cognitive Behavioral Skills App use, engagement, and satisfaction will be associated with lower self-reported anxiety and mood symptoms.",
            "detailedDescription": "Individuals who are pregnant or postpartum are at a high risk of anxiety and mood difficulties. This has been linked to negative effects on the individual, developing baby (both in the womb and after birth), and family system. Despite this, there are significant barriers to getting mental health support while pregnant or as a new parent, particularly for those in disadvantaged communities. This study seeks to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel mobile health app among individuals who are pregnant or postpartum. The Maya Perinatal Cognitive Behavioral Skills App has been adapted from a previously studied Maya Cognitive Behavioral Skills App to specifically address the unique experiences of the perinatal population. The app includes 12 skill-based sessions using principles from cognitive behavioral therapy, an evidence-based treatment that can effectively address anxiety and mood symptoms. The app will be tested by pregnant and postpartum individuals, who will provide feedback on feasibility and acceptability. Participants will also complete screening measures assessing anxiety, mood, and trauma, which will be examined in the context of app use and engagement. Participants will be recruited from a range of settings in hopes of capturing a diverse sample in terms of race, cultural background, and financial means. Results will be used to inform future versions of the app to better suit this population."
