The Magnap device consists of a neodymium-iron-boron rare earth magnet with a ferromagnetic directional back-plate encased in titanium. The device will be implanted surgically on the hyoid bone. Following surgery, the patient is fitted with a custom, removable external neck accessory containing a second magnet, which is worn during sleep and prevents airway collapse by attracting the internal hyoid magnet with sufficient force to keep the airway open ."
