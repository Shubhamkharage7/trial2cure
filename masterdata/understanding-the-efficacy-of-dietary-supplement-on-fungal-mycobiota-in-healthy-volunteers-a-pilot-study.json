            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to explore how the dietary supplement L-Phenylalanine affects the production of the metabolite phenylpropionic acid (PPA) and changes in fungal populations in the gut microbiome.",
            "detailedDescription": "The human gastrointestinal tract hosts a diverse microbial community that has a role in influencing the host's pathophysiological responses. Although there is an abundance of metagenomic data available, the functional dynamics of the gut microbiota still need exploration in different conditions. The microbiota produces various metabolites from dietary products, impacting both host health and pathophysiological functions. The metabolites produced by different microbiota may selectively suppress or stimulate the growth of some components of the gut microbiome, ultimately influencing the dynamic of gut bacterial and fungal populations. Our lab is specifically interested in a metabolite, known as phenylpropionic acid (PPA) produced by a human gut resident bacteria known as Clostridium sporogenes. C.sporogenes produces PPA by metabolizing the amino acid, L-phenylalanine, which is sourced from human diet. Many studies have observed the antimicrobial and antifungal effects of PPA. Our lab determined the antifungal activity of PPA through decreased levels of Candida albicans in the mouse gut. We are interested in investigating how diversity in mycobiota populations, which focuses on the fungi species in the human gut, are related to changes in PPA levels.\n\nTherefore, this study will assess whether additional oral supplementation of L-Phenylalanine has any effect on the way C. sporogenes metabolizes phenylalanine. Healthy subjects will receive a 14-day supply of L-phenylalanine supplements and will provide stool and blood samples to the study team."
