The study will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of DF-003 (study drug). DF-003 will be administered orally (PO), once daily (QD) for 28 days (4 weeks). Patients will be followed up for 8 weeks after administration of the last dose of study drug.\n\nA total of 8 patients will be evaluated in one cohort. The cohort will have a minimum of 6 patients. Additional patients (maximum of 12 patients) may be enrolled in the event of insufficient data after a review of safety data by the Study Safety Committee. Patients will receive loading doses of 140 mg DF-003 on Days 1, 2, and 3, followed by a maintenance dose of 45 mg DF-003 starting on Day 4 through Day 28. Individual dose modification is not allowed in this study."
