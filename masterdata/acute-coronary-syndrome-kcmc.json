Patients who presented to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) will be asked to complete a survey about barriers and facilitators of health care. In addition the survey will be administered to all providers, policymakers, and administrators participating in in-depth interviews. Data from this survey will be used to develop a quality improvement intervention that will be piloted by KCMC staff. Six months after the pilot program is implemented providers, patients, and administrators will be interviewed for their perspectives on the program."
