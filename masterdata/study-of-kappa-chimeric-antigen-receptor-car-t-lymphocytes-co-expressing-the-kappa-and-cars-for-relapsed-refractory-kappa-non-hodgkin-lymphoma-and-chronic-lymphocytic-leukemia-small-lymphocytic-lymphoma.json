            "briefSummary": "This study will combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective treatment. The treatment tested in this study uses modified T-cells called Autologous T Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor (ATLCAR) cells targeted against the kappa light chain antibody on cancer cells. For this study, the anti-kappa light chain antibody has been changed so instead of floating free in the blood, a part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the lymphoma cells is attached to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way, it is called a chimeric receptor. The kappa light chain chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells are called ATLCAR.\u03ba.28 cells. These cells may be able to destroy lymphoma cancer cells. They do not, however, last very long in the body so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells to increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called an anti-kappa light chain. This anti-kappa light chain antibody usually floats around in the blood. The antibody can detect and stick to cancer cells called lymphoma cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called kappa light chains.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving the ATLCAR.\u03ba.28 cells is safe and tolerable and learn more about the side effects and how effective these cells are in fighting lymphoma. Initially, the study doctors will test different doses of the ATLCAR.\u03ba.28, to see which dose is safer for use in lymphoma patients. Once a safe dose is identified, the study team will administer this dose to more patients, to learn about how these cells affect lymphoma cancer cells and identify other side effects they might have on the body.\n\nThis is the first time ATLCAR.\u03ba.28 cells are given to patients with lymphoma. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has not approved giving ATLCAR.\u03ba.28 as treatment for lymphoma. This is the first step in determining whether giving ATLCAR.\u03ba.28 to others with lymphoma in the future will help them.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a single center, open-label phase 1 clinical trial designed to determine the safety of escalating doses of autologous activated T lymphocytes (ATLs) expressing the chimeric antigen receptor specific for the kappa-light chain of human immunoglobulins (CAR.\u03ba) in subjects with relapsed/refractory kappa-positive (\u03ba+) mantle cell and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). During dose finding, up to 12 subjects will receive a single infusion of ATL product expressing the CAR.\u03ba encoding the CD28 co-stimulatory endodomain (CAR.\u03ba.28). The starting dose will be 5.0 \u00d7 105 cells/kg. Up to 3 dose levels of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells will be tested with at least 3 subjects enrolled in each dose cohort before dose escalation is considered based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Prior to receiving the cell product, subjects will undergo lymphodepletion with fludarabine and bendamustine or cyclophophamide. Dose escalation will be guided by the modified 3+3 design. Any dose level may be expanded to 4-9 subjects to obtain more data at that dose or to include subjects for which insufficient cells are manufactured to enroll on their assigned higher dose level. If due to the expansion the estimated DLT rate at a dose is \u22650.33, the study would not escalate to the next highest dose level and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) would be exceeded. If needed, an expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects at the RP2D to further assess safety and efficacy of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of progression free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS). The persistence of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells in the peripheral blood will be assessed as an exploratory objective. The final RP2D including expansion data will be the dose with the DLT rate closest to 0.2.\n\nThe adoptive transfer of T cells targeting the kappa light chain (CAR.\u03ba) is a promising treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory \u03ba + NHL and has shown encouraging preclinical activity \\[37\\]. The CD8\u03b1 stalk incorporated into CD28 signaling domain within the CAR, may improve the persistence of the CAR.\u03ba T cells. Therefore, subjects in this study are being infused with this newly modified version of CAR.\u03ba.28 so that persistence and efficacy will be improved compared to the older version of the CAR.\u03ba molecule.\n\nWe hypothesize that CAR.\u03ba.28 will be well tolerated in subjects with relapsed/refractory indolent and aggressive lymphomas positive for the kappa light chain and will show efficacy. We also anticipate that CAR.\u03ba.28 will show fast expansion in the peripheral blood in the first 2 - 3 weeks, but also longer term persistence than the previous version of CAR.\u03ba.28.\n\nIn this phase 1 single center study, peripheral blood will be collected for production of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells prior to conditioning chemotherapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory \u03ba+ indolent lymphoma including follicular lymphoma grade 1-3b, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. During the approximately 1-2 months necessary for CAR-T cell production, subjects may undergo standard of care treatment (\"bridging therapy\") per physician's discretion. Subjects must sign consent forms before cells are procured and again prior to undergoing lymphodepleting chemotherapy and cellular treatment. At 2-14 days (preferably 2-4 days) after lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine, we will infuse the CAR.\u03ba.28 cell product. Subjects in this study will receive CAR.\u03ba.28 cell product in one of the three planned dose escalation cohorts. Dose levels of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells administered will range between 5.0 \u00d7 105 cells/kg and 2 \u00d7 106 cells/kg. These doses have been evaluated in previous phase 1 studies of CAR-T cell lymphocytes \\[37-39\\] including a phase 1 trial targeting the kappa light chain on malignant B cells in which the construct included the CD28 co-stimulatory endodomain \\[37\\]. An expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects at the RP2D to further assess safety and efficacy of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells. In all subjects, we will measure the persistence of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells in the peripheral blood at different time points by measuring the level of the transgene and by phenotypic analyses.\n\nOUTLINE\n\nCell Procurement Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained from subjects for cell procurement. In subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood, a leukapheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for apheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes.\n\nLymphodepleting Regimen Subjects will receive a \"pre-conditioning\" cytoreductive regimen of bendamustine 70 mg/m2/day administered IV followed by fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered IV over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be administered per institutional guidelines. Prophylaxis (e.g., hydration, antiemetics, etc.) needed prior to fludarabine and bendamustine chemotherapy will be provided per institutional guidelines. At the discretion of the clinical investigator, subjects with a known history of intolerance to bendamustine may be considered for lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day administered IV followed by an IV dose of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be administered per institutional guidelines.\n\nCell Administration The cellular product consisting of CAR.\u03ba.28 cells will be administered by a licensed healthcare provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 5 - 10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line. The volume of infusion will depend upon the concentration of the cells when frozen and the size of the subject. The expected volume will be 1-50cc.\n\nPost lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will receive CAR.\u03ba.28 cells within 2 - 14 days, but preferably within 2-4 days, after completing the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen.\n\nDuring dose finding, a single dose of CAR.\u03ba.28 will be given after lymphodepletion. The cell dose levels that will be evaluated are outlined below.\n\nExpansion Cohort, CAR.\u03ba.28 will be given after lymphodepletion. Subjects will receive the RP2D.\n\nDuration of Therapy\n\nTherapy in LCCC1811-ATL involves a single cell infusion of CAR.K.28 cells. Treatment with at least one infusion will be administered unless:\n\n* Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or\n* General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.\n\nDuration of Follow-up Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years for RCR evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. In addition to this follow-up, subjects removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.\n\nSubjects who experience unequivocal disease progression and start alternate therapy after receiving a cell infusion still be required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures."
