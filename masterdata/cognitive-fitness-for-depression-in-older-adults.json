The investigators are also interested in whether participating in the treatment will result in changes to brain activity measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",
            "detailedDescription": "Major depression in the elderly is both challenging to treat and detrimental to the cognitive functioning of patients. Major depression increases the probability of a later dementia diagnosis. By targeting cognitive processes in treatment, the investigators hope to both find a more effective means to manage major depression in older adults, but also demonstrate how top-down processes (e.g., Executive Control Network) may be driving depression and cognitive decline in older adults.\n\nThe investigators are recruiting older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment. All subjects must have at least mild depressive symptoms to be eligible to participate. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two different interventions.\n\nResults of this study will help the investigators understand the mechanisms that contribute to depressed mood and cognitive change in older adults with late life depression."
