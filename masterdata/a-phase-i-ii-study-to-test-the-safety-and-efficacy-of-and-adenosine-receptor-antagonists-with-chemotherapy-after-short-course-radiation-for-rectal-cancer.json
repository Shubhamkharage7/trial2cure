This will be followed by consolidation chemotherapy (weeks 3-20) with mFOLFOX x9 cycles in combination with AB928 and AB122. Patients will thereafter be assessed for therapeutic responses (week 22-24) with a digital rectal examination, pelvic MRI, and endoscopy. Each case will be reviewed by the Weill Cornell Medicine Colorectal Multidisciplinary Tumor Board for consensus agreement regarding clinical treatment response. The patients thereafter will proceed with total mesorectal excision (TME, week 24) by transabdominal resection for pathologic evaluation (primary tumor and pelvic lymph nodes will be examined)."
