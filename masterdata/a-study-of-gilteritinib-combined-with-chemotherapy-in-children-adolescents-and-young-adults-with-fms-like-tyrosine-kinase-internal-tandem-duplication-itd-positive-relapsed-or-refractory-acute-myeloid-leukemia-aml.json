The purpose of the phase 2 portion (dose expansion) is to determine complete remission (CR) rates and composite complete remission (CRc) rates after two cycles of therapy. The study will also assess safety, tolerability and toxicities of gilteritinib in combination with FLAG, evaluate FLT3 inhibition, assess pharmacokinetics (PK), perform serial measurements of minimal residual disease, obtain preliminary estimates of 1-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rate and assess the acceptability as well as palatability of the formulation.\n\nOne cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment. A participant completing 1 or 2 treatment cycles in phase 1 or 2 will have the option to participate in long term treatment (LTT) with gilteritinib (for up to 2 years)."
