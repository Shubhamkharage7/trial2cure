History of gene therapy, intracranial antisense oligonucleotide treatment, cell transplantation, or experimental brain surgery.\n16. Current untreated or unstable depressive disorder or a serious mood disorder requiring hospitalization.\n17. Other primary degenerative dementia or neurodegenerative conditions outside of the specific basket in which the participant is enrolled, where applicable.\n18. Other uncontrolled infectious, metabolic, or systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system, such as syphilis, hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and other laboratory values.\n19. Any other medical, psychiatric, or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to unfavorably alter the risk-benefit of participation, to interfere with protocol compliance, or to confound safety or efficacy assessments.\n\nAdditional exclusion criterion for the subset of treatment-naive participants only:\n\n1. No prior treatment to manage motor symptoms of PD; note that brief periods of dopaminergic therapy administered to establish diagnosis are not grounds for exclusion.",
