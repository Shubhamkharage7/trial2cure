The primary objective is to test whether the C-peptide response to a 2-hour mixed meal tolerance test, will be improved in participants with new onset T1D who are treated with Abatacept after Rituximab-pvvr compared to those treated with Rituximab-pvvr and placebo 24 months after enrollment.",

Additional aims will compare the safety, tolerability in the two treatment arms as well as other clinical metabolic measures: exogenous insulin use, hemoglobin A1c, time in range from continuous glucose monitors, and severe hypoglycemia. Exploratory studies will assess changes in immune markers."
