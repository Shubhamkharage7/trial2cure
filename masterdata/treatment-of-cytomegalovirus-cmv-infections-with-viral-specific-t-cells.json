CMV-specific T-cells will be isolated from donor leukapheresis products using the CliniMACS\u00ae Prodigy. Prior studies on transfer of CMV specific T-cells have been shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of CMV infections.\n\nThe main trial objective is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of CMV-specific T-cell transfer in adult and pediatric participants suffering from CMV infections or reactivation following HSCT or due to other immunocompromised states (e.g.; primary immunodeficiency, cytotoxic therapy).\n\nParticipants will be followed for one year."
