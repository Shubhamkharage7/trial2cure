            "detailedDescription": "Eligible patients are those who have measurable solid tumors as detected by CT or MRI that have persisted, recurred, or metastasized despite therapy. Patients must have histologically confirmed advanced and/or metastatic melanoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and other solid tumors with palpable, visible or ultrasound detectable lesions. Also, patients with solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy and for which no existing conventional therapy are eligible. Melanoma patients who were previously treated with IMLYGIC (Talimogene laherparepvec, T-Vec) but did not achieve an optimal response to T-Vec are eligible to receive BS006.\n\nThe study will be conducted in 2 parts as described below. Both parts will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period and a follow-up period (safety and long-term follow up). Treatment period of Part 1 will include an initial treatment period (3 doses of BS006) and an optional extended treatment period (repeated every 2 weeks). Subjects will be treated for up to 12 months."
