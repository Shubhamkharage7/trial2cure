            "briefSummary": "The present study investigates how individual differences in cognitive processing contribute to the efficacy of working memory training programs in an older adult population. In a randomized crossover design, different types of working memory training interventions will be evaluated within the same participants.\n\nAdding game-like elements to working memory training programs can increase motivation and engagement, which can increase learning. However this process, termed gamification, adds sensory complexity that can lead to increased mental load and/or distraction in older adults. Investigators hypothesize that gamification of training tasks will be beneficial to some and counterproductive to other participants. The investigators will test two models; the first assumes that participants with difficulty inhibiting distracting information will show better learning and transfer when assigned to non-gamified training, whereas those with more distractor tolerance will show better learning and transfer when assigned to gamified training. The second model states that the outcomes of the intervention will be better predicted by performance on measures of general cognitive ability.\n\nIn a separate study, the investigators will compare working memory training that contains rich, multisensory information with a training program that contains only visual information. Here they will also test two models; the first assumes that participants with difficulty binding two stimulus streams will show better learning and transfer when assigned to visual-only working memory training, whereas participants who do not have this difficulty will show better learning and transfer when assigned to multisensory working memory training. The second model states that the outcomes of the intervention will be better predicted by performance on measures of general cognitive ability.",
            "detailedDescription": "Three randomized cross-over trials will be conducted to obtain within-subject comparisons of training with enriched (game-like) versions of working memory training tasks compared to basic (non-gamified) versions of these tasks. In the N-back trial, participants will be assigned to Non-Gamified N-back training and Gamified N-back training. In the Span trial, they will be assigned to Non-Gamified Span training and Gamified Span training and in the Multisensory trial, they will be assigned to Non-gamified Unisensory N-back training and Non-gamified Multisensory N-back training.\n\nEach trial involves a total of 50 sessions per participant: the first few sessions consist of completing questionnaires and computerized cognitive assessments (pre-test). Participants then complete 20 sessions of working memory training. After a mid-test, they complete 20 sessions of a different type of working memory training. Post-test is administered upon training completion, and at least a month later, participants complete 3 follow-up sessions. The study can be administered either in person or remotely; however, the investigators anticipate that most participants will complete the study remotely."
