            "briefSummary": "The Y Balance Test for the lower quarter (YBT-LQ) is a movement screen used to assess an athlete's risk for injury. The YBT-LQ is a dynamic balance test where the participant stands on a single leg and with the opposite lower extremity reaches are far in the anterior direction as they can, and this value is measured. The process is repeated in the posterior medial, and the posterior lateral directions. The final values are controlled for leg length of the participants. The YBT-LQ has been shown to be predictive of lower extremity injury in high school basketball players, but it is typically used as part of a battery of tests to determine the athlete's overall injury risk, but more questions remain to be answered. The research question: Is the YBT-LQ predictive of concussion in high school athletes? What are the norms for YBT-LQ in high school athletes? Does history of concussion effect YBT-LQ? Is the YBT-LQ with visual perturbations predictive of concussions? Is the YBT-LQ with visual perturbations predictive of lower extremity injury? What is the impact of visual perturbations on Y-balance and its injury prevention capability?\n\nThe target student participants will be 9th through 12th grade students; however, 6th to 8th grade students will be allowed to participate depending on the school or organization request. Informed consent will be obtained reiterating that participation is voluntary. Testing utilizing the YBT-LQ will occur, and sport of participation, age, height, weight, dorsiflexion, and leg length will be obtained. Follow up will be made via the athletic trainers and school personnel to indicate the effected athletes. Once the post-test follow up is complete athletes will be able to see their pre-test scores, and any questions will be answered at that time. This will be a longitudinal study where testing will take place at least two times per year, preferably three times per year over 4 years."
