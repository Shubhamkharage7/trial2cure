The Entarik FT is equipped with sensors designed to provide information about the location of the tube tip relative to the stomach, thus assisting in reducing the incidence of misplacement during first positioning.

The size of the feeding tube should be determined clinically, and the Entarik Feeding Tube should only be placed if that size is appropriate.\n* Suitable to start enteral (gastric but no post-pyloric) feeding\n* Anticipated to receive enteral feeding (either bolus or continuous feeds) for more than 6 hours and conclude the enteral nutrition while in the care of the ICU. If enteral nutrition has already been initiated, indicated for replacement of an NG feeding tube Note: Both subjects on a ventilator (non-invasive or invasive ventilation) or not requiring a ventilator are eligible for this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* inability to receive a feeding tube including subjects with known history of issues such as esophagitis or strictures, frequent nose bleeds, basilar skull fracture or GI bleeding disorders\n* Known major upper airway malformation\n* Known major GI abnormality, upper GI malignancy, or partial gastric resection\n* History of gastroparesis\n* Currently pregnant\n* NPO status - expected to remain NPO for the following 72 hours.\n* Patient needs an MRI in the immediate future (e.g., 6-12h) where placement of the feeding tube (non-MRI compatible) is going to mandate replacement with standard feeding tube\n* Critically ill, facing imminent death\n* Deemed unsuitable for enrollment in study by the investigator based on subject's history (e.g., active anticoagulation therapy) or physical examination",
