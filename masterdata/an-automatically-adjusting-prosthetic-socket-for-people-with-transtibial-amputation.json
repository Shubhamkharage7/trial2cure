They can also cause limb problems like pain or skin breakdown. Prosthetic socket systems that accommodate limb volume changes can help address these issues, but they require users to make adjustments throughout the day. The aim of this research is to create a system that will automatically adjust the fit of the socket and create a well-fitting prosthesis for people with leg amputations who experience volume fluctuations when using their prosthesis."
