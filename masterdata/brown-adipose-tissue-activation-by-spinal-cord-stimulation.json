            "detailedDescription": "This research study aims to investigate possible activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism by upper thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS). We believe that our multidisciplinary research team presents a unique opportunity to test whether SCS can activate BAT metabolism, as tested during a routine screening procedure for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for pain control. Our marker for BAT activation is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) - positron emission tomography (PET), which has previously been used to gauge cold-evoked BAT activation, and other studies of BAT in humans. We believe this proof-of-concept study could pave the way for a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of morbid obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus."
