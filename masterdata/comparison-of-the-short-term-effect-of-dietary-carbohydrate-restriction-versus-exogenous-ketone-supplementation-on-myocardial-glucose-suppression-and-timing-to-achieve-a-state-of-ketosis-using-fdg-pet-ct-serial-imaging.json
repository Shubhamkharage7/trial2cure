            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test different methods of preparation that can be used prior to a test called an FDG PET/CT scan. FDG PET/CT scans are routinely done for evaluation of heart inflammation. Standard preparation for the scan includes a ketogenic (high fat and low carbohydrate) diet for 24 hours and overnight fasting to help suppress the amount of sugar taken up in the heart muscle. However, Investigator still do not know if this preparation is the most effective method. So the Investigator, want to investigate alternative methods for decreasing the amount of sugar uptake seen in the heart during FDG PET/CT scan, thus, investigator will have participants try up to 3 different methods of preparation prior to the FDG PET/CT scans to see which type of preparation works the best."
