In addition, non-target AK lesions may be present in the treatment field, including up to two severe AK lesions \u2265 4 mm. For each severe AK lesion (\u2265 4 mm), a biopsy must be taken for confirmation of diagnosis. The treatment field (continuous or in several patches) totaling approx. either 80 cm\u00b2, 160 cm\u00b2 or 240 cm2 must be within one effective illumination area of the BF-RhodoLED\u00ae XL but may require up to three illuminations with the BF-RhodoLED\u00ae. All AK target lesions and, if applicable, severe AK lesions \u2265 4 mm located in the treatment field should be clearly distinguishable, without restrictions on the distance between lesions, and should have a minimal distance of 1 cm to the border of the treatment field.\n3. All sexes, \u2265 18 years of age.\n4. Willingness to undergo a 2 mm punch biopsy for each (up to two) severe AK lesion \u2265 4 mm, if applicable, at the screening visit.\n5.

Topical treatment with ALA or ALA esters (e.g., methyl aminolevulinic acid (MAL)) inside the treatment field within 3 months.\n   2.

Start of topical administration of a medication with hypericin or other drugs with phototoxic or photoallergic potential inside or in close proximity (\\< 10 cm distance) to the treatment field within 4 weeks. Subjects may, however, be eligible if such medication was applied for more than 4 weeks prior to screening without evidence of an actual phototoxic/photoallergic reaction.\n9. Any use of the systemic treatments within the designated periods prior to screening:\n\n   1. Cytostatic or cytotoxic drugs within 6 months.\n   2. Immunosuppressive therapies or ALA or ALA esters (e.g., MAL) within 12 weeks.\n   3. Drugs known to have major organ toxicity within 8 weeks.\n   4.
