            "briefSummary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading neurodegenerative disease of aging characterized by multiple cognitive impairments. Given the recent failures of disease-modifying drugs, the current focus is on preventing or mitigating synaptic damage that correlates with cognitive decline in AD patients. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive, non-painful electrical stimulation of the brain that is shown to act as a primer at the synaptic level when administered along with behavioral therapy, mostly involving language, learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that tDCS over the left angular gyrus (AG) improves language associative learning in the elderly through changes in functional connectivity between the AG and the hippocampus. The investigators' previous clinical trial on the effects of tDCS in neurodegenerative disorders has also shown augmented effects of lexical retrieval for tDCS. In the present study the investigators will compare the effects of active vs. sham tDCS over the AG-an area that is part of the default mode network but also a language area, particularly important for semantic integration and event processing-in two predominant AD variants: probable AD with amnesic phenotype (amnesic/typical AD) and probable AD with non-amnesic (language deficit) phenotype also described as logopenic variant PPA with AD pathology (aphasic/atypical AD). The investigators aim to: (1) determine whether active high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) targeting the left AG combined with a Word-List Learning Intervention (WordLLI) will improve verbal learning; (2) identify the changes in functional connectivity between the stimulated area (AG) and other structurally and functionally connected areas using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; (3) identify changes in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at the stimulation site using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, the investigators need to determine the characteristics of the people that may benefit from the new neuromodulatory approaches. For this reason, the investigators will evaluate neural and cognitive functions as well as physiological characteristics such as sleep, and will analyze the moderating effects on verbal learning outcomes. Study results can help provide treatment alternatives as well as a better understanding of the therapeutic and neuromodulatory effects of tDCS in AD, thus improving patients' and caregivers' quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigation implements a double-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design that allows for the evaluation of the cognitive and neural effects of word-list learning as modulated by tDCS compared to sham stimulation. Participants in all groups will receive word-list learning intervention (WordLLI)+ High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) or WordLLI+ sham in Period 1 or 2, randomized for the Period 1 stimulation condition. Each learning Period will last 2 weeks, with 5 learning sessions per week (for a total of 10 learning sessions per Period) with a 3-month (stimulation-free) wash-out period between the two Periods. The intensity, total number of learning sessions and number of learning items is consistent with most other tDCS studies in neurodegenerative disorders and the investigators have used this design successfully over the past 7 years in neurodegenerative disorders (PPA, mild AD). Stimulation is implemented every weekday to take advantage of the long-term potentiation induced by tDCS as found in early multi-session studies. A tDCS-only condition (without any intervention) is not implemented in this design because no study to date has shown improvement on motor, cognitive, or language performance after anodal tDCS-only for 2 or even more weeks. After each period the investigators will perform 1-month and 3-month follow-up sessions for evaluation purposes. For those participants who are long-distance, at the 1-month time point only the investigators may use a video conferencing tool such as GoToMeeting to administer the assessments. This is to mitigate the costs of travel for a short appointment."

It involves differentiating between previously learned images and novel images. For the MST tasks, the Pattern Separation (PS) score will be calculated using two measures: a) the rate of similar items correctly identified minus the rate of similar items misidentified as new (S\\|S-S\\|N); b) the rate of similar items correctly identified minus the rate of similar items misidentified as old (S\\|S-O\\|S). The number of correct responses for each category of items (i.e., old, similar, new) and the type of errors (i.e., identifications of new items as similar; identification of similar items as old) will also be tracked. Change in outcome in percent difference will be computed between the scores before intervention and each time point after. Increase in scores is considered a benefit.",
