            "briefSummary": "Methylation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is involved in both the biological encoding of childhood adversity and neuroplasticity following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This research will characterize BDNF methylation during recovery from TBI in children and investigate this novel biomarker as a potential biological mechanism underlying the known association between childhood adversity and poorer neurobehavioral outcomes following TBI in childhood. Findings from this research will contribute to an improved understanding of why some children display good recovery following TBI, whereas many others suffer from chronic neurobehavioral impairments.",
            "detailedDescription": "Unexplained heterogeneity in outcomes following pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most critical barriers to the development of effective prognostic tools and therapeutics. The addition of personal biological factors to our prediction models may account for a significant portion of unexplained variance and advance the field towards precision rehabilitation medicine. The overarching goal of the Epigenetic Effects on Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Recovery (EETR) study is to investigate an epigenetic biomarker involved in both childhood adversity and post-injury neuroplasticity to better understand heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes following pediatric TBI. The primary hypothesis is that childhood adversity will be associated with poorer neurobehavioral recovery in part through an epigenetically mediated reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in response to TBI.\n\nEETR is an observational, prospective, longitudinal concurrent cohort study of children aged 3-18 years with either TBI (n=200) or orthopedic injury (n=100), recruited from the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Participants complete study visits acutely and at 6- and 12-months post-injury. Blood and saliva biosamples are collected at all time points-and CSF when available acutely-for epigenetic and proteomic analysis of BDNF. Additional measures assess injury characteristics, pre- and post-injury child neurobehavioral functioning, childhood adversity, and potential covariates/confounders. Analyses will characterize BDNF DNA methylation and protein levels over the recovery period and investigate this novel biomarker as a potential biological mechanism underlying the known association between childhood adversity and poorer neurobehavioral outcomes following pediatric TBI."
