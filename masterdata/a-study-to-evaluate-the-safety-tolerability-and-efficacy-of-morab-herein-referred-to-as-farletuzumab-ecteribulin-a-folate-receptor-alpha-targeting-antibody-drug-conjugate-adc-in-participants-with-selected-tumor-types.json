(divided in two parts: Part A \\[OC and EC participants\\] and Part B \\[EC only\\]): Part A: to evaluate other farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) treatment regimens for safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in participants with OC and EC; to evaluate the use of the addition of short course of oral corticosteroids following every dose of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) administered every 21 days, as mitigation strategy for interstitial lung disease (ILD); and to select treatment regimens with farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) for further evaluation in Part B. Part B: to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of 2 treatment regimens with farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) in participants with advanced EC and to determine the recommended treatment regimen for further development of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202)."
