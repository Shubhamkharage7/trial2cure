The investigators hypothesize that a go-slow gentle approach to starting treatment in such patients, starting with just Isatuximab and dexamethasone with a gentle introduction to lenalidomide third cycle onwards, may improve treatment adherence and quality of life. The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if a go-slow approach to treating MM in ultra-frail patients may improve the ability to adhere to treatment and improve quality of life."
