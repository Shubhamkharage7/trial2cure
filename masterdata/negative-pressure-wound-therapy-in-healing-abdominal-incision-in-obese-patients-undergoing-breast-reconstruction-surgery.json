Long-term follow-up on wound healing complications.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive wound care with a standard dressing (bandage) after surgery for 7 days.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) after surgery for 7 days.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and at 1 and 3 months."
