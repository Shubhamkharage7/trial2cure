This study will evaluate the feasibility of guiding therapeutic intervention electronically facilitated symptom and disease monitoring in patients being followed on Active Surveillance. Additionally, we will develop a tissue and data resource to support discovery and hypothesis generation to evaluate germline and/or somatic alterations in relation to cancer-specific and overall outcomes..",

Monitor cancer-specific outcomes of men who meet consensus criteria for active surveillance under one of three categories: 1) low or very low-risk prostate cancer, 2) intermediate risk with patient consent, or 3) severe medical comorbidities and high-risk localized prostate cancer or patient desire, despite recommendation\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n1. Screen for a relationship between cancer-specific and clinical outcomes related to selected comorbidities.\n2. Determine the feasibility of electronically facilitated symptoms and disease monitoring to guide therapeutic intervention and prompt therapeutic course correction.\n3. Develop a tissue and data resource to support discovery and hypothesis generation focused on germline alterations, somatic alterations, and/or the interaction between the two in determining cancer-specific and overall outcomes"
