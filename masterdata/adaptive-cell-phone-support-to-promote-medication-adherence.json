The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* How should the intervention be designed to best fit patients' needs and preferences?\n* Is an adaptive intervention (personalizing the intensity of support based on patients' needs) efficacious for promoting medication adherence Researchers will compare the adaptive intervention to automated text message reminders see if the adaptive intervention shows stronger positive effects on medication adherence.",
            "detailedDescription": "An initial cohort of adolescents with chronic health conditions will be asked to try the intervention and give feedback to refine the structure and content. Then, a larger cohort will progress through a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial to 1) be randomized to either automated text reminders (active control condition) or computer-delivered Cell Phone Support and then 2) those in the computer-delivered Cell Phone Support condition who do not show a sufficient response will be re-assigned to continued computer-delivered Cell Phone Support only or to Adaptive Cell Phone Support ( computer-delivered Cell Phone Support + responsive human coaching)."
