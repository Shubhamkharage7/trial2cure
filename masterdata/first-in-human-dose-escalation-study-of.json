            "briefSummary": "Open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of AN4005 in patients with advanced tumors. This study is a first-in-human, dose escalation study with the objective to establish the MTD and/or RP2D of AN4005.\n\nExcept for Dose Level 0 (50 mg), a traditional \"3 + 3 design\" will be utilized for dose finding with dose escalation and/or de-escalation as appropriate.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study, one sentinel patient will be dosed at 50 mg first, then increasing doses of AN4005 will be administered to cohorts of 3 subjects, at doses ranging from 100 mg twice daily (BID) to 600 mg BID (see the table below). The proposed starting dose, 50 mg BID, has been selected based on integrated data from nonclinical studies. If 50 mg BID for one cycle is deemed to be tolerable upon review of safety data, the dose of AN4005 will be escalated to 100 mg BID in a cohort of 3 patients, and further dose escalations will be performed in separate cohorts based on review of data from all preceding cohorts. The dose escalation will be conducted in a sequential manner. Intermediate dose levels (decrement) may be explored. Decisions with regard to dose escalation to next dose level will be made jointly by the investigators and the sponsor. AE data collected for approximately 90 days following the end of exposure will also be used to inform the final dose and schedule. A minimum of 6 patients will be treated at the MTD/RP2D."

In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.\n* Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female study patients, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n* Using a combination of any two of the following:\n\n  * Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), and\n  * Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.\n  * Hormonal contraception methods (e.g., oral, injected, implanted).\n\n    12. A male participant must agree to use contraception during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of the study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Have received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational oncology agents within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n\n   Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to \u2264 Grade 1 or returned to baseline. Participants with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia may be eligible.\n3. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed since CAR-T infusion and subjects must have experienced disease progression, and not have residual circulating CAR-T cells in peripheral blood (based on local assessment). Any encountered treatment-related toxicities must have resolved to Grade \u22641.\n4. Have received prior palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u2264 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease.\n5. Uncontrolled tumor-related pain.\n6. Have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Non live COVID vaccinations or boosters should not occur within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and during Cycle 1.\n7. Are currently participating in a study of an investigational agent or investigational device within 4 weeks or less than 5 half-lives, prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n   Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been at least 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent (see Number 2 above).\n8.
