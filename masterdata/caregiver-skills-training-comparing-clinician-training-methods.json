            "briefSummary": "Caregiver Skills Training (CST) is an evidence-based intervention for parents of young children with developmental disabilities that was developed through a collaboration between Autism Speaks and the World Health Organization. The intervention is typically offered by Facilitators who are trained and supervised by CST Master Trainers. This study seeks to use a remote training model to compare two training and supervision processes. One group, comprised of facilitators from rural settings, will be trained and supervised by two master trainers from the University of Pittsburgh using a remote training model. A second group, comprised of facilitators from an agency serving primarily low-income households and located near Pittsburgh, will be trained and supervised in a face-to-face manner. Both groups will initially receive ten 90-minute training sessions over a 2-month period and will subsequently receive 1 hour per week of supervision while conducting their first 12-session CST group. Outcome measures will include assessment of change in caregiver stress and didactic skills as well as improvement in each child's communication/social skills, functional skills, and overall behavior. We have also added an additional research question in which we compare face-to-face CST sessions with remote CST sessions.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are two aspects to this study: First, the investigators will compare two training and supervision processes. One group, comprised of facilitators from rural settings, will be trained and supervised by two master trainers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Center for Autism and Developmental Disorders (CADD). A second group, comprised of facilitators from an agency serving primarily low-income households and located near Pittsburgh, PA, will be trained and supervised in a face-to-face manner. Both groups will receive 15 hours of training spread over the course of 2-3 months (in summer 2023). The focus of these sessions will be to introduce and train staff on the CST model, ensure their understanding of the curriculum, and to help them gain proficiency in administration. During the training phase, both groups will practice administration of activities and will be provided feedback. The master trainers will also assist the newly trained facilitators in navigating recruitment and organization of their first CST groups. Upon initiation of the CST groups, facilitators will receive 1 hour of supervision per week, either in person or via TEAMS. Supervision will extend over the 9 group sessions and 3 home visits per family (fall 2023). These supervision sessions will allow the facilitators to ask questions, obtain feedback, and troubleshoot any challenges. The investigators will also collect pre and post measures (baseline and week 12) from the parents participating in the CST groups to determine if the type of training provided to the facilitators (face-to-face versus remote) impacted parent progress. We have also added an additional research question in which we compare face-to-face CST sessions with remote CST sessions."
