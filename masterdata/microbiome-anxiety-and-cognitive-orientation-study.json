            "briefSummary": "Mounting evidence shows that the gut microbiome plays an important role in communication within the gut-brain axis. However, the relationship between gut microbiota and their influence on anxiety is still not fully understood. Recent studies on mice found a specific microbe-produced molecule, 4-ethylphenyl sulfate (4EPS), can induce anxious behavior. 4EPS is produced by gut microbes in mice and humans. Research suggests higher 4EPS levels may strongly be associated with anxiety levels. However, anxiety is far more complicated than changes in a single molecule. There are many more factors to consider when it comes to anxiety, including various aspects of one's lifestyle and how humans perceive their environment (cognitive orientation). The primary research goal is to better understand the effects 4EPS has on human anxiety behavior and the role cognitive orientation has in connection to anxiety.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to expand and improve upon previous research on gut bacteria and their connections to anxiety. The Investigators will examine the gut microbiota and its vital role in the gut-brain axis, the link between a gut-derived bacteria (4EPS) and anxiety, and the connections between cognitive orientation and anxiety. It is hypothesized that even though higher 4EPS levels may be associated with anxiety levels in humans, such levels may be more prominent (severe) or less pronounced (less severe) in humans with variations in lifestyle and cognitive orientation.\n\nCross-sectional data will be compiled from a cognitive assessment (COSEC), a health/lifestyle survey, a generalized anxiety questionnaire, a depression questionnaire, and a stool sample. Stool samples will be analyzed for 4EPS levels. Using the COSEC assessment, we will divide the subjects into nine groups of unique cognitive styles based on their perception and conception scores. Then, depending on their 4EPS level and their survey responses, the relationship between the level of 4EPS and their cognitive traits will be analyzed. COSEC is a cognitive propensity and behavioral preference diagnostic tool designed to understand people's various tendencies that occur during the process of perceiving the environment and responding in action.\n\nThe long-term goal of this project is to find connections in the gut-brain axis and gain a deeper understanding of microbiome metabolites as neurodegenerative agents, as they affect anxiety levels in humans. No other studies have been performed to date combining these research areas or their impacts on humans."
