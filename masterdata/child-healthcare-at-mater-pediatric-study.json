Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected at multiple time points. The efficacy of group well child care to improve health and healthcare-related outcomes will be evaluated.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-site cluster randomized controlled trial. Over an 18-month period, 108 pregnant women receiving treatment for opioid use disorder will be identified, screened, and enrolled into the study. Beginning with the birthdate of the first infant born in the study, 18 consecutive 1-month birth intervals will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two study arms: (1) group well child care or (2) individual well child care. Nine birth clusters will be randomized to individual well child care(control arm) and nine birth clusters will be randomized to group well child care(intervention arm), with concealment of randomization from enrolled participants until they give birth. All study participants will be included in the study until their child is approximately 18 months of age. All study participants will have a total of 5 assessment visits with research personnel; visits will occur immediately following enrollment into the study (baseline), prior to the participant's child turning 1 month of age, and within 4 weeks of the participant's child turning 6, 12, and 18 months of age. The efficacy of group well child care to improve health and healthcare-related outcomes will be evaluated."
