            "briefSummary": "Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are routinely used in radiation treatment delivery workflows to align patients with the treatment beam. Conventional CBCT image quality is sufficient for this task but not good enough for other radiotherapy-related tasks, such as contouring anatomical structures and calculating radiation dose distributions. HyperSight is a new CBCT imaging system manufactured by Varian Medical Systems. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the integration of the HyperSight imaging system with Varian's TrueBeam radiotherapy system, a linear accelerator with a C-arm gantry that rotates about the patient to delivery radiation to the target malignancy. HyperSight CBCT images will be acquired prospectively from patients who are receiving radiation treatment. The HyperSight/TrueBeam system will be used for imaging only; patients receive their radiation treatment on cleared devices and no aspect of their treatment is affected by participation in the study. HyperSight images collected during the study will be evaluated for quality and utility and compared to conventional CBCT images as well as fan beam CT images used for treatment planning."
