Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety/tolerability of pembrolizumab in unresectable patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma who do not have pre-existing autoimmune diseases.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity (response rate) of pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma.\n\nII. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. We will test archival or fresh tumor tissue for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nII. We will perform Guardant360 blood analysis on patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma to determine if any particular genetic mutations correlate to toxicities or clinical outcomes to pembrolizumab.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nParticipants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 weeks for 1 year and then every 3 months for up to 3 years."

This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current pneumonitis.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.
