            "briefSummary": "Spinal cord associative plasticity (SCAP) is a combined cortical and spinal electrical stimulation technique developed to induce recovery of arm and hand function in spinal cord injury.\n\nThe proposed study will advance understanding of SCAP, which is critical to its effective translation to human therapy. The purpose of the study is to:\n\n1. Determine whether signaling through the spinal cord to the muscles can be strengthened by electrical stimulation.\n2. Improve our understanding of the spinal cord and how it produces movement.\n3. Determine whether spinal surgery to relieve pressure on the spinal cord can improve its function.\n\nAim 1 is designed to advance mechanistic understanding of spinal cord associative plasticity (SCAP).\n\nAim 2 will determine whether SCAP increases spinal cord excitability after the period of repetitive pairing. In rats, SCAP augments muscle activation for hours after just 5 minutes of paired stimuli.\n\nWhereas Aims 1 and 2 focused on the effects of paired stimulation in the context of uninjured spinal cord, Aim 3 assesses whether paired stimulation can be effective across injured cord segments. Aim 3 will incorporate the experiments from Aim 1 and 2 but in people with SCI, either traumatic or pre-operative patients with myelopathy in non-invasive experiments, or targeting myelopathic segments in intraoperative segments.",
            "detailedDescription": "For people with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), regaining hand function is their highest priority. Currently there are no effective treatments for people living with paralysis or profound weakness after SCI. The goal of this project is to translate a promising therapy for improving arm and hand function after partial spinal cord injury to humans. The approach promotes repair of residual brain to spinal cord connections using combined motor cortex and spinal cord stimulation.\n\nThe direct brain to spinal cord connection is critical for skilled hand movement in health, and for the loss of movement after injury. After spinal cord injury, many nerve connections for movement are preserved. These connections can be strengthened by electrical stimulation.\n\nThe investigator has previously demonstrated that pairing brain and spinal cord stimulation strengthens spinal connections in rats. But it is unknown whether this is also applicable in humans. This study is designed to test this in people undergoing spine surgery for pain or decreased movement as well as non-invasively in people with traumatic spinal cord injury. There are three main goals of this project. First, the investigator will stimulate brain and spinal cord (intra-operatively and non-invasively) to try to study the influence of the timing of pairing brain and spinal cord stimulation. Second, the investigator will study how repeating the optimal timing (spinal cord associative plasticity; SCAP) will influence muscle responses over a longer period of time when relatively uninjured parts of the spinal cord are targeted. Finally, the investigator will study how the influence of this protocol changes when injured parts of the cord are targeted. Stimulation of brain and spinal cord intra-operatively will be performed with the same devices that maintain safety during the surgery, while non-invasive stimulation will be performed with non-significant risk devices.\n\nParticipants: Uninjured volunteers, individuals with chronic (\\> 1 year) cervical SCI, and individuals with cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy requiring clinically indicated decompressive surgery will be recruited. SCI and myelopathy participants will have partially retained motor function in the hand, scoring 1-4 (out of 5) on manual muscle testing of finger extension, finger flexion, or finger abduction in left or right hand. Participants will also require detectable F-wave responses of the left or right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) to median nerve stimulation and/or first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) to ulnar nerve stimulation."
