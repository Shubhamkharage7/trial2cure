            "briefSummary": "The investigators are studying the dangers that farmworkers face while working in the fields and at home. The investigators goals are:\n\n1. Measure how much heat and chemicals farmworkers in Imperial County are exposed to.\n\n   The investigators will ask the participants to wear a special belt under their clothes during work to measure heat. The investigators will also put two small temperature monitors in the participant's home for a day. The investigators will collect a urine sample to check hydration, and also measure the participants height, weight, blood pressure, and some blood markers for diseases using a simple finger-prick test.\n\n   To measure chemicals, the investigators will give the participants a wristband to wear for a week and hang another in the participants home. The investigators will also collect dust from each participant's home with a vacuum. Then, the investigators will analyze everything at San Diego State University.\n\n   After collecting samples, a trained community health worker will ask the participants a few questions about their work, lifestyle, health symptoms, and any hazards they face. The investigators will meet the participants twice at their homes to distribute the tools which will later be collected. Once the tools are collected, the investigators will have the chance to follow up with the participants if they have any questions.\n2. Provide help to lower heat and chemical exposure with the help of community health workers.\n3. Measure heat and chemicals again using the same methods to see if the project made a difference.\n4. Talk to participants about what they liked and how the investigators can make future projects better."

In addition to the educational materials, the investigators will give each farmworker cooling working gear to be worn during their work-shift with (specialized clothes that has been used in other occupational settings).
