            "detailedDescription": "This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in which 360 individuals with moderate or severe MUD will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1) extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol\u00ae) plus once daily oral extended release bupropion (BUP-XL) tablets (the XR-NTX/BUP-XL group) or 2) both the matching injection placebo (iPLB) and once daily oral placebo (oPLB) tablets (the iPLB/oPLB group). The study intervention consists of a 12-week treatment phase. It is hypothesized that the XR-NTX/BUP-XL arm will be associated with a greater number of \"responders,\" defined as participants who provide at least 3 MA-negative urine drug screens (UDS) out of 4 samples obtained during the evaluation period (i.e., Weeks 11-12) of the 12-week long treatment phase, relative to the iPLB/oPLB arm. Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of the extended release naltrexone plus bupropion XL (XR-NTX/BUP-XL) arm compared to the iPLB/oPLB arm on safety, other substance use outcomes, depression scores, quality of life, overall functioning, clinic attendance, and medication adherence."
