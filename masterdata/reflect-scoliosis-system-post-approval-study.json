            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this multi-center, prospective, single-arm registry Post-Approval Study (PAS) is to evaluate the radiographic and clinical outcomes of 100 patients with idiopathic scoliosis treated with the REFLECT\u2122 Scoliosis Correction System, as a condition of HDE approval",
            "detailedDescription": "The REFLECT\u2122 Scoliosis Correction System is designed for continued growth and mobility of the spine as well as straightening of the spine by holding the segments in a more natural anatomic position using non-rigid materials. REFLECT\u2122 uses a growth modulation technique in which growth of the patient is used to achieve progressive scoliosis correction.\n\nThe REFLECT\u2122 Scoliosis Correction System is indicated for skeletally immature patients who require surgical treatment to obtain and maintain correction of progressive idiopathic scoliosis, who have a major Cobb angle of 30 to 65 degrees whose osseous structure is dimensionally adequate to accommodate screw fixation, as determined by radiographic imaging. Patients should have failed bracing and/or are intolerant to brace wear.\n\nA total of 100 patients will be prospectively enrolled and treated at a minimum of 5 U.S. sites, with a maximum of 20 subjects at any one site, with sequential enrollment from each site. Patients will be followed for 5 years with evaluations at the following timepoints: preoperative, intraoperative, immediate postoperative (first erect), 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 60 months. Primary and secondary outcomes from 100 patients enrolled and treated with REFLECT\u2122 will be summarized."
