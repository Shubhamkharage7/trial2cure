Evaluation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) status as a biomarker of response to therapy.\n\nIII. Evaluation of HPV clearance as a surrogate endpoint.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4 cycles (24 weeks)."

Note: no testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant",
