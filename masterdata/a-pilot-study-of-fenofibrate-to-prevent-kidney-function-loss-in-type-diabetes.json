            "briefSummary": "Diabetic kidney disease remains the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), rising in frequency in parallel with the epidemic of diabetes worldwide. The estimated lifetime risk of kidney disease in persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been reported to be as high as 50-70%, although risk may be lower in excellent care environments. Two previous studies have suggested that a generic drug used to lower fats in blood (fenofibrate) may protect the kidney from damage due to diabetes. These data, however, were obtained among people with type 2 diabetes with clinical characteristics optimized for cardiovascular studies. Thus, a clinical trial specifically designed to evaluate the effects on the kidney is required to firmly show that this drug can prevent kidney damage in T1D. The goals of the present pilot study are to demonstrate the feasibility of such trial, gather essential information for designing and planning this study, and generate preliminary data. To this end, 40 participants with T1D and early-to-moderate diabetic kidney disease (DKD), at high risk of ESKD, will be enrolled at two clinical sites and assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with fenofibrate or placebo for 18 months. Kidney function will be measured at the beginning and at the end of the study to evaluate the effect of fenofibrate.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite improvements in the past 20 years in glycemic and blood pressure control, and the introduction of \"reno-protective\" drugs such as renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB), the overall incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains high. To seek new treatments to prevent diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and/or slow its progression to ESKD in T1D, the investigators have established a unique consortium of high-quality academic centers, which has been named PERL (Preventing Early Renal Function Loss in Diabetes) to emphasize the focus on intervening relatively early in the course of DKD in T1D, when renal damage can more likely be slowed or stopped. Findings from the FIELD and ACCORD trials suggest a reno-protective effect of the PPAR-alpha agonist fenofibrate, raising the exciting possibility of using this inexpensive generic drug to prevent GFR decline in persons with T1D. These data, however, were obtained through post-hoc analyses of type 2 diabetes (T2D) populations with clinical characteristics optimized for CVD studies. Thus, a clinical trial specifically designed to evaluate effects on GFR decline is required to firmly establish a DKD indication for fenofibrate in T1D. As a first step, the investigators are conducting a pilot study including 40 participants with T1D and early-to-moderate DKD, at high risk of ESKD, who will be enrolled at two of the PERL sites and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with fenofibrate or placebo for 18 months, followed by a two-month washout. The goal of this pilot study are to:\n\n1. Define the nature of the acute effect of fenofibrate on kidney function. It remains unclear whether the eGFR reduction observed at the beginning of fenofibrate treatment is an artifact of fenofibrate-induced changes in creatinine production and/or renal tubular handling, or corresponds to an actual reduction in GFR. This controversy, which has crucial implications for the pivotal trial design, will be resolved by directly measuring GFR by plasma iohexol disappearance - a methodology in which PERL sites are experienced.\n2. Generate further data on the long-term effects of fenofibrate on GFR decline in persons with T1D and DKD who are at high risk of rapid GFR decline and ESKD. The positive effects of fenofibrate in FIELD and ACCORD were observed in individuals who were not selected for having DKD and who, if untreated, had a mean GFR decline barely above the physiological decline due to aging. To make a compelling case for a pivotal trial for kidney outcomes, it is crucial to generate preliminary data on the effectiveness and safety of this drug in persons selected for having DKD and being rapidly progressing towards ESKD.\n3. Determine the effects of fenofibrate on biomarkers of increased risk of fast GFR decline. A salutary effect of fenofibrate on one or more of these biomarkers will corroborate any trend of a fenofibrate benefit identified in Aim 2.\n\nThe results of this pilot will allow the investigators to seek support for a pivotal trial to establish a kidney indication for fenofibrate in T1D."
