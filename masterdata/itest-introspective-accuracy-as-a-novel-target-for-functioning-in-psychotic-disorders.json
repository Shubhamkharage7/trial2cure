            "briefSummary": "People with psychotic disorders experience a high level of functional disability, and a major contributor to this disability is introspective accuracy, which is defined as inaccurate judgements of one's abilities and performance on tasks. Yet, no intervention has directly targeted introspective accuracy for psychotic illnesses. This trial will evaluate a new intervention, called iTEST, that uses mobile devices to train people with psychotic disorders to improve introspective accuracy and, ultimately, functional outcomes",
            "detailedDescription": "This NIH-supported clinical trial is the first phase of a two phase program, funded by Development of Psychosocial Therapeutic and Preventive Interventions for Mental Disorders, R61/R33. The overarching goal is to evaluate a new blended mobile intervention that is aimed at improving introspective accuracy (IA) in people with psychotic disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving functional outcome. Introspective accuracy is the degree to which one's self-assessment of performance or abilities corresponds with objective data. Recent research indicates that poor IA is an independent predictor of functional disability. Yet, there are currently no treatments that directly target IA. Basic experimental research and other lines of evidence suggest IA is malleable, and that improvement in task-based IA transfers to untrained tasks. This project's premise is that task-based IA training could be delivered in a remote mobile health format and coupled with coaching in applying improved IA to real-world functional behaviors, creating a novel avenue for functional rehabilitation in psychotic disorders. The investigators have developed and completed usability testing of iTEST, a novel blended IA targeted mobile intervention. iTEST integrates graduated drill-and-practice training in IA delivered on a mobile device with personalized coaching in applying IA to everyday compensatory behaviors. In the R61 phase trial here, the investigators will recruit people with psychotic disorders with at least minimal functional impairment. The investigators will conduct an open trial of iTEST, evaluating whether the intervention leads to clinically significant changes in task-based IA along with transfer to an untrained task (target mechanisms). The investigators will also determine the dose of intervention needed to achieve clinically significant improvement in IA targets, by evaluating change at 8, 12, or 16 weeks. The go/no go criteria for this trial are 75% adherence and clinically significant increases in introspective accuracy. A total of 60 persons who are diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will be recruited into this trial"
