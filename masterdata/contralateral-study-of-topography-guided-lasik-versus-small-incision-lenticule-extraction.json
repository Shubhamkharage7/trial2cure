Patients will be selected from the Hoopes Vision patient population after a preliminary refractive evaluation has been completed. Patients who express an interest in the study will be consented. After informed consent has been obtained and the patient has completed a screening exam and met all study criteria they will be considered enrolled. Randomization will ensure 50% of Right Eyes will receive Topography-Guided LASIK and 50% of Right Eyes will receive Small Incision Lenticule Extraction. Subjects will be given postoperative care instructions and medications following standard of care practices. Subjects will return for a 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month visit. Retreatments may only occur after all postoperative study visits have been completed and/or the subject has exited the study. At the preliminary screening visit, 1-month, 3-month, and 12-mont postoperative visits, patients will complete a Patient Participant Questionnaire."
