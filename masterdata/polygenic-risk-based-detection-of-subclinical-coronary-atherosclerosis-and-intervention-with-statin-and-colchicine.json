Participants will be randomized into four equal treatment groups: group A receiving a placebo daily, group B receiving rosuvastatin 20mg daily, group C receiving colchicine 0.6mg daily, and group D receiving both rosuvastatin 20mg daily and colchicine 0.6mg daily. The primary outcome is change in total non-calcified plaque volume on coronary computed tomography angiography from baseline to one year. Multiple secondary plaque imaging and biomarker outcomes will be explored in this pilot mechanistic trial."
