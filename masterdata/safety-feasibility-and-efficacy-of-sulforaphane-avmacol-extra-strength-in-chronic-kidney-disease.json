The investigators hypothesize that daily intake of Avmacol ES can decrease kidney disease progression rate and decrease markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. They will test this hypothesis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical trial. This proposed study has been funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), R01 DK128677.",

After having established a safe dose of 4 tablets once daily in participants with CKD Stages 3 - 4 in the pharmacokinetic (PK) phase, the investigators will enroll 100 participants from the Kidney Clinic at the University of Rochester Medical Center and Highland Hospital with CKD stages 3 - 4 who will be randomized to Avmacol ES or placebo in a 1:1 ratio in a blinded manner."
