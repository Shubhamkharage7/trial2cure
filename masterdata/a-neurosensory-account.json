            "detailedDescription": "This study includes Expt. 1a \\& Expt. 1b to address Aims 1\\& 2--intrinsic and novelty-related SC disinhibition and SPA pathology in PTSD.\n\nThe investigators will recruit 80 healthy subjects and 80 patients with PTS randomized, double-blind, controlled design, where tACS will be delivered at individual alpha peak frequency (active condition) and random frequency (1-200 Hz; random noise stimulation/RNS; active control condition), randomly assigned across subjects in each group. Simultaneous EEG- fMRI recordings during the resting state (Expt. 1a) and during the novelty task (Expt. 1b) will be acquired before and after tACS/RNS.\n\nDuring tACS/RNS, stimulation electrodes will be placed inside the holders of the BrainProducts EEG cap attached to the head of the participant. A very weak (completely tolerable and often unnoticeable) electrical current will be applied to the scalp via the stimulation electrodes.\n\nOverall, this study will take a basic neuroscience approach to investigate pathological mechanisms underlying PTSD"
