E-cigarettes use heated vapor to deliver nicotine. Information gained from this trial may help inform regulators of the potential risks and benefits of switching smokers at high risk for lung cancer to electronic cigarettes. This research also may help inform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) how best to regulate e-cigarettes with the goal of improving public health.",

To characterize the effects of switching from combustible cigarettes (CCs) to e-cigarettes (ECs) on product use, product acceptability, and reinforcement among adult daily CC smokers at high risk for lung cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To characterize the effects of switching from CCs to ECs on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress among adult daily CC smokers at high for lung cancer.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize metabolomic changes that result from switching from CCs to ECs among CC smokers at high risk for lung cancer.\n\nII. To character which factors moderate or mediate the effects of switching from CCs to ECs among CC smokers at high risk for lung cancer.\n\nOutline:\n\nParticipants are assigned to switch to e-cigarettes."
