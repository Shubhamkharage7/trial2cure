            "briefSummary": "This single arm observational pilot study aims to determine the longitudinal effects of androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) in men with advanced prostate cancer. The primary outcome for this trial is physical function, which will be evaluated at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes including body composition, muscle function, balance, arterial stiffness and patient reported outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this pilot trial is to obtain objective measurements of physical function in men with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) initiating ARSI treatment at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks later. Grip strength, muscular power, body composition, balance, arterial stiffness, along with QoL, fatigue, anxiety, and depression will also be measured. Finally, the potential associations in primary and secondary outcomes by the type of ARSI, stage of mPC, and physical activity levels will be explored.\n\nWith more men requiring ARSI treatment for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), as well as being an efficacious option earlier in metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), accurate estimates of declines from ARSI initiation are required to determine the true effects. Utilizing novel assessments in mPC like muscular power tests will provide insight into potentially more relevant assessments and outcomes to intervene on. The data from this pilot study will also determine effect sizes to adequately power future studies."
