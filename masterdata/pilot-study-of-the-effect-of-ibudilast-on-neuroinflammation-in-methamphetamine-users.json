Right now, there are no medications that a doctor can give someone to help them stop using methamphetamine. More research is needed to develop drugs for methamphetamine addiction. Ibudilast (the study drug) is a drug that could help people addicted to methamphetamine.\n\nThe investigators are interested to know if the study drug can help some symptoms that methamphetamine can cause, specifically inflammation in the brain. Inflammation has been shown to affect decision-making. The study drug has anti-inflammatory properties, however it is not yet known whether the drug will reduce inflammation in the brain."
