Prior IL-2 is permitted.\n* Prior therapy with intravesical BCG within 6 weeks of treatment.\n* Positive test for hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HBV surface antigen (HBV sAg) test or positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) using HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or HCV antibody test indicating acute or chronic infection.\n* Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n* History of allergy to study drug component or history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.\n* Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant as evidenced by a positive pregnancy test within 14 days of first dose.\n* Male subjects who are unwilling to use contraception during the treatment and for at least 31 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (5 half-lives of study drug plus 90 days duration of sperm turnover).\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not using a medically acceptable means of contraception throughout the study treatment and for at least 23 weeks following the last dose of study treatment (5 half-lives of study drug plus 30 days duration of ovulatory cycle).\n\n  * WOCBP are defined as those who have experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal.
