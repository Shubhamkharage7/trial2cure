The FloPatch FP120 device uses ultrasound and the Doppler effect to non-invasively assess the flow of flood. In this study, the FloPatch FP120 will be applied to the neck at the location of the carotid artery on cardiac arrest patients in the emergency department. FloPatch FP120 data will be compared with arterial line blood pressure to assess for accuracy of pulse checks among cardiac arrest patients in the emergency department.",

In this study, the FloPatch FP120 will be applied to the neck at the location of the carotid artery on cardiac arrest patients in the emergency department. This study will determine the peak systolic velocity, as measured by the FLoPatch FP120 device, that is associated with a systolic blood pressure of \u226560 mmHg on a femoral arterial line in cardiac arrest patients during a pulse check. The associated accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the calculated pulse systolic velocity to detect return of spontaneous circulation with a systolic blood pressure \u226560 mmHg in cardiac arrest."
