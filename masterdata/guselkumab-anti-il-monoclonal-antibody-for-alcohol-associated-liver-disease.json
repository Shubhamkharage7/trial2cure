This drug is approved for the use in psoriatic arthritis but not for alcoholic liver disease. The investigators will be using a standard 3+3 phase I dose escalation trial design, the dose levels will start from 30 mg, 70 mg and to 100 mg, a maximum total of 24 patients will be evaluable. In this study the investigators propose to establish safety of the product in those with alcoholic liver disease and efficacy (secondary endpoint) will be determined by biomarkers for liver inflammation and fibrosis surrogate biomarkers."
