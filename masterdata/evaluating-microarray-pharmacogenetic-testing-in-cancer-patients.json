The target population is adults \u226518 years of age who have received or will be receiving standard of care single-gene DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase) PGx testing to help guide dosing for their cancer treatment. Pharmacogenes that will be reported back to participants and providers from the microarray test are expected to take approximately one week and will be evaluated by the PGx team and uploaded to the participant's electronic medical record (EMR). Only clinically actionable results per CPIC and FDA guidelines will be included in the participant report. Participants will be followed on study for approximately 6 months to collect data on the number of drug prescriptions with known drug-gene interactions and potentially actionable results, BPAs fired, and actions taken due to BPAs."
