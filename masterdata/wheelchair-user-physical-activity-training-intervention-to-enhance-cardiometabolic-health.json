            "briefSummary": "The goal of the study is to improve cardiometabolic health outcomes for wheelchair users and identify strategies for achieving sufficient physical activity intensity during bouts of structured physical activity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Wheelchair users have a higher risk for obesity and cardiometabolic health-related diseases compared to persons without a disability and remain one of the most sedentary populations in the United States. Engaging wheelchair users in physical activity levels following the current recommendations to achieve cardiometabolic health-related changes requires tailoring and supports in an accessible community environment, but it is unclear if a community-based physical activity intervention that also prioritizes intensity levels is best to improve cardiometabolic health. This project will determine the effects and implementation outcomes of a community-based, intensity-controlled aerobic and strength training intervention on the cardiometabolic health of wheelchair users and will significantly advance public health knowledge of how to engage wheelchair uses in physical activity to reverse or prevent cardiometabolic health-related disease.\n\nThe aims of the study are to:\n\n1. Compare the effectiveness of the intensity-controlled physical activity training (IPAT) group to the education and access (EA) group for improving cardiometabolic-related health outcomes.\n2. Identify barriers and facilitators to wheelchair users engaging in physical activity at a community-based accessible gym.\n3. Examine the moderators (i.e., age, race, gender, duration of disability, wheelchair type, and physical function) and mediators (ie., self-efficacy, motivation, and barriers/facilitators) of the proposed intervention to understand for whom and how the intervention was effective.\n\nA hybrid I RCT will be conducted. One hundred and ten individuals with a physical disability requiring the use of a wheelchair will be recruited. Each participant will be randomized into either a 14-week IPAT group (n=56) or a 14-week EA group (n=54). Participants' cardiomrespiratory, body composition, metabolic blood chemistries and strength will be assessed baseline (T1) and post intervention (T2)."

Tailored sessions will be created for each participant based on their physical fitness, goals, preferred exercise equipment and results from their baseline assessment. Each session can include vitals, pain assessment, warm-up, aerobic training, strength exercises and a cool-down. The participants will be monitored to ensure they are achieving at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity weekly.
