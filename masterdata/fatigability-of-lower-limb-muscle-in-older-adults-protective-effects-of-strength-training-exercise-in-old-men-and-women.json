            "briefSummary": "The proposed studies will assess 1) the mechanisms for the age-related increase in fatigability during dynamic exercise (Aims 1 and 2) and 2) the effectiveness of high-velocity resistance training coupled with blood flow restriction (BFR) in improving muscle power output and fatigability in older adults (Aim 3). The first two aims are cross-sectional studies comparing young (18-35 years old) and older adults (\u226560 yrs old) to test our central hypothesis that the greater accumulation of metabolites and increase in fatigability in older adults is due to either age-related impairments in skeletal muscle bioenergetics (Aim 1) and/or vascular dysfunction (Aim 2). These two aims will integrate techniques to assess whole-muscle bioenergetics (31P-MRS) and in vivo vascular function (near infrared spectroscopy; NIRS and doppler ultrasonography) with in vitro assessment of single fiber bioenergetics (epifluorescence microscopy) and vasoreactivity of isolated skeletal muscle arterioles (video microscopy). We will then determine whether bioenergetics, vascular function and fatigability are altered in older men and women in response to 8 weeks of resistance exercise training of the lower limb both with and without blood flow restriction (Aim 3)."
