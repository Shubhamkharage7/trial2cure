            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to develop and test an 8-week sedentary behavior reduction intervention (\"Sit Less\" program) for patients with type 2 diabetes. The program aims to reduce and break sitting times among this population using an objective activity monitor and mHealth. The investigators will test the program to help diabetes patients break up sitting time, reduce daily sitting time, and move more. The investigators will also study preliminary effects of the SB reduction intervention on light physical activity, cardiometabolic markers and patient-centered outcomes, and whether diabetes patients like the program and can follow it.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose to develop and conduct a pilot study to test a wearable technology-based sedentary behavior reduction intervention in type 2 diabetes patients. The participants in the first cohort (n=15), 'Sit Less Version 1' will be randomized to either the control group or the sedentary behavior reduction intervention group. The intervention group will target a 120 minute per day reduction in sedentary behavior using an objective activity monitor and mHealth. The study will have an iterative design process with multiple cohorts. Cohort 2 (n=10) and cohort 3 (n=10) participants will participate in the intervention.\n\nSpecifically, the study aims to: determine the feasibility and acceptability of the sedentary behavior reduction intervention in type 2 diabetes patients by evaluating reach, retention, satisfaction, and compliance with the intervention; evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the sedentary behavior reduction intervention on changes in sedentary time; and explore preliminary effects of the sedentary reduction intervention on physical activity, cardiometabolic markers and patient-centered outcomes."
