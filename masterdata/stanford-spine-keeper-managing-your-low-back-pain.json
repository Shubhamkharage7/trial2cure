            "briefSummary": "Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) are transforming medical research and intervention by allowing constant, instantaneous and personalized access to patients. The investigators have designed a mHealth app (Stanford SpineKeeper) utilizing the Apple ResearchKit and HealthKit platform, which is an open source software framework designed Apple Inc to be used by medical researchers to use for research purposes. The investigators will assess whether a multidisciplinary intervention delivered through the application can help improve quality of life and minimize symptoms in patients with chronic low back pain.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to assess whether a mHealth app based intervention can improve symptoms and quality of life in human subjects. Access to human subjects is critical to the success of this project.\n\nRecruitment:\n\nParticipants will be recruited via the Apple ResearchKit platform. Interested participants who answers \"yes\" to the questions \"Are you having low back pain?\" and \"Have your back pain been an ongoing problem for 6 months or longer?\" are eligible to download the mobile phone application and participate. Patients will provide electronic informed consent via the mobile application . A phone number will be provided for potential participants to call to speak to a live representative.\n\nMaterials\n\nApp Design:\n\nThe investigators designed the mobile phone application to be compatible with the Apple Inc (iPhone operating system \\[iOS\\] 8 or 9) platform - ResearchKit. Our app was based on codes from another Stanford approved ResearchKit study - MyHeart Counts. The ResearchKit platform is set up to help researchers design applications capable of performing HIPAA compliant informed consent, surveys, active tasks, account creation, and passcode pin entry. As in the original MyHeart Counts app, the smartphone consent process used here have been adapted from an opensource toolkit developed by Sage Bionetworks in collaboration with the Electronic Data Methods forum of the AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research \\& Quality). The consent process have previously been reviewed with faculty in the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics.\n\nIntervention:\n\nPatients can choose among or choose to be assigned to 2 tracks for management for their low back pain. The tracks include one focused on relaxation and symptom management, and another track on increasing activity. Each include educational material adapted from various sources from North America Spine Society (NASS), Center for Disease Control (CDC), National Institue of Health (NIH).\n\nPatients will stay in track for 28 days. After this, they may choose to remain in track and continue to perform maintenance activities or to engage in a different track."
