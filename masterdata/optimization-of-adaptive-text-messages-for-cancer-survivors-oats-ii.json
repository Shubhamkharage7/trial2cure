            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates whether an adaptive text-message intervention is useful in helping survivors of colorectal cancers (CRC) eat more whole grain foods and less refined grain foods. Most CRC survivors don't achieve the recommended intakes of whole grains or fiber, even though there is strong evidence that a high-fiber diet rich in whole grains lowers the risk of death from CRC. Dietary interventions are a promising approach for reducing death from CRC, and text message interventions specifically are a promising tool for reaching diverse populations. This trial evaluates a text-message based dietary intervention that continuously adapts message content to be specifically tailored for the participant for increasing whole grain consumption.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the intervention's feasibility and acceptability.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the effect of the intervention on the percent of grains consumed that are whole.\n\nII. Estimate the effect of the intervention on total fiber intake (grams per day \\[g/d\\]).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess convergence of the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nutrition education materials and then receive the adaptive text message intervention for 12 weeks on study. Patients who are food insecure also receive resources for food banks, information about meal delivery programs, and support for applying for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits."
