            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (AMRI) will improve the targeting of brain tumor needle biopsies compared to the standard targeting techniques. Researchers also want to learn how the results of the images and biopsies compare to each other to try to improve the way researchers and radiologists use AMRI images.\n\nThis is an investigational study. The perfusion scan is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently only being used in research.\n\nThere will be no cost to you for the advanced MRI, additional anesthesia, special pathology stains, and/or gene testing for this study.\n\nUp to 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participant is being asked to take part in this study because participant has a lesion in participant's brain which is suspected or proven to be a tumor and participant has been scheduled for surgery to remove it.\n\nSome parts of brain tumors are more aggressive than other parts. A needle biopsy only gets a small part of the brain tumor cells. Doctors (neurosurgeons) want to get a biopsy sample from the most aggressive part of the tumor. Researchers think that AMRI techniques may help to better target the most aggressive part of the tumor for the needle biopsy.\n\nAMRI Scan:\n\nIn addition to the images that will be taken as part of participant's standard of care surgery preparation, participant will have an AMRI scan performed. The AMRI has several parts. There are 2 perfusion scans that use a contrast dye to look at small blood vessels. There is a spectroscopy scan to looks at the chemical make-up of the tumor. There is also a diffusion scan to look at how water moves in the tumor and can see the white matter that connects both sides of brain parts. The AMRI scans are performed in the same way as normal MRI scans and in the same scanner. They can be noisy, but do not feel any different than standard MRI exams.\n\nIn most cases, the AMRI should take less than 1 hour to complete and will be performed within 2 weeks before participant's standard of care surgery.\n\nSurgery During the surgery, the neurosurgeon(s) will use the information collected from the AMRI to decide what area of the brain tumor will be biopsied. The biopsies are only from areas that would normally be cut out during surgery and will not change the way the surgery is done even if participant chooses not to take part in this study. Biopsies (from up to 5 locations, each smaller than participant's thumbnail) will be taken before the tumor is surgically removed. The tumor tissue samples from the biopsies will be tested to learn more about the tumor and optionally the DNA inside(the genetic material of cells - this procedure is described in the optional procedures section below).\n\nAfter the surgery is over, participant will continue to have participant's standard of care follow-up appointments in the neurosurgery clinic.\n\nLength of Study After the biopsy is complete, your active participation on this study will be over. Participant's medical records will continue to be reviewed for up to an additional 5 years.\n\nFollow-Up Medical Record Review:\n\nAfter participant's active participation on this study is over, participant's medical record will be reviewed to learn how participant is doing, what other treatments participant may have had and how they worked, if participant had any new brain problems or if the tumor came back. Researchers will review and record information from participant's medical records for up to 5 years after participant's active participation on this study is over."

Patient is a candidate for cerebral tumor resection with lesion suspected to be or previously biopsy proven to be a primary brain tumor.\n3. Patient is able to understand and give consent to participation in the study.\n4. Patient agrees to undergo, prior to the procedure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, within 14 days and preferably with 3 days of the planned procedure) with perfusion, diffusion and spectroscopic imaging.\n5. Patient has a GFR \\> 60. In patients with moderate renal failure (GFR 30-60), an alternate injection with 2 times half-dose multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine) or gadovist (gadobutrol) will be considered, if a contrast exam is deemed clinically necessary.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The patient is found to have unfavorable anatomy to indicate that stereotactic biopsy could not be safely performed.\n2. Pacemakers, electronic stimulation, metallic foreign bodies and devices and/or other conditions that are not MR safe, which include but are not limited to: electronically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implants, ferromagnetic or electronically operated active devices, metallic splinters in the eye, ferromagnetic hemostatic clips in the central nervous system (CNS) or body, cochlear implants, other pacemakers, insulin pumps and nerve stimulators, non-MR safe lead wires, prosthetic heart valves (if dehiscence is suspected), non-ferromagnetic stapedial implants, pregnancy, claustrophobia that does not readily respond to oral medication\n3. Prior brain tumor treatment, including surgical resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy for a primary brain neoplasm. Previous biopsy will not disqualify the patient from participation. Remote history (\\> 6month) of non-CNS malignancy in remission, without evidence of current/ prior brain metastasis, will also not disqualify patient from participating.",
