            "briefSummary": "This trial studies the effectiveness of two interventions on patient reported outcomes of patient centered communication and decision making about breast cancer treatment. The first intervention consists of enhancements to an existing patient-facing breast cancer treatment decision tool called iCanDecide that supports the management of worry, distress, and anxiety as compared to an existing tool. The second intervention consists of a clinician dashboard that populates information after patients view either website regarding any ongoing issues or concerns.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary and key secondary objectives of the study:\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To demonstrate that the enhanced iCanDecide (iCanDecide-emotional support enhancement \\[ESE\\]) intervention is more effective than the standard version (iCanDecide-standard \\[S\\]) resulting in higher patient knowledge about locoregional treatment risks and benefits.\n\nII. To demonstrate that the activation of the clinician dashboard (CDB) is more effective than not using a CDB, resulting in higher patient knowledge about locoregional treatment risks and benefits.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To demonstrate that the enhanced iCanDecide (iCanDecide-ESE) intervention is more effective than the standard version (iCanDecide-S), resulting in higher patient-reported breast cancer self-efficacy and lower patient reported cancer worry.\n\nII. To demonstrate that the activation of the clinician dashboard (CDB) is more effective than not using a CDB, resulting in higher patient-reported breast cancer self-efficacy and lower patient reported cancer worry.\n\nOUTLINE: This study is a multi-level trial of SHaDES that has two interventions in a factorial or crossed design: 1) an individually randomized patient-level randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the standard version (iCanDecide-S) vs. a version with innovative emotional support enhancements (iCanDecide-ESE), and 2) a clinic-level stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to test a Clinician Dashboard (CDB). Twenty-five surgical practices will be recruited for participation. Practices will be randomized to the timing of the CDB intervention, with some practices initiating the CDB intervention right away, while others may initiate the CDB later or perhaps be randomized to \"no CDB\" period. Clinicians will be asked to use the CDB beginning in the time period to which their practice was randomized and continuing to the end of the study. After registration, clinicians are followed up at 9 and 18 months. After a patient is registered, the patient will be randomized to one of two arms:\n\nARM I: Patients utilize the iCanDecide - ESE website, then undergo surgery within 5 weeks of registration. Patients may also participate in an audio-recorded phone interview over 20 minutes at 9-12 months post registration.\n\nARM II: Patients utilize the iCanDecide - S website, then undergo surgery within 5 weeks of registration. Patients may also participate in an audio-recorded phone interview over 20 minutes at 9-12 months post registration.\n\nAfter study registration, patients are followed up at 4-5 weeks and 9 months.\n\nPatients will be enrolled at participating clinics during the full duration of the study and all enrolled patients will receive a version of the decision support tool (iCanDecide-S; iCanDecide-ESE). These patient-level activities are not influenced by the timing of the practice-level randomization to the CDB."

Although men are recommended to undergo surgery to treat breast cancer, male breast cancer is relatively rare and decision making for breast cancer surgery is quite different between men and women\n* Planning breast surgery as a component of their definitive treatment within 5 weeks of registration\n* Receives care from a clinician and at a practice that has consented to participate in the clinician dashboard practice-level intervention. Practices/clinicians will consent initially at the initiation of the study. Patients will then be identified and recruited in those practices. If a practice has more than one clinician doing breast surgery, patients will be recruited from those clinicians who consent (one or more). Patients of clinicians who have not consented will not be eligible\n* Patients must be able to speak English or Spanish with the fluency required to have a direct discussion around treatment decision-making (i.e. without interpreter)\n* Age 21-84 years\n* CLINICIAN STAKEHOLDER (SURGEONS AND CLINIC STAFF) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\n* Clinicians eligible for this study include: breast surgeons and their designee(s) (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or nurses) that participate in the treatment decision-making process. At least one surgical oncologist at a practice must agree to participate and sign consent. S/he may then also identify a nurse, physician assistant (PA) or advanced practice provider (APP) with whom s/he works that is involved in the delivery of the care of the same patients to participate. Henceforth, in this protocol they will be referred to as \"clinicians\"\n* Clinicians must agree to have their patients recruited for the entire time the study is open at their practice, which will include time periods in which the clinicians will and time periods in which they will not have access to the CDB\n* INSTITUTION ELIGIBILITY:\n* Practices that annually provide surgical care for over 100 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer are eligible to participate in this study\n* Eligible practices must have at least one surgical oncologist who agrees to participate in the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are visually impaired are not eligible, as they must be able to access the study intervention on a website at home or in clinic and view the decision aid\n* Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (such as with a diagnosis of dementia or memory loss) are not eligible for this study\n* Practices currently enrolling to Alliance A231701CD are not eligible to participate in this study",
