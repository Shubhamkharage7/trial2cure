Part 2 will comprise up to 4 cohorts of healthy adult subjects and will investigate multiple ascending doses of LAD603. Each ascending dose level will be investigated by a sequential cohort, with dose escalation based on satisfactory safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) (biomarker) data from the previous cohort(s). Dose levels evaluated in Part 2 of this study will not exceed dose levels that were safe and well tolerated in the single-dose study, and may be changed, depending on emerging safety and tolerability, PK, and PD (biomarker) data.\n\nEach participant will participate for about 8 weeks in Part 1 and for about 14 weeks in Part 2 of the study."

Participants taking drugs that are substrates of cytochrome P450 or have a narrow therapeutic index are excluded from participating in this study.\n21. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at Screening or, if applicable, Day -1, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single repeat, if deemed necessary:\n\n    * Neutrophil or lymphocyte counts below the lower limit of the normal range.\n    * Eosinophil count above the normal range (i.e., \\>500/mm\\^3).\n    * Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI) calculation \\<=90 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 at Screening.\n    * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \\> Upper limit of the normal range (ULN).\n    * Total bilirubin \\>ULN\n    * Other clinically significant abnormalities of laboratory assessments, as judged by the Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor that could affect the safety of the participant, or the interpretation of the data from the study.",
