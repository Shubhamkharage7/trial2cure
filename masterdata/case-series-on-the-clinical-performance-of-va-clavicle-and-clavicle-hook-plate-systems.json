            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to gather early and mid- to long-term evidence to confirm the clinical performance, safety and use of the Clavicle Plate and Clavicle Hook Plate System.\n\nA minimum of 76 patients with clavicle fractures or dislocations of the AC joint surgically treated with any plate from the DPS VA-LCP Clavicle System will be enrolled in this observational post-market clinical investigation.\n\nOutcomes will be collected until up to 2 years after surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Common problems with existing clavicular plates are poor plate 'fit,' unbalance fixation, plate prominence, associated soft tissue irritation, subacromial pain, plate and/or fixation failure (due to unbalanced fixation) and high reoperation rate (for plate removal) \\[1-3\\]. The newly developed DePuy Synthes (DPS) variable angle locking compression plate (VA-LCP\u00ae) Clavicle 2.7 System was designed to address these problems. The system consists of lateral, shaft and medial plates and hook plates of different sizes to cover a wide variation in clavicular morphology and diverse fracture, fracture-dislocation and dislocation indications.\n\nThe objective is to describe the short and long-term clinical performance and safety of both systems, as well as the functional outcomes of this patient population.\n\nOutcomes will be collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months 1, and 2 years after surgery. In addition, the surgeons' experience and utility of the devices will be surveyed. For the short term evaluation, an interim analysis will be done as soon as 30 patients in each group have completed 6 months of follow-up (FU). The final evaluation of long-term outcomes will be done after 2 years of FU.\n\nAll treatments and follow-up visits are according to standard of care."
