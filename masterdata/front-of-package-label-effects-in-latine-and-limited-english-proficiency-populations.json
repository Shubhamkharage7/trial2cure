            "briefSummary": "The goal of this experiment is to examine the effects of 4 types of front-of-package food labels among a sample of Latino adults. The main questions this experiment aims to answer are:\n\nWhat front-of-package label design is most effective in helping Latino and low English proficiency consumers identify healthier and less healthy food products?\n\nWhat front-of-package label design is most effective in helping Latino and low English proficiency consumers choose healthier food products?\n\nAdditionally, this experiment also aims to answer the following question:\n\nDo the benefits of front-of-package label designs differ by English proficiency and parental status?\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 types of front-of-package label designs and view their assigned label design on 3 sets of products. Each set will display 3 similar products, each high in either 1, 2, or 3 nutrients of concern. For each set, participants will select the product that they believe to be the healthiest, least healthy, and the product that they would most want to consume. Researchers will compare results across label designs.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to determine which front-of-package label design is most effective at helping Latino consumers identify and choose healthier products, as well as explore whether the benefits of different front-of-package label designs differ by English proficiency. A Latino-focused panel company will recruit 4,000 US Latino adults of parental age (18-55 years), approximately 50% of whom will have limited English proficiency.\n\nIn a between-subjects experiment, researchers will randomize participants to 1 of 4 types of front-of-package label designs: a numerical label, an interpretive text-only label, an interpretive label with a magnifying glass icon, or separated interpretive labels with a magnifying glass icon. Participants will view their assigned label design on 3 similar products (each product high in either 1, 2, or 3 nutrients of concern) and complete selection tasks. These tasks will be repeated 3 times, each time with a different type of product (i.e., frozen meals, frozen pizzas, and frozen desserts), with the products displayed in random order."
