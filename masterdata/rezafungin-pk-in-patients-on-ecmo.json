It is well known that critically ill patients may experience alterations in antibiotic pharmacokinetics, and as a result, dosing modifications are generally required. There is a need to understand how ECMO circuits affect the pharmacokinetics and disposition of drugs. This study is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics of the new broad-spectrum echinocandin, Rezafungin, in critically ill patients receiving ECMO",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, open-label, Phase 1b, pharmacokinetic study of Rezafunginin 8 critically ill patients receiving ECMO support at Hartford Hospital. Informed consent will be collected from all study participants, legal authorized representative, or their next of kin in order to participate. This is not a treatment study; all participants will receive other antibiotics as necessary to treat any current infection."
