            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThere are many endocrine and metabolic-related conditions. Two well-known disorders include diabetes and thyroid disease. Some of these diseases are caused by a change in genes. Researchers want to identify the genes involved in these disorders. They hope this will help them learn more about these diseases.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo learn more about conditions that affect the hormone-secreting glands (endocrine glands) in adults. To train doctors to diagnose and treat people with endocrine or metabolic conditions.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 years and older with a known or suspected endocrine disorder.\n\nRelatives ages 18 years and older.\n\nDoctors will review all requests and available medical records to determine final eligibility for the protocol.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have a medical history and physical exam.\n\nMost participants will have 1 visit, and may have follow up visits if necessary. They may have tests, surgery, or other procedures to help diagnose or treat their condition. These could include:\n\n* Blood, urine, and saliva tests\n* Imaging tests. These may include X-ray, ultrasound, or scans.\n* Sleep study\n* Medical photographs\n* Visits with other specialists at NIH\n\nParticipants will provide blood, urine, saliva, or tissue samples. Some of these samples may be stored in the freezer for future studies.\n\nParticipants may be asked to participate in genetic testing. They will give a blood or saliva sample for this.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an observational protocol designed to collect data from adult subjects with known or suspected endocrine or metabolic disorders.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to increase knowledge of endocrine or metabolic diseases. Adults with known or suspected endocrine or metabolic-related condition(s) may be evaluated under this protocol for:\n\n1. Collection of data for endocrine related conditions (case reports, case series)\n2. Collection of data for future research\n3. Collection of samples, including leftover samples from clinically indicated tests, for future research (including genomics)\n\nMETHODS: Patients will undergo a history and physical exam, anthropometrics, vital signs and endocrine laboratory studies."
