Additionally, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of briquilimab, and other pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters (such as effects on mast cells (MC), serum tryptase levels, and on allergic skin reactivity) will be investigated."

History of anaphylaxis\n6. Any H2 antihistamine, leukotriene receptor antagonist or tricyclic antidepressant use within 3 days prior to Screening\n7. Experimental monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., dupilumab, ligelizumab, etc.) within 6 months or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors within 5 half-lives prior to first IP dosing\n8. Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, dapsone, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, etc.) within 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to first IP dosing\n9.

Male participants (who are not vasectomized) who are not willing to use highly effective contraceptive methods (when having sexual intercourse with a female partner of childbearing potential, Section 8.2) and who are not willing to abstain from sperm donation during the trial and for at least 150 days after last IP dosing. A male participant is considered vasectomized if he had a vasectomy at least 4 months prior to Screening and if he has received post-surgical medical assessment of the surgical success of the vasectomy.\n16. Female participants of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraceptive methods (Section 8.2) during the trial and for at least 150 days after last IP dosing. Women of nonchildbearing potential, must be surgically sterile (i.e., had undergone complete hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or be in menopausal state (at least 1 year without menses).\n17. Participation in another research trial involving the use of an IP within the last 30 days (or 5 halflives of IP, whichever is longer) prior to Screening\n18. Any known contraindications or hypersensitivity to any component of the IP, drugs of similar chemical classes (i.e., to murine, chimeric or human antibodies) or antihistamines or leukotrienes\n19. Any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that could increase the risk associated with trial participation or IP administration or could interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into the trial\n20. Participants not willing to abstain from blood donations while being on the trial (until EOT Visit)\n21.
