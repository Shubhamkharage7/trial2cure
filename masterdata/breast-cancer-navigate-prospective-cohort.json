TCI and its new academic/clinical partner, The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, propose to apply TCI's developed patient navigation support techniques to enhance knowledge and self-advocacy among a cohort of Black and African American women, and other women of color (WOC), receiving care in Northwestern's breast cancer program.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of this study is to apply TCI's patient navigation-and-coaching program and its website/mobile app (Breast Cancer-Navigate) platform to improve timely initiation to patient adjuvant treatment among WOC breast cancer patients and evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this approach."
