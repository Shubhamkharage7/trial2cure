Outcomes will be observed for 10 months under the current (traditional) clinical blood pressure threshold for acute treatment of hypertension, which is \\>= 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic blood pressure (SBP). This will be followed by one month of education about rationale for the new SBP threshold of \\>= 180 mmHg and change of clinical guidelines. Then, there will be 10 months of observation after adopting the updated clinical threshold for acute antihypertensive treatment (\\>= 180 SBP)."
