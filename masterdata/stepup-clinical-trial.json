The study will randomize 150 participants to one of 2 groups: current education regimen vs. current education regiment with video. The primary outcome is stage of self-care engagement. Secondary outcomes are PAD knowledge, self-efficacy, and activation. A subset of participants will also be randomly selected to participate in semi-structured interviews. Study duration for participants is 6 months."
