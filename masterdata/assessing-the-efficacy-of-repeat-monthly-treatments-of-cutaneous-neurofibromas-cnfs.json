These treatments are: a 1064nm laser, a 755nm laser, and Kybella and Polidocanol injections. Each patient will have a treatment and a control site.\n\nThis study is designed with the goal of improved efficacy/tumor reduction via multiple treatment visits. If there is minimal to no clinical improvement in tumor size with one treatment after three treatment visits, the subject will be given the option of crossover treatment with the most effective of the four treatments. Three treatment visits with the crossover treatment will then take place."
