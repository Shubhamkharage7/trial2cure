History of any significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis) deemed clinically relevant by the Investigator.\n5. Any major surgery within 3 months of screening.\n6.

Positive test for drugs of abuse at screening or admission. Subjects with a positive test based on a prescribed medication may be enrolled.\n13. Any subject with poor peripheral venous access\n14. Receipt of blood products within 1 month prior to check in.\n15. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 antibody positive at screening for all groups.\n\n    For Subjects in Groups 8 and 9 (Hepatic impairment group but with cirrhosis from cholestatic liver disease):\n16. Other known cause of liver disease such as NASH, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), autoimmune hepatitis, or acute or chronic viral hepatitis as determined by the Investigator and subject's medical records.\n17. Subjects who have had a change in hepatic disease status within 30 days of screening, as documented by the participant's medical history and deemed clinically significant by the Investigator.\n18. Subjects having -\n\n    1. History of gastrointestinal bleeding within 1 month prior to screening.\n    2. Current functioning organ transplant.\n    3. Evidence of severe ascites requiring frequent paracentesis in the opinion of investigator.\n19. Subjects who use or intend to use any over the counter (vitamins, minerals, and phytotherapeutic/herbal/plant-derived preparations) or prescription medications within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to enrolment, with the exception of hormone replacement therapy and therapies for hepatic disease and treatments of associated disorders that have been stable for at least 30 days prior to screening and until Day 1, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee).\n\n    For Control with Normal Hepatic Function:\n20. Subjects who have taken any prescription medications or over-the-counter medications, including herbal products, within 14 days prior to start of study drug dosing, with the exception of vitamins, acetaminophen, hormonal contraceptive medications and/or any other over-the-counter product approved by the Investigator.",
