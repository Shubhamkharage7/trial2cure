The registry is designed to estimate the association between risankizumab and maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes by comparing the prevalence rates of these outcomes in the exposed and unexposed populations.\n\nApproximately 818 female participants with pregnancy will be enrolled (409 participants exposed to risankizumab and 409 without exposure) at multiple sites across the United States.\n\nParticipants will not receive risankizumab as part of this study. Maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy for female participants who received risankizumab or other treatment will be followed for and up to 1 year after delivery\n\nThere may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care. Participants will attend visits determined by HCPs during the study at a hospital or clinic. The pregnancy outcomes including side effects will be collected during routine clinical care."
