In this study, we will examine the safety and tolerability of GLP-1RA semaglutide as an add-on therapy to insulin for overweight/obese adult patients with CFRD. We hypothesize that weekly administration of the long-acting GLP-1RA semaglutide to overweight/obese CFRD patients will be safe and well tolerated.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Collect pilot data on the safety and feasibility of weekly semaglutide therapy in overweight and obese patients with CFRD to support a future larger randomized controlled trial.\n\nHypothesis 1: Weekly therapy with GLP-1RA semaglutide will be safe and well tolerated in overweight/obese adults with CFRD.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Collect preliminary data to examine the impact of semaglutide therapy on insulin secretion, glucagon and glucose levels as measured by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and on glycemic outcomes as measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and HbA1c.\n\nHypothesis 2a: Treatment with semaglutide will lower glucose levels, and increase insulin and C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) during the OGTT as compared to baseline.\n\nHypothesis 2b: Treatment with semaglutide will improve glycemic control as indicated by time in range on CGM and HbA1c"
