            "briefSummary": "Poor emotion recognition has been associated with poor quality of interpersonal relationships, loss of employment, behavioral problems, reduced social reintegration, social isolation and even suicide. Deficits in emotion recognition are common in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but these deficits have not been well studied in Veterans with both mild TBI (mTBI) and PTSD. Currently there are no interventions for emotion recognition in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD, and interventions for severe TBI have lacked training of both facial and vocal emotion recognition. In a preliminary study of an innovative combination of facial and vocal modalities, a multimodal affect recognition training (MMART) showed promise but lacked attention training that is an essential component in recognizing emotions in our daily lives. Given the need to improve relationships and productivity in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD, a study is needed to determine the effectiveness of a MMART combined with attention training.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background. Deficits in emotion recognition are common in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but these deficits have not been well studied in Veterans with both mild TBI (mTBI) and PTSD. Poor emotion recognition has been associated with poor quality of interpersonal relationships, loss of employment, behavioral problems, reduced social reintegration, social isolation and even suicide. Currently there are no interventions for emotion recognition deficits in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD, and interventions conducted in civilians with severe TBI have lacked training of both facial and vocal emotion recognition. In a preliminary study of an innovative combination of facial and vocal modalities, a multimodal affect recognition training (MMART) showed promise with significant improvement on the Florida Affect Battery (FAB) but lacked attention training that is an essential component in recognizing rapidly changing emotions in our everyday lives. Attention training using Brain HQ targets the required attention factors underlying emotion recognition. Given the need to improve relationships and productivity in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD, a randomized controlled trial is needed to determine the effectiveness of an innovative MMART combined with attention training to improve emotion recognition and everyday function.\n\nObjective \\& Hypotheses. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the treatment effect of a MultiModal Affect Recognition Training (MMART) combined with attention training in Veterans with TBI/PTSD.\n\nHypothesis 1. MMART combined with attention training will significantly improve performance on tests of emotion recognition.\n\nHypothesis 2: Treatment gains will translate to functional activities. Primary measures. Florida Affect Battery (FAB) and the Community Reintegration in Service members (CRIS).\n\nSecondary measures. Emotion Recognition Task (ERT), attention index of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the Continuous Performance Task and the TBI Quality of Life (TBI-QOL) Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities.\n\nMethods. 20 Veterans with mTBI and PTSD will be randomized to either the combined training or an inactive control group. Both groups will attend 16, one-hour in-person sessions over 8 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at pre-, post-, 3 month-post-treatment. A linear regression will be used to determine significant improvement of the treatment group over the control group, with t-tests to demonstrate within group improvement. Effect size calculations will be used to determine the power needed for a future Merit proposal."
