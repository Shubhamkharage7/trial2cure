            "detailedDescription": "Study type: Interventional Estimated enrollment: 60 Allocation: block randomization. The block randomization method is designed to randomize subjects into groups that result in equal sample sizes. This method is used to ensure a balance in sample size across groups over time.\n\nInterventional model: parallel assignment Description: two different methods of screw and plate fixation of posterior wall acetabulum fractures.\n\nTime perspective: Prospective\n\nPopulation:\n\nSkeletally mature patients who have presented with an acute traumatic fracture of the posterior wall of acetabulum due to dislocation of the femoral head will be included in this study. All surgeons on the study routinely perform both types of repairs.\n\nTreatment arms and Intervention:\n\nArm A: Rim plate group - This group will consist of 30 patients where the posterior wall fracture will be operatively stabilized with a pelvic reconstruction plate and interfragmentary screws placed through the plate.\n\nArm B: Buttress plate group - This group will consist of 30 patients where the posterior wall fracture will be operatively fixed with a buttress plate applied under compression without interfragmentary lag or position screws."
