NOTE: For patients with post-radiation scans suggestive of radiation-induced \"pseudoprogression\", patients can be consented and enrolled on this trial but investigational treatment will not start until a repeat MRI scan is obtained 4 weeks later (8-9 weeks following completion of radiation). If that scan shows no further tumor progression, despite no interval treatment in those preceding 4-weeks, then it will be assumed that the post-radiation MRI scans represent radiation-induced pseudoprogression rather than true tumor progression. In such a case, patients will start on treatment with paxalisib, the ketogenic diet and metformin. Assessment of PFS will start for such patients from this 8-9 week time point. By contrast, for patients whose 8-9 week \"pseudoprogression assessment\" MRI scan shows continued tumor progression, then these patients will be assumed to have true tumor progression and will not be eligible to remain treated on this study. Such patients will be deemed for the sake of the study as consented and screened. They will be evaluable for toxicity but not evaluable for response.
