            "detailedDescription": "We will assess the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in preventing post-vaccine health conditions. To do this, we will employ a target trial emulation design, examining the vaccine's effectiveness from the time it was authorized or approved, specifically for different age groups, up until the most recent available data. We will gather patient data from HealthVerity, including those enrolled in the claims database, and supplement it with information from the state's deidentified vaccine registry. Only patients eligible to receive the vaccine during the study period will be included in the analysis of post-vaccine health conditions. We will compare vaccinated individuals with those eligible for vaccination but not vaccinated, using various statistical methods such as descriptive statistics, incidence rates, hazard ratios, and survival curves.\n\nThe second part of our study will use a retrospective cohort design to examine the uptake of the vaccine in specific groups over time. We will identify subjects through two different methods: 1) by analyzing all available dosing records in the Immunization Registry, 2) by using HealthVerity claims data based on specific time periods when the vaccine was available. We will follow these individuals until they receive the vaccine under investigation, leave the study, reach the end of the available data, or pass away. We will assess overall vaccination rates and also analyze the data based on the specific type of prior vaccine dose received."
