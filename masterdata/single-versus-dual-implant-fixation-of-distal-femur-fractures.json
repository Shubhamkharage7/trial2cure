The main questions it aims to answer is which operation for distal femur fractures is better for efficient return to work and everyday activities.",
            "detailedDescription": "Fractures of the distal femur are severe and common injuries sustained by Wounded Warriors in combat. Despite advances in implant technology, these injuries continue to have an unacceptably high rate of nonunion (failure to heal) of approximately 20%. This adverse outcome requires additional surgery to achieve fracture healing, which prolongs recovery and further delays return to duty often beyond one year after injury. The goal of this study is to investigate a potential treatment for distal femur fractures that has the potential to improve the likelihood of fracture healing and accelerate return of patient function during the healing process."

Patients will be asked to jump forward to the force plate, clear a 30.5 cm hurdle, land on the force plate with their test leg only, stabilize as quickly as possible, and maintain balance with their hands on their hips for ten seconds. A total of three trials will be collected and averaged together for analysis. A stability index based on the three ground reaction force components will be calculated as described previously.",

Participants will perform three consecutive jumps off one leg while crossing over the tape with each jump so that the first jump is lateral, the second jump is medial, and the final jump is lateral. Participants will be asked to hold their place at the end of the third jump until their distance is recorded. Three test trials will be assessed for each leg and averaged together for analysis.",
