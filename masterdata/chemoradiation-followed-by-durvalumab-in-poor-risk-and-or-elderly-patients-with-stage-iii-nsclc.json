            "detailedDescription": "The rationale for the study is to identify another cohort of stage III NSCLC for whom adjuvant Durvalumab can be safely given, expanding its utilization and benefits. With a unique, extremely well-tolerated 4-phase split course CRT regimen preceding the administration of Durvalumab, we expect to be able to offer adjuvant Durvalumab to a significant proportion of patients on study.\n\nPatients who have completed four cycles of chemoradiation (Radiation is 60 Gy in 30 fractions administered over 12 weeks with 1-1.5 week breaks between cycles; Chemotherapy is once every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles) will go on to receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy as 1500mg durvalumab (MEDI4736) via IV infusion Q4W for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13 doses/cycles) with the last administration on week 48 until confirmed disease progression unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.\n\nPrimary objectives are:\n\n1. To determine the percentage of poor risk and/or elderly unresectable stage III NSCLC patients who complete split course chemoradiation\n2. To determine the safety and tolerability of durvalumab (MEDI4736) after completion of chemoradiation in this group of patients.\n\nSecondary Objectives are:\n\n1. To determine the 1-year overall survival rate\n2. To determine the 1-year progression-free survival rate\n3. To determine the 1-year loco-regional progression-free survival rate\n4. To determine rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities with this regimen in the selected patient population"
