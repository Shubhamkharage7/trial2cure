The targeted study population is men and women 18-50 years of age who are disproportionately vulnerable to N. gonorrhoeae infection. Approximately 2,200 participants are expected to be enrolled to achieve at least 202 evaluable participants. Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. Study product recipients and study staff responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint will be unaware of whether Bexsero or placebo were administered. The duration of the study for participants who are enrolled and randomized will be approximately 16 months. Study participation is expected to be completed in approximately 36 months. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate efficacy of Bexsero in prevention of urogenital and/or anorectal gonococcal infection.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase II, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site trial of the FDA licensed rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, Bexsero. The targeted study population is men and women 18-50 years of age who are disproportionately vulnerable to N. gonorrhoeae infection. Approximately 2,200 participants are expected to be enrolled to achieve at least 202 evaluable participants. Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. Study product recipients and study staff responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint will be unaware of whether Bexsero or placebo were administered. Participants who consent to screening will have baseline clinical information collected at Visit 0, Screening (Day -14 \\[Window -45 to -7\\]). This information will consist of medical history, concomitant medications, physical exam, sexual history, and clinical and laboratory findings. Participants will undergo a physical exam and have blood drawn to establish baseline laboratory values for safety assessment. Urine or a vaginal swab, and a rectal swab will be collected for Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) for gonorrhea and chlamydia. A pharyngeal swab will be collected for NAAT testing of gonorrhea. At the enrollment visit, Visit 1, participants who test negative for gonorrhea and who otherwise qualify will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the initial intramuscular (IM) dose of study product. A phone call, Visit 2, will be held approximately 30 days after the initial study product dose was received and will be conducted with all participants to assess for safety events in the interim. At Visit 3, the participant will receive the second dose of study product. Visit 4 will be held 1 month after second dose. At 3-month intervals, through the final study follow-up visit, participants will have clinic study visits, Visit 5 thru Visit 8. The duration of the study for participants who are enrolled and randomized will be approximately 16 months. For those not enrolled, participation could end at their Visit 0, Screening; post Visit 0, Screening based on NAAT test results; or Visit 1, Enrollment. Study participation is expected to be completed in approximately 36 months. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate efficacy of Bexsero in prevention of urogenital and/or anorectal gonococcal infection. The secondary objectives are to estimate efficacy of Bexsero in prevention of overall gonococcal infection and by anatomical site (urogenital, anorectal or pharyngeal) and to assess safety of Bexsero."
