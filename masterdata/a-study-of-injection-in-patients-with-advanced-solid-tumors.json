The phase I study will enroll up to 54 subjects with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on or after standard of care therapy and for whom there is no further treatment available that in the judgement of the patient's physician would be beneficial. One cycle is defined as 21 days.",

During this phase of the study, DLTs, MTD and MTD range will be observed which will inform RP2D. Phase I:Approximately 54 patients will receive HB0045 as a monotherapy at escalating doses.One cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21 days).\n\nIn the phase II study, the safety and preliminary efficacy of HB0045 at the RP2D will be evaluated in cohorts of patients with pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors.Phase II:During the dose escalation process, expansion cohorts will be conducted based on the preliminary RP2D.A Simon 2-stage design will be utilized with a stopping rule to allow for early termination of a particular cohort at the end of Stage 1 if patients have insufficient responses to HB0045. During Stage 1, 9 evaluable patients will be enrolled in each cohort; if no responses are observed within the cohort, then the cohort will be discontinued. If at least 1 response is observed, 8 additional evaluable patients will be enrolled in the cohort (Stage 2), for a maximum of 17 evaluable patients per cohort."

Patients with previously treated brain or meningeal metastases may participate and be eligible for treatment provided they are stable and asymptomatic. Patients with asymptomatic brain or meningeal metastasis or patients who are symptomatically stable after treatment and are on\u2264 10 mg/d prednisone or equivalent are eligible.\n3.

Patients with rate-controlled arrhythmias may be eligible for study entry at discretion of the Investigator.\n4. Active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy \\< 2 years prior to screening except hypothyroidism, vitiligo, Grave's disease, Hashimoto's disease, or Type I diabetes. Patients with childhood asthma or atopy that has not been active in the 2 years prior to study screening are eligible.\n5. Patients who have previously received allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.\n6. History of severe allergic reactions, grade 3-4 allergic reactions to treatment with another monoclonal antibody or known to be allergic to protein drugs or recombinant proteins or excipients in HB0045 drug formulation.\n7. History of Grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or irAEs requiring discontinuation of prior therapies, (except for Grade 3 endocrinopathy that is managed with hormone replacement therapy).\n8. Use of systemic corticosteroids in a dose equivalent to \u226510 mg/day of prednisone or other immunosuppressive agents \\< 2 weeks prior to screening; the use of topical, intraocular, intraarticular, intranasal, or inhaled corticosteroids and systemic steroids to prevent (e.g., allergy to contrast agents) or treat non-autoimmune condition (e.g., delayed hypersensitivity caused by exposure to allergens), or short course (\\< 5 days) will be allowed.\n9. Have received antibiotics lasting over 1 week within 28 days prior to first dose.\n10. Have received or will receive a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose.\n11. Any of the following infections\n\n    1. Positive COVID-19 qRT-PCR or rapid screening test during screening; can be eligible after quarantine (14 days) if COVID-19 test becomes negative.\n    2. Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) who are receiving anti-TB treatment or who received anti-TB treatment within 1 year prior to screening.\n12. Prior treatment with agents targeting CD73 or A2AR.\n13. Anticancer therapy \\< 5 half-lives or 4 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to study entry; palliative radiotherapy to a single area \\< 2 weeks prior to study screening is permitted. Measurable lesions cannot be previously irradiated unless they have demonstrated growth after radiation therapy (RT).\n14. Major surgery (except for diagnostic needle biopsy or puncture and drainage or intravenous catheterization) or chemotherapy/ interventional therapy/radiation therapy/ablation therapy \\< 4 weeks prior to the first dose\n15. Patients who have participated in any clinical trial of a drug or medical device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose.\n16. Patients whose existing significant clinical abnormalities or laboratory abnormalities may affect the evaluation of the study drug by the Investigator's judgement. Psychiatric, psychological, familial condition or geographical location that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may interfere with the planned staging, treatment and follow-up and affect patient's compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatment.\n17. Other conditions which would make it inappropriate for the patient to participate as judged by the investigator.",
