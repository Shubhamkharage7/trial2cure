            "briefSummary": "Nivolumab (and other agents affecting the anti-programmed death-1 \\[anti-PD-1\\] pathway) have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma (MEL), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and other cancers. However, there remains a large proportion of participants who do not achieve durable clinical benefit to nivolumab monotherapy. Combinations of immune-oncology (IO) agents with complimentary mechanisms as well as radiation represent a promising strategy to improve response rates to immunotherapy. In this phase I study, radiation will be used in combination with IO agents nivolumab and anti-IL-8 (BMS-986253) to assess toxicity by organ system. The study will determine the safe doses of radiation by organ site in conjunction with nivolumab and BMS-986253. The study will also provide the opportunity to evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by the treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a study of SBRT in combination with nivolumab and BMS-986253, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human interleukin-8 (IL-8), conducted in humans with advanced solid tumors. This study will evaluate the safety profile, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SBRT in combination with BMS-986253 and nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors and detectable levels of IL-8 in the serum. The study will be conducted in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 will evaluate the safety, tolerability of different doses of SBRT in combination with nivolumab (480 mg) and BMS-986253 (2400mg) every 2 weeks (Q2W) in participants with advanced solid tumors and detectable levels of IL-8 in the serum. This phase will begin with a cohort of participants who will receive a 2,400 mg flat dose of BMS-986253 Q2W combined with 480 mg flat dose of nivolumab Q4W along with SBRT (the dose is dependent on the irradiating organ).\n\nPart 2 will assess preliminary efficacy of SBRT in combination with nivolumab and BMS-986253 in participants with advanced/metastatic/unresectable melanoma and RCC who progressed on anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and have detectable levels of IL-8 in the serum.\n\nThis study aims to determine that safe doses will be found using ablative doses of SBRT with concurrent IO agents. Additional safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy information in specific patient population will be gathered. Twenty participants with anti-PD-(L)1 refractory advanced/unresectable/metastatic melanoma and RCC and with serum IL-8 above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be enrolled into efficacy phase.\n\nThis proposal is intended to incorporate SBRT as a direct therapeutic which is in contrast with other proposals evaluating response at distant sites after isolated metastasis radiation. With this intent, the results of this study will be directly applicable to potential expansion cohorts and ongoing clinical need.\n\nNote: The Sponsor-Investigator/Study Principal Investigator of this trial is Jason J. Luke, MD at the University of Pittsburgh/UPMC . The Sponsor-Investigator of this trial at University of Chicago is Steven Chmura MD, PhD."
