Only about half of people with high blood pressure have it under control. New methods to control blood pressure are needed to reduce heart attack and stroke rates. The purpose of this study is to test whether a digital program that includes personalized health coaching and remote patient monitoring with a connected blood pressure cuff, all delivered on a smartphone or website, can improve blood pressure control compared with usual care among patients with high blood pressure."

Participants will receive digital tools that connect with the Omada app to help track their food intake, physical activity, and blood pressure (BP). Participants who also have diabetes will receive a digital blood glucose meter and/or a continuous glucose monitor as well. The care team will support patients with lifestyle self-management support, adherence to their current medication regimen, improved BP control, and use of monitors for self-management of their BP and/or blood glucose values.",
