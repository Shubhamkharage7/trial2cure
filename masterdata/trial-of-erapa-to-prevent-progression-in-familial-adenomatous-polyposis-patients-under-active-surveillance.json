            "detailedDescription": "Patients with FAP who are undergoing endoscopic surveillance will be given eRapa at one of three escalating doses/ schedules (0.5mg every other day, 0.5mg daily every other week, or 0.5mg daily) for 12 months with the aim of reducing polyp burden. Patients will serve as their own controls. Patients will be assessed with surveillance endoscopy at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months for change in polyp burden. Correlation between immune markers and clinical outcomes will be explored.\n\nThis is a Phase IIa trial which will enroll at approximately 6-8 sites within the United States that have specialty expertise in FAP treatment and surveillance. The trial is anticipated to last approximately 24 months for treatment and follow up.\n\nThe trial will enroll 30 patients with the genetic or clinical diagnosis of FAP. The clinical diagnosis includes individuals with 100 or more cumulative tubular adenomas throughout the colorectum. Patients must be undergoing surveillance for known FAP and can include those with intact colons as well as those who have undergone surgical therapy. For those patients who have undergone partial or total colectomy, they must have documented residual polyps in their rectum for which they are receiving active surveillance.\n\nOnce the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified, subjects will undergo evaluation under fed and fasted states to determine the food effect on eRapa absorption."

Patients will serve as their own control; no placebo will be given.\n\nAdditionally, a subset of participants will be included in a randomized, balanced, single-schedule, two-treatment period (fed versus fasted) crossover study.\n\nParticipants will receive eRapa under fed or fasted conditions in the first period, and then crossover to the other treatment (fed to fasted and vice versa) following a 2 week washout. Under this design, participants serve as their own control and will allow the assessment of the effect of food on the anticipated R2PD of eRapa",
