The safety and tolerability of the dose and the biological signature of GOS and hGOS in healthy adults will be established through a pilot clinical trial to assess GOS and hGOS effects vs placebo on (i) gastrointestinal adverse effects as measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom and Severity Checklist (GSSC), (ii) increased abundance of beneficial gut bacteria and restoration of the gut microbiome saccharolytic potential, (iii) modulation of biomarkers of inflammation and (iv) evaluation of intestinal barrier function."
