            "briefSummary": "The objective of RAP PAC is to identify safe and effective weekly dose(s) for the mTOR inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus that intervene on the underlying fundamental biology of aging. Participants who are 55-89 years old that are free of overt chronic diseases will be assigned to either 6 weeks of sirolimus or everolimus (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once per week). The investigators will complete the everolimus arm first and then subsequently complete the sirolimus arm of the study. Total time on study would be up to 17 weeks to complete baseline and follow up visits.",
            "detailedDescription": "The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) extend healthspan and/or lifespan in multiple model systems. However, the risk of adverse events and dose limiting toxicities in humans have thus far precluded the long-term prophylactic use of mTOR inhibitors as a therapy for aging and age-related diseases. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) data for mTOR inhibitors in older adults is currently unknown and has prevented the identification of a safe dosage that could maximize health-span extension and minimize adverse effects.\n\nRAP PAC will identify a recommended phase 2 trial dose for sirolimus and everolimus in older men and women by performing a phase 1, dose finding study that evaluates PK/PD, safety and tolerability, and mTOR signaling using conventional as well as novel approaches. Overall, the investigators will pair comprehensive molecular and pharmacologic approaches to evaluate PK/PD in humans and identify dosing regimens that safely inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) to intervene in the biology of aging."

Middle-aged to older adults will be treated with either sirolimus or everolimus for 6 weeks. All participants will take one capsule weekly. This dose escalation trial will begin with two cohorts, each consisting of 3 male and 3 female participants. The first two cohorts will take a weekly 5mg dose of sirolimus or a weekly 5mg dose of everolimus. The first arm of the study will be with everolimus. The second arm of the study will be with sirolimus. The dose can be escalated/de-escalated from the current dose based on the rate of dose limited toxicity (DLT) at the end of the 6-week intervention for each cohort.
