This is a randomized clinical trial testing 3 educational approaches to help patients with advanced chronic kidney disease prepare for placement of hemodialysis vascular access. Study participants will each be assigned to one of the 3 approaches: 1) \"Education\", in which participants will be given a video and brochure that provide information about the types of vascular access and what can be expected before and after the vascular access is placed, 2) \"Education-Plus\", in which participants will be given the video and brochure and will also have sessions by telehealth with a motivational interviewing coach to provide additional support around vascular access placement, and 3) \"Usual Care\", in which participants will have the usual education provided by their kidney doctor and clinic staff just as if they were not in the study. Participants in all 3 groups will be asked to complete questionnaires by telephone and may be invited to be interviewed about their experience with the study intervention at the end of the study. Study participation will last for about 12 months, with most of the study activities taking place during the first 3 months."
