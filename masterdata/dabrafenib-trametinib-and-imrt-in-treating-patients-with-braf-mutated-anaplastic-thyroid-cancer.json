            "briefSummary": "This trial studies how well dabrafenib, trametinib, and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) work together in treating patients with BRAF mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer. Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving dabrafenib, trametinib, and IMRT together may kill more tumor cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose \\[MTD\\]) of concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and BRAF-MEK inhibitors dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess overall objective response rate, time to progression of local recurrence, progression free survival and overall survival.\n\nII. To assess pharmacokinetics during concurrent IMRT and dabrafenib plus trametinib therapy.\n\nIII. To assess pharmacodynamics of dabrafenib plus trametinib induction therapy.\n\nIV. To assess mechanism of resistance to dabrafenib plus trametinib and radiation therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dabrafenib.\n\nINDUCTION: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once daily (QD) for 7-28 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.\n\nOPTIONAL SURGERY: Patients with resectable disease may undergo surgery 3 days after stop treatment of dabrafenib/trametinib, and move to Concurrent Radiation 14 days after surgery provided that surgical wound has healed. All other patients continue to receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCONCURRENT RADIATION: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD at weeks 6-7. Within 2.5 hours of morning doses of dabrafenib/trametinib administration, patients undergo intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on Monday-Friday delivered over 6.5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPOST-RADIATION: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE: Patients with residual disease receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Patients stop dabrafenib and trametinib 8 weeks after achieving complete response. Patients with no residual disease stop dabrafenib and trametinib, with the option of restarting dabrafenib and trametinib at time of disease recurrence.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year."

Previous treatment with sorafenib is permitted.\n* Patients that are receiving any other investigational agent.\n* Patients that are currently taking any prohibitive medication.\n* Patients with a history of other active malignancy requiring cancer treatment.\n* Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases. Patients who are on a stable dose of corticosteroids for more than 1 week or off corticosteroids for 2 weeks prior to study enrollment can be enrolled. Enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs are not permitted.\n* Patients with a known history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), central serous retinopathy (CSR), uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension.\n* Patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system.\n* Corrected QT (QTc) interval greater than or equal to 480 msecs (\\>= 500 msec for subjects with Bundle Branch Block).\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women and nursing women are excluded from this study because dabrafenib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. In embroyfetal developmental studies in rats, developmental toxicities including reduced fetal body weight, embryo-lethality, cardiac ventricular septal defect malformations, delayed skeletal development and variation in thymic shape have been observed.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients or those on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with study drugs.",
