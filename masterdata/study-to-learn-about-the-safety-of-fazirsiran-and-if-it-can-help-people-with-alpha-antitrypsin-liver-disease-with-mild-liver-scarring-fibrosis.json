            "briefSummary": "The liver produces a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is normally released into the bloodstream. In some people, the liver makes an abnormal version of the AAT protein, called Z-AAT. Making an abnormal version of the AAT protein can result in liver disease as Z-AAT builds up in liver cells, which leads to liver problems such as liver scarring (fibrosis), continuing liver damage (cirrhosis), and eventually endstage liver disease. Fazirsiran is a medicine that reduces the creation of the Z-AAT protein and thus the build-up of this abnormal protein in the liver. People with this type of liver disease who already have mild liver scarring will take part in the study. They will be treated with fazirsiran or a placebo for about 2 years. This study will check the long-term safety of fazirsiran, whether participants tolerate the treatment and if there are any effects on liver scarring. A liver biopsy, a way of collecting a small tissue sample from the liver, will be taken twice during the study."

Participants may be rescreened once their blood pressure (BP) is successfully controlled.\n* The participant has a history of torsades de pointes, ventricular rhythm disturbances (example, ventricular tachycardia), heart block (excluding first-degree block, being PR interval prolongation only), congenital long QT syndrome or new ST-segment elevation or depression or a new Q wave on ECG. Participants with a history of atrial arrhythmias should be discussed with the medical monitor.\n* The participant has symptomatic heart failure (per New York Heart Association guidelines), unstable angina, myocardial infarction, severe cardiovascular disease (ejection fraction less than \\[\\<\\] 20 percent \\[%\\]), transient ischemic attack, or cerebrovascular accident within 24 weeks before screening.\n* The participant has a history of major surgery within 12 weeks of screening (or longer, at the discretion of the investigator).\n* The participant has a history of more than moderate alcohol consumption within 12 months before the screening visit.\n* The participant has a history of drug abuse (such as cocaine, phencyclidine) within 1 year before the screening visit or has a positive urine drug screen at screening.\n* The participant has previously been treated with fazirsiran or any other RNA interference (RNAi) for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease (AATD-LD).\n* The participant has a history of hypersensitivity or allergies with any associated excipients of fazirsiran.\n* The participant has received an investigational agent or device within 30 days, or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the dosing of study medication or is currently participating in an investigational study involving a therapeutic intervention.\n* The participant has donated \\>=500 milliliter (mL) of blood within 1 month of the administration of study treatment.\n* The participant has any concomitant medical or psychiatric condition or social situation that would make it difficult to comply with protocol requirements or put the participant at additional safety risk. The participant has a history of clinically significant hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, gastrointestinal (GI), systemic inflammatory, metabolic, or endocrine disorder or any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, rendered the participant a poor candidate for inclusion into the study.\n* The participant has a history of thromboembolic disease (including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), within 24 weeks before screening, or is taking chronic anticoagulants.\n* This participant is unable to return for all scheduled study visits.\n* The participant has known or suspected COVID-19 by the investigator within the past 2 months before screening. Positive antibody testing for COVID-19 without other evidence of current or recent active infection does not exclude participation. Participants who were in screening at the time that COVID-19-related factors resulted in discontinuation may also be rescreened with approval of the sponsor or designee.\n* The participant is a study site employee, an immediate family member (example, spouse, parent, child, sibling), or is in a dependent relationship with study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study or may consent under duress.\n* The participant takes or is required to take excluded medications.\n* The participant is pregnant or breastfeeding or intending to become pregnant before participating in this study, during the study, and within 24 weeks after last dose of the study drug; or the participant is intending to donate ova during such time period.",
