            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates light therapy and occupational therapy in improving cancer related fatigue (CRF) patients with genitourinary cancers. Light therapy is a non-pharmacological and evidence-based intervention for managing fatigue in cancer patients. The use of light therapy can provide a low burden, inexpensive, and easy to disseminate intervention approach that can potentially have a larger impact on CRF. In addition, occupational therapy is a standard, but often underutilized, component of the multi-disciplinary approach to cancer care. Using the combination of light therapy and occupational therapy may be effective in CRF management.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate patient's fatigue at post-intervention (3 months from baseline).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate whether the change (improvement) in fatigue as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue tool, from pre-interventions to post interventions is significantly different between intervention groups in patients with genitourinary cancers.\n\nTHIRD OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess patient perceived changes in occupational performance as measured by the Canadian Occupational and Performance Measure (COPM) tool, in the occupational therapy (OT) group, compared to the control group in patients with genitourinary cancers.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.\n\nARM I (Bright white light \\[BWL\\]): Patients self-administer 30 minutes of light delivered via light glasses every morning for 3 months. Patients attend 6 follow up sessions to address any questions regarding the wearable light therapy glasses.\n\nARM II (OT): Patients undergo 6 occupational therapist-led sessions over 60 minutes each.\n\nARM III (BWL and OT): Patients self-administer 30 minutes of light delivered via light glasses every morning for 3 months. Patients attend 6 follow up sessions to address any questions regarding the wearable light therapy glasses and to complete the occupational therapist-led session over 60 minutes.\n\nARM IV (CONTROL): Patients undergo routine treatment and usual follow up care with their medical oncologist.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are follow-up for 3 months."
