Subjects with cancer associated pain who are receiving conservative medical management (CMM) only and cancer patients receiving Intrathecal Drug Delivery system (IDDs) along with CMM will be followed for up to 3 months. Subjects will be evaluated monthly up to 3 months from the medical care initiation which is the implant day for the IDDs group and start of the new treatment plan for the CMM group. Subjects that decide to cross-over to the IDDs group in a future date, will still be followed for their progress.\n\nBased on routine care, subjects will be seen at day of implant, 1 month post-implant, 2 months post-implant, and 3 months post-implant."
