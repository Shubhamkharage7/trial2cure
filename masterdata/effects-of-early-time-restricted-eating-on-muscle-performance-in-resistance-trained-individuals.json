Two parallel groups will be randomly assigned to either the early time-restricted eating or a control group. All participants will be asked to maintain their usual exercise routines during the 6 week intervention period. Muscle strength and endurance are the primary outcomes. Body composition (body weight, fat mass, fat-free mass and percent body fat), hunger and satiety ratings, sleep quality, energy intake, diet quality, macronutrient composition and adherence are secondary outcome measures."
