            "briefSummary": "This study aims to determine whether treatment response with IV ketamine is superior to treatment response with IV midazolam in adults with moderate to severe MUD.\n\nThe study design is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing intravenous (IV) ketamine against IV midazolam, delivered over six weeks in 120 adults with moderate to severe methamphetamine use disorder (MUD).",
            "detailedDescription": "Effective management for methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) remains elusive, despite widespread misuse of this stimulant. Psychological interventions have demonstrated modest benefits, and relapse rates are high. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapies for MUD. This study explores the efficacy, safety, and feasibility for intravenous (IV) ketamine as a treatment for MUD and will help to determine the effect size for a larger, multi-site trial of intravenous (IV) ketamine in MUD.\n\nParticipants will receive either IV ketamine (0.50mg/kg) or IV midazolam (0.02mg/kg) over 40 minutes per infusion for a total of eight (8) infusions over six (6) weeks. Medical management sessions with a study clinician will be provided to all participants once weekly (from Weeks 1 through 6).\n\nThe use of IV ketamine in this trial is consistent in dose (0.5 mg/kg) and duration of infusion (40-minute-long) to other studies of ketamine for psychiatric disorders (such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, both of which are often comorbid in individuals with MUD) and substance use disorder. However, IV ketamine has not been directly evaluated as mono-pharmacotherapy in those with MUD yet.\n\nAdditionally, participants will be asked to participate in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions once weekly (from Weeks 1 through 12) on a non-infusion day."
