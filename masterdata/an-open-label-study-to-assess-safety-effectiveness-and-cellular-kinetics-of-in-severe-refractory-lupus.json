Patients who have had at least one severe infection that required prolonged hospitalization in the intensive care setting within 5 years prior to screening and/or at least one severe infection that required prolonged hospitalization within one year prior to screening.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, lung diseases or any other illness that are not related to SLE that in the opinion of the Investigator would jeopardize the ability of the patient to tolerate lymphodepletion and CD19 CAR-T cell therapy\n* Prior history of malignancy except for localized basal cell or squamous skin cancer. Other malignancies for which the patient is judged to be cured by local surgical therapy, such as head and neck cancer, or stage I breast cancer will be considered on an individual basis\n* Any patients requiring medications prohibited by the protocol\n* Any psychiatric condition or disability making compliance with treatment or informed consent impossible\n* Prior treatment with anti-CD19 therapy, adoptive T cell therapy or any prior gene therapy product (e.g. CAR-T cell therapy)\n* History of bone marrow/hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n* Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to conceive during the course of the study\n* Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using a highly effective method of contraception starting from the time of enrollment to at least 12 months after the YTB323 infusion and until CAR-T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests\n* Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse from the time enrollment for at least 12 months after the YTB323 infusion and until CAR-T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests\n* Any acute, severe lupus related flare during screening that needs immediate treatment and/or makes the immunosuppressive washout impossible; thus, makes the patient ineligible for CD19 CAR-T therapy as judged by the Investigator, such as acute central nervous system (CNS) lupus (e.g. psychosis, epilepsy) or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome\n* Significant, likely irreversible organ damage related to SLE, e.g. end stage renal disease, that in the opinion of the Investigator renders CD19 CAR-T cell therapy would be unlikely to benefit the patient\n* B cell aplasia",
