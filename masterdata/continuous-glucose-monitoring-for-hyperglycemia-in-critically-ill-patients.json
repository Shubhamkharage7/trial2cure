The study will examine relevant outcomes for patients in the ICU with diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia. The primary outcome of the study will be the proportion of time in target range (blood glucose 70-180 mg/dL).",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Purpose:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) versus point of care (POC) glucose monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting for differences in glycemic control and other important outcomes.\n\nResearch Plan:\n\nThis will be a prospective, single-center, randomized comparative trial of adult patients at North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System anticipated to be admitted to an ICU for a minimum of 48 hours after enrollment. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of the study groups (CGM or POC) after being found eligible for inclusion and giving consent to participate. The CGM group will receive glycemic management based on CGM readings. The POC group will receive glycemic management based on POC glucose readings.\n\nStudy Outcomes:\n\nGroups will be compared for differences in clinical and safety outcomes. The primary outcome will be the proportion of time in target range (BG 70-180mg/dL). Secondary outcomes will include mean glucose, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, ICU length of stay, mortality, glucose variability, cost, and patient satisfaction. Safety outcomes will include new infection, acute kidney injury, delirium, agitation, and pain.\n\nAnalysis Methods:\n\nDescriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods will be used as appropriate to report findings of this study."
