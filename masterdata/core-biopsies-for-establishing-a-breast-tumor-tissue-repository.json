            "briefSummary": "This research trial establishes a breast tumor tissue repository from core biopsies. Collecting breast tissue from core biopsies may allow doctors to learn more about the biology of breast cancer and to analyze proteins, genes, and other components of tumor cells. It may also allow doctors to conduct future studies to help understand how breast cancer grows and how it responds to different types of therapy. This will help doctors develop better breast cancer therapies and better tests to help make treatment decisions.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To develop a baseline and serial breast cancer core biopsy repository within the University of Southern California (USC)/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center Women's Cancer Program.\n\nII. To develop and maintain a secure clinical database of relevant demographic, clinical, pathologic and longitudinal outcome characteristics of the samples to be banked.\n\nIII. To have an efficient process for the distribution of de-identified samples from the bank to researchers with institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols or exemptions for the study of breast cancer-related questions. These studies would include analyses of tumor proteins and nucleic acids, serum/plasma and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and immune cells in relationship to other baseline and follow-up clinical and pathological variables.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I (PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER WHO WILL UNDERGO DEFINITIVE SURGERY BEFORE ANY SYSTEMIC THERAPY): Patients undergo baseline and, if applicable, follow-up core needle biopsies of breast cancer in the breast, regional nodes, and distant metastases. Patients who experience a recurrence or progression after therapy undergo additional core biopsies at the time of recurrence. Clinical and blood specimens will also be gathered.\n\nCOHORT II (PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED BREAST CANCER WHO WILL RECEIVE STANDARD OF CARE SYSTEMIC THERAPY BEFORE SURGERY OR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED UNRESECTABLE DISEASE): Patients undergo core biopsy, clinical, and blood sample collection as in Cohort I. Patients also undergo biopsies at a specific time point following the initiation of standard systemic therapy.\n\nCOHORT III (PATIENTS BEING EVALUATED FOR A SUSPICIOUS BREAST MASS THAT HAS A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CANCER): Patients undergo core biopsy, clinical, and blood sample collection as in Cohort I. Patients who have Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 4b, 4c, and 5 lesions may undergo up to 6 additional 6 core biopsies.\n\nCOHORT IV (PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER RECURRENCE OR PROGRESSION \\[LOCAL, REGIONAL, OR DISTANT/METASTATIC\\]): Patients undergo core biopsy, clinical, and blood sample collection as in Cohort I. Patients may also undergo 1-3 extra core biopsies.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up every 6 months."
