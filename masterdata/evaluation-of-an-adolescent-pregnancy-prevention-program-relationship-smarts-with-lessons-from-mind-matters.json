            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized control trial (RCT) is to assess an innovative adolescent pregnancy prevention program among youth that are at the highest risk of adolescent pregnancy, to prevent pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS in the greater Miami area in Florida. The primary research question it aims to answer is:\n\n(RQ1a): What is the effect of adding 4.5 hours of Mind Matters trauma-coping skills curriculum to the Relationship Smarts Plus curriculum, on rates of unprotected sex among 9th and 10th graders compared to the students receiving only the 14-hour-long Relationship Smarts Plus curriculum? (RQ1b): What is the effect of the 14-hour-long Relationship Smarts Plus curriculum on rates of unprotected sex among 9th and 10th graders compared to the control group receiving only financial literacy? Participants will complete program lessons and complete surveys for data collection.\n\nThe RCT will assess behavioral health outcomes and other psychological outcomes at four-time points (baseline, post-program, 3 months, and 12 months)",
            "detailedDescription": "The intervention combines the pregnancy prevention curriculum, Relationship Smarts Plus (RSP+) with lessons from the trauma coping skills curriculum, Mind Matters (MM). The mental health component was added to assess the importance of mental health as a risk factor for teen pregnancy. Researchers will estimate the effect of Mind Matters (MM) by comparing the RSP+ \\& MM treatment arm with the RSP+ treatment arm. This answers RQ1a: If MM has an impact, then researchers will answer RQ1b by comparing the RSP+ treatment arm with the control arm. If there's no impact, then RQ1b will be answered by comparing the pooled RSP+ and RSP+ \\& MM treatment arms with the control arm.\n\nThis study is funded through the Personal Responsibility Education Program Innovative Strategies (PREIS), which is administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau, part of Health and Human Services,\n\nTrinity Church, Miami Gardens, is responsible for site and participant recruitment as well as the implementation of the intervention. Participants are randomized at the classroom level. All control group participants will only receive a financial literacy program.\n\nAMTC \\& Associates is the external evaluator, The Dibble Institute is the curricula developer."
