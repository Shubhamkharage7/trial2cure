            "briefSummary": "The objective of this clinical investigation is to collect scientifically valid safety and effectiveness data on the Acuity 200\u2122 (fluoroxyfocon A) Orthokeratology Contact Lens for Overnight Wear. The clinical performance data reported from this study is intended to be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in support of a new Premarket Application (PMA).",
            "detailedDescription": "Orthokeratology is an alternative method to correct refractive errors using individually designed gas permeable (rigid) lenses worn overnight to temporarily modify the curvature of cornea. Modern orthokeratology technology uses highly permeable rigid lens material and dynamic reverse geometry designs to allow faster and more effective corneal reshaping. Acuity 200\u2122 (fluoroxyfocon A) is a stable material with relatively higher oxygen permeability compared to other marketed gas permeable materials. The clinical effects of wearing contact lenses that limit oxygen supply have been extensively reported with potential complications related to hypoxia including corneal swelling, epithelial microcysts, limbal hyperemia, corneal vascularization, refractive error changes and corneal distortion. Given the significantly higher oxygen permeability characteristics of Acuity 200\u2122 (fluoroxyfocon A) relative to currently FDA approved orthokeratology materials, the material is well-suited for overnight wear applications-such as orthokeratology, when the eye is subject to hypoxic conditions during sleep.\n\nThe objective of the clinical investigation (AVDR 2022-01) is to collect scientifically valid safety and effectiveness data on the Acuity 200\u2122 (fluoroxyfocon A) Orthokeratology Contact Lens for Overnight Wear. The clinical performance data reported from the study is intended to be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in support of a new Premarket Application (PMA). The hypothesis is that the primary and secondary outcomes for safety and effectiveness are consistent with currently marketed devices approved by the FDA for overnight orthokeratology."

Is free of eye disease and binocular vision problems (e.g., strabismus, amblyopia, oculomotor nerve palsies, corneal disease, etc.) that may affect vision or contact lens wear; Has normal healthy eyes with no evidence of lid infection or structural abnormality; a conjunctiva free of infection; a cornea clear and free of edema, visually or topographically significant scars, clinically significant staining, significant vascularization, infiltrates when examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy; and no evidence of iritis or uveitis.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant over the course of the study.\n2. Is a potential pediatric subject that does not have the appropriate level of psychological maturity to comply with appropriate procedures needed for safe wear according to the investigator.\n3.
