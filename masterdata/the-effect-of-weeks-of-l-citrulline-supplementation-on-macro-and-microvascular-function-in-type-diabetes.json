Visit 1 (screening visit) will take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, visit 2 will take approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes, and visits 3-5 will be approximately 3 hours each.\n\nVisit 1 will measure blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, anthropometry, body composition, and muscle strengths. Visits 2-5 will assess vascular function and glucose control during fasted and acute hyperglycemia conditions induced by 75g of glucose ingestion."
