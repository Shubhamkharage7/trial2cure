            "briefSummary": "Disruptive behavioral disorders are common in early childhood, affecting up to 15% of preschool-aged children. Behavioral parent training programs are a first-line evidence-based treatment for child disruptive behaviors. There is evidence showing that (a) these programs are effective in reducing disruptive behavior and improving long-term outcomes, and (b) there is an excellent return on investment for early intervention. Nevertheless, there is limited availability of behavioral parent training programs, particularly in rural settings, due to shortages of trained clinicians. Thus, there is a pressing need for expanding the mental healthcare workforce in rural/underserved areas. The study will involve an established parent-based behavioral intervention (First Approach Skills Training for Behavior; or FAST-B) with added pilot component incorporating parents who have previously been through parent behavioral management training programs as Peer Supports.",
            "detailedDescription": "Up to 30 (15 per group, with 2 total groups) participant families will be recruited for FAST-B Peers intervention. These participants will receive the FAST-B standard of care in the context of the research study through trained clinician on the research team. As is the current standard of clinical care, FAST-B will be delivered in 1-hour weekly sessions in group-based format via Zoom, using the standard FAST-B curriculum and caregiver workbooks (https://www.seattlechildrens.org/health-safety/classes-events/behavior-basics-class/).\n\nIn addition to standard of care, half the FAST-B participants will be randomized 1:1 to additionally receive an added pilot Peer Support component. Upon enrollment completion of FAST-B group, randomization will be performed via random number generator. This FAST-B Peers pilot intervention involves trained Peer Supports who will each work with 2-3 families over the course of the 5-week intervention.\n\nPeer Supports will conduct weekly calls with families going through FAST-B intervention to review the material presented, discuss application for the family, problem-solve barriers, and reinforce the family's efforts. Peer supports will additionally receive weekly consultation (1-2 hours/week) with the clinician delivering FAST-B. After the intervention is completed, both peer supports and participant families will be asked to participate in follow-up focus groups to discuss their experience in the intervention, specifically as it relates to the work of the peer supports."
