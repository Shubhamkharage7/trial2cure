            "briefSummary": "This descriptive study aims to evaluate the experience of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma receiving standard of care isatuximab-irfc through collection of quantitative, qualitative and wearable data. Fifty adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma receiving standard of care isatuximab-irfc will be enrolled across 2 sites, The University of California San Francisco and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Consented participants will be enrolled in a 3-month digital health coaching program through which electronic patient reported outcomes and wearable activity data will be collected. Outcomes include treatment experience, quality of life, financial toxicity, treatment adherence, symptom burden and health self-efficacy. These will be captured by patient reported outcome measures including the Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment- Real World (PQAT-RW), Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGIC/S), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma (QLQ-MY20), and the European QoL-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Form (CBI-B), Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Medication Adherence Index, Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) Instrument.\n\nClinical data, including treatment history, healthcare utilization, and co-morbidities, as well as demographic data will be collected via the electronic health record from each clinical site. This data will be complemented by qualitative data from a selected cohort of study participants with a focus on treatment experience ranging from infusion burden, toxicity management, to overall quality of life. Evaluation of this data in combination will be used to better understand the treatment experience of individuals on standard of care isatuximab-irfc specifically, and with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma generally, contributing to an existing gap in the literature regarding patient reported outcomes from diverse data sources. Outcomes will be analyzed with attention to the relationship between social determinants of health, including race, ethnicity, and geographic location, and treatment experience as reflected in both the qualitative and quantitative data."
