The study will be conducted in male and female subjects, greater than 1 year of age, with iobenguane avid, who have recurrent or progressive disease, regardless of overall response to frontline therapy, where frontline therapy includes a minimum of 4 cycles of induction therapy at any time prior to enrollment, high-risk neuroblastoma.\n\nSubjects who are eligible for combination treatment will receive vorinostat 180 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 400 mg) once daily for 14 days (Day -1 to Day 12) continuously.\n\nSubjects will receive 18 mCi/kg of 131I-MIBG intravenously on Day 1.\n\nIf the subject qualifies, the subject will receive the second treatment course of 131I-MIBG in combination with vorinostat or 131I-MIBG alone (no sooner than 6 weeks following first treatment course). Subject must have an overall response of stable disease or better, as assessed by the Investigator, and meet certain predefined criteria to receive the second course of treatment.\n\nFollowing a screening period of up to 4 weeks, the duration in the study treatment phase for an individual subject, who receives two treatments, is up to 26 weeks. For an individual subject, who receives one treatment only, the duration of the treatment phase is 16 weeks. In addition, there is a 2-year follow-up after the treatment phase, during which assessments will be performed to assess disease progression, as well as record adverse events."

Clinically important cardiac, pulmonary, and hepatic impairment.\n11. Vorinostat treatment exclusion criteria (subjects, who meet any one of these criteria and otherwise meet eligibility criteria, are still eligible for 131I-MIBG monotherapy)\n\n    1. Since valproic acid has HDAC inhibitory activity, patients must not have received valproic acid within 30 days of study entry.\n    2. Since vorinostat may prolong the QT interval, patients must not be receiving other medications known to prolong the QT interval at the time of study entry .
