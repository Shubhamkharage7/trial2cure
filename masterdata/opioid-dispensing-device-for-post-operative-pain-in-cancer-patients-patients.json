The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the Addinex device in cancer patients undergoing cancer-related surgery that require pain control with opioids after the surgery. Participants will be asked to answer questions about their medical history and background, fill out questionnaires, use a mobile application associated with the device, and undergo a phone interview one month after stopping use of the device. This study aims to find out how participants like using the Addinex device as opposed to a traditional pill bottle. Results of this study will help determine if the Addinex device could be useful to patients in the future after surgeries, as opposed to typical pill bottles.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a non-randomized pilot study to test the use of the Addinex system among participants receiving opioids following surgery. The Addinex system is designed to dispense opioid medication to participants on a provider-determined schedule, to track participant use of the device, and to allow for return and disposal of unused opioids. This study will determine the feasibility of using Addinex for these purposes."
