The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure (eg, noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n* A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum as required by local regulations) within 7 days before the first dose of study intervention.\n\n  * If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.\n* Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after study intervention.\n* The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.\n\nInformed Consent\n\n* Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\nMedical Conditions\n\n* corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation defined as a QTc \u2265 470 ms using the Bazett formula.\n* Known symptomatic Central nervous system (CNS) metastases requiring steroids. Participants with previously diagnosed CNS metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to enrollment, have discontinued high dose steroid treatment for these metastases for at least 2 weeks, and are neurologically stable (physiologic doses of steroids and short courses of steroids for other indications are acceptable).\n* Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy; however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy, hypothyroidism, and rash Grade \u2264 2 are acceptable, and other Grade \u2264 2 adverse events (AEs) not constituting a safety risk based on the investigator's judgement are acceptable.\n* An uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection requiring antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral therapy, symptomatic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, could substantially increase the risk associated with participation in this study.\n* Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the participant at high-risk for treatment complications.\n\nPrior/Concomitant Therapy\n\n* Received prior treatment with lurbinectedin or trabectedin.\n* Received prior treatment with any investigational product within 4 weeks of first infusion of study intervention. Observational studies are permitted.\n* Received live or live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment or plans to receive live vaccines during study participation. Administration of inactive vaccines or messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines (for example, inactivated influenza vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines) are allowed.\n* Had major surgery \u2264 4 weeks or radiation therapy \u2264 2 weeks prior to enrollment unless fully recovered. Prior palliative radiotherapy is permitted, provided it was completed at least 2 weeks prior to participant enrollment.\n* Received prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or solid organ transplant.\n* Received chemotherapy \u2264 3 weeks prior to start of study intervention.\n\nDiagnostic Assessments\n\n* Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening (positive HBV surface antigen or Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for HCV RNA if HCV antibody test is positive).\n* Human immunodeficiency infection at screening (positive anti-HIV antibody).\n\nOther Exclusions\n\n* Has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study intervention.\n* The participant or parent(s)/guardian(s) is/are unable to comply with the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements, in the opinion of the investigator",
