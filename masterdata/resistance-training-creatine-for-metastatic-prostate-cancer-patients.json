Resistance training, with or without creatine monohydrate supplement, may help to improve feelings of tiredness and overall physical function in patients with prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the change in lean mass with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance training compared to resistance training alone.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate change in other body composition variables (i.e. fat mass, fat-free mass, percent body fat, appendicular lean mass) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance training compared to resistance training alone.\n\nII. To evaluate the change in health outcomes associated with body composition (i.e. physical function, fatigue, insulin regulation) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance training compared to resistance training alone.\n\nIII. To examine associations between creatine supplementation use and changes in biomarkers linked with prostate cancer progression (prostate specific antigen \\[PSA\\] and inflammatory markers).\n\nIV. To evaluate the degree of adherence to the creatine supplementation protocol.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients complete Personal Optimism with Exercise Recovery (POWER) resistance training program sessions twice weekly over 30-60 minute each for 12 weeks.\n\nGROUP II: Patients complete POWER resistance training program sessions twice weekly over 30-60 minutes each for 12 weeks and receive creatine monohydrate supplementation orally (PO) 4 times daily during week 1, and then once daily (QD) during weeks 2-12."
