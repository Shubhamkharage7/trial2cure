            "briefSummary": "The focus of this research is on increasing the uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in young cancer survivors, a vulnerable population at high risk for developing new cancers (such as cervical and anal cancer) caused by persistent HPV infection. An effective vaccine exists that can prevent these cancers, but HPV vaccine uptake is low among young cancer survivors. This research will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based intervention, adapted for use by healthcare providers in pediatric oncology clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors 9-17 years of age. Results of this research will provide important information that can be used to implement new strategies to increase the uptake of the HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "Childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new cancers (such as cervical and anal cancer) caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Compared with the age- and sex-matched general population, female and male cancer survivors have a 1.4- to 2.5-fold excess risk, respectively, of developing HPV-related malignancies. Fortunately, HPV-related malignancies are largely preventable due to availability of the nonavalent HPV vaccine, which offers protection against \\~90% of oncogenic HPV subtypes. We have previously shown that uptake of the HPV vaccine is significantly lower in cancer survivors compared with general population peers (22.0% vs 42.5% in those age 13-17yrs), and that lack of healthcare provider recommendation is the strongest predictor of HPV vaccine non-initiation in cancer survivors. Strategies that are most successful in increasing HPV vaccine uptake in the general population focus on improving healthcare provider knowledge about the HPV vaccine, enhancing the skills that healthcare providers need to effectively recommend the vaccine to young people and their parents, and reducing barriers to receiving the vaccine.\n\nThis study will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based intervention (HPV-PROTECT), adapted for use by healthcare providers in pediatric oncology clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors (9 to 17 years of age and at least one year following completion of cancer therapy). The HPV-PROTECT intervention has three components: i) Provider Communication Training; ii) Assessment and Peer Feedback/Coaching; and iii) Provider Toolkit, and is designed to increase provider knowledge regarding use of the HPV vaccine in the cancer survivor population, enhance provider skills in delivering brief, compelling HPV vaccine recommendations to parents of young cancer survivors, present ongoing feedback to providers regarding clinic- and provider-level survivor HPV vaccination rates, and decrease barriers to receipt of vaccine by survivors through the provision of Vaccine Action Plans. If the intervention is effective in improving and sustaining increased uptake of the HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors, this study will contribute important information needed to move forward with testing the widespread use of the intervention in pediatric oncology practices."
