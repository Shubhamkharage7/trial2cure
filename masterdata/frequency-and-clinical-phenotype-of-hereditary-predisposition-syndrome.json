            "briefSummary": "This research will have a significant impact on the overall management of those cancer patients and their family members who are at risk for hereditary cancer due to germline inactivation of BAP1. Our study will ultimately facilitate the development of novel screening, prevention and treatment strategies for these individuals with the syndrome. Because the vast majority of UM develop in pre-existing nevi, characterization of individuals at high risk for development of UM will allow closer screening and earlier intervention which would improve the treatment outcome not only for retaining vision but also for overall survival. Similarly in patients with germline BAP1 mutation CM develops in premalignant atypical melanocytic lesions and careful follow up of these patients will improve the outcome of their disease. In addition this study could have impact on the management of patients with personal and/or family history of several other cancers reported in patients with germline BAP1 mutation such as mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, meningioma and basal cell carcinoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein-1), is a deubiquitinating enzyme with a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase function that has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene with a role in cell proliferation and growth inhibition. Recently germline mutations in BAP1 have been identified by our group and others in families with hereditary cancers. However, the clinical spectrum of cancers in patients with germline BAP1 is still not clear. The association of germline BAP1 mutations with increased risks for uveal melanoma (UM), mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma (CM), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and BAP1-inactivated melanocytic tumors is fairly well established. However, several other cancers have been reported in these patients and their family members including cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, meningioma, basal cell carcinoma and other internal malignancies. Identification of the clinical phenotype of BAP1-TPDS is important for proper counseling and management of patients."
