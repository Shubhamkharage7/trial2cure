            "briefSummary": "The current study is a clinical trial, meaning a research study in which human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related behavioral outcomes. Specifically, male and female adults with current suicidal intent will be randomly assigned to receive either a 1-hour session of crisis response planning (CRP) or a 1-hour session of standard crisis risk management (Treatment as Usual). The effects of both conditions on changes in emotion regulation, behavioral inhibition, stress reactivity, and suicide risk will be evaluated post-intervention and at six-month follow-up. Additional assessments of changes in mood and suicidality will be collected daily during the first 10-days following intervention, and then monthly for a duration of six months. A cohort of healthy controls is included in the study but are not randomized to either treatment condition. The investigators hypothesize the following: 1) A single session of CRP will acutely change suicide risk and 2) Individuals who receive CRP will show sustained improvements in measures of suicidality when compared to individuals who received the Treatment as Usual intervention."

The CRP active component involves a collaborative process in which the therapist invites the patient to share the events, symptoms, and contextual factors leading up to and surrounding the participant's suicidal crisis. Next, the patient and therapist identify the patient's personal warning signs for an emotional crisis, self-management coping skills, patient's reasons for living, and sources of social support. These components are written, by the patient, on an index card. The index card serves as a concrete reference for patients in the real-world.",
