            "briefSummary": "This phase IV trial studies the effect of radiofrequency ablation in treating patients with benign or low risk thyroid nodule. Radiofrequency ablation uses a needle to deliver a high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells by heating them. The goal of this research study is to learn if ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation can provide the same treatment result as standard surgical removal of the thyroid nodule, small primary thyroid, or thyroid cancers that have come back. Researchers also want to learn if the procedure can be less invasive and perhaps provide a better recovery response than surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate the longitudinal thyroid nodule volume changes induced by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) during post procedure follow-up.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate treatment response to compressive and/or cosmetic symptoms that affect patient's quality of life.\n\nII. Evaluate the sonographic features of the nodule induced by RFA.\n\nIII. Compare cost of ultrasound guided RFA to gold standard surgical thyroidectomy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo ultrasound guided RFA over 1-2 hours.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months."
