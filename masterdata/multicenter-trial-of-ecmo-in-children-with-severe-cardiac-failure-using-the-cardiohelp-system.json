            "briefSummary": "The goal of this multicenter observational clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiohelp System for VA-ECMO in children with cardiac failure. The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiohelp device for pediatric ECMO?\n* What are the optimal performance specifications of the Cardiohelp device in children? Should the Cardiohelp device be FDA-cleared for children?\n\nChildren who are receiving the Cardiohelp device will be approached and consented to participate if interested. Participants will undergo a standardized data collection to estimate survival to 30 days and the prevalence of serious adverse events like stroke, bleeding, and hemolysis.\n\nOutcomes will be compared to performance goals (PG) derived from the ECMO literature.\n\nFunding Source -- FDA OOPD (Office of Orphan Product Development)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiohelp System for up to 30 days of support in children with severe cardiac failure. Despite more than 50 years of use and significant mortality, no standalone ECMO device has ever been FDA-cleared for ECMO. All ECMO use in children is off-label and this may explain why there is significant center-based variation in ECMO use that is not evidence driven. This study seeks to change that by collecting systematic safety and effectiveness data on a single standardized ECMO circuit (Cardiohelp Device). The goal is to provide the data necessary to secure FDA clearance of the first pediatric ECMO system, to determine the optimal performance range of the Cardiohelp device in infants and children, and to provide the FDA with a predicate device to support FDA clearance of other ECMO systems."
