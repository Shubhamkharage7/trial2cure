            "briefSummary": "This is a validation study involving the Bilistick System 2.0 point-of-care bilirubin measuring device. The validation will be conducted by comparing bilirubin measurements utilizing the standard-of-care blood sample collected for both a diagnostic reference device and Bilistick System 2.0 point-of-care device. Whole blood samples collected from male or female newborns (\\<2-weeks of age) born at a Kettering Health Network facility to obtain a total of 80 valid comparison pairs between the reference device and the Bilistick System 2.0 point-of-care device with current laboratory standards.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose a prospective diagnostic validation study comparing total bilirubin values measured under the reference clinical methodology to the point-of-care Bilistick System 2.0 testing device. During the routine standard-of-care whole blood sample collection (0.5 milliliters whole blood draw) for bilirubin assessments under reference clinical methodology, an additional 0.035 milliliters of whole blood will be collected (not to exceed more than 2 sample collections per week) for measurement in the point-of-care Bilistick System 2.0. The resulting Bilistick System 2.0 data will be recorded, but will not be entered in the patients' electronic medical records or used for any diagnostic or medical decision purposes.\n\nWhole blood samples collected from male or female newborns (\\<2-weeks of age) born at a Kettering Health Network facility to obtain a total of 80 valid comparison pairs between the reference device and the Bilistick System 2.0 point-of-care device will be included on study.\n\nConsent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved and the parent or legal guardian of the participant will be asked to read the document. The investigator or delegated study staff will explain the research study to the parent or legal guardian of the participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided to allow for the comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and rights of the research participant. The parent or legal guardian of the participant will be informed that participation is voluntary, they can withdraw at any time. Sufficient opportunity will be provided to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The parent or legal guardian of the participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.\n\nSince this study uses blood collected during an existing standard of care blood collection (i.e., there will be NO separate research-specific heel stick) this study poses no additional risk and parental permission will be required by only one parent."
