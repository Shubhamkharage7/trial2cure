Then they will see a picture of a button on the screen together with all three categories. If they press the button, they may prevent the shock from occurring. Pressing the button for one of the conditioned categories will prevent the shock from happening. Pressing the button to the other conditioned cue will not prevent the shock .Pressing the button to the third category does nothing. On day 2, subjects will be given $5 and will be told that they can press a button to avoid a shock. The number of times the button was pressed will be counted and if it is less than the number by another randomly selected participant then the participant will get to keep the money.",
