Each hula lesson will consist of 8 participants, providing them with the opportunity to engage-in this social support network.\n\nFor the remaining 5 months of the Ola Mau i ka Hula Program, hula lessons led by the kumu hula will be reduced to once a month for 60 min. In addition, the intervention group will meet with a community-peer educator weekly over this 5-month period. Each meeting will be 90 minutes in length with 60 minutes of hula practice following the same format as previous classes, and 30 minutes will cover the PILI Lifestyle Plan curriculum and cultural-based cognitive exercises, alternating weekly.",
