            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nBiliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is cancer of the slender tubes that carry fluids in the liver. People with advanced BTC have few treatment options, and their survival rates are very low.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a study drug (CDX-1140) combined 3 other drugs (capecitabine, oxaliplatin, Keytruda) in people with BTC.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older with BTC that progressed after treatment and is not eligible for surgery or liver transplant.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam. They will have blood tests and tests of their heart function. They will have imaging scans. They may need to have a biopsy: A small sample of tissue will be taken from their tumor using a small needle.\n\nThree of the drugs are given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm (intravenous). The fourth drug is a pill taken by mouth with water.\n\nParticipants will be treated in 21-day cycles. They will receive intravenous treatments on day 1 and day 8 of the first 6 cycles. After that, they will receive intravenous treatments only on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nParticipants will take the pill twice a day only for the first 2 weeks of each cycle. They will stop taking this drug after 6 cycles.\n\nImaging scans will be repeated every 9 weeks.\n\nParticipants may continue receiving the study treatment for up to 2 years. Follow-up visits, including imaging scans, will continue for 3 more years. These images may be taken at other locations and sent to the researchers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nAdvanced biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) has limited treatment options in the second line setting and a dismal prognosis.\n\nCapecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) in combination with Keytruda is a tolerable and potentially effective treatment for patients with refractory advanced BTC.\n\nProgrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory receptor that is expressed by all Tcells during activation. It regulates T-cell effector functions during various physiological responses, including acute and chronic infection, cancer and autoimmunity, and immune\n\nhomeostasis. Keytruda is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody indicated for the treatment of different cancers including patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nCD40-mediated activation of macrophages and dendritic cells (DC)s in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) significantly improves response to anti-PD-1 therapy in preclinical studies. The efficacy of this regimen is enhanced by first-line chemotherapy,\n\nsupporting the potential antitumor efficacy of the combination of CD40 agonist antibody (anti-CD40) with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPhase I: To estimate safe dose of CDX-1140 used in combination with CAPOX, and Keytruda (R)\n\nPhase II:\n\nTo evaluate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) in participants with advanced BTC treated with CDX-1140, CAPOX, and Keytruda (R).\n\nTo determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 in participants with advanced BTC.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHistopathological confirmation of BTC or histopathological confirmation of carcinoma in the setting of clinical and radiological characteristics which, together with the pathology,are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of BTC\n\nAge \\>=18 years\n\nEvaluable or measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1\n\nDesign:\n\nPhase I/II, single-arm, non-randomized trial of Keytruda(R) and CDX-1140 in combination with CAPOX in participants with BTC in the second-line setting.\n\nInitially, 9-12 participants will be enrolled into a Phase I portion of the trial. If safe, we will continue enrollment as planned into Phase II, if not, we will close the protocol.\n\nAfter estimation of CDX-1140 recommended phase II dose, the first 13 participants enrolled at this dose level of CDX-1140 in Phase I and Phase II will be evaluated for progression. If among these 13 participants, no more than 2 can be progression-free at the 6-months evaluation, then no further participants will be enrolled as soon as this can be determined."
