Since then, with the support of SAMSHA block grants to states, there are CSC programs across the nation.\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a learning health system with sites providing CSC treatment of first-episode psychosis (FEP). Sites are drawn from five states: Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma and South Carolina. They vary in populations served, levels of funding available and research experience. All are committed to advancing the development of CSC using a health learning system model, to implementing a practical assessment strategy to enhance outcome assessment and to conducting research to improve outcomes that will be meaningful to the full range of stakeholders."
