            "detailedDescription": "670 nm energy in the form of red light dilates isolated blood vessels. This study seeks to measure vessel dilation in human subjects exposed to this energy at different irradiance intensities (25 milliwatts (mW)/cm2 and 75 mW/cm2). The intent of this protocol is to measure blood flow in the gastrocnemius muscle before and after exposure to 670 nm light energy. This protocol will be performed in healthy subjects, who do not meet exclusion criteria. The study consists of one visit. Blood flow measurement will be performed using contrast enhanced ultrasound, a method by which ultrasound contrast is continuously infused into the blood stream. Ultrasound records images in the area of interest and flow is related to the intensity of the contrast in each image. After baseline blood flow images are collected, the subject will receive red light energy to the gastrocnemius muscle with concurrent blood flow measurements with contrast ultrasound. The subject will be monitored post procedure and the study will then be completed."
