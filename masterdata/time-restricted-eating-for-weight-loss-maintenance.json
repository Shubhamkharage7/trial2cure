This study will be conducted in 40 individuals with non-surgical weight loss of \u22655% initial body weight recruited from the NYU Langone Health Weight Management Program and NY-MOVE! Weight Management Clinic at the Manhattan VA. Measurements will occur at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Participants will be randomized with equal allocation to 2 groups: (1) TRE6 or (2) TRE10. The TRE6 will restrict their eating window to 6 hours per day and the TRE10 to 10 hours per day."
