            "briefSummary": "It is well established that rehydration with a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution is more effective in comparison to plain water. This is primarily based on the sodium-glucose co transporter, based on which the world health organization has based its oral rehydration solution recommendations. Also, rehydration with a solution that includes sodium and glucose plasma osmolality should not drop as much as it happens during rehydration with water. As a result, we should have higher fluid intake due to higher thirst perception and lower urinary output due to higher levels of vasopressin.\n\nThe present study aims to examine the effectiveness of a electrolyte-glucose drink on rehydration following exercise-induced dehydration."
