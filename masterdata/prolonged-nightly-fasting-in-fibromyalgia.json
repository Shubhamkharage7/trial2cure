            "briefSummary": "The present randomized-controlled pilot trial will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week prolonged nightly fasting (PNF) intervention protocol in 20 adults with fibromyalgia.\n\nAim 1: Evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the PNF intervention among participants with fibromyalgia.\n\nAim 2: Evaluate preliminary efficacy of PNF on pain severity and sensitivity, mood, sleep and inflammation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, negative mood, and cognitive dysfunction. It is estimated about 4 million individuals in the U.S. are affected by fibromyalgia, which results in high disability, lost productivity, and poor quality of life. Various medications have been tested, but findings suggest only small therapeutic effects with high side effects. First line evidence-based psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, also yield only small to moderate treatment effects and they require specialized personnel. Thus, there is a dire need to develop a novel approach to manage fibromyalgia symptoms with a high safety profile, are affordable, and are easily implemented by participants without extensive guidance and support from specialized personnel.\n\nProlonged nightly fasting (PNF) which is a type of time-restricted eating with no or minimal caloric intake for periods of time as few as 12 hours has been shown to promote various health benefits. PNF has also been demonstrated to be highly acceptable and adherable for adults with various clinical condition. Although some dietary patterns have been explored for their impact on pain, the effects of PNF on pain-related outcomes (e.g., pain severity, pain sensitivity), mood, sleep, and inflammation among individuals with fibromyalgia have not been examined. The present randomized-controlled pilot trial will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week PNF intervention protocol in 20 adults with fibromyalgia."
