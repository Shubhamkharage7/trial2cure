Pregnant women requiring labor induction will be randomly assigned to receive either nitrous oxide or oxygen during the Foley balloon placement. The primary outcome measured will be the success rate of the Foley balloon placement, with secondary outcomes including patient comfort, pain levels during the procedure, and any adverse effects. The study seeks to determine if nitrous oxide can improve the success rate of Foley balloon placement compared to oxygen and to evaluate the overall patient experience and safety associated with its use in this context."
