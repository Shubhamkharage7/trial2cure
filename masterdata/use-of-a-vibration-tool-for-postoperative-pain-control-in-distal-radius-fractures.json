            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to determine if using a vibration tool improves pain control after surgical treatment of distal radius fracture. Additionally, the investigators would like to determine if this tool has any impact on consumption of pain medications postoperatively.",
            "detailedDescription": "Traditionally, occupational therapists have utilized vibration for sensory re-education in compression neuropathies and peripheral nerve injuries. Vibration is also commonly used for desensitization of hypersensitivity following amputation, crush injury, and for hypersensitive scarring. Since the vibration tool is readily available in the hand therapy clinic, vibration analgesia should be further explored in the hand clinic to help reduce pain. Vibration is a simple, and non-invasive, tool and would be easy, economical, and practical to implement into the hand clinic for postoperative pain control. This research project will evaluate whether vibration can be a useful adjunct to current postoperative pain modalities. With a multidisciplinary approach, the investigators hope to highlight the use of non-opioid modalities of pain control in distal radius fractures and believe that the findings from this study may apply to other painful conditions of the hand as well."
