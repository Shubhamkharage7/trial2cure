We will use the blood and tissue for future studies. These studies will try to find ways to treat future breast cancer patients.\n\nBecause there is cancer left in your body after breast cancer treatment is finished, we think the cancer may be different than other cancers. Tissue from surgery will be used to try to grow that kind of cancer in the lab so we can find out more about it and how to treat it.\n\nBlood samples will be used to look at measurements of biomarkers to see how this cancer is different and seek new ways to identify and treat it."
