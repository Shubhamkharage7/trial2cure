Outcomes will be compared to matched subjects with basal ganglia ICH who undergo MIPS alone as part of the ENRICH trial. This study will take approximately two years to complete.",

These subjects will be enrolled at an ENRICH trial site independent of our Institution. Deidentified patient information from 20 subjects in this group, who will be matched to those in the ENRICH-PLUS group, will be provided to the principal investigator for comparison of outcomes.\n\nConsent for study participation will be obtained from the patient or the LAR only after fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria either before or after MIPS, which will be scheduled as a standard institutional procedure outside the realm of the study.\n\nStudy participants will be administered pioglitazone (15 mg tablet) either p.o. or enteral (via nasogastric tube). The first dose may be administered prior to surgery or within 3 hours of the end of surgery but must be administered within 24 hours of the index event or time last known normal (TLKN). Pioglitazone (15 mg tablet) administration will continue 3 times daily for 3 weeks, including after hospital discharge, if applicable.\n\nFollowing completion of pioglitazone, subjects will be followed at days 30, 90, 120 and 180 post MIPS. In addition to AE monitoring during these follow up's, a utility-weighted mRS (uw-mRS) at 180 days will serve as the primary end point."
