Staff in facilities assigned to the intervention are eligible to receive evidence-based programming in suicide detection and prevention (Shield of Care; SOC) and wellness skill-building (Skills for Life) through training and personalized coaching. Multiple training sessions will be offered to small groups of staff in-person in residential facilities and paired with personalized in-person and virtual coaching. Staff and youth in all facilities will be asked to complete periodic surveys assessing experiences in the facility, suicide and safety knowledge and risk, and their mental health and wellness. Researchers will compare outcomes of staff in youth in facilities assigned to the intervention compared to facilities in the training-as-usual condition."
