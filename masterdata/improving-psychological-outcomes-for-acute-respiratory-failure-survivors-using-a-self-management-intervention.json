            "briefSummary": "A growing number of patients are surviving a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) but may experience long-lasting psychological problems, but research evaluating such treatment for ICU patients is scant.\n\nThe goal of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefit of an evidence-based psychological intervention for anxiety and associated outcomes for ICU patients.\n\nThe main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is this intervention feasible and acceptable in ARF patients?\n* Is this intervention in the ICU and hospital associated with reduced anxiety symptoms?\n\nParticipants will participate in a cognitive behavioral therapy informed self-management intervention aimed to reduce anxiety symptoms. Researchers will compare the intervention group to patients who receive usual care to see if the intervention reduces symptoms at the the conclusion of the intervention and at 3 months follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "Statement of the Problem. An increasing number of adults develop acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). To improve patient outcomes, evidence-based guidelines recommend titrating sedatives to allow for patient wakefulness while in the ICU. However, among awake acute respiratory failure patients, anxiety can be a common and long-lasting problem. Outside of the ICU setting, cognitive behavioral therapy based self-management is an established, evidence-based, first-line treatment for patients with anxiety. However, there is limited evidence about the feasibility and benefit of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for acute respiratory failure patients with anxiety during hospitalization.\n\nSpecific Aims. This award proposal seeks to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a tailored self-management protocol vs. usual care in the ICU and subsequent hospital ward to establish its feasibility, acceptability (primary outcome; Aim 1a), and potential efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms and associated outcomes at hospital discharge (Aim 1b) and at 3-month follow-up (secondary outcomes; Aim 2). Experimental Approach. Pilot randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment and 3-month phone-based follow-up.\n\nSignificance of the results. ARF patients experience significant anxiety during ICU stay, reporting feelings of terror, fear of death, and loss of control. Up to 50% of ARF patients report clinically significant anxiety at ICU discharge, and up to 40% report persistent symptoms up to 5 years after ICU. This project provides an essential foundation for evaluating a novel intervention, with a strong evidence-base outside of the ICU, to reduce anxiety in acute respiratory failure patients."
