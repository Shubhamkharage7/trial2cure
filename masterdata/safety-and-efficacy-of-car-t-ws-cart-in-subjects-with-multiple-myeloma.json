            "briefSummary": "Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease. Although survival has improved, there are nevertheless diminishing durations of response to each subsequent line of therapy. This highlights the need for further therapeutic innovation. BCMA-targeting CAR-T cells show impressive response rates; however, their median duration of response is disappointing. The investigators propose that CS1(SLAMF7)-targeting CAR-T cells will fill a gap in the MM armamentarium.\n\nCS1 is an attractive target in MM because it is expressed in most patients. Elotuzumab (Empliciti\u00ae), an approved anti-CS1 antibody, has proven the clinical efficacy of this target. CAR-T cells are an ideal modality to target CS1, given that two approved treatments, ide-cel (idecabtagene vicleucel, AbecmaTM) and cilta-cel (ciltacabtagene autoleucel, Carvykti\u2122), have proven the potential for cellular immunotherapy in MM.\n\nThe investigators are testing the safety and preliminary anti-myeloma efficacy of WS-CART-CS1, a CAR-T cell therapy targeting CS1."
