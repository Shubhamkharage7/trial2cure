To address this public health concern, the proposed research seeks to use a multi-method approach to adapt a sleep intervention for African American adults with overweight/obesity not meeting national sleep duration or physical activity recommendations. The overall goal of the project is to reduce cancer and obesity-related health disparities among African Americans."

Participants in this condition will receive hardcopy weekly daily diary worksheets, and receive an online version of the sleep daily diary every morning to complete via text messaging. Sessions 2-4 will be between 15-30 minutes where Dr. Wu or a trained counselor will review the sleep diary, problem solve barriers to weekly goals, and sleep promoting behaviors will be reinforced.
