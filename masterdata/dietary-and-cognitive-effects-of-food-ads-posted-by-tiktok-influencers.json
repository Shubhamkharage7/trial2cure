Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) seeing an influencer with food or (2) seeing an influencer without food. Participants will complete a 15-minute survey in which they will be randomized to one of two conditions and view and rate TikTok influencer ads associated with their condition. Then they will complete a food purchasing task in which they will shop in an online store that will display six food items and six beverages. Finally, they will answer demographic questions (e.g., self-reported height and weight) and view a debriefing summary that describes the full purpose of the study."
