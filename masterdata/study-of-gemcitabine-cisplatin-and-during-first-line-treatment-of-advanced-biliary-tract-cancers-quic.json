The study will include a safety run-in involving 6 study participants. The goal of the safety run-in is to screen for early safety signals of the proposed drug combination. Trial enrollment can continue while full safety assessment is being completed for the first 6 subjects.\n\nParticipants will receive 4 cycles of combination therapy as described. After 4 cycles (\\~6 months), cisplatin will be discontinued, while gemcitabine, zimberelimab (AB122), and quemliclustat (AB680) will be continued. Subjects will be treated until disease progression or development of intolerable toxicities. In total, there will be up to 39 participants on the study."

Males able to father a child must be willing to abstain from heterosexual vaginal intercourse or to use an effective method(s) of contraception from initiation of treatment, during the study and for up to 120 days after the last dose of study drug(s).

Ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study, as determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior therapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or any immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of BTC.\n2. Known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins, or any excipient contained in treatment medication formulations.\n3. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n\n   NOTE: participants with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or local corticosteroid injections will not be excluded from this study.\n4. History of solid organ or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n5. Pregnant or breastfeeding. NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study.\n6. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are not eligible for this trial.\n7. Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Screening of asymptomatic patients for CNS metastasis is not required for enrollment.\n8. Underlying medical conditions that, in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion, will make the administration of IP(s) hazardous, including but not limited to\n\n   * Interstitial lung disease, including history of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis.\n   * Active viral, bacterial, or fungal infections requiring parenteral treatment within 14 days of the initiation of the study treatments.\n9. History of trauma or major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of IP. (Note that placement of central venous access catheter (e.g., port or similar) is not considered a major surgical procedure.\n10. Treatment with palliative radiation therapy within 14 days of study treatment initiation.\n11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n12. Significant dementia or other mental condition that precludes the participant's ability to consent to the study.\n13.
