The secondary endpoint is combined therapy in tumors with evidence of both homologous recombination deficiency (by germline or somatic Next-generation DNA sequencing \\[NGS\\]), as well as homologous recombination proficiency. Exploratory endpoints will assess the impact of homologous recombination deficiency and proficiency on response to radiation, PARP inhibition and PD-1 blockade."

Histologically confirmed metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma that is amenable to biopsy either at primary or metastatic site.\n4. Patient must consent at initiation of study to serial tumor biopsies during study. Irradiated lesions will not be considered for biopsy. For baseline biopsy, available archived tumor tissue of a metastatic tumor collected up to 28 days prior to registration is acceptable. If, after patient consent, the tumor is deemed inaccessible, the biopsy is not in the subject's best interest per investigator discretion, or the patient refuses biopsy during course of the study, patients will be allowed to remain on study.\n5. Participant must have a primary tumor or a single metastatic site amenable to radiation in: the stomach, esophagus, liver, lungs, pancreas, thoracic/abdominal LNs, or soft tissues. Of note - sites of disease planned to be biopsied should not be radiated.\n6. Participant must have at least one radiographically-confirmed index lesion that will not undergo RT and is measurable based on RECIST v1.1.\n7.

All patients must undergo NGS testing in a CLIA certified, CAP tested and bioinformatics-validated testing lab PRIOR to protocol treatment, to determine which cohort they are eligible for - HRD versus HR proficient. The testing may have been done at any time prior to enrollment.\n   2. For patients within whom a deleterious mutation in the homologous recombination pathway is found, the determination of a deleterious mutation must be supported in the documentation included in the testing, and should include clinical, or pre-clinical literature to support the finding that a specific mutation results in impaired function of the gene, and thus impaired DNA repair through homologous recombination. Variants of unknown significance will not be eligible.\n   3. Patients with germline deleterious mutations may have been identified at any time point prior to inclusion in the protocol and do NOT need to have this genetic testing repeated regardless of time frame and intervening therapy.\n8. Participants must have received at least one line of therapy including a fluoropyrimidine and platinum drug. For participants with HER2+ tumors, they must have received trastuzumab. Adjuvant therapy does not count toward first-line therapy unless patient recurs within 6 months of completion.\n9. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.\n10. Participants must have the ability to swallow whole pills and liquids at the Screening Visit and, in the investigator's judgement, for the duration of the study.\n11.

Participant receiving corticosteroids, for reasons other than radiation related toxicities, may continue as long as their dose is stable (meaning no increase or on tapering dose) for least 4 weeks prior to initiating protocol therapy.\n13. Female participants are eligible if they are: not pregnant (within 28 days prior to start of study treatment - see Appendix 3), not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: a.) Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3 OR b.) A WOCBP who agrees to follow contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n14. Male participants must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n1. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to allocation.\n\n   1. Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to \u2264Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with \u2264Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible.\n   2. Note: If participant received major surgery within 4 weeks, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.\n2. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids specifically for radiation toxicities, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u22642 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n3. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Note: Vaccines for SARS CoV- 2 will be permitted before and during the course of study.\n4. Is currently participating in, or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n6.
