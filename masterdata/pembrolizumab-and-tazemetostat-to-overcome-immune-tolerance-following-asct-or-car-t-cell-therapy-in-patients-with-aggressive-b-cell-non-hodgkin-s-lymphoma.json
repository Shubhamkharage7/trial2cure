            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well pembrolizumab and tazemetostat work to treat patients who have received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for aggressive non hodgkins lymphoma. A monoclonal antibody, such as pembrolizumab, is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Tazemetostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and tazemetostat may work better to treat patients who have received ASCT or CAR-T cell therapy for aggressive non hodgkins lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the event-free survival (EFS) for the combination of pembrolizumab and tazemetostat as maintenance for 12 months in patients with aggressive B-cell Non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma following ASCT or CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) for the combination of pembrolizumab and tazemetostat as maintenance for 12 months in patients with aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma following ASCT or CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nII. To assess the overall survival (OS) for the combination of pembrolizumab and tazemetostat as maintenance for 12 months in patients with aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma following ASCT or CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of pembrolizumab and tazemetostat as maintenance therapy for 12 months following ASCT or CAR T cell therapy.\n\nIV. To determine the objective response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy during maintenance phase (as assessed by Lugano Criteria).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the change in immune cell subsets and cytokines, measured by flow and proteomics, with pembrolizumab alone and in combination with tazemetostat.\n\nII. To determine survival outcomes (event free survival \\[EFS\\], PFS and OS) by type of treatment and line of therapy (ASCT, CAR T-cell therapy in second and third line).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nStarting on day 14 after standard of care ASCT or CAR-T cell treatment patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each cycle. Starting cycle 2, patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily(BID) on days 1-21 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo echocardiography during screening, computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 90 days and periodically for up to 18 months."

Women should use effective contraceptive methods beginning \u2265 28 days prior to initiating, study treatment, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 6 months following completion of therapy. As tazemetostat may interfere with hormonal contraception and render it ineffective, adequate contraception in this case would consist of a barrier method of birth control or abstinence.\n\nShould a female patient become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\nMen treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to either practice complete abstinence or agree to use a latex or synthetic condom, even with a successful vasectomy (medically confirmed azoospermia), during sexual contact with a FOCBP from time of informed consent, for the duration of study participation (including during dose interruptions), and atleast 6 months after study drug discontinuation.\n\nMale subjects must not donate semen or sperm from first dose of tazemetostat, during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 6 months after discontinuation of study drugs.\n\nNOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n* Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy\n* Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for \\> 12 months)\n\n  * FOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test prior to registration on study\n* Note: Serum or urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential.
