            "briefSummary": "Homelessness severely affects health and well-being and is particularly negative for youth. Between 70-95% of youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) report problem substance use and 66-89% have a mental health disorder. Youth appear to be at greater risk for living on the streets or being homeless than adults and are more vulnerable to long term consequences of homelessness. Multiple social determinants of health (SDOH) are uniquely associated with homelessness, driving substance use and adverse mental health consequences. However, limited research has identified pragmatic interventions that have a long-term ameliorating impact on the complex, multi-symptomatic issues among these youth. This study overcomes prior gaps in research through testing a multi-component comprehensive prevention intervention targeting SDOH that may affect biopsychosocial health indicators and longer-term health outcomes. In partnership with a drop-in center for YEH, youth between the ages of 14 to 24 years, will be engaged and randomly assigned to conditions using a dismantling design so that essential intervention components can be efficiently identified. In particular, youth (N = 300) will be randomly assigned to a) Motivational Interviewing/Community Reinforcement Approach + Services as Usual (MI/CRA + SAU, n = 80), b) Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy + Services As Usual (SBOA + SAU, n = 80), c) MI/CRA + SBOA + SAU (n = 80) or d) SAU (n=60) through the drop-in center. In order to assess the longer-term prevention effects on substance use, mental health and other outcomes, all youth will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24-months post-baseline. The primary goal of this study is to establish the impact of a comprehensive intervention embedded within a system that serves YEH, a community drop-in center, on youth's opioid misuse and disorder, other substance misuse and disorders, mental health diagnoses, and other targeted outcomes. This study will offer unique information on the physiological and psychological stress pathways underlying change for specific subgroups of youth along with cost estimates to inform future implementation efforts in drop-in centers around the country.",
            "detailedDescription": "Specific Aim 1. Using a dismantling randomized design, compare intervention conditions to determine those components essential for optimizing substance use and mental health: a) Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA), b) Motivational Interviewing (MI)/Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), c) SBOA+MI/CRA, and d) Services As Usual (SAU). Hypothesis. Youth assigned to SBOA+MI/CRA will show better short and long-term outcomes on Opioid Use Disorder prevention and on other substance use and mental health outcomes than youth assigned to either intervention alone or Services As Usual.\n\nSpecific Aim 2. Test whether intended change processes (social stability, psychosocial resources, stress) produce the desired change on substance use and mental health. Hypothesis. Inasmuch as the interventions trigger successful increases in social stability and psychosocial resources and reductions in stress, targeted outcomes will improve.\n\nSpecific Aim 3. Explore how the moderators of age, sex, race/ethnicity, sexual/gender minority status, and experience of childhood abuse and neglect influence intervention response.\n\nSpecific Aim 4. Determine cost effectiveness of the intervention approaches."

The strengths model is based on the premise that the purpose of advocacy \"is to assist consumers in identifying, securing, and preserving the range of resources, both external and internal, needed to live in a normal, independent way in the community\". Strengths-based interventions focus on enhancing well-being and happiness rather than attempting to correct deficits or pathology. The advocate takes responsibility for securing needed services for the youth and remains a support as they traverse the system of care. The focus of the first several weeks of advocacy is on obtaining identification and ensuring basic needs are met (food, safety, medical care, housing, etc.). As basic needs are addressed, youth and advocates focus on other high need areas including education, employment, mental health and substance use.",

The data from all 300 participants will be available for the six time-points of collection, made available in ICPSR preferred formats (e.g., CSV, SAS, SPSS) and securely transferred to ICPSR. Identifying (individual and location data) and personal health information will NOT be shared to protect participant confidentiality.",
