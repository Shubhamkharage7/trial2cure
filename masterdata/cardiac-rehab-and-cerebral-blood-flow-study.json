            "detailedDescription": "This study will investigate the influence of exercise training and intensity (as part of cardiac rehabilitation) on improving cerebral blood flow regulation and cognitive function following a cardiac event. This will be a randomized control trial, recruiting adults in mid-life (years 40-65) with coronary artery disease, enrolling in cardiac rehabilitation following a cardiac-related hospital admission. Patients that enroll in the Mayo Clinic cardiac rehabilitation will be randomized 1:1 to high intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), with stratification for sex and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patients that decline enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation will be recruited as an observational control group, which will be matched to the intervention groups by age decade, sex, BMI category, and surgical status. Patients that enroll in cardiac rehabilitation but decline randomization will be recruited as an observational cardiac rehabilitation group. A healthy control group without cardiovascular disease will also be recruited for baseline comparison of outcome measures."
