            "detailedDescription": "Traditional cardiac rehabilitation programs typically prioritize aerobic exercise (e.g., walking, cycling, etc.) with much less emphasis on improving physical function and strength, which is very important in, for example, decreasing the risk of falling. Through this research, researchers will implement a comprehensive fall risk screening and physical function assessment supported with individualized therapeutic exercise(s). Researchers hope that this will decrease fall risk, enhance rehabilitation experience, and improve ability to perform tasks of daily living."

Balance, upper body muscular fitness, and lower body muscular fitness and gait will be reassessed in each participant after 5-to-6 weeks of CR and again upon completion of the CR program. Patient reported measures of fall risk will be measured at baseline with the Stop Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) tool kit.
