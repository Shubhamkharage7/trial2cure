Patients with vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years) are not excluded. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Active documented inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) who require immunosuppression or patients who exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid are excluded\n* History of primary immunodeficiency\n* History of organ transplant that requires therapeutic immunosuppression\n* Taking daily probiotics (patients with last probiotic \\> 4weeks prior to first dose of RMT are eligible)\n* History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (known HIV 1/2 antibodies positive) who are on anti-retroviral treatment for \\< 6 months and absolute CD4 count\\<500 (patients with HIV not meeting these criteria are eligible)\n* Has known active Hepatitis B or C. Active Hepatitis B is defined as a known positive HBsAg, and positive hepatitis B virus quantification assay (patients with history of Hepatitis B who have seroconversion i.e. Hepatitis B core antibody positive and Hepatitis B surface antibody positive are eligible).
