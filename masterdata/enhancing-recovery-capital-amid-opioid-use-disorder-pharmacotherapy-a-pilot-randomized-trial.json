Develop and refine a novel intervention protocol for individuals receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder that assertively links them to recovery community centers; Aim 2. Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of assertive linkage to recovery community centers relative to a matched control condition, via a pilot randomized controlled trial; Aim 3. Explain quantitative findings by gaining an in-depth understanding of the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy via qualitative interviews.",
            "detailedDescription": "This 5-year project seek to advance our understanding of the clinical and public health utility of recovery community centers and help bridge the gap between clinical treatment and community-based recovery support services. As a first step in this work, the investigators will develop and test a new intervention for peer-facilitated assertive linkage of patients receiving opioid use disorder pharmacotherapy to recovery community centers (RCCL), relative to a matched control condition (CC). This study aims to: Aim 1. Develop, manualize, and refine RCCL and CC protocols via stakeholder feedback. RCCL and CC protocols will be developed and manualized by adapting published community-based mutual-help linkage protocols. Upon preliminary manual development, feedback cycles will be conducted with relevant stakeholders (recovery coaches, recovery community center members, pharmacotherapy prescribers) to inform protocol revision, and promote its feasibility, acceptability, and adoptability. Aim 2. Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of RCCL versus CC, via a pilot randomized controlled trial. More specifically, the feasibility of study procedures and RCCL/CC interventions, acceptability of interventions, and preliminary efficacy of RCCL relative to CC will be assessed. Aim 3. Explain quantitative findings by gaining an in-depth understanding of RCCL feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy via qualitative interviews in a subset of RCCL participants, peer facilitators, and linkage managers."
