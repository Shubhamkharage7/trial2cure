A study participant who provides written informed consent will be screened within 28 days prior to treatment. Screening assessments will be conducted, after which the study participants' eligibility will be determined on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nEligible participants will be enrolled and undergo Baseline assessments on Day 1. Patients will receive IMM01-STEM twice a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 8 injections. Site staff will administer study medication by im injection using a small-gauge needle (eg, 24 or 26 Ga) at all scheduled visits. After each administration of study medication, participants will be observed for 3 hours to monitor for injection-related reactions and other early onset treatment-related adverse events (AEs), in particular for the presence of allergic reactions. After Visit 2 and 3, there will be follow-up phone contact 6 to 8 hours later the same day and once the day following each injection.\n\nAfter their last injection, participants will enter a Safety Follow-Up (SFU) period, with clinic visits 3 days after their last injection and then monthly for 3 months."
