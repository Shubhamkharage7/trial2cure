            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of neratinib in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and have changes in a gene called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neratinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is composed of a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Adding neratinib to trastuzumab deruxtecan may be able to shrink cancer with a change in the HER2 gene.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess dose limiting toxicities and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of neratinib maleate (neratinib) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring alterations in HER2 (including HER2 overexpression/amplification and selected HER2-activating mutations).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of neratinib and DS-8201a, as measured by objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by investigator assessment, and overall survival (OS).\n\nII. To assess the safety and tolerability for the combination neratinib and DS-8201a.\n\nIII. To assess the effect of neratinib on DS-8201a payload (DXd/MAAA-1181a) tissue concentration in part 2 at the RP2D chosen in part 1 (and potentially at a lower dose\\[s\\] of neratinib) before and after addition of neratinib to DS-8201a.\n\nIV. To assess the pharmacokinetics of DS-8201a and neratinib in combination.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the pharmacodynamic response to neratinib and DS-8201a as measured by markers of DS-8201a-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage using gammaH2AX, phosphorylated (p)NBS1 immunofluorescence assay (IFA), multiplex multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM)- based proteomic assay panel of DNA repair response pathway biomarkers, induction of apoptosis, and HER2 signaling along with other pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers such as cleaved caspase3 (apoptosis) and TOP1CC (target engagement) pending National Clinical Laboratory Network (NCLN) assay availability.\n\nII. To assess quantifiable HER2 protein expression of pre-treatment or archival tumor biopsies, and at disease progression in correlation with treatment response.\n\nIII. To assess tumor tissue mutation profile pre-treatment and at progression in correlation with treatment response.\n\nIV. To assess circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) mutation profiles pre-treatment, C2D1, and at progression in correlation with treatment response.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of neratinib followed by a dose-expansion (PD) study.\n\nPatients receive neratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (days 8-21 of cycle 1, then days 1-21 in cycles thereafter for PD study) of each cycle and trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood sample collection, computed tomography (CT) scan and echocardiograpahy or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan throughout study. Additionally, patients may undergo a tissue biopsy at baseline.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for at least one year or until death."

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method\n* Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration.

If treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment is absolutely required, study treatment must be interrupted. If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is administered, then a wash-out period of more than 14 days is required before restarting study treatment\n* Patients with a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening\n* Patients with clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (i.e. pulmonary emboli within three months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion, etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders with potential pulmonary involvement (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis, etc.), or prior pneumonectomy\n* Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to DS-8201a, the inactive ingredients in the drug product, or neratinib\n* Patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein are ineligible. Avoid concomitant use with proton pump inhibitors and P-glycoprotein substrates. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment, or symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association class II to IV)\n* Patients with a corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation to \\> 470 ms (females) or \\> 450 ms (males) based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Patients with clinically significant corneal disease in the opinion of the investigator\n* Patients with a pleural effusion, ascites, or pericardial effusion that requires drainage, peritoneal shunt, or cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART).

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with DS-8201a, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DS-8201a. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Prior treatment with neratinib or DS-8201a\n* Clinically significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea as a major symptom; G2 or greater diarrhea at baseline. Please contact the study PI for any patient with more than two episodes of diarrhea per day averaged over at least a 7 day period at time of screening to determine whether the diarrhea would be considered clinically significant\n* Inability to swallow tablets\n* Patients with active additional malignancy or a personal history of additional malignancy that may affect outcome of disease under treatment (patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen at the discretion of the treating investigator are allowed)\n* Patients with prior allogeneic organ transplantation including allogeneic stem cell transplantation",
