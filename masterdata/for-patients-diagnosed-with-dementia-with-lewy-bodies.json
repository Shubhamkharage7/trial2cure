Clinical assessments of cognitive, behavioral and motor functioning will also be evaluated. A total of 45 participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups (n=15/per group) to be treated with sachet of 192 mg powder of K0706 ( equivalent to 96 mg capsule of K0706) or sachet of 384 mg powder of K0706 (equivalent to 192 capsule of K0706) or sachet of matching placebo ( equivalent to a capsule of placebo) for 12 weeks, followed by 4-week wash-out period.",
            "detailedDescription": "Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is an alpha-synucleinopathy and the second most common form of dementia in the elderly. DLB shares striking neuropathological and clinical similarities with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). DLB and PD are characterized by death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the nigro-striatal system and formation of intra-neuronal alpha-synuclein inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs). Misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates within LBs and apha-synuclein (SYN) is the highest genetic risk factor for PD and DLB followed by the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) . At autopsy alpha-synuclein, hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid plaques are all detected in the brains of individuals with DLB. Therefore, the neuropathology of DLB overlaps with both PD and AD, and includes alpha-synuclein accumulation in LBs, p-tau and beta-amyloid deposition . Potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including alpha-synuclein, dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) , total tau and p-tau and amyloid beta peptides (Abeta 40/42) may be commonly shared in AD, PD and DLB. The core clinical features of DLB, include dementia and Parkinsonism in addition to hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBD) . L-Dopa replacement therapies and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may partially control motor and cognitive symptoms, respectively in DLB. Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and antipsychotics manage the behavioral but worsen motor symptoms in DLB. There is a major unmet medical need for further research into DLB to identify potential therapies for this disease and provide significant insights into the treatment of other Parkinsonian and memory disorders. A major challenge facing DLB is to develop a therapy that can halt neuronal death and alleviate cognitive, motor and behavioral symptoms. No therapeutic approach exists to alter the levels of neurotoxic proteins such as alpha-synuclein and halt DA and other neuronal death in DLB. One mechanism to degrade neurotoxic proteins is autophagy , which is a process by which the cell can degrade its own contents. There is evidence that autophagy is impaired in neurodegeneration , leading to failure of degradation of protein aggregates, including misfolded alpha-synuclein. Importantly, autophagy is exploited therapeutically in several diseases, including adult chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce autophagy, leading to destruction of rapidly dividing tumor cells in CML and degradation of neurotoxic proteins, including alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid and p-tau in PD and AD models. Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Limited (SPARC Ltd.) is developing K0706, for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy or Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy; and its ability to slow down progression of PD. Using allometric scaling and an average human body weight of 70kg an oral dose of 15-30mg/kg once daily in mice corresponds to an oral human equivalent dose (HED) of 85-160 mg which is within the tolerated dose in both CML and PD. Therefore, the effects of a sachet of 192 mg powder of K0706 (equivalent to 96 mg capsule of K0706 ) and a sachet of 384 mg powder of K0706( equivalet to 192 mg capsule of K0706) and a sachet of matching placebo taken daily by mouth for 12 weeks, followed by a 4 week wash-out period will be evaluated in individuals diagnosed with DLB. The data obtained from this study will serve as a proof of concept for future placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in patients diagnosed with DLB, AD, or PD."
