            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in patients with undetectable postoperative HPV circulating tumor DNA (cfHPVDNA) with transoral robotic surgery (TORS) alone can result in cancer control and survival comparable to those previously reported with standard therapy. The protocol includes patients with only with low or intermediate pathologic risk factors following surgery with detectable pre-surgery cfHPVDNA and undetectable post-surgery cfHPVDNA.\n\nThe hope is that with this approach, the long-term complications from chemotherapy and radiation can be reduced.",
            "detailedDescription": "There has been significant increase in the incidence of oropharynx cancer in North America and Europe. It is now understood that there are two dominant carcinogenic pathways for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Environmentally related which is caused mainly by smoking and alcohol, and HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPVOPSCC). HPVOPSCC now accounts for over 80% of OPC seen in the USA and an increasing fraction of these malignancies in Europe. It has been shown that HPVOPSCC confers an excellent prognosis for intermediate staged disease and this has called into question the rational for aggressive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. High-dose radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) have substantial impact on local tissues and organ function and result in a significant rate of late mortality and morbidity. Studies are now being designed to reduce the impact of RT and CRT for patients.\n\nRecently, a new test has been developed that measures HPV circulating tumor DNA (cfHPVDNA) in the blood. The test has emerged as a promising biomarker for HPVOPSCC, correlating with both treatment response as well as surveillance for cancer recurrence. Data suggests that a negative test in the surveillance period following treatment is highly sensitive and specific for recurrent disease.\n\nIn this trial, the study will be stratifying p16 positive patients with PCR detectable high-risk (HR) HPV DNA or RNA following TORS into risk groups based on final pathology to determine appropriate treatment intensity. Patients with low- or intermediate-risk pathologic disease and undetectable postoperative cfHPVDNA will receive no adjuvant therapy. This group includes patients with AJCC 7th edition T1-T2N0-2b disease. Patients must have less than four pathologic nodes on final pathology, negative margins, and no contralateral nodes. Perineural or lymphovascular alone is allowed but not in combination. Microscopic extranodal extension (less than or equal to 2 mm) is allowed. Patients cannot be active smokers or have a 20 or greater pack year history of smoking."
