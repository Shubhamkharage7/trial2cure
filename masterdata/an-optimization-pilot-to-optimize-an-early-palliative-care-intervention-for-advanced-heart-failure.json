            "briefSummary": "Using a highly innovative methodology, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), the purpose of this randomized factorial pilot trial is to identify feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of components of an intervention (UPHOLDS) to improve quality of life of older adults with advanced heart failure. Using a 2x2x2x2 factorial design, 64 adults with advanced heart failure will be randomized to receive one or more palliative care coach-delivered components, based on Ferrans' Health-Related Quality of Life Model: 1) psychoeducation on palliative care principles (4 vs. 8 sessions); 2) financial coaching (yes vs. no); 3) one-time specialty outpatient palliative care consultation (yes vs. no); and monthly follow (1 monthly follow-up call vs. monthly follow-up calls for 24 weeks).",
            "detailedDescription": "A priority NINR, nursing, and palliative care focus is how to best support patients with advanced AHA Stage C/D heart failure (HF). HF, a progressive condition, affecting 6.2 million U.S. adults results in reduced quality of life (QOL), high symptom burden, and unpredictable disease trajectory.There is a critical need to develop effective and scalable early palliative care (PC) interventions for patients with advanced HF, especially in the Southeastern U.S., where there is a high proportion of underserved groups (e.g., African-Americans, rural dwellers) who experience high HF morbidity and mortality.However, few interventions have been tested and demonstrated effectiveness- and none have been widely translated to practice.\n\nRecent major systematic reviews and research agendas identify developing efficacious and scalable HF PC interventions as a key research priority. However, these efforts are stymied by a lack of understanding \"active\" PC interventions components. Traditional RCTs treat interventions as \"bundled\" packages, making it hard to assess definitively which intervention components are most essential for efficacy and efficiency. Hence, innovative methods are needed to efficiently test multiple intervention components simultaneously. To address this problem, prior work has developed and refined intervention components for underresourced Southern older adults with advanced HF (Utilizing Palliative Care for Heart Failure Optimized using Lay Navigators to Decrease Suffering -Project UPHOLDS).\n\nBased on Ferrans' Health-Related QOL Model, we will use the highly innovative Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST)1 strategy to pilot test via a factorial design the individual UPHOLDS components with underresourced, older adults with advanced HF (n=64) who will be randomized to receive different levels of the following UPHOLDS intervention components: 1) outpatient PC consultation (Yes vs. No), 2) lay navigator PC coaching sessions addressing self-care, symptom management, communication, problem solving, decision-making, and advance care planning (4 vs. 8 weekly telephone sessions), 3) financial coaching session addressing financial distress and resources (Yes vs. No) and 4) monthly maintenance follow-up phone calls (1 vs. 4 calls).\n\nAim 1: Using the innovative MOST factorial design, determine UPHOLDS feasibility, acceptability, enrollment, retention, and completion rates in participants (n=64) for 24 weeks. Feasibility: \\>80% of participants will be enrolled, retained, and will complete all measures and all intervention components. Acceptability: Positive post-intervention interviews.\n\nAim 2: Explore the preliminary efficacy of individual intervention components and component interaction on patient outcomes at 12- and 24- weeks after baseline including a) QOL using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Scale (primary outcome) b) financial toxicity using the Comprehensive score for financial toxicity, and c) mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\nAim 3 (Exploratory): Explore mediators and moderators (e.g., sociodemographics, self-management skills, financial well-being, self-efficacy) of the relationship between intervention components and patient outcomes"
