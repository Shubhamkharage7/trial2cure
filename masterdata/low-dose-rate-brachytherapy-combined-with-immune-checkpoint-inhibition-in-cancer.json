This involves the addition of a treatment called brachytherapy to SOC immunotherapy. Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy where radioactive pellets are placed within a tumor to temporarily irradiate the tumor at a low level. This is the first time that this combination (immunotherapy and brachytherapy) has been used in humans.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of combining LDR with immunotherapy, determine safety and feasibility, generate a toxicity profile, evaluate response, and overall survival."
