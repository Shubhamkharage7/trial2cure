The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of PRRT.\n\nPRRT is a form of targeted treatment (think of a \"lock and key\") done by the use of a small molecule (Lutathera) Lutathera acts as a \"key\" to \"lock\" onto certain areas your tumor cells called receptors when injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Lutetium-177 is the radionuclide in Lutathera which is a chemical that delivers strong radiation directly into your tumor cells and works by causing death of the cancerous tissues.\n\nPRRT can only be done on patients who have tumors that have the somatostatin receptors. Before being given PRRT, your treating doctor will run imaging tests to make sure your tumors have these targeted receptors. Your participation in this research will last about 2 years. The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of PRRT.\n\nParticipants will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to one of two arms. Arm 1 is the control arm, which will undergo standard of care cytoreductive surgery (for the tumor). Arm 2 will undergo four cycles of PRRT before cytoreductive surgery."
