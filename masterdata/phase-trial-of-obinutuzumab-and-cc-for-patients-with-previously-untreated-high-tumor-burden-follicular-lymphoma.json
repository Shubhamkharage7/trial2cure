Hepatitis B or C serologic status: subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are surface antigen negative will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects with a history of Hepatitis C who received antiviral treatment are eligible as long as PCR is negative.\n* History of immunodeficiency (with the exception of hypogammaglobulinemia) or concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, etc., or chronic administration glucocorticoid equivalent of \\>10mg/day of prednisone) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug\n* Requires chronic treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors (List in Table 1).

Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* Patients who have a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Known history of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism\n* Known history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)",
