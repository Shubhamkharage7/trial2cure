This study will test a new method for monitoring treatment. The investigators will use \\[18F\\]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at previously diagnosed stage IV breast cancer and image up to three times during therapy. FDG is a non-natural amino acid with a radioactive tag that is used clinically for staging of disease. However, the role of FDG-PET/MRI for imaging response in breast cancer is not currently clear. PET/MRI is a new imaging technique that combines PET and MRI into a single study."
