            "briefSummary": "This is a phase 2 research study that enrolls adult subjects with Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NSGCT). The purpose of this study is to create a repository and explore the presence of modified T cells in the subject's plasma or tumors.\n\nThis study collects biospecimens (such as tumor tissue, blood, and modified T cells) that can be used in future research studies. The collected specimens can help to examine whether the modified T cells are present in the body and tumor. If the modified T cells are present in the body, and how long they last. They also will use the specimen to identify ways to improve treatment options for a future cancer patient.\n\nResearch with blood, tissue, or body fluids (specimens) can help researchers understand how the human body works. Sometimes researchers collect and store specimens and use them for different kinds of research or share them with other scientists; this is called a specimen repository or \"biobank.\" Research with biospecimens might help to introduce new tests to find diseases or new ways to treat diseases.\n\nThe body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.\n\nPrior trials have shown the safety of ATLCAR.CD30 product was administered to subjects with lymphomas. This study was planned based on the safety and efficacy data from previous studies (NCT02690545 and NCT02917083)."

Evidence of progressive or recurrent NSGCT after prior high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) treatment, defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria: i. Tumor biopsy of new or growing or unresectable lesions demonstrating viable NSGCT. In the event of an incomplete gross resection where viable NSGCT is found, subjects will be considered eligible for the study. ii. Consecutive elevated serum tumor markers (\u03b2-HCG or AFP) are increasing. An increase of elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) alone does not constitute progressive disease. iii.
