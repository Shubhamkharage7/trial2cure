VS occurs in up to 88% of patients treated with radiation for cervical cancer. VS is not well characterized in measurements. There is a lack of understanding of how short and tight the vagina becomes after RT. This study will use specific measurements of the vagina during the routine physician physical exam after RT in the follow up periods: after RT, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months using a plastic commercial dilator set and length and width measurements.\n\nIn addition, the study use a validated sexual health survey and a specific survey on vaginal dilation preferences to help stop VS after RT.",

The study will collect data from CT images, physical measurements, patient reported outcomes to develop a quantifiable generalizable metric for determining the severity of radiotherapy/brachytherapy induced vaginal stenosis.\n\nThe data will be used to inform the development of a novel personalized device for the treatment of vaginal stenosis."
