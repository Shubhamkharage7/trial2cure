This will be done using a multicenter, single-arm, consecutive series, retrospective cohort study with prospective follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "Under study are the Persona\u00ae Revision Knee System (K181947 and K191625) implants and instrumentation, and any compatible devices being used in conjunction according to the Instructions for Use. This will be accomplished by retrospectively identifying patients who underwent primary or revision TKA with this system and inviting them to participate in prospective data collection at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-years postoperative follow-up. As the device was not available for commercial use until late 2019, the retrospective portion will involve those activities that occurred per standard of care for participants.\n\nThe primary endpoint for this study will be performance assessed by improvement in the 1989 Knee Society Clinical Rating System (KS) objective knee score (KS-KS) from baseline to 2 years (as evaluated using the overall group mean showing at least the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of 5.4 points).\n\nA maximum of 20 sites will contribute to this study. There will be a maximum of 380 patients enrolled in the study."
