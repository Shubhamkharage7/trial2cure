            "briefSummary": "While older women are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases and conditions associated with aging, including both physical and cognitive impairments, that can be alleviated or delayed by regular physical activity, few physical activity programs have been developed specifically with their needs in mind. This research aims to evaluate, in insufficiently active older women from the national WHISH pragmatic trial, the effects of a technology-driven \"citizen science\" approach to environmental physical activity barriers called Our Voice plus the ongoing \"light-touch\" remote physical activity educational program, compared to the \"light-touch\" remote physical activity educational program plus a control educational intervention that creates awareness around human and planetary health. This study will add important information on the benefits and trade-offs of combining these remotely delivered and practical behavioral health approaches to promote physical and cognitive health for the fast-expanding demographic group of U.S. older women.",
            "detailedDescription": "Older women are disproportionately impacted by a range of chronic diseases and conditions, such as cognitive impairments, that can be alleviated by regular physical activity (PA), including walking; yet they are the most inactive segment of the US population. This study's primary aim is to enhance the efficacy of a \"light-touch\", remotely delivered PA educational intervention for older women by testing the added impacts of an innovative, remotely delivered citizen science program to identify and address local environmental barriers to walking and other PA, called Our Voice (OV). The \"light-touch\" PA educational program (Encore) has been delivered since 2015 to \\>23,000 women \\>70 years that have been participating in the U.S.-wide Women's Health Initiative Strong and Healthy (WHISH) pragmatic PA trial. The study's hypothesis is that women receiving Encore+OV will show higher 12-month PA levels than women receiving Encore plus the control educational program. Additional questions include changes in cognitive function and sedentary behavior and exploring the relative costs of the two programs for PA change."
