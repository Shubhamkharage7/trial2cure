Pre-operative labs (blood and urine) will be collected along with additional blood, urine, and fecal samples will be collected pre-operatively. During surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgeries only) tissue collection will include subcutaneous \\& omental fat, jejunum, and liver biopsy. Post surgery patient will be observed for weight loss and resolution of co-morbidities. At designated times post surgery when lab studies are ordered additional blood/urine samples will be collected and analyzed."
