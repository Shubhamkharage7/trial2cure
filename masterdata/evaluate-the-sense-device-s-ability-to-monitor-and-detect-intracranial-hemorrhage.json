            "detailedDescription": "This study is a two-stage, pivotal, prospective, nonrandomized, multi-center, within patient comparison of the SENSE device and the standard diagnostic test, head CT scans. All subjects who meet eligibility criteria should be enrolled. An algorithm has been developed for detecting ICH, which will now be tested in this independent cohort of subjects. CT scans will be grouped into: 1) ICH, or 2) non- ICH. Enrollment will continue until 120 subjects with and 120 without ICH have been enrolled. An interim analysis will occur after \\~60 subjects each with and without ICH have been enrolled and the sample size may be increased at the direction of the DMC as warranted. In Stage 1, 150 subjects (with primary spontaneous ICH or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage) were enrolled for the development of a hemorrhage detection algorithm. In Stage 2, the algorithm developed in Stage 1 will be tested in an independent cohort of up to 300 subjects. All subjects who meet eligibility criteria should be enrolled. The gold standard will be the CT results. The algorithm established in Stage 1 will be tested in this independent cohort of subjects. CT scans will be grouped into: 1) ICH or, 2) non-ICH. Enrollment will continue until \\~60 subjects each with and without ICH have been enrolled. An interim analysis will occur after \\~60 subjects each with and without ICH have been enrolled and the sample size may be increased at the direction of the DMC as warranted. All subjects' CT images will be reviewed by an independent neuroradiology core for classification as ICH or non-ICH, and ICH volume estimation. The treating clinicians and independent neuroradiologist will be blinded to the SENSE device findings."
