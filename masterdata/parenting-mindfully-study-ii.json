Before, during, and after the interventions, and at 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow-ups (into middle adolescence), the researchers will collect questionnaire, interview, and biological measures of parent stress, parenting, and adolescent substance use and psychological symptoms. At pre- and post-intervention, observed parenting and stress reactivity will be measured in a parent-adolescent interaction task. Some mothers will also complete fMRI sessions at pre- and post- examining emotion-related neurobiological mechanisms."
