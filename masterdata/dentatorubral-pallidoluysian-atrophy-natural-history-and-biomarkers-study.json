            "briefSummary": "DRPLA Natural History and Biomarkers Study (DRPLA NHBS) is a prospective observational study that will lay the foundation for clinical trials in DRPLA. The aims of this project are:\n\n* To characterize the natural history of DRPLA in both juvenile- and adult-onset patients and study different modalities of biomarkers in this condition.\n* To identify genetic factors and biomarkers that could predict disease progression.\n* To provide a platform to support the design and conduct of clinical trials.\n\nThis study has three arms:\n\n1. Adult Participants: this arm of the study will require participants to be 16 years old or over to participate.\n2. Pediatric Participants: this arm of the study will require participants to be under 16 years old to participate.\n3. Remote Participants: patients that cannot or do not wish to travel to one of the study sites can participate in this arm of the study, irrespective of their age.\n\nParticipants will have an annual visit for three years (baseline visit and two follow-up visits, three visits in total). Subjects who complete the whole protocol will be assessed on two consecutive days to reduce patient burden.\n\nThis project will allow for a better understanding of DRPLA and its course, and therefore allow for future clinical trials on this condition to be more precisely and effectively conducted."
