Oral stents are made from the impression of patients' mouth and cover patients' teeth and gums during radiation therapy. A customized, 3D-printed oral stent may help to reduce mouth blisters and/or sores that may develop in patients while receiving head and neck radiation therapy.",

To evaluate the acute mucositis rates in non-target mucosa of patients who receive head and neck radiation with or without a customized 3D printed oral stent.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To record patient reported outcomes during radiotherapy. II. To evaluate patient narcotic use during radiotherapy. III. To evaluate the imaging and dosimetric differences in head and neck radiotherapy with and without a customized 3D printed oral stent.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients wear 3D printed oral stent during standard of care radiotherapy.\n\nARM II: Patients receive standard of care during treatment."
