The study is designed to research how well this technique can help people with TBI improve their memory and their ability to function better in everyday life",
            "detailedDescription": "Impairments in higher level cognitive processing, such as new learning and memory, are common in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)and negatively impact multiple aspects of everyday life, including occupational and social functioning. Despite this, few studies have attempted to remediate these cognitive deficits in order to improve everyday functioning. While not applied in traditional rehabilitation protocols as of yet, many techniques from cognitive psychology significantly improve learning and memory in healthy persons. These techniques include the generation effect (GE), the spacing effect (SE), and the testing effect (TE). These techniques have recently been incorporated into an 8-session treatment protocol, Stylistic Memory Enhancement (SME), designed to teach participants about each of the techniques, train them on how to apply the techniques in daily life and practice their application to daily life memory demanding situations. The protocol includes teaching participants how to restructure a memory demanding situation in order to make optimal use of self-generation, spaced learning and self-testing."
