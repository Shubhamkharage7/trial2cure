Learning about the outcomes of these patients may help researchers determine the long-term effects of different types of hemipelvectomy procedures and may help improve quality of life.",

To determine functions of patients who underwent internal hemipelvectomy with or without reconstruction or have had an external hemipelvectomy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine factors that influence the functional outcomes of these patients following surgery.\n\nII. Assess sexual and urinary function in patients who have undergone internal or external hemipelvectomy.\n\nIII. Determine whether type of surgery influences long-term sexual and urinary function.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo physical performance assessments and complete quality of life assessments and questionnaires pre-hemipelvectomy, at 6 weeks post-hemipelvectomy, and then every 3 months up to 12 months and yearly thereafter for 10 years. Patients who are 1 year out from surgery complete pain-related questionnaires once. Patients who have already undergone hemipelvectomy prior to enrollment undergo medical record review."
