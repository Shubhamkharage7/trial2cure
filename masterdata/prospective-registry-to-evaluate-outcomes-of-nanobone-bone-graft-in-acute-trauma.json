These outcomes include radiographic measures such as fracture healing, instrumentation integrity, and clinical outcomes (symptom and function improvement) based on investigator and patient-based outcome assessments.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to document and analyze the use of NanoBone products in acute trauma cases (as a stand-alone bone graft, or in combination with local bone only, no other bone graft substitute or biologic product used) and determine both radiographic success and clinical outcomes. All product related adverse events will be documented, tabulated, and summarized."
