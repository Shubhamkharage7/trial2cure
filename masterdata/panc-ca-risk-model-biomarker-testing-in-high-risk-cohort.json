            "detailedDescription": "This research aims to identify people who have a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than the general population, by testing a double-screening strategy for pancreatic cancer. The purpose is to allow early detection of cancer, which potentially leads to cure.\n\nThe double-screening will include a computer-based model developed using clinical data from medical records, and three different blood tests for early detection of pancreatic cancer.\n\nParticipation in this study involves having medical records followed up for up to three years, and a single donation of blood specimens.\n\n- This is a Combined Retrospective and Prospective Review:\n\n* The first part of the study, involves collection of retrospective data from Electronic Health Record database (for the 3 collaborating HCOs) in order to deploy our EHR model, so that a high-risk group for pancreatic cancer can be identified. All individuals stratified into low, intermediate or high risk groups by the model, will be prospectively, electronically followed to assess outcome.\n* The second stage is prospective, and involves requesting biological specimen donations from participants identified as high-risk, for biomarker testing. The prospective \"observation period\" is up to 3 years (depending on each subject's index date at retrospective recruitment and outcome). Biological specimens will be collected during the prospective \"observation period,\""
