            "briefSummary": "The Women's Ischemia Study Evaluation (WISE), a cohort study of over 1000 women, has made many contributions to the understanding of cardiovascular disease. A milestone acknowledged in the 2011 AHA Herrick Lecture is the role of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) in women with symptoms/signs of ischemia without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). While in 1996, CMD was considered \"an imaging artifact\", in 2013, it is a widely accepted as a pathophysiologic process requiring systematic cohesive scientific pursuit. CMD is prevalent, associated with adverse clinical outcomes, poor quality of life and healthcare costs rivaling obstructive CAD. There are 2-3 million US women with CMD, and 100,000 new cases projected annually placing CMD prevalence, morbidity and costs higher than all female reproductive cancers combined.\n\nAmong women with ischemia, preserved ejection fraction and no obstructive CAD, it has been observed that there are relatively more new onset heart failure (HF) hospitalizations than nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). It has been hypothesized that CMD contributes to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and subsequent heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Preliminary data further suggests that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is linked to CMD via a mechanism of augmentation and/or perpetuation by cardiomyocyte fat accumulation. HFpEF is prevalent in women and older men, but poorly understood. Mechanistic understanding is critical to HFpEF intervention and guideline development.\n\nThe study hypotheses are as follows:\n\n1. Risk factor conditions (hypertension, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, loss of estrogen) promote an inflammatory and pro-oxidative state making the microvasculature vulnerable;\n2. Vulnerable coronary microvasculature becomes dysregulated (sympathetic nervous system activation, endothelial dysfunction, changes in vascular smooth muscle activation, spasm) causing repeated episodes of transient ischemia;\n3. Repeated ischemia-reperfusion episodes facilitate preconditioning with preservation of cardiomyocyte contractile and microvascular function against ischemic injury;\n4. Ischemia-reperfusion and preconditioning lead to cardiomyocyte fat accumulation and relaxation impairment resulting in diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).",
            "detailedDescription": "The current application will study new cohorts of women and men with the following specific aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: LV diastolic dysfunction is linked to CMD. Sub-Aim 1: LV diastolic dysfunction and CMD are linked via the mechanism of cardiomyocyte fat accumulation.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Comprehensive noninvasive Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) that includes LV diastolic function is linked with invasive measures of LV diastolic function and can optimize diagnosis of CMD.\n\nSub-Aim 2: Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CMRA) can exclude obstructive CAD in CMD.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Add completely de-identified data sharing to prepare for future large precision medicine research and to advance precision medicine initiative.\n\nExploratory Aim: Blood proteomic and metabolomics biomarkers of extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis combined with ischemia measures will predict HFpEF.\n\nIn this prospective, cohort design study, investigators intend to enroll 220 new subjects including 120 symptomatic women undergoing invasive coronary angiography for suspected ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as \u226550% luminal diameter stenosis in \u22651 epicardial coronary artery and 100 women and men hospitalized for Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) defined by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria who have not yet undergone coronary angiography.\n\nNew and existing samples and longer term follow-up will be analyzed in an exploratory fashion looking for potential HFpEF biomarkers for pilot data purposes.\n\nAfter baseline evaluation, the n=120 cohort will undergo noninvasive high resolution, comprehensive CMRI imaging, invasive angiography, coronary reactivity testing and rest-stress Millar pressure-volume measurement. Handgrip, mild leg exercise, and brief Valsalva Maneuver will be conducted during CMRI and Millar pressure-volume assessment to characterize cardiac response to stress. Lastly, these patients will also undergo MR Coronary Angiography, for validation purposes against gold-standard angiography.\n\nThe cohort of 100 women and men with HFpEF admitted to the hospital who have not yet undergone coronary angiography will also undergo CMRI (with stress), including MR coronary angiography (CMRA) and noninvasive computed coronary tomographic angiography (CCTA)(CSMC only).\n\nThis will provide understanding of a non-cath-lab based population regarding links between CMD, diastolic function and HFpEF, and will result in data to test the hypothesis that coronary MRA can exclude obstructive CAD and diagnose CMD without ionizing radiation. Proteomic and metabolomics biomarker assays in the (n=567) subjects with no obstructive CAD (Exploratory Aim) will be performed."
