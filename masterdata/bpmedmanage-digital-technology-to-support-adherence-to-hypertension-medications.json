A total of 100 older adults will be recruited. There will be two treatment arms, bpMedManage-S and bpMedManage-P with 50 participants in each arm. Participants randomized into the bpMEDManage-S intervention arm will use a smartphone application with medication reminders plus receive education with standardized information on hypertension and antihypertensive medications on the education portal. Participants in the bpMedManage-P group will use a smartphone to receive education with standardized information on hypertension and antihypertensive medications on an education portal. Both groups will complete baseline assessments followed by 4 weeks of medication adherence monitoring. At the end of the adherence monitoring period, participants will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms. Immediate outcomes on primary and secondary measures will be assessed 4 weeks after beginning of the intervention. Follow-up outcomes will be assessed 12 weeks after the beginning of the intervention."
