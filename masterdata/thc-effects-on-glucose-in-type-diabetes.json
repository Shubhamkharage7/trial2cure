The participants will complete blood tests and tests to measure energy expenditure, CVD risks, and glucose metabolism. These tests will be performed prior to start of treatment and again after 2-weeks of treatment with the THC or placebo.",
            "detailedDescription": "A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study designed to evaluate the effects of THC on glucose metabolism and endothelial functioning in individuals with type 2 diabetes. To accomplish the specific AIMS proposed, a single clinical trial will be conducted in which a maximum of 30 subjects with T2D, who are otherwise healthy, will be treated with THC and matching placebo in a cross-over study design. Each treatment period will be 2 weeks in duration with metabolic and endothelial assessments done post-therapy. Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either receive either THC or placebo for the first 2 weeks of therapy. Then following a 4-week washout, they will receive the opposite investigational product for the second 2 weeks of therapy. Subjects will remain on their standard treatment for T2D throughout the entire course of the study. There will be a total of 10 study visits and subjects will be enrolled for approximately 16 weeks.\n\n1. Screening - Complete consenting process, complete medical history and physical exam, review of current medications, collect height/weight, vital signs, ECG and fasting laboratory (blood and urine) tests.\n2. Visit 2 - Treatment Session 1 Start - Collect weight, vital signs and fasting laboratory tests. Receive investigational product and training on its use.\n3. Visit 3 - Monitory investigational product compliance and adjust dosing.\n4. Visit 4 - Complete endothelial function tests including flow mediated dilation and EndoPat, complete vital signs, weight and laboratory tests for safety.\n5. Visit 5 - Complete a 2-Step Hyperinsulinemic/Euglycemic clamp and Indirect Calorimetry. Begin 4-week washout.\n6. Visit 6 - Treatment Session 2 Start - Collect weight, vital signs and receive investigational product and training on its use.\n7. Visit 7 - Monitory investigational product compliance and adjust dosing.\n8. Visit 8 - Complete endothelial function tests including flow mediated dilation and EndoPat, complete vital signs, weight and laboratory tests for safety.\n9. Visit 9 - Complete a 2-Step Hyperinsulinemic/Euglycemic clamp and Indirect Calorimetry. Discontinue use of investigational product.\n10. Safety Follow-up - Collect weight, vital signs, ECG and fasting laboratory tests. Receive investigational product and training on its use."
