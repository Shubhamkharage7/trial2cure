It will also learn if the drug works to treat works to treat CF with a specific mutation.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to:\n\n* test the safety and effectiveness of multiple doses of the study drug, SPL84\n* test how multiple doses of the drug are processed by the body\n\nResearchers will compare drug SPL84 to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) to see if drug SPL84 is safe and if it works to treat CF.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nTake drug SPL84 or a placebo by inhalation every week for 9 weeks months Visit the clinic approximately 14 times over 17.5 weeks for checkups and tests"
