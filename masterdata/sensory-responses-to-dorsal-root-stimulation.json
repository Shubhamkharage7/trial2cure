            "briefSummary": "The goal of this project is to characterize the types of sensations that can be evoked via electrical stimulation of the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Patients will be recruited from a local pain clinic, each with a spinal cord stimulation device implanted, to participate in experiments to explore the ability to modulate and control the modality, intensity, focality, and location of the sensations evoked by stimulation through the spinal cord stimulator leads. Investigators will connect spinal cord stimulator leads to a custom stimulator system and will ask subjects to report the types of sensations felt. Invesigators will also perform detailed psychophysical metrics to examine participants' ability to discriminate sensations.",
            "detailedDescription": "For this study, investigators aim to determine whether DRG and spinal root stimulation might be viable techniques for restoring feedback. Investigators will focus on patients undergoing temporary percutaneous trials of DRG or lateral spinal cord stimulation with leads manufactured by either Boston Scientific (under PMA P030017) or St. Jude (under PMA P150004), which have FDA premarket approval for the management of chronic pain in the trunk and lower limbs. In this early experiment, investigators will not focus on individuals with limb loss, but rather will include patients already undergoing a percutaneous trial of DRG or spinal root stimulation to treat pain. Investigators will characterize the location, modality, and intensity of sensations evoked in the hands or feet with stimulation delivered by an external stimulator."
