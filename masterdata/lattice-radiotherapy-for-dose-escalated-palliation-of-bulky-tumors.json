Treatment will consist of 5 fractions of lattice radiation therapy delivered every other day. The primary endpoints will include the efficacy of lattice therapy as evaluated by ORR (CR or PR per RECIST criteria) at 60 days (2 months) post-treatment and safety. Toxicity will be evaluated at day 5 (+/- 2 days), day 15 (+/- 5 days), day 30 (+/- 5 days), and day 60 (+/- 7 days) post-completion of lattice therapy. This study will also include a translational analysis of the impact of lattice therapy on systemic immune responses."
