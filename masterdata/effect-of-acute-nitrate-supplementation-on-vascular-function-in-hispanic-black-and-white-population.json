The investigators will further investigate the affect of Beetroot juice on the vascular function of all participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "African Americans and Hispanic individuals have the highest incidence of type 2 diabetes, which increases their risk of all cardiovascular diseases. One of the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes is vascular dysfunction, caused by a lack of nitric oxide bioavailability. Vascular function and blood flow responses to exercise have been shown to improve after nitrate supplementation (beetroot juice), However, whether nitrate supplementation will improve vascular function in African American and Hispanic individuals remains unknown. The investigators will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy African American, Hispanic and Caucasian subjects. They will be studied before and 90 minutes after consuming Beetroot juice (high nitrate supplement) or Placebo, with at least 1-week washout period between the two visits (Kenjale AA et al., J Appl Physiol 2011)."
