            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective study to assess the impact of biomarker driven, early therapeutic switching and delayed imaging with the incorporation of DiviTum\u00ae serum TK1 activity (\"DiviTum\u00ae TKa\") in patients with HR positive, HER-2 negative metastatic or unresectable breast cancer. Patients will receive first-line treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) and endocrine therapy. All patients will have blood drawn for thymidine kinase activity (TKa) testing at baseline and at C1D15. Patients who are found to have a lack of TKa suppression at C1D15 will be recommended to switch to an alternative therapy. Patients with suppressed C1D15 TKa levels will continue on CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy until clinical progression. Patients with TKa which remains suppressed will be recommended to delay restaging scans from 24 weeks to 36 weeks.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that a patient's TKa level at C1D15 is prognostic for progression-free survival (PFS) on a CDK4/6 inhibitor and early therapeutic switching in patients with a lack of C1D15 TKa suppression will be associated with prolonged PFS."
