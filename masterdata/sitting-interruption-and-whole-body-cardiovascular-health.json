            "briefSummary": "There is strong evidence for the association between sedentary behaviors and cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke. However, the public currently has no clear guidance on how to limit or interrupt their sedentary behaviors. This study will identify and test the physiological effects of several sedentary behavior interruption strategies and explore the feasibility (i.e., likelihood of an individual performing the requested activities) of those strategies to inform the development of public policy surrounding sedentary behavior interruption. Long-term, the findings of this study will inform a large clinical trial that can test whether sedentary behavior reduction can decrease cardiovascular disease risk.",
            "detailedDescription": "Sedentary behaviors (SB) are biologically distinct but understudied heart disease risk factors. National and international agencies have concluded that the level of evidence for an overall and dose-response association between SB and heart disease mortality is moderate-strong. These agencies do not provide specific recommendations for breaking-up SB, though do call on the research community to facilitate policy development by establishing biological plausibility, identifying the optimal dose for SB substitution strategies, and conducting randomized clinical trials to test the efficacy of these strategies. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to identify mechanism-informed, socioecological-based SB substitution recommendations to reduce heart disease risk. To achieve this goal, two aims will be addressed. Aim 1 will identify a feasible SB substitution strategy to prevent the negative cardiovascular responses to prolonged SB (i.e., strategies that people will actually follow). Adverse cardiovascular responses to prolonged SB will be measured using aortic arterial stiffness (AS), a noninvasive test that predicts future heart disease. To accomplish this aim, 56 middle-aged (36-55 years) participants will provide written informed consent, prior to the measurement of aortic AS and associated mechanistic responses to the following over 4 hours, in a randomized crossover manner: (i) SB with a 5-minute walk break once per hour; (ii) SB with a 15-minute standing break once per hour; (iii) SB with two breaks per hour, alternating between a 5-minute walk and a 15-minute stand; and (iv) SB with no breaks (control). These strategies were selected based on extensive prior work by the investigators, and because they are feasible, which is a key component of this study. SB reduction strategies will only decrease heart disease risk if people are willing to adhere to future SB substitution recommendations. To increase the likelihood of feasibility and long-term adherence, Aim 2 will evaluate the determinants of SB using a socioecological model. This recognizes that behavior change is likely to be limited if the physical and sociocultural environments do not support the behavior change. To accomplish Aim 2, a combined inductive-deductive qualitative approach will be used. Participants who complete Aim 1 will participate in one of 6 focus groups (6-8 participants/group). Crucially, the outcomes from this proposal will be instrumental in helping to design a subsequent clinical trial to test a mechanism-informed yet feasible SB reduction intervention, and in doing so directly support the development of SB policy."
