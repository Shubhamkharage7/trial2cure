Twelve church groups, each with 10 people (N=120) will be invited to participate. This intervention will be the first evidence-based, faith-based intervention designed for African Americans if validated.",

At the start of a R-SWD, all clusters begin as control groups. At certain time points during the course of the trial, some of the clusters are randomly selected to be switched to the Cognitive Behavioral Faith Fellowship to Improve Thy Health (CB-FAITH) treatment, with all clusters eventually crossing over to receive the treatment.\n\nPrimary Aim 1: Examine efficacy of CB-FAITH in reducing symptoms of depression.\n\nSecondary Aim 1: Examine moderating effects of religiosity on treatment effectiveness.\n\nSecondary Aim 2: Evaluate satisfaction with CB-FAITH delivered in church settings.\n\nImpact: CB-FAITH is poised to be the first evidence-based faith-based depression intervention designed for African American adults with depression. This community-prioritized research and transformative intervention has potential to reduce depression symptoms, reduce mental health disparities and advance health equity. Given the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, CB-FAITH is critically needed."
