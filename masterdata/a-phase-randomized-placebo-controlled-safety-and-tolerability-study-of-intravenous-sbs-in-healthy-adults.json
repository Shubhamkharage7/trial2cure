Up to 56 subjects will be randomized.\n\nA total of 6 ascending dose cohorts will be used to assess the MTD of SBS-1000. Each cohort will be comprised of up to 8 subjects randomized 6:2 (IP:placebo). A sentinel group of 2 subjects randomized 1:1 (IP:placebo) will be used for each cohort with the sentinel group being dosed at least 48 hours prior to dosing the remaining subjects of the cohort, and contingent on the results of ongoing safety evaluation.\n\nBlood samples will be collected over 72 hours postdose and urine samples over 48 hours postdose for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments in all cohorts. Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed throughout the study in cohorts 1 through 6. The sampling parameters may be adjusted based on the interim safety review.\n\nOnce the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established, dosing with the MTD or a lower dose, as determined by an interim safety review, an additional cohort (7) will occur to investigate the cardiodynamic effects of SBS-1000 using Holter monitoring. Cohort 7 will be comprised of 8 subjects randomized 6:2 (IP:placebo). No sentinel dosing administration will occur in this cohort."
