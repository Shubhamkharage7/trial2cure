            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate successful clinical use of the ThecaFlex DRx\u2122 System in delivering nusinersen in subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\n\nAll enrolled subjects will undergo implantation of the investigational device (ThecaFlex DRx\u2122 System) and will be followed for 12 months after receiving the implant. The 12-month data will be used to assess the primary endpoint support a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, multi-national, prospective, non-randomized, single arm, group sequential design, pivotal clinical investigation (device exemption study) to assess the safety and performance of the ThecaFlex DRx\u2122 System in subjects with SMA.\n\nThe subject population will include subjects aged \u2265 3 years with SMA who are considered candidates for intrathecal port and catheter implantation because they require chronic, bolus intrathecal administration of necessary therapy, and who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the clinical investigation.\n\nAfter a screening period of up to 30 days, all enrolled subjects will undergo implantation of the investigational device (ThecaFlex DRx\u2122 System) and will be followed for 12 months after receiving the implant.\n\nIn agreement with the nusinersen dosing information, the treatment frequency will be adapted for non-na\u00efve and na\u00efve subjects:\n\nSubjects who are not na\u00efve to nusinersen should have nusinersen maintenance doses administered via the implant every 4 months (i.e., 4, 8, and 12 months after their last nusinersen dose, before enrollment in the clinical investigation).\n\nSubjects who are na\u00efve to nusinersen will have their first three loading doses administered via the implant at 14-day intervals. The fourth loading dose should be administered 30 days after the third dose. A maintenance dose should be administered once every 4 months thereafter within the 12 months post-implantation.\n\nA DMC and Clinical Events Committee (CEC), independent of each other and the Sponsor, will be used to perform ongoing consistent adjudication of events related to the safety throughout the entire duration of the clinical investigation and to periodically review data that relate to the safety of the study.\n\nThe clinical investigation will enroll 90 subjects. The clinical investigation incorporates a lead-in phase which consists of 10 subjects enrolled, implanted, and followed for 30-days. Enrollment for the lead-in phase is expected to take approximately 6 to 9 months, at which point the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the data for safety and approve continuation of enrollment. The second phase of enrollment is expected to take approximately 12 to 15 months.\n\nIndividual subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in the clinical investigation for approximately 37 months. The total duration of this clinical investigation is estimated to be approximately 60 months."
