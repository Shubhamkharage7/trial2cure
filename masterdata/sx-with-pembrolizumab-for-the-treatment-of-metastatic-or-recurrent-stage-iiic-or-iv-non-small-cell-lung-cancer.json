            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether CXCR1/2 inhibitor SX-682 (SX-682) with pembrolizumab works to treat patients with stage IIIC or IV non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or that has come back (recurrent). SX-682 is a drug that binds to receptors on some types of immune and cancer cells, inhibiting signaling pathways, reducing inflammation, and allowing other types of immune cells to kill and eliminate cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a receptor called PD-1 that is found on the surface of T-cells (a type of immune cell), activating an immune response against tumor cells. Giving SX-682 in combination with pembrolizumab may be more effective at treating patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer than giving these treatments alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive SX-682 orally (PO) twice daily (BID), starting 7 days prior to the start of pembrolizumab, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo biopsy and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or CT at screening and on study and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and collection of blood samples at screening, throughout the study, and during follow up.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 60 months."
