            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this observational study is to understand how adults who survive acute respiratory failure (ARF) and the people (usually family) who support ARF survivors after returning home think about the first 6 months of recovery. The study aims to find out if expectations about the recovery process after ARF are associated with mental health symptoms in both survivors and the survivor's care partners. Study participants will complete 3 surveys over 6 months. These surveys ask questions about participants' future expectations, feelings, and mood. Surveys can be completed online, over the phone, or on paper.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overarching objectives of the Investigating Dyadic Expectations about ARF Survivorship (IDEAS) cohort study are to learn how expectations about ARF survivorship are related to dyadic mental health symptoms and dyadic coping. Specifically, the study aims are:\n\n* Aim 1: To determine whether health expectations and self-efficacy after acute respiratory failure (ARF) are associated with mental health outcomes in survivor-care partner dyads.\n* Aim 2: To assess whether concordant expectations within survivor-care partner dyads are associated with better dyadic coping (primary outcome) and exploratory secondary outcomes.\n\nThe term dyadic coping refers to the ways two people interact as the pair manage illness-related stressors. Concordant expectations within dyads, also called shared appraisal, refers to both members of a dyad being \"on the same page\", and is hypothesized to lead to better dyadic coping behaviors."
