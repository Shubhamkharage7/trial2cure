            "briefSummary": "This project is a pilot study of an adapted intervention of an existing Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment retention intervention called Recovery Management Checkups (RMC). This intervention has been adapted to better fit the experiences and unique issues of those that have been hospitalized with serious injection related infections (SIRI) based on the findings from a prior qualitative study from the principal investigator. This project plans to test the adapted intervention within a smaller group of participants to assess feasibility, acceptability, and calculate early findings of intervention efficacy.\n\nHospitalizations for SIRIs are a unique entry point for patients to start their recovery journey with medications for OUD (MOUD), but many people do not remain on long-term treatment, despite evidence that indicates MOUDs reduce death and re-hospitalization after SIRIs.\n\nThe study objectives are to:\n\n* Assess the implementation feasibility of the adapted RMC model for patients with SIRI and OUD.\n* Establish preliminary estimates of intervention efficacy.\n* Make further adaptions to the intervention that will reduce both known and unknown barriers to care and increase effectiveness in future larger scale trials.\n\nFindings from this pilot study will result in further intervention refinement to better fit the target population, and serve as the basis for a larger randomized control trial that will have aims focused on more in-depth analysis of the efficacy of this program"
