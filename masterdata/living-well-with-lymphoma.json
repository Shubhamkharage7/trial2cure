The investigators will randomize and follow 68 lymphoma cancer survivors; accounting for a \\~10% drop out rate to achieve a target of 60 patients that will complete the study. The investigators hypothesize that persistently fatigued lymphoma cancer survivors will experience improvements in fatigue, quality of life, and symptoms commonly associated with fatigue, which are then maintained at 15-months post-enrollment; and decreased CRP and alterations in inflammation-associated DNA methylation consistent with reduced inflammation from following the FRD as compared to the GHC."
