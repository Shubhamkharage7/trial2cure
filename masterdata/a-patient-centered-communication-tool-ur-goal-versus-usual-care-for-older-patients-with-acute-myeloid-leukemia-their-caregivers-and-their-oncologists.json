            "detailedDescription": "The investigators have developed a patient-centered communication tool (University of Rochester-Geriatric Oncology assessment for Acute myeloid Leukemia or UR-GOAL) that 1) conducts assessments of fitness, 2) elicits patient values via Best-Worst Scaling, and 3) elicits preferences for prognostic information and assesses prognostic awareness. The tool also includes an AML educational video. The investigators have refined the tool based on feedback from stakeholders consisting of older patients with cancer, caregivers, and oncologists. This was further adapted in a qualitative study of 15 older patients with AML. In a single arm pilot study, the investigators have demonstrated feasibility of recruiting older patients with newly diagnosed AML to a single arm study, as well as their caregivers and oncologists."
