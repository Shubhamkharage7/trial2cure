Information will be collected from patient's provider of Impavido treatment, obstetrical treatment, and if applicable, the child's pediatrician.\n\nPopulation: Leishmaniasis patients or patients who take Impavido off-label who become pregnant while taking Impavido or within 5 months after taking Impavido.\n\nDrug Product:\n\nDrug name: Impavido (50 mg capsules). Dosing regimen: as per the Impavido Product Label (PL)\n\nStudy Procedures: Pregnant women will become aware of the Impavido Pregnancy Registry via the product label (PL) or the Impavido website or her physician. By calling 1-866-588-5405, the patient will be connected to the Impavido Pregnancy Registry Coordinating Center. A trained staff member will acquaint the patient with the goals and procedures of the study. If the patient tentatively agrees to participate in the study over the telephone, the patient will be mailed information forms, the Consent Form and Assent Form as appropriate, and the Consent for the patient's physician and obstetrician and the child's pediatrician to release medical information. Receipt of the four signed Consent Forms and Assent Form as appropriate by the Coordinating Center will signify patient and/or legal guardian consent/assent. The Coordinating Center will contact the patient and/or the patient's physicians each trimester until delivery to collect data on maternal adverse events (AEs), pregnancy outcome, and fetal outcome.\n\nSample Size And Study Duration: Estimated 0-1 patients per year for 10 years.\n\nOutcome Parameters:\n\nMaternal AEs. Pregnancy outcome. Fetal outcome.\n\nAnalysis Plan: Baseline data, compliance to prescribed treatment, and outcomes will be reported for individual patients and for all patients."
