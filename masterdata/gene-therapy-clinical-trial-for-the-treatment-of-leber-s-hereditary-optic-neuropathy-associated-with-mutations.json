            "briefSummary": "The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of NFS-02 in the treatment of LHON caused by mitochondrial ND1 gene mutation. This study will enroll subjects aged \u2265 18 years old and \u2264 75 years old to receive a single unilateral intravitreal (IVT) injection of NFS-02 to evaluate its safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy. The clinical manifestations of all subjects are to be reduced visual acuity caused by LHON associated with ND1 mutation, with laboratory test showing G3460A mutation (a CLIA-certified laboratory) and reduced visual acuity lasted for \\> 6 months and \\< 10 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "At the dose-finding stage, the principle is that the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will decide whether to make dose adjustment based on the safety data of the starting dose. The starting dose is 1.5\u00d7108 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose. The safety of the starting dose will be reviewed by the SRC, and dose escalation or de-escalation is by recommendation of the SRC. The safety of the starting dose will first be performed in 6 evaluable subjects.\n\nCriteria for Dose Modification:\n\nDose Escalation:\n\nIf drug-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events are observed in \\< 2 of the 6 evaluable subjects within 6 weeks after the dosing of NFS-02 at the starting dose, the dose can be escalated to 5.0\u00d7108 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose after the approval by SRC.\n\nIf drug-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events are observed in \\< 2 of the 6 evaluable subjects within 6 weeks after the dosing of NFS-02 at the 5.0\u00d7108 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose, the dose can be escalated to 1.5\u00d7109 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose after the approval by SRC.\n\nDose De-escalation:\n\nIf drug-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events are observed in \u2265 2 of the 6 evaluable subjects within 6 weeks after the dosing of NFS-02 at the starting dose, the dose can be de-escalated to 5.0\u00d7107 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose after the approval by SRC.\n\nEnrollment Sequence:\n\n* The enrollment sequence of any dose group (6 subjects) is that the 2nd subject and the 3rd subject will be enrolled at least 7 days after the enrollment of the 1st subject.\n* The 4th, 5th and 6th subjects will be enrolled at least 7 days after the enrollment of the 2nd and the 3rd subjects.\n\nThe 7-day interval is to avoid acute safety events to the greatest possible extent."

Presence of disorders or diseases of the eye or adnexa, excluding LHON, which may interfere with visual or ocular assessments, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), during the study\n7. Presence of known/documented mutations, other than the LHON-related mutation, which are known to cause pathology of the optic nerve, retina, or afferent visual system\n8. Presence of systemic or ocular/vision diseases, disorders, or pathologies, other than LHON, known to cause or be associated with vision loss, or whose associated treatment(s) or therapy(ies) is/are known to cause or be associated with vision loss\n9. Presence of optic neuropathy from any cause other than LHON\n10. Presence of illness or disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, include symptoms and/or the associated treatments that can alter visual function, for instance cancers or pathology of the central nervous system (CNS), including multiple sclerosis (diagnosis of multiple sclerosis must be based on the 2010 Revisions to the McDonald Criteria) (Polman C H et al., 2011), and/or diseases or conditions that affect the safety of subjects participating in the study\n11. History of recurrent uveitis (idiopathic or immune-related) or active ocular inflammation\n12. Participated in another clinical study and receive an IMP within 90 days prior to the screening visit\n\n    a) Exceptions: Subjects who have completed the clinical study of idebenone as IMP \\> 90 days prior to the screening visit and has completely discontinued idebenone at least 7 days prior to dosing are still eligible to participate in the study.\n13. Any eye has previously received ocular gene therapy\n14. Subjects who refused to stop using idebenone\n15. Have undergone clinical-related ocular surgery (per investigator's assessment) within 90 days prior to the screening visit\n16. Female subjects who are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed within the first 6 months after the administration of NFS-02 Injection\n17. History of drug or alcohol abuse (including heavy smoking, i.e., \\> 20 cigarettes per day or \\> 20 pack-years \\[equivalent to one pack a day for 20 years or 2 packs a day for 10 years\\])\n18. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, syphilis antibody and HCV antibody positive are excluded; hepatitis B test that shows a clinically significant active infection requiring treatment (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \\[HBcAb\\] positive or hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] positive, and hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid \\[HBV-DNA\\]) \\> 1000 copies/mL or according to local laboratory method above lower limit of quantitative detection) are excluded\n19. Unable to tolerate or unable or unwilling to comply with all the protocol requirements\n20.
