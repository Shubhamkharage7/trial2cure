We will enroll up to 15 cancer survivors who are cancer-free and meet all other inclusion/ exclusion criteria, including CIPN symptoms at least 3 months after final chemotherapy infusion. Participants will undergo baseline assessments (V1) of questionnaires and performance tests, and may repeat these tests within a few days as a double-baseline (V2). In addition, they complete 7-days of baseline symptom monitoring by diary before starting 6 weeks of daily at-home therapy with a Myovolt wearable FV device. A study coach will check in by phone or video calls during the intervention period. Participants undergo post-testing immediately after the 6-week intervention (V3), and after another 6 weeks without FV (V4). In total, participants attend 3-4 onsite study visits, a 6-week intervention period with weekly remote check-in contact from the study team, and a 6-week intervention-free follow-up period with at least one remote check-in. Participants will keep a provided daily symptom diary during the primary study period (i.e., 6 weeks), and at least weekly in the 6-week follow-up period."
