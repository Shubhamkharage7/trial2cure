            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to explore whether a group exercise program called Strength After Breast Cancer can be delivered in an outpatient physical therapy clinic to improve physical function among women after treatment for breast cancer.\n\nThe main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n* Can the Strength After Breast Cancer program and the associated outcome battery be successfully delivered in an outpatient physical therapy clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital and do participants find the program practical?\n* What are the barriers to and facilitators of delivering the group exercise program in a clinical setting and what changes need to be made to the program to improve sustainability and to facilitate implementation at other clinical sites?\n\nParticipants will complete study questionnaires before and after engaging in the group exercise program and they will participate in interviews following participation in the program.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this single arm feasibility study of the Strength After Breast Cancer (SABC) evidence-based group exercise intervention for women after treatment for breast cancer is to determine if investigators can feasibly deliver the program out of the outpatient physical therapy clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital Waltham.\n\n- Following a one-on-one physical therapy evaluation, the four-session SABC program provides a group-based but individualized exercise plan and encourages engagement in independent home-based exercises to improve physical function. The SABC program has previously been found to be safe and led to improvements in physical function among women after treatment for breast cancer. Therefore, the focus of this study is to explore clinical implementation barriers, facilitators, and necessary program adaptations to enhance sustainability and facilitate implementation at other clinical sites.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility, in-clinic visits, questionnaires, and a semi-structured interview.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last up to 5 months. It is expected that up to 40 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis is an unfunded study."
