Part A is a dose escalation study in participants with any advanced solid tumor with FGFR/FGF pathway alterations who have exhausted approved standard therapies. Part A will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of TYRA-200 to determine the optimal and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Part B will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-200 in participants with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who have previously received an FGFR inhibitor and have FGFR2 kinase-domain mutations resistant to other FGFR inhibitors."
