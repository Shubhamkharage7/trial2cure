The researchers hypothesize that participation in a lateral stepping program a minimum of 2 times/week for 8 weeks, in addition to RSB class participation, will decrease fall risk factors, increase balance confidence, and decrease fear of falling in participants in the experimental group compared to the control group. The researchers also hypothesize that the integration of this program into an existing community-based RSB program will be deemed feasible as shown by the number of sessions attended by each participant and their satisfaction"
