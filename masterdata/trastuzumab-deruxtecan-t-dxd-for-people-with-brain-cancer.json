Complete heterosexual abstinence for the drug washout period is an acceptable contraceptive method if it is in line with the patient's usual lifestyle (consideration must be made to the duration of the clinical trial); however, periodic or occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable. It is strongly recommended for the female partners of a male patient to also use \u22651 highly effective method of contraception throughout this period, as described in Table 1. In addition, male patients should refrain from fathering a child, or freezing or donating sperm from the time of enrollment until 4 months after the last dose of T-DXd; sperm preservation should be considered prior to enrollment in this study.\n* Female subjects must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of enrollment through at least 7 months after the final study drug administration.
