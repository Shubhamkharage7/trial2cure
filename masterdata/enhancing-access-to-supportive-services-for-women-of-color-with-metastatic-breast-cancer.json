Establish the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted navigator delivered supportive care model called ACCESS to address supportive care needs for Black and Latina women with Metastatic Breast Cancer.\n2.

Participants complete questionnaires over the phone with a research coordinator at baseline, 6 and 9 months.\n\nGROUP 2/Attention Control group: Participants complete 6 phone calls with a research coordinator focused on supportive care resources followed by monthly phone call check ins for 4 months.
