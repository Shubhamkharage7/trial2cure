            "detailedDescription": "Uveal Melanoma (UM) is a rare type of melanoma (3.1% of all melanoma incidence, approximately 4000 cases globally per year) with an incidence of 5.3-10.9 cases per million individuals. Despite its rare incidence rate, UM is the most frequent primary intraocular malignancy of the adult eye that affects the vascular layers of the eye (iris, ciliary body, and choroid). UM has a high incidence of metastases, predominantly to the liver, because of the lack of significant lymphatic traffic out of the eye and predominant hematogenous spread.\n\nTebentafusp has been studied in four clinical studies including IMCgp100-01 (NCT01211262; \u22652L cutaneous and uveal melanoma), IMCgp100-102 (NCT02570308; \u22652L uveal melanoma), IMCgp100-201 (NCT02535078; PD-1 na\u00efve and PD-1 R/R cutaneous melanoma), and IMCgp100-202 (NCT03070392; 1L uveal melanoma vs. physicians' choice chemotherapy). Based on early first-in-human (FIH) studies, tebentafusp 68 mcg was identified as the RP2D; with an intra- patient escalation regimen (20 mcg at C1D1 and 30 mcg at C1D8) and the dose escalated at C1D15. This dose was subsequently evaluated in a recently completed phase -II trial - IMC-p100-202 - that randomized 378 treatment-na\u00efve, HLA-A\\*0201 positive patients with advanced uveal melanoma on a 2-to-1 ratio to tebentafusp (n = 252) or investigator's choice (IC) of dacarbazine, ipilimumab, or pembrolizumab (n = 126). Based on the data from the IMCgp100-202 study, the current approved dose of tebentafusp is a fixed starting dose of 20mcg (C1D1), followed by 30 mcg (C1D8) and 68mcg at C1D15 and beyond."

An erythroid-stimulating agent is allowed as long as it was initiated at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and the patient is not red blood cell transfusion dependent.\n* Pregnant, likely to become pregnant, or lactating women (where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation).\n* Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective contraception during study treatment and must agree to continue using such precautions for 6 months after the final dose of investigational product; cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.\n* Male patients must be surgically sterile or use double barrier contraception methods from enrollment through treatment and for 6 months following administration of the last dose of study drug.\n* Receipt of live or attenuated vaccinations 2 weeks prior to starting study therapy.
