These outcomes are related to depression being a recurrent disorder, with repeated episodes over a patient's lifetime. Recurrence rates (defined as including both relapse and recurrence) are high in LLD.\n\nThe goals of this study are to identify neurobiological factors that predict recurrence risk, and examine how cognitive performance changes are both influenced by these neurobiological factors and also predict recurrence risk."
