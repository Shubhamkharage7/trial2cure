            "briefSummary": "This pilot study will examine the impact of pre-operative Medical Reiki\u00a9 on the psychosocial well-being and recovery of underserved women undergoing breast cancer surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Reiki is a form of energy therapy involving the facilitation of healing through the manipulation of biofields utilizing light touch. Practitioners lightly place their hands directly on or above the patient's body to transmit energy from the practitioner to the recipient. This process of targeting the energy fields around the patient's body is believed to stimulate the patient's natural ability to heal itself. Reiki is a safe treatment modality that emphasizes spirituality in healing and wellness whose origins are rooted in ancient Tibetan traditions. The prevalence of integrating complementary therapies such as Reiki into mainstream medical practices is demonstrated by the number of hospitals that make use of these therapies to help alleviate, for example, the fatigue, pain, anxiety, and diminished quality of life experienced by cancer patients and those with other illnesses. Reiki in particular, has become more widespread in cancer centers because of its potential to reduce cancer-related symptoms and enhanced wellness without posing harm to patients.\n\nA pilot double-blind randomized-controlled design will be used to engage 32 women in a pre-operative Reiki intervention designed by Raven Keyes called Medical Reiki\u00a9 with a follow-up of two months. Women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing mastectomy for their treatment will be recruited to study within two weeks of surgery. Patients will be recruited to receive Medical Reiki\u00a9 vs Sham Reiki (attention control) before surgery, with medical and psychosocial outcomes assessment conducted at three time points: -T0 - Baseline/pre-surgery; T1 (1-month); T2 (2 months). These assessments will either be self-administered or administered via telephone by the research team. The study The study will aim to determine the feasibility of offering Medical Reiki to breast cancer patients immediately prior to breast surgery; the impact of pre-operative Medical Reiki\u00a9 vs Sham Reiki on post-operative recovery at the identified timepoints based on the specified measures of Subjective QoL metrics and objective recovery metrics."

The CBI-B survey consists of a 12-item scale which assesses how confident the patient is in performing specific behaviors during and after cancer treatment. Patients are asked to provide a score on a 9 point scale ranging from 1 (\"Not at all Confident\") to 9 (\"Totally confident\"), for an overall possible scoring range of 12-108. Overall scores will be summarized at each time point using basic descriptive statistics. Higher scores are associated with an increased level of self-efficacy in coping with cancer.",
