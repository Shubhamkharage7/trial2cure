            "detailedDescription": "Participants in this research study, may or may not have a tumor within a urologic region of interest such as the bladder, prostate, testicle, kidney, urethra, and penis which may or may not have spread to a lymph node and have been scheduled to undergo a lymph node dissection procedure and/or organ removal surgery within one of the previously mentioned urologic regions of interest concerning for urologic cancer.\n\nThis research study involves the use of a standard of care laparoscope and ultrasound probe. The laparoscope and ultrasound probe will have an electromagnetic sensor attached which will assist in the tracking of lymph nodes of interest or organs of interest.\n\nIt is expected that the entire time to record the data will be less than 10 minutes.\n\nA total of 10 people will take part in this research study\n\nThis study is supported by Siemens Medical USA."
