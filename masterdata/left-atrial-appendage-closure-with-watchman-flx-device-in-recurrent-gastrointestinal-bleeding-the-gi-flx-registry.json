            "briefSummary": "The GI-FLX Registry is intended to create a registry of patients with a history of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed who will receive Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) with WATCHMAN FLX device and compare to patients with AF and GI bleed who do not have LAAC. The GI-FLX Registry will be a multi-center, non-randomized registry. Approximately 250 prospective patients will be enrolled at all 4 sites. Historical cohort of 250 patients after propensity score matching with WATCHMAN-FLX arm will be included in the final analysis.",
            "detailedDescription": "A large gap in the literature exists as no prior study has evaluated the outcomes of those with prior GI bleeding undergoing LAAC. Furthermore, patients with prior GI bleed may be on no or minimal antithrombotic therapy prior to LAAC and subsequently require escalation of antithrombotic therapy following LAAC. Long-term outcomes including bleeding events will be most relevant and informative to this potentially high-risk subgroup. Therefore, this is an attempt to create a prospective registry describing outcomes of patients with AF and prior GI bleed undergoing LAAC to provide insight into safety and efficacy and will also compare to a historical cohort of patients with AF and GI bleed without LAAC."
