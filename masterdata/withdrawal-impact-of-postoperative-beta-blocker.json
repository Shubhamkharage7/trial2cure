The investigators hypothesize that withdrawing BB after CABG for 1 year will be non-inferior to continuing BB in terms of MACCE incidence."

The investigators will measure patient-reported outcome on 1) 10-item activity level (VSAQ), 2) Fatigue Assessment Scale. 3) 15-item Vertigo Symptom Scale at the time of enrollment and 3 months.",
