Investigators will also evaluate the safety and impact of pulsatile flow on clinical outcomes compared to non-pulsatile flow during cardiopulmonary bypass.",
            "detailedDescription": "Non-pulsatile and pulsatile blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery are both considered standard of care and allow surgeons to operate on the heart without movement. Pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass produces variations in blood flow to produce a pulse similar to a normal beating heart. Non-pulsatile and pulsatile blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass are approved as safe and effective ways to provide perfusion during cardiac surgery, but it is unknown whether there are differences in clinical outcomes after surgery. Acute kidney injury is common after cardiac surgery and may be caused by inadequate perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nSpecific Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of pulsatile blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass to reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery compared to non-pulsatile blood flow.\n\nHypothesis: Pulsatile blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass will reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery compared to non-pulsatile blood flow."
