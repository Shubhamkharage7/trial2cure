The device uses safe, high-power LED arrays to produce photons at therapeutic wavelengths in the near infrared (nIR) portion of the light spectrum.\n\nOrthoPulse is an established device that uses low levels of light energy to stimulate the bone surrounding the roots of teeth and facilitate tooth movement which may reduce treatment time for braces or clear aligners.",
