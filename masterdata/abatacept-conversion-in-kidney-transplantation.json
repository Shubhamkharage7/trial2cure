This protocol has been developed to answer the question: Can patients be safely converted from monthly belatacept IV infusions to abatacept subcutaneous injections without a decrease in kidney function. Research subjects will be recruited from those who were initiated on belatacept at the time of their kidney transplant and have been stable on belatacept therapy for at least 2 years post-transplant and off CNI therapy for at least 6 months.\n\nA total of 86 subjects will be randomized in equal numbers, 43 patients in each arm. Enrollment of all 86 patients is expected to be completed within 1.5 years. All patients will be actively followed in the study for 24 months following randomization. The patient participation is projected to last a total of 3.5 years with data analysis to follow.\n\nThe primary objective will be the difference in estimated GFR (eGFR) for abatacept and belatacept groups using a monthly repeated measures model between randomization and 12 months."
