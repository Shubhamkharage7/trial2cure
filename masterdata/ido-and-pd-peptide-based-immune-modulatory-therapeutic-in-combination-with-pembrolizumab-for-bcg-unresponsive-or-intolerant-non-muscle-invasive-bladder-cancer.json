            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety and side effects of a PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine (IO102-IO103) in combination with pembrolizumab in treating patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. IO102-IO103 is a novel IDO and PD-L1 peptide based immune-modulatory therapeutic. It is designed to activate the patient's own immune cells (called T-cells) to fight the tumor and stop the tumor cells escaping from the body's immune system. IO102-IO103 works to directly kill tumor cells and remove the body's immune suppressive cells, which are cells that prevent the immune system from fighting the tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab may make tumor cells more visible/recognizable to the immune system.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Evaluate the feasibility, safety and toxicity of the PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine (IO102-IO103) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive or intolerant, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess preliminary efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab. II. To obtain preliminary efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients receive PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) and/or CT/positron emission tomography (PET) and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter."
