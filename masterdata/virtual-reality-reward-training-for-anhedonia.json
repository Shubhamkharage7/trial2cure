Participants will complete in-person VR sessions, laboratory assessments, self-report questionnaires as part of the study.\n\nThe total length of participation is around 3 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Anhedonia, or loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities, has been relatively resistant to pharmacological and psychological treatments in the context of anxiety and depression. Newer treatments that focus upon positivity or reward sensitivity have shown promising results.\n\nThe purpose of the current randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of Virtual Reality-Reward Training (VR-RT) with an active control condition, Virtual Reality-Memory Training (VR-MT), on positive affect and other clinical symptoms. Virtual Reality-Reward Training is designed to augment reward sensitivity in individuals with depression and low positive affect. Targets include behavioral, cognitive, and self-report indices of reward anticipation and initial response to reward. Specificity of target engagement is assessed by comparison with Virtual Reality-Memory Training, designed to improve memory.\n\nTargets and clinical outcomes are assessed at baseline (Week 1) and either weekly or at mid-treatment (Week 3), post-treatment (Week 7), and follow-up (Week 12). Statistical models evaluate whether change in outcomes and change in target measures are greater as a result of Virtual Reality-Reward Training compared to Virtual-Reality-Memory Training and whether changes in target measures correlate with changes in outcome measures.\n\nTarget enrollment is 80 male and female participants with low positive affect, depression, and impaired functioning, who are at least 18 years old, who will be randomized to Virtual Reality-Reward Training or Virtual-Reality Memory Training, each comprising 7 individual virtual reality training sessions over the course of 7 weeks.\n\nParticipants will complete laboratory tests and self-report questionnaires as part of the study. Total length of participation is around 3 months."
