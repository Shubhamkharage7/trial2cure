The eligible women will undergo pre-study evaluation to ascertain study eligibility.The study will enroll 60 participants in total, half will receive simvastatin and the other half will receive a placebo. The study drug and placebo will be an add on to the participants ongoing medical management of fibroids until surgery. The participants will be monitored at intervals for the effect of the drug on fibroid size and symptoms using ultrasound and quality of life questionnaires."
