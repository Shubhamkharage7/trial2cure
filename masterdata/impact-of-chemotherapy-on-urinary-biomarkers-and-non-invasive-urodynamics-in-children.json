The global hypothesis is that childhood cancer survivors with prior exposure to systemic vincristine (VCR) and/or doxorubicin (DOX) report an increased incidence of bladder dysfunction (BD) symptoms on the Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score (DVSS) survey. We expect to observe differences in non-invasive urodynamic (niUDS) testing between childhood cancer survivors with BD symptoms on the DVSS versus those without BD symptoms on DVSS. We also expect to observe statistically significant differences in the urinary levels of known urinary biomarkers of BD (NGF, ATP and BDNF) of patients with evidence of BD compared to those without BD on the DVSS. We also expect to observe rational differences in the urinary proteome of patients between those with and without BD."
