Through a series of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics assays, this proposal will identify gene-drug and drug-drug interactions (DDI), including those that place transplant recipients at risk for increased toxicity related to their immunosuppression. The information learned in these studies will help to inform practitioners as to whether cannabidiol needs to be avoided in transplant recipients and how to appropriately adjust doses of CBD and immunosuppression in order to improve health outcomes and long-term treatment success in this high-risk population."
