This study will measure PSMA levels using standard PET/CT scans and participants will receive standard-of-care androgen receptor antagonist monotherapy.\n\nThe names of the treatment interventions involved in this study are:\n\n* Androgen receptor antagonist monotherapy.\n* PSMA PET/CT scan\n\nIt is expected that about 15 people will take part in this research study.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last about 4 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a pilot study, and it is the first time investigators are directly examining the effect of standard androgen receptor antagonists on Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) expression for participants with recurrent, asymptomatic, metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). This study will measure PSMA levels using standard PET/CT scans and participants will receive standard-of-care androgen receptor antagonist monotherapy.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study imaging and evaluations, blood collections, and follow up visits.\n\nThe names of the treatment interventions involved in this study are:\n\n* Androgen receptor antagonist monotherapy.\n* PSMA PET/CT scan\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\nIt is expected that about 15 people will take part in this research study.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last about 4 weeks.\n\nFunding for this research study is provided by a philanthropic gift."
