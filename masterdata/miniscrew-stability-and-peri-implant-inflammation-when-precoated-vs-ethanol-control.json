Mobility will be assessed at the 4 and 8 week follow up appointments by gentle manipulation with cotton pliers. Clinical success will be defined as maintenance of stability for a period of 8 weeks. Peri-implant inflammation will be assessed at follow up appointments by looking for signs of soft-tissue inflammation (redness, swelling) where possible."
