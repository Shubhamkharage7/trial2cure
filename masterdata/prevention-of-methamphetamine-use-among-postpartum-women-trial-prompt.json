            "briefSummary": "The PRevention Of Methamphetamine Use among Postpartum Women Trial (PROMPT) is randomized controlled trial of postpartum individuals with methamphetamine use disorder to 12 weeks of 200 mg oral micronized progesterone twice daily or placebo. The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of micronized progesterone for the prevention of return to methamphetamine use. A secondary aim is to assess participant's salivary levels of allopregnanolone with methamphetamine cravings. This study has the potential to provide effective interventions to prevent methamphetamine use among postpartum women.",
            "detailedDescription": "While substantial attention and resources have been directed at the opioid epidemic in the US, another deadly drug epidemic - methamphetamine use (MU) - has been evolving. While most pregnant women achieve abstinence by late pregnancy, the postpartum period is a particularly vulnerable time. Postpartum return to use is high and potentially deadly. Data from the Utah Maternal Mortality Review Committee indicate that from 2005-2016 (n=176), MU contributed to one out of every five deaths of pregnant and postpartum women; 85% of these deaths occurred in the postpartum period and, 70% of methamphetamine-related deaths also involved opioids. While medications for OUD reduce return to opioid use among postpartum women, similar interventions to reduce return to MU are lacking.\n\nIn developing novel interventions to address MU in this vulnerable population, it is critical to consider important hormonal changes that mediate drug cravings and place postpartum women at particular risk of return to MU. Among women, higher systemic levels of progesterone and its active metabolite allopregnanolone appear to attenuate drug craving, urges, and return to use. Postpartum women may be particularly sensitive to increased craving and urges given the precipitous post-delivery drop in endogenous progesterone and allopregnanolone levels. Supplementation of exogenous progesterone is a novel therapy that has shown promising results in decreasing return to use among women using cocaine, tobacco, and benzodiazepines. Among postpartum women who used cocaine in pregnancy, micronized progesterone (which metabolizes to allopregnanolone) was associated with a reduction in cocaine use in the first 12 weeks postpartum in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.\n\nThe investigator's long-term goal is to advance the understanding of how pregnant and postpartum women's unique physiology impacts the trajectory of MUD and to apply this knowledge to developing novel interventions aimed at reducing MU in this population. The objectives of the PROMPT study is to determine: 1) the effect of micronized progesterone on return to MU among postpartum women with MUD, and, 2) determine the association between allopregnanolone levels and methamphetamine craving in this population. The central hypothesis is that micronized progesterone is a feasible, safe, and effective intervention that reduces the risk of return to MU among postpartum women with methamphetamine use disorder"
