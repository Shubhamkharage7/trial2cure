The main objective is to determine whether daily personalized gaze stabilization training is more beneficial than intermittent gaze stability training in people with multiple sclerosis.",
            "detailedDescription": "People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often experience dizziness, caused by problems in how their brain processes balance signals. This dizziness can lead to difficulties keeping their eyes focused on a target while moving their head, known as gaze instability. This makes activities like walking or driving challenging and dangerous. Vestibular physical therapy, including gaze stabilization exercises, can help. The team developed StableEyes, a technology that improves gaze stability using a gradual approach to these exercises. In the studies, StableEyes significantly enhanced gaze stability in people with balance issues. Preliminary research in people with MS shows promising results, suggesting that tailored gaze stability exercises can further improve their vision stability. This method targets the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), a critical reflex for maintaining clear vision during head movements. Improved VOR function can reduce dizziness and improve the quality of life for people with MS."
