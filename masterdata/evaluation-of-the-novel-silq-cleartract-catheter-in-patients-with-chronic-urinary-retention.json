            "briefSummary": "To assess the ability of the Silq ClearTract\u2122 100% Silicone 2-Way Foley Catheter to reduce catheter associated complications in subjects that require a long-term indwelling Foley catheter when compared to other commercially available Foley catheters.",
            "detailedDescription": "A prospective, randomized, multi-center, post-market study in subjects that require a long-term indwelling Foley catheter.\n\nNeurogenic bladder is commonly managed with indwelling catheters (urethral or suprapubic). Indwelling catheters are associated with multiple complications, including recurrent urinary tract infections and catheter obstruction. A randomly assigned catheter will be inserted using standard techniques. The assigned catheters will either be the SILQ ClearTract 100% Silicone 2-Way Foley Catheter or the current standard of care catheter. Subjects will continue to use the assigned catheter for a period of approximately 3 months following regular standard of care. Subjects will then be assigned the alternative catheter for an additional 3 month period after which they will be exited from the study\n\nThe purpose of the study is to compare the incidence of catheter-related complications between the SILQ treated catheter and the current standard of care catheter(s). Because these complications lead to more frequent interventions and associated treatment costs, the study will also calculate the economic impact of the use of SILQ treated catheters compared to standard of care catheters. Patient-reported outcomes will also be measured via questionnaires upon each study visit. Explanted catheter samples will also be sent to a core lab for quantification of the calcification present on the catheter surface."
