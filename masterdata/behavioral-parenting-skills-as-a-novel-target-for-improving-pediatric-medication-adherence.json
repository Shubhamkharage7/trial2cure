Use direct observation of medication administration in the home to understand common episode-level barriers and identify the most impactful behavioral parenting skills for intervention.\n\nII. Use daily diary methods to identify contextual barriers to adherence and identify intervention components to help parents anticipate barriers and plan strategies to promote successful adherence.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants complete a survey over 15-20 minutes at baseline. Family behaviors before, during and after the administration of medication to the child are video-recorded over 40-45 minutes. Participants receive MEMS electronic pill bottle to use for 2 weeks and complete daily survey over 5 minutes for 14 days."
