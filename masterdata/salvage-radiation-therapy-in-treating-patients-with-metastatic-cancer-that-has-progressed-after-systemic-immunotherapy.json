Giving radiation therapy may help to control the cancer after the disease has gotten worse after receiving immunotherapy in patients with cancer that has spread to the other places in the body.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To identify immunotherapy-based treatments where salvage radiation produces systemic disease control after initial progressive disease.\n\nII. To identify immunotherapy-based treatments where salvage radiation produces a high rate of treatment-related toxicities.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the frequency of systemic disease control (objective response or stable disease) after salvage radiation following progression on immunotherapy among all patients and within each treatment group.\n\nII. Determine the frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) with salvage radiation after progression on treatment with an immunotherapy agent among all patients and within each treatment group.\n\nIII. To determine the rate of systemic objective response among all patients and within each treatment group among all patients and within each treatment group.\n\nIV. To determine the duration of response in patients who achieve disease control among all patients and within each treatment group.\n\nV. To determine the overall survival after salvage radiation among all patients and within each treatment group.\n\nVI. To determine the systemic progression free survival after salvage radiation among all patients and within each treatment group.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo either 4, 5, or 10 fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), or 5-15 fractions of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to any site of metastatic disease daily for any time between 4 days and 3 weeks as determined by the treating radiation oncologist. Patients with at least stable disease (SD) after the second imaging evaluation may undergo additional SBRT in 4 fractions or EBRT in 3 fractions.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year."

Has a diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy.\n2. Has had prior radiation therapy within the past 3 months where the high dose area of the prior radiation would overlap with the high dose area of the intended radiation based on the judgment of the treating radiation oncologist.\n3.

Has an active infection requiring intravenous systemic therapy or hospital admission.\n5.
