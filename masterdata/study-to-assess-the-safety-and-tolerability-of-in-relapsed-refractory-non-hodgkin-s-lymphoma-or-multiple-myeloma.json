Known malignancy other than study indication that is progressing or has required treatment within the past three years.\n10. Major surgery within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.\n11. Presence of \u2265Grade 2 toxicity (CTCAE v5.0) due to prior cancer therapy.\n12. Initiation of hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (e.g., G-CSF, GMCSF, M-CSF) \u22641 week prior to start of study treatment. An erythroid stimulating agent is allowed if it was initiated at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n13. Received live, attenuated vaccine within four weeks of first dose.\n14. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n15.

Subjects will be excluded if there is a reactive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBS-Ag) or Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total).\n16. Any Subject with a known history or risk of Hepatitis C must be tested for HCV. Subjects with positive test for hepatitis C (HCV) infection are excluded regardless of viral load. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, a confirmatory test should be performed. If the test is negative, subject is eligible for this trial.\n17. Uncontrolled active systemic infection or any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety or put the study outcomes at undue risk.\n18. Concurrent administration of strong CYP3A modulators.\n19. Is currently participating in, or has participated in, a study of an investigational agent, or has used an investigational treatment within \u2264 5 half-lives or within 4 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n20. Inability or difficulty swallowing capsules, or tablets (as available), malabsorption syndrome, or any disease or medical condition significantly affecting gastrointestinal function.\n21. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n22. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with cooperating with requirements of the study.\n23. Is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n24. Previously identified hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment or excipients.",
