The efficacy of adjunctive treatments to prevent the development of post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) after DVT will be evaluated.",
            "detailedDescription": "Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a significant complication that occurs up to 75% of patients after DVT. Rosuvastatin is a HMGCoA reductase inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination standard anticoagulation therapy (e.g. Factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and three months of 20 mg dose of rivaroxaban and its efficacy as prophylaxis against PTS after lower extremity DVT. After the diagnosis of lower extremity DVT with either duplex venous ultrasound or other imaging, study participants will initiate standard rivaroxaban therapy as per standard medical care. All consented participants in this trial will receive three months of rosuvastatin (20 mg daily dose). Assessment of post thrombotic syndrome follow up will continue for 365 days from the time of DVT diagnosis or until resolution or stabilization of any clinically significant drug related adverse event, after which they will be considered off-study."

Three doses of xisomab 3G3 (42, 126, or 252 mg IV) will be tested to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with the dose limiting toxicity as any major bleeding or serious adverse event. Phase 2 will assess the efficacy of xisomab 3G3 for the prevention of PTS and compare the 1 year incidence of PTS as determined by the Villalta score in patients with lower extremity DVT on standard rivaroxaban therapy in 30 study participants.",
