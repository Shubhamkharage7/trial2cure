            "detailedDescription": "This is a 12-week study to clinically evaluate the effectiveness of the Sustained Acoustic Medicine (SAM) device combined with diclofenac on symptoms of patients suffering from pain related to a bone fracture(s). The class-II device, sam\u00ae, has been FDA-cleared for home use. On the first day of the study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain score before treatment. During the following 12 weeks, patients will self-apply their treatment for the 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores will be recorded immediately before application of SAM device, during treatment, and at the completion of treatment.\n\nOver 90 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study site(s). The study is designed to reach a diverse target patient population."
