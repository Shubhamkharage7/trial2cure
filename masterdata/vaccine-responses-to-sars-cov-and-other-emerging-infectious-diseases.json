But the protective effects of these vaccines appear to wane over time. Researchers want to learn why.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about how the immune system responds to vaccines against infections like SARS-CoV-2.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy adults ages 18 or older who are scheduled to receive either a new vaccine or a booster shot against SARS-COV-2 or another emerging infection.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests.\n\nParticipants will have up to 8 study visits in 1 year. Each visit should last less than 2 hours. At each visit, participants will give blood samples. Some blood samples will be used for genetic testing. They will also give updates on their health.\n\nAfter the first study visit, participants will receive either a first vaccination or a booster shot. They must get the vaccine in their community or workplace. They will not get the vaccine at NIH.\n\nThis study currently focuses on SARS-CoV-2, but it will expand to other infectious diseases as they emerge and become the target of new vaccines.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description: This protocol will enroll up to 200 adults per year who are scheduled to be vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or other emerging pathogens.Participants will provide blood samples prior to and serially aftervaccination. The blood will be used to perform research studies of the immune response to primary (new) and secondary (booster) vaccines.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: Characterize longitudinal serologic and cellular responses to vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging\n\ninfections.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. Evaluate baseline correlates of immune response to vaccination.\n2. Correlate cellular and serologic responses after vaccination.\n3. For vaccines that require two or more doses; characterize the immunologic responses following both the primary (new) and\n\n   the secondary (booster) dose(s).\n4. Evaluate the longevity of immune responses to primary (new) and secondary (booster) vaccination.\n\nEndpoints: Primary Endpoint: Establish immunologically well characterized cohorts of primary (new) and secondary (booster) vaccinated individuals.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Establish factors associated with longevity of serologic and cellular responses to primary (new) and secondary\n\n(booster) vaccination."
