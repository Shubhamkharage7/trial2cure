            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of a computerized anxiety sensitivity treatment (CAST) compared to a health education control (HEC) in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their care partners. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Efficacy of CAST in reducing anxiety and related symptoms among those with MCI/mild ADRD\n2. Efficacy of CAST in reducing care partner burden among care partners of people living with MCI/mild ADRD\n3. Explore treatment mechanisms using a multi-modal assessment battery of anxiety sensitivity and anxiety\n\nParticipants will complete six in-person visits including a baseline assessment, two intervention sessions, and three follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6-months posttreatment. Participants will also complete three weeks of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for one week prior to intervention, one week between intervention sessions, and one week after intervention.\n\nIf there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare CAST to HEC to see if CAST reduces anxiety and related symptoms in older adults with MCI/mild ADRD and care partner burden to a greater degree than HEC.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants are dyads consisting of an older adult with MCI/mild ADRD and their care partner. Baseline assessment will include a neuropsychological evaluation to confirm cognitive status for the older adult with MCI/mild ADRD, a series of baseline questionnaires, and introduction to the EMA application. Dyads are randomized to either the CAST or HEC conditions. During CAST sessions, dyads view the CAST presentation and complete interoceptive exposures. An interventionist guides dyads through these sessions. During HEC, dyads view the HEC presentation and complete behavior tracking and goal-setting with the guidance of an interventionist. At both intervention sessions, dyads complete questionnaires including post assessments at the end of intervention session two. For the week prior to intervention session one, the week between the two intervention sessions, and the week after intervention session two, dyads complete daily EMAs about emotional and other factors using an application downloaded on a phone or tablet. At 1, 3, and 6-months follow-up assessments, dyads complete follow-up cognitive testing and outcome questionnaires."

CAST is a fully computerized, 1-hour intervention containing video animation and audio narration throughout, as well as interactive features (e.g., brief quizzes to promote comprehension, introduction and practice with interoceptive exposures). Procedures draw heavily on standard CBT techniques; AS, a core vulnerability for anxiety and depression is targeted using these procedures. In CAST, participants are informed that \"the primary purpose of the presentation is to highlight healthier, more productive, and effective ways of dealing with stress.\" Through participation in the intervention, people learn adaptive long-term strategies for tolerating, coping with, and effectively reducing distress and negative emotions.",
