            "detailedDescription": "Cognitive impairment begins early in Parkinson's disease (PD) and progresses to dementia in a majority of patients, impairing quality of life and contributing to growing health-related costs. Physical exercise has potent anti-aging effects and improves many outcomes in PD including cognition. Identifying biomarkers that respond to exercise, and how they associate with cognition and underlying disease pathology, may elucidate key mechanisms for countering cognitive decline. This is a randomized-controlled trial that evaluates safety and feasibility of a home-based exercise intervention in people with PD and measure its effects on cognition and circulating biomarkers of aging and stress. Thirty-six participants with PD will be randomized to receive a home-based, trainer-supervised endurance and resistance training program (exercise group) or no exercise (wait list control group) for 26 weeks. Cognitive assessments and patient reported outcomes will be obtained at baseline and at end of 26 weeks. Biomarkers in periphery (blood, saliva) and brain \\[cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\\] will also be measured before and after the 26-week exercise intervention."

Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) score \\> 16, indicating depression that precludes ability to exercise.\n5. Use of neuroleptics/dopamine receptor blockers for more than 30 days in the year prior to baseline visit, or any use within 30 days of baseline visit.\n6. Recent use of psychotropic medications (e.g., recent use of psychotropic medications (i.e., anxiolytics, hypnotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants) where dosage has not been stable for more than 30 days prior to screening.\n7.

Complete Blood Count out of range on screening labs and physician's judgment that abnormal value is clinically significant.\n9. Uncontrolled hypertension (resting blood pressure \\>150/90 mmHg).\n10. Orthostatic hypotension and standing systolic BP below 100. Orthostatic hypotension is a reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing.\n11. Already participating in 120 minutes or more of moderate intensity exercise per week.\n12. Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) within the last 4 weeks.\n13. History of any other medical problem or injury that may interfere with ability to exercise.\n14. Condition that precludes the safe performance of routine lumbar puncture, including:\n\n    1. INR \\> 1.4 or other coagulopathy\n    2. Platelet cell count of \\< 50,000/\u03bcL\n    3. Infection at the desired lumbar puncture site\n    4.
