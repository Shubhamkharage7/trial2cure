            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase III three arm randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of two interventions (1) Integrated infectious diseases (ID) and Medication for Opioid Use Disorder outpatient clinic (IC) and (2) Navigation Services To Avoid Rehospitalization (NavSTAR )Intervention (NS) compared to treatment as usual on infection related rehospitalization in individuals hospitalized with infections due to injecting opioids, in the 6 month time period after discharge. This study includes both cost effectiveness and implementation outcomes.\n\n(1) The Integrated ID/MOUD Clinic (IC) will provide facilitated linkage to a clinic providing medical treatment aimed at treating opioid use disorer (OUD), resolving the index infection, treating existing ID complications of OUD (HIV, HCV, wounds) and preventing subsequent infections by providing accessible care for infectious diseases and medication for OUD (MOUD) treatment that is integrated into a single appointment and co-located at a single site (either in person or via telemedicine) for a minimum of monthly appointments over a 6 month time period. A feature of the IC will be weekly care coordination meetings between the ID and MOUD providers.\n\n2) The NavSTAR Arm (NS) aims to targeted support delivered by a Patient Navigation team to enhance participants' linkage with outpatient OUD treatment and recommended medical care for infections and other presenting illnesses. The Navigation Dyad will work in concert with existing resources in the hospital system and broader community to ensure continuity of care (initial linkage and subsequent retention) during the 6-month period after hospital discharge when patients are at elevated risk of disengaging from care, inpatient readmission, and other adverse outcomes.\n\nThe study will recruit patients during hospitalization for an infection due to injecting opioids at four hospital systems (five hospitals) and randomly assign approximately 608 inpatients in 1:1:1 ratio to IC vs NS vs TAU.\n\nParticipants will be followed for 12 months."
