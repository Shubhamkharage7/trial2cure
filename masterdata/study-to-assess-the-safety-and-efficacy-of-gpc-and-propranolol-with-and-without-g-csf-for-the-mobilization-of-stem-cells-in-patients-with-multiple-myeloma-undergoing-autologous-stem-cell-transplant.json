Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms prior to study drug administration.\n\nApproximately 40 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment arms:\n\n* GPC-100 in combination with propranolol; or\n* GPC-100 in combination with propranolol and G-CSF. To characterize the safety and clinical activity of GPC-100, the study will employ a Bayesian Optimal Phase II (BOP2) design to enroll patients for each arm.\n\nAll patients will receive via IV 3.14 mg/kg GPC-100 (Burixafor) at least 2 hours prior to leukapheresis sessions from Days 7-8 (Days 9-11 optional) and 30 mg propranolol (3 x 10 mg tablets) twice daily at 8:30 AM (+/- 1 hr) and 4:00 PM (+/- 1 hr) local time from Days 1 to 8 (and on Days 9-11, if applicable). Patients will administer the first dose of propranolol onsite on Day 1. Patients will be provided with doses of propranolol for self-administration at time points when they are not otherwise required to be onsite.
