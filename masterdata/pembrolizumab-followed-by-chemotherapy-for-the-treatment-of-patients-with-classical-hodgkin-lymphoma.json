            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well giving pembrolizumab followed by chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine works to treat patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Pembrolizumab is a type of drug called a \"monoclonal antibody (mAb)\" that uses the body's immune system to help fight and kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab followed by chemotherapy may work to treat patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the percent of patients that achieve a complete response (CR) after frontline pembrolizumab monotherapy induction, among classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients with early unfavorable or advanced stage disease, per Lugano 2014 response criteria at positron emission tomography (PET) #2.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy of a reduced number of cycles (2-4) of doxorubicin (adriamycin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD) when used following treatment with frontline pembrolizumab monotherapy in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), per Lugano 2014 Response Criteria.\n\nII. To assess the safety and tolerability of sequential immunotherapy with upfront pembrolizumab followed by AVD chemotherapy in cHL per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (ver.) 5.0.\n\nIII. To assess progression-free-survival (PFS) of cHL patients who received sequential immunotherapy with upfront pembrolizumab followed by AVD chemotherapy, assessed by central review, according to Lugano 2014 Response Criteria.\n\nIV. To assess overall survival (OS) of cHL patients who received sequential immunotherapy with upfront pembrolizumab followed by AVD chemotherapy.\n\nV. To assess the CR rate at the end of pembrolizumab (PEM) induction by PET-computed tomography (CT) in all treated patients, regardless of number of cycles of PEM received, per Lugano 2014 Response Criteria.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats repeat every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo disease assessment. Patients with a response complete 3 additional cycles of pembrolizumab, undergo disease assessment and proceed to consolidation. Patients without response or with progressive disease proceed to consolidation.\n\nCONSOLIDATION: Patients receive doxorubicin IV, vinblastine IV and dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for 2 to 6 cycles dependent upon response and disease type. Patients undergo echocardiography/ multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, CT scan, PET scan and blood sample collection throughout the study and may undergo tumor biopsy during screening.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year, and every 6 months for 4 years."

If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n  * Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Patients who have had prior systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or other systemic therapy (including investigational agents) for the treatment of cHL.\n\nNOTE: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

In addition, the investigational agent, pembrolizumab, has the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with adriamycin (doxorubicin) as part of the AVD chemotherapy regimen, and the investigational agent, pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AVD and/or pembrolizumab.\n* Patients who have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or are receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to registration are not eligible.
