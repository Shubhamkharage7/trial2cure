In each arm of the study, successive cohorts of participants will receive increasing oral doses of FHD-286 as a single agent or in combination with LDAC or decitabine to determine the RP2D(s) in this population.\n\nThe data from this study in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies, including safety, tolerability, PK/PD findings, and antitumor activity, will form the basis for subsequent clinical development of FHD-286."
