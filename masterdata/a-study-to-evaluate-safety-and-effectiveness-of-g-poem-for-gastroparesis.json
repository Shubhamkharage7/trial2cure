The qualifying gastric emptying scintigraphy must be performed within 18 months prior to registration or can be the baseline gastric emptying.\n* No evidence of mechanical obstruction based on upper GI endoscopy or upper GI series in their medical history.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Another active disorder which could explain symptoms in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Gastric retention of solids at 4 hours \\< 25% or \\< 75% at 2 hours.\n* Ongoing use of prokinetic agents (e.g., metoclopramide, erythromycin, prucalopride) GLP -1 analog or agonists, or drugs that slow down gastric emptying (narcotics). Neuromodulators such as tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline or nortriptyline) or others that are being used at stable doses for a month prior to randomization may continue at the discretion of the care provider.\n* Significant systemic illness such as chronic renal failure (adjusted for age) or liver disease as defined by Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater.\n* Poorly controlled diabetes with HbA1c of greater than 10% at time of screening.\n* New medications for gastroparesis-related symptoms started within 1 month prior to registration.\n* Pregnancy or nursing.\n* Failure to give informed consent.\n* Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would impede compliance or hinder completion of the study.\n* Botox injection into the pylorus within 3 months prior to registration.\n* Allergy to eggs or Egg Beaters and Ensure.",
