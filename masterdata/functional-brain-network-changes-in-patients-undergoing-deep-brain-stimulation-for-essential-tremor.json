            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to collect electrophysiological data related to functional brain network changes in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for the treatment of essential tremor. Participants will be asked to remain seated with their head inside of a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording system as resting-state and task-related data are acquired. Spontaneous electrophysiological activity will be recorded in both the eyes open and eyes closed conditions with the participant seated comfortably. These recordings will be repeated in the DBS OFF and DBS ON states, with the ON state involving specific settings identified as optimal, sub-optimal, or ineffective at achieving tremor control. They will also be repeated following the optional administration non-DBS tremor mitigation techniques, which may include one or more of 1) cooling the limb, 2) oral administration of alprazolam, 3) oral consumption of ethanol (alcohol), or 4) peripheral nerve stimulation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Electrophysiological data from participants will be collected during Magnetoencephalography (MEG) procedures. The MEG experiments, will utilize recordings from the DBS system that may be synchronized to externally recorded signals (e.g., MEG, EEG, EMG, accelerometry) via gentle tap-induced motion artifacts, and/or by applying a small, barely perceptible electrical current at the skin over the DBS system with use of a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) unit.\n\nIt is hypothesized that the chronic, electrical stimulation of the target region has both local and circuit-wide effects, the net effect of which is to disrupt the pathophysiological neural activity present across both cortical and subcortical brain regions that and thought to underlie disease manifestation (i.e., tremor). By systemically characterizing the pathways involved in propagating tremor-related activity as well as mediating treatment-related benefits, the investigators hope to identify potential new therapeutic targets or treatment paradigms to further optimize tremor control in this population."
