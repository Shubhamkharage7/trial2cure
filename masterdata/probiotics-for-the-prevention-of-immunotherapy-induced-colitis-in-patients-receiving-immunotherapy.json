            "briefSummary": "The clinical trial tests the use of over-the-counter probiotics VSL#3\u00ae 450B in patients receiving immunotherapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, helps the body's immune system attack tumor cells, and interferes with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy can also cause an unfortunate side effect of inflammation of the colon and diarrhea, also known as immune checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis. Immune checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis can occur in up to 45% of patients receiving immunotherapy. Taking probiotics VSL#3\u00ae 450B may reduce the chances of developing immune checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis in patients receiving immunotherapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)-induced colitis (IIC) in patients with solid malignancies receiving over-the-counter multi-strain probiotic blend and ICIs in both cohorts: (1) anti-Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) +/- anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and (2) anti-PD-1/PD-L1 +/- chemo.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety of multi-strain probiotic blend in cancer patients receiving ICIs.\n\nII. To evaluate the clinical outcomes related to IIC, including the incidence of IIC, hospitalization, treatment delays, and administration of immunosuppressants.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate changes in gut microbiome with ICIs and multi-strain probiotic blend.\n\nII. To evaluate changes in immune response with ICIs and multi-strain probiotic blend.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive VSL#3\u00ae 450B (live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria probiotic) orally (PO) once daily (QD) at least 3 days prior or 1-2 weeks prior to starting standard care ICIs and then continue for 12 weeks. Patients also undergo stool and blood sample collections on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 1 year."
