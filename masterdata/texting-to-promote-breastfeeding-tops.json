Because breastfeeding is healthy for mothers and babies, and because fewer African-American/Black women decide to breastfeed and continue breastfeeding than many other racial and ethnic groups, researchers like us are trying to figure out ways to be supportive to African-American/Black mothers who might be interested in breastfeeding. The investigators will enroll up to 80 mothers and their infants at UHCMC."
