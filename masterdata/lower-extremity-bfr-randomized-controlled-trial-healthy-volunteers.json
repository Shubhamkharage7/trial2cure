The primary research procedures are:\n\nSubjects will be randomized into either BFR or conventional strengthening groups.\n\nBFR and conventional strengthening programs will be implemented. Force plate and force frame data will be collected at baseline, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 weeks.\n\nSubject Population. The study will enroll 18 healthy volunteers. The study includes 6 visits.\n\nThe total study duration for each subject is 16 weeks.\n\nThe device the investigators intend to use is Class I and in a class of devices that is exempt from the FDA requirement for premarket notification/approval (exempt from 510K or PMA), which would not be \"subject to section 510(k), 515, or 520(m) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act"
