Patients should not receive hydroxyurea while on treatment.\n* Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required between end of radiotherapy and randomization\n* The effects of ruxolitinib and abemaciclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. To be eligible for the study, female subjects of childbearing potential (and their male partners) and men (and female partners) enrolled in the study should use two methods of effective contraception (hormonal and barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior and during the study and also continue to use contraception for 4 months after completion of ruxolitinib and abemaciclib administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Screening is not required for enrollment.\n* Patients with \u2265 10% circulating or bone marrow blasts.\n* Pregnancy and lactation.\n* The patient has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\<30ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).\n* The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest.\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A that cannot be discontinued. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information.\n* Unwillingness to be transfused with blood components.\n* Inability to comprehend or unwilling to sign the informed consent form (ICF).\n* Other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the achievement of the objectives of the study.",
