            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II pilot randomized-controlled, single-site trial to determine if surgical untethering of the filum terminale is more effective, preliminarily, than medical management as a treatment option for OTCS. Subjects will be randomized to one of two arms: surgical untethering or medical management only. Symptom improvement and adverse events will be assessed and recorded for 1 year from initiation of treatment. After a minimum of 1 year, subjects who were randomized to the medical management arm may cross over to the surgical arm if the PI deems it is in the subject's best interest to do so. The exploratory hypothesis is that surgery for OTCS is both safe and more effective than medical management at relieving the symptoms of OTCS."
