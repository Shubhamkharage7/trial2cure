Researchers in this study want to see if decreased blood flow to the heart during stress could be causing the heart damage seen in SCD patients. They also want to test people who don't have SCD to see if their hearts react the same way under stress.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* To estimate the coronary flow reserve (CFR) (also referred to as myocardial perfusion reserve), as measured by PET stress-rest myocardial perfusion imaging, in SCD patients with and without diastolic dysfunction, and healthy controls.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To investigate the relationship between decreased CFR (quantified with PET stress- rest myocardial perfusion imaging) and presence of abnormal diastolic parameters",
            "detailedDescription": "This study requires two visits. The first visit includes blood tests, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and an echocardiogram. The second visit includes a positron emission tomography (PET) stress test and a blood test.\n\nSubjects will be considered off-study one week after all post PET imaging study tests have been completed along with the next day and one-week follow-up phone calls are completed."
