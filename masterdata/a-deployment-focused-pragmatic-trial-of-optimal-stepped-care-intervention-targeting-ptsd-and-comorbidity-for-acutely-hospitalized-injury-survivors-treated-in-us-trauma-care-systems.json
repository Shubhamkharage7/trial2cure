            "briefSummary": "This investigation is a randomized pragmatic trial of a brief stepped care intervention delivered from an acute care medical trauma center that may both reduce the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and diminish emergency department health service utilization.",
            "detailedDescription": "Life-threatening traumatic exposures requiring presentation to acute care medical settings are endemic in the US in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, firearm proliferation, and extreme weather events, and constitute both a substantial source of individual suffering and a significant public health burden. Each year in the US, over 30 million individuals present to acute care medical settings after injury, and approximately 2.5 million individuals are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospital admissions. The overarching goal of the Trauma Survivors Outcomes and Support (TSOS) investigation is to advance the sustainable delivery of high quality trauma center mental health screening, intervention and referral procedures for diverse injury survivors. Over the past two decades, the TSOS study team that includes research scientists, trauma surgical policymakers, patients, and frontline clinicians has established a track record of using evidence derived from NIH pragmatic trials to directly target American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (College) regulatory policy. The TSOS investigation will refine and test optimal stepped care intervention strategies for diverse injury survivors presenting to acute care medical settings with PTSD and associated comorbidity. This single trauma center site pragmatic trial investigation will individually randomize 424 patients (212 intervention and 212 control) to a brief stepped care intervention versus College required screening and referral control conditions. The stepped care intervention consists of proactive care management, as well as medications and psychotherapy elements targeting PTSD and comorbidity. Blinded follow-up interviews at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-injury will assess the symptoms of PTSD and related comorbidity for all patients. The emergency department health information exchange will be used to capture population-level automated emergency department/inpatient utilization data for the intent-to-treat sample. The investigation aims to test the primary hypotheses that intervention patients will demonstrate significant reductions in PTSD symptoms and emergency department/inpatient utilization when compared to control patients. The investigation will also explore mediators and moderators of intervention treatment effects that directly address actionable national trauma center quality improvements. A mixed method Rapid Assessment Procedure-Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) implementation process assessment will facilitate the integration of study results into national College policy requirements, guidelines, and verification criteria. A national trauma center survey will elucidate the progression of PTSD and comorbidity screening, intervention and referral for all US level I and II trauma centers. An end-of-study College policy summit will harness pragmatic trial data to inform the capacity for US trauma centers to implement high quality acute care medical mental health services for diverse patient populations."
