Women will be randomized to receive CARE, a culturally tailored mammography education module, or CARE+COACH, which is the CARE education module plus access to an Apache paraprofessional women's health coach (i.e., patient navigator). The CARE intervention was developed through a community-based participatory research process. The primary outcome is mammography uptake within 2 months of a referral."
