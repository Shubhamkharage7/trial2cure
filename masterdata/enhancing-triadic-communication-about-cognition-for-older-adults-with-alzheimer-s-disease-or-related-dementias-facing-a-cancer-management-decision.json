The investigators hypothesize that for patients with dual diagnoses of ADRD and cancer, COACH-Cog will increase autonomy support of care partners and patients in the decision-making process, leading to greater acknowledgement and support of cognitive concerns and cognitive-related goals, thereby improving goal concordant care. The investigators are conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT; cluster randomized by physician) including approximately 45 oncology clinicians and 130 patient/care partner dyads evaluating the effect of COACH-Cog on care partner and patient autonomy support, care partner well-being, goal-concordance, and communication."
