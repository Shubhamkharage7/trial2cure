            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot study of biomarker evaluation and safety of pre-incisional ketorolac for patients undergoing surgical resection for non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. There is significant promise in the use of preoperative ketorolac to decrease the inflammatory response after surgical resection of tumors, thereby potentially reducing the risk of distant metastatic tumor spread and improving survival. A total of 56 patients (28 per disease site) will be enrolled into the experimental arm and will receive ketorolac prior to surgery. About 10 patients will be allocated randomly into a control group, for each disease site, for a total of 76 patients enrolled. The research will advance scientific knowledge by studying the safety of a preoperative dose of ketorolac prior to major surgical resection, which needs to be assessed prior to proceeding with a larger phase II study designed to evaluate traditional efficacy endpoints such as recurrence and overall survival.",
            "detailedDescription": "Surgical resection is a cornerstone of standard-of-care treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Yet despite optimal treatment, many of these patients will develop cancer recurrence within the first few years. For example, the 5-year survival rate for patients with stage I/II NSCLC is only around 55%. As a result, more effective treatments that decrease cancer recurrence and increase survival are still needed.\n\nSurgery induces inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis. Although these processes are important for wound healing in response to tissue injury caused by surgery, they also support the survival, growth and dissemination of any remaining cancer cells and can lead to systemic recurrence soon after surgery. Surgical trauma increases the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which have tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive activities, and reduces the activity of natural killer cells, which impairs the ability of the immune system to keep cancer cells in check. However, if given just before tissue injury, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be able to block the production of prostaglandins/thromboxanes and boost the activity of natural killer cells, and thereby decrease the risk of cancer recurrence. NSAIDs such as ketorolac are already routinely given to cancer patients postoperatively for pain management and are sometimes given intraoperatively (immediately before or during surgery) to prevent postoperative pain. A retrospective clinical analysis found that intraoperative intravenous ketorolac or diclofenac (another NSAID), when added to standard of care for patients with stage I/II NSCLC, was associated with decreased risks of distant recurrence and mortality.\n\nThere is significant promise in the use of preoperative ketorolac to decrease the inflammatory response after surgical resection of tumors, thereby potentially reducing the risk of distant metastatic tumor spread and improving survival.\n\nPatients will be screened and recruited during the preoperative period by the responsible medical and surgical team. Blood will be drawn preoperatively and then at the end of the surgical procedure. Participants will be randomized to either preoperative ketorolac group or a concurrent control group who will not receive preincisional ketorolac. The concurrent control group is to obtain untreated biologic samples for biologic correlative studies and secondary endpoints. These patients will not be compared to the investigational cohort in regards to the primary endpoint of safety. Patients will be randomized on the day of surgery to either the experimental or control arms and participants will be followed or 28 days. Medical records will be reviewed at 1 and 2 years post-surgery for survival assessment."
