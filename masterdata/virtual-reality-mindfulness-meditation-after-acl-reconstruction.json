            "briefSummary": "To evaluate the effect of virtual reality mindfulness meditation on patients after ACLR, the investigators will determine the effect of virtual reality mindfulness meditation to 1) decrease self-reported injury-related fear, 2) improve poor jump-landing movement patterns, and 3) improve brain activity in women 1 to 5 years post-ACLR when compared to a virtual reality sham group.",
            "detailedDescription": "Injury-related fear after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury significantly contributes to decreased return to sport, decreased physical activity engagement, and increased ACL reinjury risk in previously high functioning, physically active individuals. Injury-related fear is also associated with poor jump-landing movement patterns in patients after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Unfortunately, current rehabilitation practices do not specifically address injury-related fear in patients after ACLR. Virtual reality mindfulness meditation is a mental practice that involves focusing the mind on experiences in the present moment and has been used to address depression, anxiety, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. To evaluate the effect of virtual reality mindfulness meditation on patients after ACLR, the investigators will determine the effect of virtual reality mindfulness meditation to 1) decrease self-reported injury-related fear, 2) improve poor jump-landing movement patterns, and 3) improve brain activity in women 1 to 5 years post-ACLR when compared to a virtual reality sham group. Patients in the intervention group will complete 8-weeks of virtual reality mindfulness meditation + an advanced rehabilitation training program. Patients in the sham group will complete 8-weeks of the virtual reality sham + an advanced rehabilitation training program. The central hypothesis is that women 1 to 5 years post ACLR who undergo virtual reality mindfulness meditation will demonstrate decreased injury-related fear, improved jump-landing movement patterns, and improved brain activity."

Mindfulness meditation is the practice of sustaining attention on the body, breath, or sensations in any given moment and allows for the self-regulation of attention by decreasing rumination about past or future events. During the practice of mindfulness meditation, the individual is aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings, but rather than reacting to them, the individual accepts them. Virtual reality mindfulness meditation has been demonstrated to be superior in inducing mindfulness states when compared to traditional mindfulness meditation. Use of a virtual reality system to implement mindfulness meditation not only decreases the barrier of time to implement psychological interventions, but also improves the clinician's confidence in implementing the intervention as the virtual reality system guides the patient through the mindfulness meditation process.",
