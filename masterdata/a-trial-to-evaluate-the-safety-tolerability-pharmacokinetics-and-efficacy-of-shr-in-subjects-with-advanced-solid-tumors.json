Subjects with pathologically diagnosed advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors, either gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, or pancreatic cancer, who are intolerable to SoC, have progressed through all available treatment options, or for whom there is no efficacious treatment available. Subjects must have pathological classification (e.g., adenocarcinoma etc.) documented.\n6. Positive expression of Claudin 18.2 (\\>=50% of cells with 2+ or 3+ expression, either from fresh or archival tissue) is required prior to enrollment and participation in this study. Positivity for Claudin 18.2 is defined as tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining. The percentage of tumor cells at four different staining intensities will be estimated: 0 (no staining), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate), and 3+ (strong). The sum of all 4 percentages should equal 100%. The H-score is determined according to the H-Score formula: \\[1 x Percentage of tumor cells stained at 1+\\] + \\[2 x Percentage of tumor cells stained at 2+\\] + \\[3 x Percentage of tumor cells stained at 3+\\] = H-Score (range 0 or 1-300). Actual figure of Claudin 18.2 expression tested by IHC should be documented. Subjects must have pathological classification (e.g., adenocarcinoma) documented.\n7.

Known to be allergic to any component of SHR-A1904 product (antibody conjugated toxin, antibody), or allergic to humanized monoclonal antibody products.\n8. Subjects with known brain metastases, unless the participant is \\> 1 month from definitive therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), has no evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the start of study intervention.\n9. Subjects with a second primary cancer, except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, and other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \u22653 years prior to the first dose of the study.\n10. Class III-IV cardiac insufficiency as per the New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria; arrhythmia requiring long-term drug control; unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction within 6 months before the first dose of the study.\n11. Subjects with a history of clinically significant lung diseases (e.g., interstitial pneumonia, radiation pneumonia, and pulmonary fibrosis) or who are suspected to have these diseases by chest imaging at screening period.\n12. Serious infections that require use of intravenous antibiotics, antiviral drugs, or antifungal drugs during the study period.\n13.
