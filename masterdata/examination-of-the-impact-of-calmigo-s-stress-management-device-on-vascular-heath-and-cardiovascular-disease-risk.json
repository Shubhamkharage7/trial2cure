Patients then will be randomized to either CalmioGO stress management device + standard of care treatment or just standard of care treatment. Those randomized to CalmiGO stress management device treatment will be instructed to use the hand device much like an inhaler once a day for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of rehabilitation both groups will return for reassessment of baseline tests."
