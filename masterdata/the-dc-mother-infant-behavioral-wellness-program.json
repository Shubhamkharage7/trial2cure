            "detailedDescription": "The overarching objective is to develop and evaluate a collaborative, multi-dimensional and culturally tailored community-based model of integrated perinatal MH care. The target population is low-income Black/of African descent women with pregnancy-related stress, anxiety, and depression. There are two specific aims: (1) to refine an individualized plan to integrate patient navigation and a culturally adapted cognitive-behavioral (CBT) intervention for low-income Black/of African Descent women designed to increase recruitment and retention within the healthcare community system, and (2) through a two-arm prospective randomized controlled design, women who are subthreshold and threshold risk for prenatal stress, depression and/or anxiety will participate in one of two interventions: (a) existing prenatal intervention (usual care); or (b) patient navigation plus culturally adapted CBT, and peer support groups.\n\nThe investigators will screen 1,000 low-income pregnant AA women (18-45 years of age) in their second pregnancy visit with validated tools for stress, anxiety, and depression. A total of 700 study participants will be recruited from urban prenatal care centers in the Washington DC area and will be randomized Usual Care of Intervention conditions above (n=350/condition). Following randomization, participants will participate in a diagnostic interview based on DSM-5 criteria to 'self-select' themselves into 1 of 2 groups (i.e., 'threshold' or 'subthreshold'). Threshold includes women who meet criteria for depression or anxiety based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Subthreshold includes all other women who do not meet DSM criteria). In the intervention arm, participants in the threshold group will receive a 1:1 CBT treatment intervention, and participants in the subthreshold group will receive a group CBT intervention. Both threshold groups will also include patient navigation and participation in a peer support group. Participants will complete standardized health, mental health, and well-being questionnaires during pregnancy at their prenatal site, and up to 12 months after delivery at their well-baby visits, when they also will complete questionnaires about their infants' development and behavior. All infants also will undergo a standardized developmental test at 12 months. Health care utilization and outcomes also will be collected through electronic medical records."
