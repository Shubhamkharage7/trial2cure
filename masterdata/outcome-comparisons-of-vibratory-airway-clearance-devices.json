            "detailedDescription": "This pilot study is a randomized control trial of adult patients admitted to an academic medical center from April 2023 to April 2024. Subjects included in this study must be adults 18 years or older and will receive a respiratory assessment and allocation of therapy (RAAT) score of at least 10 and a secretion score of at least 5 post extubation or within the first 48 hours of ICU admission. Exclusion criteria include those younger than 18 years of age, those who are pregnant, with an SVC of \\<10mL/kg, and who cannot follow instructions or currently receiving cough assist, vest or intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. Patients receiving more than one therapy session using the oscillatory index device before enrollment will be excluded. Patients with multiple ICU admissions will be enrolled once. After randomization, the study team will give the device to the patient and administer instructions on the device use. Each eligible patient will receive clinical evaluation using RAAT scores per the department policy. The frequency of using oscillatory index devices will be based on the department protocol. Each subject will be followed up until discharge from the hospital. The primary outcome will be the RAAT score. The RAAT score range from 0-50 and includes five components: respiratory rate, oxygen therapy, chest x-ray, secretion clearance, and vital capacity. The higher score denotes respiratory compromise, and therapy is assigned for score 10 or greater per departmental protocol. The secondary outcomes include respiratory interventions used or other bronchial hygiene (vest therapy, intrapulmonary percussive ventilation) performed, ICU re-admission, need for continuous positive pressure, and length of stay (hospital and ICU)."
