Participants with LGS or DS must have a diagnosis that is consistent with International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines and confirmed by the Epilepsy Study Consortium (ESCI).\n* Participants who have uncontrolled seizures, and who are currently receiving 1 or more antiseizure medication (ASMs).\n* A suitable VEEG, as available in the medical record, within 1 year of Visit 1. When a historical VEEG is not available, and if clinically indicated and appropriate (due to uncertainties or new seizures), a VEEG will be completed and read to confirm diagnosis prior to Visit 3.
