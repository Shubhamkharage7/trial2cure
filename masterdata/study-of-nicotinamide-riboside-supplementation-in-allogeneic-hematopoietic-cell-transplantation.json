            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to find a safe and tolerable way to improve engraftment after transplant. Research studies have shown that adding nicotinamide riboside to donor cells has the potential to increase blood stem cell numbers and potentially decrease the time to engraftment. Also, nicotinamide riboside, TRU NIAGEN (the study drug) is a type of vitamin B supplement that the general public can get without a prescription and is well tolerated.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-center, pilot feasibility study of NR supplementation in allogeneic (donor) HCT in which the study team is seeking to obtain preliminary data on any beneficial effect of increasing NAD+ levels in-vivo to facilitate engraftment. Engraftment is defined as the process during which transplanted stem cells begin to grow in the bone marrow and produce new white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. It takes about 14 to 24 days for donor cells to engraft after infusion, and the time between which blood counts fall to the time when they recover is a very critical period. Transfusions are frequently required to prevent bleeding and antibiotics are needed to prevent infections during this critical time period. Shortening the time of engraftment decreases these risks and can improve long-term health status.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of NR supplementation\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to evaluate neutrophil and platelet recovery after HCT"
