Data shows that the gut microbiota composition and function may be drivers of CRC. High levels of exercise are associated with improved CRC prognosis and survival. While data suggests that exercise has the potential to influence gut microbiota composition and function, it is not known whether these effects contribute to improved CRC prognosis. This clinical trial evaluates the effects an exercise intervention has on gut microbiota and how these effects relate to CRC progression and patient-reported outcomes.",

Patients also undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and week 8.\n\nARM B: Patients receive health-related information for 8 weeks on study. Patients are then offered a session of supervised exercise followed by 7 weeks of tele-coaching sessions. Patients also undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and week 8."
