The goal of this trial to establish the safety profile of this light therapy while generating data on its impact on fatigue, as well as its mechanism of action. Fatigue is often a complex symptom in multiple sclerosis, without any FDA-approved direct therapy. Fatigue is traditionally treated with symptom management through a multidisciplinary team.",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be an open label, single arm, single center, phase 1 research study designed to determinate the safety and mechanism of action of targeted light therapy as a treatment for fatigue in people with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS).\n\nParticipants will undergo a 2-week screening that includes an at home sleep monitor, saliva collection, and completion of surveys. Once screening is complete, participants will complete a light therapy program that will require visits to UT Southwestern Medical Center each day for 3 days, and then every 2-3 weeks for three visits, for a total of 7 visits. Each visit will take about 3 hours. Participants will also be asked to collect saliva, wear the home sleep monitor, and complete surveys. The total study duration is about 2.5 months.\n\nThe risks of this study include the possibility of eye irritation during the light therapy, and loss of confidentiality.\n\nThe primary outcome will be the treatment emergent adverse events. There is a number of exploratory efficacy and mechanism of action outcomes for future study design."
