The hypothesis of this study is that recombinant human CYT107 can be safely administered after AHCT and will promote quantitative and qualitative T cell reconstitution, which will be associated with enhanced tumor cell clearance and reduced infectious complications. Patients will be randomized to either the intervention arm that will receive CYT107 + standard of care melphalan and AHCT or to the control arm that will receive standard of care melphalan and AHCT only."

Patients with autoimmune disorders adequately controlled with medication (5 mg prednisone equivalent or less) are allowed.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
