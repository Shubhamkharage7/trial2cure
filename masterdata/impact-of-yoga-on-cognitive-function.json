While yoga has proven effective in promoting cognitive health in older adults through its gentle movements, controlled breathing, and meditation, its effects on patients with heart failure remain unknown. Therefore, this feasibility and pilot study plans to deliver a 12-week yoga intervention and test its effects on cognitive function in patients with heart failure and mild cognitive impairment.",
            "detailedDescription": "A prospective, 2-arm comparative feasibility design will be used. The investigators will enroll 24 patients with a confirmed heart failure diagnosis with mild cognitive impairment. Patients will be randomized equally into yoga intervention or control group. Patients in the yoga intervention group will receive a 60-minute yoga session twice per week for 12-week. Survey, cognitive function data, MRI scans, and blood samples will be collected at baseline and at 3 months (after completion of yoga intervention)."
