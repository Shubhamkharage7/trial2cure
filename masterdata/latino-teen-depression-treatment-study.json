The purpose of this study is to identify a stakeholder-preferred implementation strategy that may improve psychotherapy attendance among Latino adolescents. Latino adolescent-parent dyads and healthcare providers will be recruited from healthcare settings and social media. Focus groups will be conducted with healthcare providers (n=5), and individual interviews will be conducted with Latino adolescents with a diagnosis of depression (n=15) and their parents (n=15)."
