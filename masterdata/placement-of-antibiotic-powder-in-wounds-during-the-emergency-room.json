The current routine treatment for these injuries includes the use of systemic IV antibiotics. However, open fracture injuries often have compromised blood supply, reducing the amount of antibiotic that reaches the target tissue while increasing risk of injury to non-target organs. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of early application of a topical vancomycin antibiotic powder on open fracture wounds, in combination with the usual treatment, in reducing the risk of infection seen in these injuries."
