Participants will also receive nutrition education using the Brighter Bites app which includes recipes for a variety of meal types or produce types, all of which are searchable. Recipes include the average cost to prepare, the number of servings, and the calories for the recipe. The Brighter Bites app also includes healthy living \"Brighter Choices\" suggestions such as tips for how to store different types of foods, gardening tips, and tips to pack a healthy lunchbox.
