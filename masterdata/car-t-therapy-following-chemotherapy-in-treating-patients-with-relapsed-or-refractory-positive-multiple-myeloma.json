            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CS1-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy after chemotherapy in treating patients who have CS1 positive multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Immune cells can be engineered to kill multiple myeloma cells by inserting a piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the immune cells using a lentiviral vector such as CS1, that allows them to recognize multiple myeloma cells. These engineered immune cells, CS1-CAR T cells, may kill multiple myeloma cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) delivered autologous CS1-CAR T cells for research participants with CS1+ recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the response rates at days 28, 100, and 180 post CAR T cell infusion.\n\nII. Measure the persistence of CS1-CAR T cells in blood and marrow. III. Measure phenotype and anti-tumor functionality of CS1-CAR T cells in marrow and blood.\n\nIV. Measure the levels of cytokines in blood and marrow, and soluble CS-1 in blood post infusion as a surrogate indicator of CAR T cell activity.\n\nV. Evaluate CS-1 expression on MM cancer cells before, during and at progressive disease (PD) to determine antigenic loss.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Describe the percentage of MM cells that express CS-1 surface marker before, during and at PD.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CS1-CAR T cells.\n\nPatients undergo leukapheresis over 2-4 hours. Beginning 3-4 weeks, patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and/or -3 or fludarabine IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3. Patients then undergo CS1-CAR T therapy over 10-15 minutes on day 0.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 day, at least every 2 days for up to a minimum of 14 days, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, then periodically for up to 15 years."

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n* Participants with toxicities from prior therapies, with the exception of peripheral neuropathy attributable to bortezomib, that have not recovered to grade =\\< 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 criteria or to the subject's prior baseline.\n* Participants with known active hepatitis B or C infection; research participants who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive based on testing performed within 4 weeks of enrollment; research participants with any signs or symptoms of active infection, positive blood cultures or radiological evidence of infections.\n* Participants with active auto-immune disease, including connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease or have a history of severe (as judged by the principal investigator) autoimmune disease that will require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.\n* Have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, unstable angina, or a history of recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction.\n* Participants with a history or presence of clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) pathology such as uncontrolled seizure disorder, stroke, severe brain injuries, dementia, cerebellar disease or psychosis.\n* Participants with known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy. Subjects with prior CNS disease that has been effectively treated will be eligible if treatment was completed at least 3 months prior to enrollment with no evidence of symptomatic disease and stable abnormalities on repeat imaging.\n* Participants with plasma cell leukemia (PCL) or symptomatic amyloidosis. However, participants with a prior history of PCL are not excluded.\n* Participants with any known contraindications to leukapheresis, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, cetuximab or tocilizumab.\n* Dependence on corticosteroids.\n\n  * Defined as doses of corticosteroids of greater than or equal to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids.\n  * Note: Topical and inhaled corticosteroids in standard doses and physiologic replacement for subjects with adrenal insufficiency are allowed.\n* Participants with inadequate venous access for leukapheresis, and who are either unable to or unwilling to have a supportive line (temporary or other) placed for the procedure.\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* Prospective subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).",
