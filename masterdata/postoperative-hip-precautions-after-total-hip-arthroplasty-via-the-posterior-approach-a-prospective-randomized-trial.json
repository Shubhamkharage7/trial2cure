The impact of hip precautions on a patient's return to activities of daily living and overall patient satisfaction will also be investigated. The overall cost effectiveness of hip precautions will be determined.",

Precautions are instructions that limit the functional use of the hip and are given for the first six weeks after surgery, with the goal of preventing an instability event resulting in dislocation. The hip precautions that will be investigated in this study are: no hip flexion past 90\u00ba, no crossing the legs, and no twisting at the waist."
