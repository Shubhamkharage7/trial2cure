Key Procedures: Tumor biopsy, surgical resection, blood draws, and stool collection.\n\nStatistical Analysis: The primary efficacy endpoint is the achievement of immune response, defined as activation of one or more of the following markers: HLA-DR, CD38, CD25, KI67, and CD69; activation is defined as an increase of 20% or more over baseline in percentage of cells expressing the marker. With 25 patients, a 95% exact confidence interval around the immune response rate will be no more than 0.46 units wide."
