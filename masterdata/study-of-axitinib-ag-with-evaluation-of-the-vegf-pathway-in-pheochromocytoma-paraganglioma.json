            "detailedDescription": "The long-term survival for malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL) may be limited because of its hormonal effects as well as its aggressive behavior and dissemination, particularly in some hereditary PHEO/PGL. Although several therapeutic modalities have been used to palliate malignant PHEO/PGL, a continued search for new agents to address the malignancy is needed to improve outcomes. One approach is to utilize drugs that target signaling pathways leading to decreased proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Some data in the literature suggests that in malignant PHEO/PGL, VEGF seems to play a role in the biology of the cancer and thus, its inhibition could reduce tumor growth. Sunitinib and imatinib has been used in a limited number of malignant pheochromocytomas with varying responses. Axitinib was designed to inhibit VEGFR that participates in tumor angiogenesis. In order to determine the activity of axitinib in tumor and hormonal responses in malignant PHEO/PGL, it will be used as a single agent in this study. The combination of cyclophosphamide; vincristine and dacarbazine have been shown to produce partial responses in malignant PHEO/PGL. The majority of the patients may have already received this combination or will receive this combination chemotherapy in the future. The goal is to develop multiple lines of effective treatments for this disease."

Core biopsies or FNA will not require any waiting period\n* Last radiotherapy treatment \u2265 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with this protocol and there must be sites of measurable disease that did not receive radiation\n* Prior therapeutic MIBG is allowed\n* Organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal), unless the patient meets the criteria for Gilbert's Syndrome. The upper limit value for bilirubin for subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome is less than 3 mg/dl.\n\n  o Note: A diagnosis of Gilbert's disease will be made in the presence of (1) unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia noted on several occasions; (2) normal results from CBC count, reticulocyte count, and blood smear; (3) normal liver function test results; and (4) an absence of other disease processes that can explain the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n* AST \u2264 2.5 x ULN, ALT \u2264 2.5 x ULN\n* Amylase and lipase equal to, or less than, the institutional ULN.\n* Creatinine clearance \u2265 40 ml/min (estimated or measured creatinine clearance) or serum creatinine \u2264 1.6 mg/dl\n\n  o Random urine protein \\< 20 mg/dL.

Low-dose anticoagulants for maintenance of patency of central venous access devices or prevention of deep venous thrombosis is allowed. Therapeutic use of low molecular weight heparin is allowed.\n* Active seizure disorder or evidence of brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Any of the following within 12 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial infarction, uncontrolled angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack and within 6 months before study drug administration for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.",
