            "briefSummary": "This is a single-center, pilot study of up to 25 subjects with residual upper extremity deficits at least six months after an ischemic stroke. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the initial clinical safety, device functionality, and treatment effect of non-invasive electrical stimulation of the trigeminal and/or vagus nerves (nTVNS) using the NeuraStasis Stimulator System adjunctive to rehabilitation. Subjects will either receive the intervention or control-sham stimulation. The study will inform the design and implementation of a pivotal study.",
            "detailedDescription": "This pilot study will proceed in two phases: Phase I, an unblinded blinded stage and Phase II, a blinded stage comparing intervention and sham groups.\n\nPhase I will consist of 5 subjects, unblinded, receiving nTVNS. This phase will test the usability of the device and de-risk the use of nTVNS during rehabilitation. Visits will include consent and baseline evaluation followed by 6 weeks of treatment consisting of the standard of care with nTVNS. Rehabilitation and treatment will occur at a cadence of 3 sessions per week. Primary endpoints will be collected after 6 weeks.\n\nPhase II will consist of a Prospective Randomized Open, Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) design. Subjects will be randomized to an intervention nTVNS group or a control sham stimulation group. The control sham stimulation consists of standard-of-care rehabilitation with only a minimal amount of nTVNS delivered at the start of each session during a tolerability assessment intended to support further blinding for therapists and subjects. The same evaluations, sessions, and endpoints will occur as those in Phase I."
