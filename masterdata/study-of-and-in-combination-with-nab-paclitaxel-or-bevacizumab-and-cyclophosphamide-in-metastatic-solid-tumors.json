Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.\n* Currently receiving an investigational drug in a clinical trial or participating in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. If a patient is currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving non-approved use of a therapeutic device for cancer control, then agreement with the investigator and the sponsor (MD Anderson IND Office) is required to establish eligibility.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine, measles, mumps, rabies, rubella, typhoid vaccine, varicella/zoster, and yellow fever. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. COVID19 vaccines including killed virus are allowed.\n* Caution should be exercised when administering nab-paclitaxel concomitantly with known substrates or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/drug-development-and-drug-interactions-table-substrates-inhibitors-and-inducers).\n* Symptomatic primary tumors or metastasis in the brain and/or central nervous system that are uncontrolled with antiepileptics and/or require steroids at a dose of prednisone \\> 10 mg/day or equivalent.\n* Evidence of leptomeningeal or lymphangitic carcinomatosis.\n* A history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically significant, requiring active intervention except for hormone therapy.\n* Lactation or pregnancy.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus requiring HAART treatment due to unknown drug-drug interactions or has known active hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or C virus (e.g., HCV RNA \\[quantitative\\] is detected) infection: patients who have had active HBV or HCV infections in the past but have evidence of viral clearance as shown by negative viral load, i.e., undetectable HBV DNA or HCV RNA, will be eligible.\n* Concurrent immunosuppressive therapy or steroid (\\> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent).\n* History of autoimmune disease including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis, which requires systemic therapy in the past 2 years.\n\n  * Note: Patients with vitiligo, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, hypothyroidism on stable hormone replacement, controlled asthma, Type I diabetes, Graves' disease, or Hashimoto's disease, are not excluded.\n* History of grade \u2265 3 immune-related adverse events with previous immunotherapy. Note: Patients with adequately treated skin rash other than Steven-Johnson, toxic epidermal necrolysis of other severe forms of dermatitis; or replacement therapy for endocrinopathies, are not excluded.\n* History of interstitial lung disease or (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.\n* History of grade \u2265 3 allergic reaction to treatment with a monoclonal antibody.\n* Patients with Urinary Outflow Obstruction (apply to cyclophosphamide-based regimens only).",
