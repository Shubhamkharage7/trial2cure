The main questions the study seeks to answer are: 1) what is the feasibility of the recruitment method, research design, interventionist training methods, and delivery of the intervention; 2) does the intervention, relative to control, at the 2- and 4-month follow-up period, produce reductions in the quantity and frequency of alcohol use, sexual victimization, and psychological distress (anxiety, depression). Follow-up assessments are completed at 2- and 4-months following program completion. The intervention is compared to a wait list control group."
