The investigators hypothesize that there will be a significant difference between the PhytoSERM group and placebo group in glucose brain metabolism.",

PhytoSERM or placebo pills will be administered orally once a week over 24 weeks. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed over the duration of the study.\n\nTo determine eligibility, all participants will undergo cognitive assessment, physical and neurological examination, imaging scans, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical/safety laboratory assessment, and interviews. After a 2-4-week screening period, participants will be randomized to study intervention (PhytoSERM 50mg administered orally, once per day) or matching placebo, in a 1:1 allocation. Brain imaging to evaluate the primary endpoint (standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) by FDG-PET) will be conducted at screening and 24 weeks (6 months). Study participants will be asked to complete a total of 7 study visits. All participants will be enrolled at a single site, at the Alzheimer's Prevention Program (APP) at Weill Cornell Medical Centre (WCMC, New York).\n\nThis study protocol will include an embedded single-dose, 24-hour pharmacokinetic (PK) study in a subset of 12 participants which will begin after the first dose of the study intervention."
