The POCUS protocol described here is the standard of care for patients who present in acute respiratory failure to the Emergency Room and both groups will receive this standardized care during the study.\n\nUpon hospital discharge, the final discharge diagnosis will be used as the ground truth for assessing the accuracy of the POCUS protocol. The POCUS exam and the EkoAI exam may be performed wherever the subject is located in the hospital when first enrolled in the study. If possible, both exams should be performed immediately, in either order. They will be performed by the same examiner.\n\nBoth the POCUS and the EkoAI exam will be analysed by an investigator blinded to the final diagnosis."
