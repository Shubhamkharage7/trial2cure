            "briefSummary": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has devastating health consequences. Evidence-based PTSD interventions address the substantial burden of PTSD on the health of individuals and societies; however, several individuals receiving these interventions drop out and not all individuals experience improvement in PTSD symptoms. Moreover, these current PTSD interventions primarily target trauma memories. Notably, growing evidence suggests that PTSD symptoms are related to difficulties in the encoding and retrieving of positive memories as well.\n\nThus, the proposed study will examine effects of and targets underlying a novel PTSD technique focused on narrating and detailing positive memories - Processing of Positive Memories Technique (PPMT). Methodologically, 70 individuals will be randomly assigned to PPMT vs. Supportive Counseling (SC) for this study.\n\nThe aims of the proposed study include (1) examining PPMT's effects on PTSD symptom severity and stress systems' dysregulation (i.e., awakening salivary alpha amylase \\[sAA\\] and cortisol); (2) examining mechanisms underlying PPMT's effects; and (3) refining PPMT. It is hypothesized that the PPMT arm will report greater decreases in PTSD severity and sAA/cortisol ratios. Further, it is hypothesized that PPMT-related improved affect will mediate the association between study arm (PPMT vs. SC) and changes in PTSD severity. Lastly, feedback will be obtained from study participants on PPMT's feasibility, format, and content to refine PPMT.\n\nThe proposed study may contribute preliminary evidence on the potential significance of targeting positive memories in PTSD interventions."
