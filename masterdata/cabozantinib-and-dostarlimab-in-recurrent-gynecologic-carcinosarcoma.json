            "briefSummary": "Immunotherapy has gained a significant amount of attention recently, but its efficacy as a single agent in gynecological cancers has been disappointing. Pre-clinical evidence supports the combination of using Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGF) inhibitors with immunotherapy. VEGF inhibitors suppress the activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and VEGF has been shown to affect the functional maturation of dendritic cells; therefore, VEGF inhibitors could improve the function of antigen presentation. In this study, Cabozantinib (VEGF inhibitor) and Dostarlimab (immunotherapeutic drug) will be admnistered as a combination to patients with recurrent gynecologic carcinosarcoma."

Inability to swallow tablets.\n12. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulations.\n13. Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment, except for superficial skin cancers, or localized, low-grade tumors deemed cured and not treated with systemic therapy.\n14.

Patients with a serious chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.\n16. Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the protocol should be excluded.\n17. Presence of a known active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection, HIV or viral hepatitis; however, it is acceptable to treat an acute infection and then re-screen or re-evaluate eligibility.\n18. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment\n19. Other clinically significant disorders:\n\n    1. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.\n    2.
