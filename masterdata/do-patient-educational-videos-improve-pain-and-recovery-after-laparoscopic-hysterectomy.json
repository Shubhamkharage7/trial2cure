However, it is unknown what type of audio and/or visual materials work best in a given clinical setting. By surveying overall pain/post-operative recovery satisfaction we can measure how well our video intervention educates and reinforces post-operative management at home when compared to the current method of education that patients receive at the pre-operative visit prior to laparoscopic hysterectomy at this institution."
