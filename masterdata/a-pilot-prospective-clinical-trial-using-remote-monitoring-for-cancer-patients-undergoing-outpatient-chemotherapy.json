Early detection of things such as fever or increased heart rate can alert patients to seek medical attention sooner and therefore have the potential to improve patient outcomes and decrease healthcare costs.\n\nTo further investigate the feasibility of using remote patient monitoring ( RPM)to prospectively monitor patients undergoing outpatient chemotherapy for chemotherapy related toxicities, defined as follows: (1) patients answer queries through the Locus Health iPhone app at least 70% of the time; (2) patients report that the Locus Health iPhone app and the Apple Watch were 'easy to use,' defined as an average score of 7 or higher on the first two questions of the post-intervention questionnaire, and (3) fewer than 10% of patients withdraw from the study."
