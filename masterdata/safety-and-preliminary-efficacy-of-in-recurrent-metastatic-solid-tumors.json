            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate OBT076, which is a drug that combines an antibody with an anti-cancer drug. This class of drugs are called Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADC). Antibodies are normally produced in the human body by the immune system to fight infections but can be designed to target cancer cells and deliver an anti-cancer drug. OBT076 is composed of an antibody that targets the CD205 protein on cancer cells and delivers an anti-cancer drug which can kill them. OBT076 is an \"Investigational Drug\", which means that it is still being studied and has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or any other regulatory authorities to be prescribed by doctors for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. The use of OBT076 in this study is investigational.\n\nThis is a Phase I research study designed to look at several dose levels of the study drug to find the highest dose level that is safe and well-tolerated (does not cause unacceptable side effects), and to examine the effects of the study drug in a small group of research participants. The study will also look at the effectiveness of OBT076 as an anti-cancer therapy. Once the optimal dose is determined and safety is assessed, additional research participants will be treated at the optimal dose level to further evaluate safety and effectiveness.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study OBT076-001 is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation and expansion clinical study of OBT076 in CD205+ve recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard treatments, or for which a standard therapy is not available or not suitable or is no longer effective. The study will consist of four parts:\n\n* Part A: Dose escalation\n* Part B: OBT076 single agent expansion\n* Part C: Sequential administration of OBT076 and balstilimab\n* Part D: Combination therapy with concurrent administration of OBT076 and balstilimab\n\nParts A, B, C and D will consist mainly of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up periods. The treatment period with OBT076 consists of 21 days cycles. Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled across Parts A to D."
