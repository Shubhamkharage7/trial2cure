            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare Moses 2.0 pulse modulation technology and the standard high powered Holmium Laser lithotripsy and how it will affect time in the operating room, time using the laser, laser energy, and stone free rates.\n\nCurrently Moses 2.0 laser technology is FDA approved and currently used in practice since 2021. No study to this date has compared Moses 2.0 without pulse modulation laser technology to Moses 2.0 with pulse modulation laser technology.\n\nThe study will be including kidney and ureteral stones (a kidney stone located in the tube between the kidney and the bladder) that are 6mm and greater, but less than 20 mm in size undergoing ureteroscopic treatment. High powered lasers are used for \"dusting\". Dusting is when a laser is used to break a stone down into tiny fragments that are able to pass through the urine.",
            "detailedDescription": "On the day of surgery, the treatment assigned to the patient will be determined by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the patient nor the study doctor will choose the treatment type. Each patient will have an equal chance of being given either surgical treatment. One group will have stones treated with high powered laser dusting with Moses 2.0 pulse modulation and the dust produced will pass spontaneously through the urine. The other group will have stones treated with standard of care high power laser fragmentation and the dust produced will pass spontaneously through the urine. The surgical procedure will not differ from the treatment a patient would receive if he/she were not in this study.\n\n8 to 12 weeks after surgery, participants will undergo a standard of care renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS) and Kidney Ureter Bladder Abdominal X-ray (KUB) to evaluate for stones and hydronephrosis, which is swelling of the kidney due to build-up of urine.\n\nIf there are abnormal findings on the RBUS or KUM at the 8 to 12 week follow-up, participants will be asked to return to the urology clinic and may have to repeat imaging to ensure participants did not develop a postoperative condition."
