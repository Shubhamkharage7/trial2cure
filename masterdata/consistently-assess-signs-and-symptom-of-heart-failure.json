The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification by a HF provider helps to guide their decisions in patient treatment. The purpose of this study is to further examine the NYHA Classification Guide that is designed to assist healthcare providers. The investigators will conduct the study in the outpatient clinic setting where adult patients with chronic heart failure are treated. HF providers will be asked to complete the NYHA classification Guide and then participants will complete a standardized 6-minute walk test which is considered as the gold standard. Participant results will be compared between providers' assigned class and the results from the 6-minute walk test. The subsequent phase of the study will be incorporation of the NYHA Classification Guide into clinical practice. HF providers will use the NYHA Classification Guide for 30 days in the clinic setting and will report their perceptions.",

The investigators will conduct a prospective cross-sectional study in the ambulatory care settings that manages adult patients with chronic heart failure (both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \\[HFrEF\\] and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction \\[HFpEF\\]). HF providers will be asked to complete the NYHA classification Guide and assign one of 4 functional classes: Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class IV. Participants will then complete a standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWT), considered as the gold standard. Participant results will be compared between providers' assigned class and the results from the 6-minute walk test. The subsequent phase of the study will be incorporation of the NYHA Classification Guide into clinical practice. Clinicians will utilize the NYHA Classification Guide for 30 days and will report perceived barriers and facilitators. Data reporting NYHA Class and HF Stage will be obtained from 30 days prior implementation and compared to during implementation."
