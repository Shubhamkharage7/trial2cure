            "detailedDescription": "Participants in the proposed study will be current clinical participants in the SET program within Fairview. Participants will have a diagnosis of PAD and be \u226540 years of age (participants are diagnosed before they are referred to the SET program). Rate limiting comorbidities not associated with vascular disease (e.g., severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) will be exclusionary (for example). Age, sex, race, ethnicity, educational status, and smoking status at baseline will be recorded from cardiac rehabilitation intake forms. Eligible participants will be identified by study staff reviewing electronic medical records of patients who are enrolling into the SET program. University of Minnesota staff will travel to the urban and rural clinical rehabilitation sites to obtain informed consent at the participants first SET visit. They will then provide participants instructions and training for how to use the smartphone and app."
