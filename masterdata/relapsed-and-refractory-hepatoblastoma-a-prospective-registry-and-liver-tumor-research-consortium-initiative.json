This project provides the infrastructure for acquisition of biological specimens, imaging, and correlative clinical data to facilitate biology studies and characterization of rrHBL. This registry will collect clinical, demographic, and pathological data, specimens (as available) and imaging from patients with rrHBL, prospectively. Cases are identified through:\n\n1. Existing clinical and/or cancer registry databases\n2. Referrals from clinicians, surgeons, or pathologists\n3. Families initiating contact with Registry staff directly",
            "detailedDescription": "The following data/materials will be collected:\n\nClinical Data: Demographic data, date of diagnosis, pathology, radiological imaging data, signs and symptoms at diagnosis, molecular and biological data, staging details including sites of disease, detailed treatment data (e.g. types and dates of surgeries/interventional therapy (if any), medical/systemic therapy, radiotherapy), response to treatment (imaging and tumor markers), dates of progression, types of progression (local or metastatic), and follow-up data. The demographic and clinical data collected are abstracted and entered into an electronic data system secured by password protection. Collection of existing molecular and/or genomic data or analysis that has been performed will also be included.\n\nResearch Specimens:\n\nTissue (fresh/frozen/FFPE) from diagnosis and all subsequent timepoints where tissue was acquired (for example at each relapse and/or progression) will be requested for all enrolled patients and sent for central review to the study pathologist and stored in the rrHBL biorepository within the Cancer and Blood Disease Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Future research testing may be conducted on this tissue.\n\nOptional research specimens:\n\nPending consent specification of family/patient, and resources, specimens may be sent directly to collaborating laboratories to proceed with tumor modeling and drug testing, or other translational research with PI or designee via an Institutional Review Board approved project.\n\n* Tumor Modeling, Drug Testing, or Other Applicable Cancer-Related Research (Fresh, frozen,): Prospectively collected or retained left-over tumor tissue samples and normal tissue (background liver) as available, for research purposes.\n* Blood: prospectively collected at time of enrollment and at time of subsequent relapse\n* Urine: prospectively collected at time of enrollment and at time of subsequent relapse\n* Saliva: prospectively collected at time of enrollment or at one time point after enrollment\n\nRegistry clinical data will be correlated with biological/bioinformatic and genomic data. Data stored in the Registry may be used to provide statistical data for scientific presentations and for preparation of peer- reviewed manuscripts."
