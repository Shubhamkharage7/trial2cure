            "briefSummary": "This study will assess safety and feasibility of infusing genetically modified autologous T cells transduced to express a chimeric antigen receptor targeting the B cell surface antigen Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, pilot, phase 1 study to determine the safety profile of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell infusion in participants with R/R B-cell NHL. The dose-finding cohorts in this study will evaluate and define the safe dose of anti-CD19 Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) cells. Using a \"3+3\" design, participants will be enrolled sequentially to each dose level. A dose expansion will then occur at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose levels that have not exceeded the MTD.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES\n\n1. To evaluate the safety of administering chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD-19 to patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL).\n2. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for this cellular therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n\n1. To assess the safety and toxicity of cell collection and infusion of CAR-T cells targeting CD19 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell NHL.\n2. To describe the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD-19 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell NHL.\n3. To evaluate the feasibility of CD19 CAR T cell manufacturing for patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell NHL of local manufacturing and ability to produce adequate quantities of vector positive T-cells.\n\nOUTLINE\n\nEligible participants will undergo apheresis with collection of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells that will be used to generate CAR-T cells. The CAR T cells will be produced using the Miltenyi Prodigy, and an FDA compliant Lentigen Technology, Inc., CD19 targeted lentiviral vector. After successful generation of the anti-CD19 CAR-T cells (drug product (DP)), subjects will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by 2-5 days of rest. A single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at the starting dose of 5 x 105 cells/kg will be given on Day=0. Following treatment with DP, subjects will be followed on this study for 12 months for safety, disease status, and survival. For long term follow-up, participants will be followed for 15 years.\n\nFor participants whose dose does not meet the target dose, enrollment into a conforming product low-dose cohort, at minimum dose level - 1 and that has not exceeded the MTD will occur. This conforming product low-dose cohort will be evaluated for toxicity and efficacy of those lower dose levels as part of the primary safety and secondary objectives.\n\nFor participants whose CAR-T product does not meet the pre-specified release criteria, enrollment into a non-conforming product cohort, at a minimum dose level - 1 and that has not exceeded the MTD will occur. This non-conforming product cohort will be evaluated for toxicity and efficacy of the non-conforming product cohort as part of the exploratory objectives"

Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to enrollment. (PCR positive patients will be excluded.)\n6. Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because CAR-T cell therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CAR-T cells, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. NOTE: Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test.\n8. Patients with history of clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) pathology such as epilepsy, seizure disorders, paresis, aphasia, uncontrolled cerebrovascular disease, severe brain injuries, dementia and Parkinson's disease.\n9. History of autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) with requirement of immunosuppressive medication within 6 months.\n10. Body weight \\<40 kilograms(kg)\n\nEligibility for Infusion of Investigational Product:\n\nSubjects will undergo an evaluation of eligibility on day 1 prior to infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell product. This eligibility criterion will include the inclusion and exclusion criteria required for enrollment with the following exceptions and additions:\n\n1. No significant laboratory abnormalities. Laboratory result abnormalities that are considered not clinically significant by the principal investigator AND are not the result of a demonstrated active infection or an active central nervous system condition.\n2. ECOG performance status \\< 2\n3. No evidence of uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, inflammatory response, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities or psychiatric illness/social situations.\n4. No new neurologic symptoms suggestive of an active central nervous system condition, or uncontrolled CNS involvement by lymphoma.\n5. No corticosteroid use within 7 days prior to infusion (with exception of agents used for prevention of emesis during lymphodepletive chemotherapy).",
