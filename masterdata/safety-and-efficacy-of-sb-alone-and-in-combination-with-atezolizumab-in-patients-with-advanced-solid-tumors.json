            "detailedDescription": "Part 1a of the study will assess the safety and tolerability of SB 11285 as monotherapy in eligible patients with advanced solid tumors. Part 1b will assess the safety and tolerability of SB 11285 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. RP2D decisions will be based on the totality of data, including DLTs, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy, as available. Part 2 will further evaluate the combination RP2D of SB 11285 and atezolizumab in selected tumor types. Both Parts 1a and 1b of the study will use a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design with the dose escalated in successive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each within each cohort in an open-label fashion. In Part 1a Monotherapy Dose Escalation, patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive IV SB 11285 as monotherapy weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles in escalating doses. Once Dose Level 2 of Part 1a monotherapy have been evaluated by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) and have been declared to be safe to dose escalate to Dose Level 3, Dose Level 1 of Part 1b Combination Dose Escalation (SB 11285 combination with atezolizumab) will be opened for enrollment. After determination of MTD and RP2D in SB 11285 plus atezolizumab combination the Part 2 with Expansion Cohorts will commence to further evaluate the RP2D."

Prior radiation therapy: permissible if at least 1 non-irradiated measurable lesion is available for assessment according to RECIST version 1.1 or if a solitary measurable lesion was irradiated, objective progression is documented. A wash out of at least 28 days before start of study treatment for radiation of any intended use to the extremities for bone metastases and 28 days for radiation to the chest, brain, or visceral organs is required. Palliative radiation is permissible at any time before or during the study.\n16.
