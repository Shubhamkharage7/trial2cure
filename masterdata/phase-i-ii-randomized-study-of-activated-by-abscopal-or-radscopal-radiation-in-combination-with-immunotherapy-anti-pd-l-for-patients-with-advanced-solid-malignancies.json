            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and possible benefits of NBTXR3, radiation therapy, Anti PD-1 / PD-L1 in treating patients with solid tumor that has spread to the lung (lung metastases) and/or liver (liver metastases). NBTXR3 may help make tumor cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with Anti PD-1 / PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving NBTXR3, radiation therapy, Anti PD-1 / PD-L1 may help to control the disease.",

Except anti-PD-1/L1, which will not require a washout window.\n   2. A reduced washout window may be considered for therapies with short half-lives (i.e., kinase inhibitors) after discussion with Nanobiotix and investigator.\n6. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).\n\n   a. Replacement therapy (i.e., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement \\[\u2264 10 mg prednisone\\] therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n7. Any live-virus vaccine used for prevention of infectious diseases administered within 4 weeks prior to NBTXR3 injection.\n\n   1. Except killed-virus Influenza vaccine\n   2.
