Patients enrolled to the experimental arm will be assessed for clinical outcomes such as progression free survival (PFS), local control, distant control, and toxicity. The first 6 patients randomized to the experimental arm will be considered the safety lead-in and will be assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The 6 patients randomized to the control arm will be evaluated for correlatives but will not be included in the analysis for primary and secondary endpoints."

Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first study treatment. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* Known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.\n* Has a known history of active TB (bacillus tuberculosis).\n* Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first study treatment.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
