However, at the discretion of the PI, subjects may not be required to return monthly. These subjects may return at intervals ranging from 2 months to a max of 6 months apart.\n\nIn the situation that the subjects would fall out of the inclusion criteria or not be eligible for the LGMD2E gene therapy trial, they will be given the opportunity to roll over into the Natural History for LGMD (IRB17-01086). If a subject is invited to screen for the gene therapy trial they will discontinue this trial. By being in this study, it is not a guarantee that subjects will be invited to screen for the LGMD2E gene therapy trial."
