A total of 40 patients who have had or will require surgery to remove cancer cells prior to starting chemoradiation may be enrolled. All eligible patients will receive de-intensified cisplatin-based chemoradiation, with high-risk patients receiving a higher dose and longer treatment period than other patients on the study. The study will assess whether a de-intensified version of standard chemoradiation treatment will be just as effective in treating HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer while causing less side effects than standard dosing.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm phase II study that will enroll patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, undergoing resection through trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) of all gross visible disease at the primary site and in the lymph nodes. A total of 36 patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and its affiliates (Tower Hematology-Oncology, Torrance Memorial Physician Network) who have had or will require surgery to remove cancer cells prior to starting chemoradiation may be enrolled. All eligible patients will receive de-intensified cisplatin-based chemoradiation, with high-risk patients receiving a higher dose and longer treatment period than other patients on the study. The treatment period will last 3 to 5 weeks depending on whether the patient is considered high-risk or not. The study will assess whether a de-intensified version of standard chemoradiation treatment will be just as effective in treating HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer while causing less side effects than standard dosing."
