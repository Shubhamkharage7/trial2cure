The target population for this study are critically-ill patients over the age of 18 who as part of their routine clinical care are receiving a focused TEE.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the clinical impact and safety of TEE performed during the evaluation of critically-ill patients in the emergency department and intensive care settings.\n\nThe secondary objective(s) of this study are to characterize the use of this imaging modality in the subsets of critically-ill patients in shock and cardiac arrest; including but not limited to; description of the frequency of studies, clinical indications, clinician characteristics, echocardiography findings, timing of studies, procedure-related complications and patient outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Vision\n\nThe Resuscitative TEE Collaborative Registry aims to accelerate the development of outcome-oriented research and knowledge translation on the use of TEE in emergency and critical care settings.\n\nMission\n\nThe registry aims to catalyze clinical research involving the use of TEE in critically-ill patients through the following strategic initiatives:\n\n* Facilitate collaboration between different clinical teams and organizations across the entire spectrum of users of TEE in acute care setting, including emergency departments and intensive care units.\n* Standardize data collection and reporting that enables multi-institutional data sharing.\n* Provide an efficient research infrastructure that facilitates data capture, management and analysis, enabling teams around the world to conduct research studies in this field.\n* Make shared data open and accessible to clinicians and researchers."
