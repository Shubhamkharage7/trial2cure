Identifying key intersectional groups across demographic (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, and age), PSU factors (e.g., drug types and routes of administration), and socio-behavioral (e.g., mental health history, justice history, and homelessness) characteristics will inform targeted service delivery. Aim 2 will use epidemiological methods to estimate the association of OPC use with mental health services salient to PSU populations (e.g., hospitalization for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder). Measuring the association of OPC use with treated mental health outcomes for PSU-involved populations will foster an understanding of the impacts of OPCs on critical but unevaluated outcomes."
