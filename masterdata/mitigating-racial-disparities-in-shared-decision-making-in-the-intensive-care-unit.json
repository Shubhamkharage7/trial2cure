The goal of this intervention is to mitigate racial disparities in shared decision making.",
            "detailedDescription": "The care of critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure involves life-or-death decisions. Ideally, intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians should include patients or their families in shared decision making, which promotes goal-concordant care (i.e., care aligned with patients' preferences), reduces psychological distress for both families and clinicians, and shortens ICU length of stay. However, racial disparities have been documented in shared decision making and associated outcomes. In outpatient settings, clinicians treat Black patients differently from White patients, providing fewer treatment options, less prognostic information, and less emotional support, and making assumptions about rather than eliciting patient preferences. Disparities in shared decision making are likely to be amplified in the ICU because clinicians often do not have long-standing relationships with patients or families, and decisions are complex, emotional, and time-pressured. Yet, no interventions currently exist to address racial disparities in shared decision making about acute respiratory failure. This research will directly fill this gap."
