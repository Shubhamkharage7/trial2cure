            "detailedDescription": "The Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) is an evidence-based intervention to enhance serious illness conversations between physicians and patients with advanced cancer. It consists of the Serious Illness Conversation Guide as well as training and system-level support for clinicians to conduct serious illness conversations. The investigators have previously adapted the SICP to be delivered via telehealth for older adults with myeloid malignancies. In this study, they will conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the preliminary efficacy of a telehealth-delivered Serious Illness Care Program compared to an education control."
