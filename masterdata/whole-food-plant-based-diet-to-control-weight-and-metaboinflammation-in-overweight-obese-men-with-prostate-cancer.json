            "briefSummary": "The study is comparing the effect on weight of providing home-delivered whole-food, plant-based meals versus standard, general nutritional counseling to men with prostate cancer on androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).",
            "detailedDescription": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis for men in the United States. For patients with advanced or recurrent disease, ADT has is the cornerstone of systemic treatment. Overall, almost half of prostate cancer patients will undergo ADT at some point during their treatment. Unfortunately, ADT has metabolic side effects, including weight gain, central adiposity, and insulin resistance. This study is a multi-site randomized phase II trial comparing a home-delivered whole food, plant-based diet (WFPBD) with specialized behavioral coaching to standard dietary intervention with general nutritional counseling to assess the efficacy of a WFPBD in promoting weight loss in overweight/obese men receiving ADT. The home-delivered WFPBD will be for 28 days with 12 meals a week followed by 28 days with 6 meals a week; followed by self-prepared WFPBD for 18 weeks (for a total of 26 weeks).\n\nThe study hypothesis is that a WFPBD will decrease body weight and decrease systemic metabo-inflammation in overweight/obese men (BMI \\> 27) with prostate cancer receiving ADT. Secondary objectives will be to assess the effects of a WFPBD on adiposity, markers of inflammation (hsCRP, IL-6), metabolism (insulin, glucose, leptin, adiponectin), and fecal microbiota that may contribute to prostate cancer progression; to assess the effects of a WFPBD on quality of life; and to assess the durability of any observed effect (weight, adiposity, markers of inflammation and metabolism, fecal microbiota) of the intervention after cessation of the meal-delivery service."

There will be a line for each patient. A different color will be used for each treatment group. The average at each timepoint for each group will be computed. A two-way ANOVA will be used (or Kruskal-Wallis test if more appropriate) will be used to determine whether there are changes in the measures over time as well as between groups. The first analysis will be to determine whether there is a significant interaction between time and treatment. Subsequent analyses will depend on whether the interaction is statistically significant or not. Effect sizes will be summarized with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.",
