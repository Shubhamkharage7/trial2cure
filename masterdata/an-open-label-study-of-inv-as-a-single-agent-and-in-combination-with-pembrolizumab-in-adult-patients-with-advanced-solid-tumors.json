Additionally, up to 9 additional patients may be enrolled to confirm the safety of patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).\n\nPhase 1b: approximately 36-42 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation and de-escalation phases in the combination with pembrolizumab. One or more combination dose levels that could represent the combination RP2D will be expanded to a total of 12-15 patients to confirm safety and tolerability of the combination."
