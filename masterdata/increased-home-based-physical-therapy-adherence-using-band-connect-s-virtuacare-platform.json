            "briefSummary": "This study aims to enhance at-home therapy by introducing a new device called the BAND Connect's VirtuaCare\u2122 platform. The study aims to determine whether patients can improve their adherence to at-home exercises using this device. Currently, research indicates that only 35% of patients undergoing physical therapy treatment fully comply with their prescribed plans of care, often neglecting their at-home exercises. To address this issue, a set of smart exercise tools called VirtuaCare\u2122 has been developed. This platform provides patients with instructions on performing at-home exercises and offers real-time biofeedback to help them adjust their form if necessary. The study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of BAND CVCP in assisting patients and improving their overall success with at-home therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to compare the effectiveness of the BAND CVCP device with the standard physical therapy regimens provided by UC Health Orthopaedic Surgery. Participants undergoing shoulder surgeries performed by Dr. Brian Grawe will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 will utilize the BAND CVCP both in the clinic and at home as a supplement to their treatment protocols. Group 2 will receive standard physical therapy without the BAND CVCP.\n\nIn Group 1, participants will be given access to the BAND CVCP and necessary materials during their first physical therapy appointment. The physical therapist will guide them through exercises using the device, recording their actions and providing real-time feedback. The BAND CVCP app on their provided Android phone will offer instructions for each exercise, eliminating the need to memorize the routine.\n\nDuring clinic visits, Group 1 participants' progress will be reviewed using the BAND CVCP participant report. The report will display information such as completed exercises, form, pace, range of motion, and exertion, which is measured by sensors in the BAND CVCP handles. The therapist will help participants understand any corrections needed for their at-home exercises and make adjustments to their rehabilitation plan accordingly.\n\nBoth Group 1 and Group 2 participants will complete patient report outcomes at different intervals, including pre-operative scores, weekly visual analog scale assessments, and monthly assessments such as the Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) or Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH). Group 1 participants will complete these forms using the BAND CVCP's phone application, while Group 2 participants will use paper copies at the clinic.\n\nAdditional assessments will be conducted at the 3-month, 6-month, and discharge from care visits, which include the ASES, SST, and EQ-5D-5L forms. Group 1 participants will complete these assessments on the BAND CVCP's phone application, while Group 2 participants will use paper copies at the clinic.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the BAND CVCP device compared to standard physical therapy regimens and track participant rehabilitation outcomes throughout the process."
