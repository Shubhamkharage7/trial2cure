            "briefSummary": "This is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in which subjects with the non-fluent/agrammatic and logopenic variants of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA and lvPPA, respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and functional brain imaging before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of real or sham high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) paired with modified constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be repeated immediately after completion of and 3 months following completion of treatment. The 3-month follow-up will be the primary endpoint. The investigators will examine changes in language performance induced by HD-tDCS + mCILT compared to sham HD-tDCS + mCILT. The investigators will also use network science to analyze brain imaging (fMRI) data to identify network properties associated with baseline PPA severity and tDCS-induced changes in performance. This study will combine knowledge gained from our behavioral, imaging, and network data in order to determine the relative degrees to which these properties predict whether persons with PPA will respond to intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "The central framework for the project is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in which subjects with the non-fluent/agrammatic and logopenic variants of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA and lvPPA, respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and functional brain imaging before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of real or sham high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) paired with modified constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be repeated immediately after completion of and 3 months following completion of treatment.\n\nSubjects with naPPA and lvPPA will be randomized to one of two study arms: HD-tDCS+mCILT or sham stimulation+mCILT paired with pre- and post-stimulation imaging and behavioral measures. Equal numbers of subjects with naPPA and lvPPA will be randomized to the HD-tDCS + mCILT and sham + mCILT study arms. The study is double-blinded, in that neither the subject nor the study personnel administering HD-tDCS or sham stimulation will know which arm of the study the subject has been randomized into. Study coordinators will administer HD-tDCS by entering a pre-determined code that has been programmed into the device by another member of the study team. Data will be digitally audio-recorded and analyzed off-line, such that study team members performing data coding and analysis will likewise be blinded to the treatment condition of each subject.\n\nSubject participation in this protocol will occur during 27 planned visits that will span approximately 8 months. The events of the study visits are described below:\n\nVISIT 1:\n\na Informed consent and screening b. Baseline language assessment #1 c. Baseline MRI scanning\n\nVISIT 2:\n\nBaseline language assessment #2\n\nVISITS 3-11:\n\nHD-tDCS+mCILT OR sham stimulation+mCILT, depending on the study arm to which they had been randomized.\n\nVISIT 12:\n\n1.

It is believed to elicit brain effects by producing incremental shifts in the resting membrane potential of large numbers of neurons, which alters neuronal firing rates and thus modulates patterns of brain activity in potentially behaviorally-relevant ways. HD-tDCS differs from conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) because it employed smaller electrodes configured in such a way as to deliver more focal stimulation of the brain.",

Other key elements of CILT include massed practice of goal-directed speech and shaping of desired responses by increasing response demands as participants improve. MCILT differs from traditional constraint-induced language therapy (CILT) in three ways: 1) it will be done as an individual therapy with the examiner in the role of a communication partner; 2) treatment will be delivered in short sessions (1 hour rather than a more typical 3-4 hour session); 3) targeting nouns + semantically related verbs to generate noun + verb phrases in treatment, a modification that may be better suited to addressing syntactic structure.",
