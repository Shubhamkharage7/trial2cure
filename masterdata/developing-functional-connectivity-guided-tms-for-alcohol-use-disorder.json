            "briefSummary": "Alcohol Use Disorders are currently positioned as the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States, constituting a humanitarian crisis with substantial financial burden on society and medical facilities. While several pharmacological interventions exist, 60% of individuals who seek these treatments relapse to alcohol within 6 months. These high relapse rates are due in part to elevated brain response to alcohol cues in the environment. This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of one session of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a strategy to reduce brain reactivity to alcohol cues.",
            "detailedDescription": "At least 60% of those with AUD will experience a major relapse period within 6 months of treatment, irrespective of the intervention (psychosocial and/or pharmacological) employed. Consequently, the high prevalence of AUD and relapse following treatment in Veterans is associated with substantial resource allocation and costs for the VA Health Care System. Current pharmacological and psychosocial interventions demonstrate only a moderate level of efficacy, which is reflected in the high rate of relapse in AUD. Transcanial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a neurostimulation method that is at the forefront of innovative, non-invasive, and safe treatments for AUD, and other psychiatric disorders. To reduce the high rate of relapse in Veterans with AUD, it is necessary for interventions to more effectively address the associated neurobiological dysfunction. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques are showing promise toward the aim of modifying specific and selective neural targets related to AUD and relapse. To date, TMS has been primarily delivered to the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortices as these regions are, on average, highly reactive to alcohol cues. On an individual basis, however, peak brain response to alcohol cues can vary substantially in spatial location within the brain. Retrospective analyses of TMS-AUD clinical trails has demonstrated that when TMS is delivered to an individual's peak brain response to alcohol cues, the likelihood of remaining abstinent is increased by a factor of 5.6 (relative to sham TMS treatment). This study aims to deliver one session of TMS to a cortical target which displays peak functional connectivity to the ventral striatum, a key brain region mediating reward and alcohol cue reactivity. The ultimate goal of this study evaluate change in brain reactivity to alcohol cues following active and sham TMS."
