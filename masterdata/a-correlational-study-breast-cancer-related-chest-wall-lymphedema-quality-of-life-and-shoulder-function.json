Determine if there is a correlation to Delfin Moisture Meter Compact D reading and DASH measure of shoulder function.\n\nIII. Determine how the presence of chest wall lymphedema as determined by physical exam may affect an individual's quality of life as measured by the LymQOL-midline assessment.\n\nIV. Determine how the presence of chest wall lymphedema as determined by physical exam may shoulder function on the effected side, as measured by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients complete questionnaires and undergo chest wall and breast lymphedema measurements by clinical assessment and using the Delfin Moisture Meter D Compact and have their medical records reviewed on study."
