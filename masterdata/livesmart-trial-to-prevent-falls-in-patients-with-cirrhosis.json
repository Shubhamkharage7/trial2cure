After completing stage one, participants will be re-randomized to stage 2 of the project that will last approximately 12 more weeks.\n\nThe study hypothesizes that sequential lactulose/TeleTai-Chi will reduce falls, incident overt HE, death and physical frailty and will improve cognitive function, and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) over 24 weeks compared to other treatment combinations.",

The caregivers that are enrolled are not in the clinical trial. Because all of the outcome measures in the supplemental study are other outcome measures (neither primary nor secondary to the trial) these are not included in this registration."
