Loop diuretics (furosemide) have been given historically during the morcellation portion of HoLEP to promote urine production in the post-operative setting and to minimize the impact of fluid absorption during long periods of morcellation. The intra-operative use of 20mg IV furosemide in perioperative HoLEP pathways has been propagated with the dissemination of HoLEP across North America without evidence to support its routine administration. With increasing surgical efficiency from improvements in laser and morcellator technology, the role of intra-operative furosemide is unknown. This study is designed to assess if there is a significant difference in same day discharge rates after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) with and without IV furosemide. .",

Loop diuretics (furosemide) have been given historically during the morcellation portion of HoLEP to promote urine production in the post-operative setting and to minimize the impact of fluid absorption during long periods of morcellation. The intra-operative use of 20mg IV furosemide in perioperative HoLEP pathways has been propagated with the dissemination of HoLEP across North America without evidence to support its routine administration.\n\nThis single-center randomized controlled trial is designed to assess if there is a significant difference in same day discharge rates after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP). We currently attempt to perform HoLEP as a same-day discharge (SDD) procedure, however one of the main limiting factors in SDD is hematuria. Loop diuretics (furosemide) have been administered at the time of morcellation as a part of our HoLEP pathway to increase post-operative urinary output and reduce clinically significant gross hematuria and clot-formation. The objective of our study will be to assess if SDD rates are non-inferior in those patients who do not receive furosemide diuretics versus those that do.\n\nPatients will be randomized 1:1 to 20mg of IV lasix versus control. Patients and the surgeon/post-operative care team (fellow, residents, and nursing team) will be blinded to the treatment allocation."
