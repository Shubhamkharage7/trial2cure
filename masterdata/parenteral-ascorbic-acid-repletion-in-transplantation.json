Participants randomized to the intervention group will receive intravenous (IV) AA 1500 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Participants randomized to the control group will receive a saline placebo. The primary study outcome will be a change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from baseline to three days after the first dose of drug (dSOFA3). Secondary outcomes will include total vasopressor dose in norepinephrine equivalents, 30-day and 1-year mortality, and serum AA levels.",
            "detailedDescription": "HYPOTHESIS: Administration of supraphysiologic doses of parenteral AA in the perioperative period for patients undergoing liver transplantation will improve Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, vasopressor usage and biochemical, cellular and clinical end-organ damage.\n\nSpecific Aim: Determine the clinical response to parenteral AA supplementation in patients undergoing liver transplantation by a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial.\n\nStudy Design: This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized trial in which 90 participants will be enrolled at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics (UWHC). Participants must meet study eligibility criteria and be scheduled to undergo primary deceased donor solitary liver transplantation. Participants will be randomized to receive 8 doses of 1500 mg AA IV or volume-equivalent placebo every 6 hours for 48 hours, in addition to standard medical management."
