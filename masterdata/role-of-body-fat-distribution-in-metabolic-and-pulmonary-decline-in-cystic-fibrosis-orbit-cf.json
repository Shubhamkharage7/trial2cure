This study wants to learn more about how nutrition and body composition affects health outcomes like glucose tolerance and lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are ages 16-30 years old. 60 adolescents and young adults with CF will be recruited, and 30 volunteers without cystic fibrosis. A total of 40 of these study participants with CF will be asked to return for annual study visits for 2 years after the first visit.\n\nThe long-term goal of this study is to use the information collected to make decisions about future nutrition monitoring and interventions which help maintain optimal health for individuals with CF.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, observation study to test the central hypothesis that individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a higher propensity to increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation and decreased lean body mass (LBM) compared to healthy controls, and this dysregulation in adipose and protein deposition exacerbates glucose intolerance and lung function decline. A sub-set of participants with CF will be followed longitudinally for two years (n=40). The investigators will conduct detailed body composition, fat distribution, metabolic, and nutritional phenotyping in this cohort. Body fat distribution will be assessed with MRI. Whole body composition will be assessed with DEXA. Glucose tolerance will be assessed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and mathematical modeling of the C-peptide and insulin response to glucose. Lung health will be assessed by objective clinical data and self-reported symptoms."
