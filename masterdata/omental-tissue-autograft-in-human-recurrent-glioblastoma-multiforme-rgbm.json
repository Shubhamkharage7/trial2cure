            "briefSummary": "This single center, single arm, open-label, phase I study will assess the safety of laparoscopically harvested autologous omentum, implanted into the resection cavity of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "Laparoscopically harvested omental grafts are commonly used to fill surgical cavities after resection of head and neck cancers. Investigators hypothesize that an omental tissue graft implanted into our patients with resected recurrent GBM may be used as a readily available and accessible means of circumventing the blood brain barrier (BBB) selectively and focally. The laparoscopically harvested omental graft omentum would easily conform to many resected GBM cavities in our human patients with acceptable risk. The predictable and rich vascular anatomy of a laparoscopically harvested piece of omentum makes it an ideal tissue for cases of previously irradiated and/or infected wound beds. This is why it is successfully used in head and neck and skull base tumors. The permeability of the new blood vessels formed between the omental graft and the cortical brain surface should allow for improved delivery of chemotherapeutics and immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into the vicinity, extracellular space and microenvironment of the resected tumor cavity including the brain adjacent to the tumor (BAT). Milky spots within the greater omentum are very small white-coloured areas of lymphoid tissue will also provide direct deposition of immune cells such as dendritic, macrophages and lymphocytes into the milieu of the resected GBM. The milky spots are made up of mesenchymal cells and are covered in a layer of mesothelium. These structures surround the small blood vessels. The enclosing mesothelium contains macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells. They are also known as secondary lymphoid organs. Most milky spots contain extremely thin-walled lymphatic capillaries. In addition, the technique of fat grafting has been reliably used since 1990 as a way to improve and enhance wound healing, scar healing, as well as tissue augmentation and tissue repair following radiation injury.\n\nAll subjects included in the study will undergo standard surgical resection for diagnosed recurrent GBM. Following the resection, the surgical cavity will be lined with a laparoscopically harvested piece of autologous omentum. The patient's dura, bone and scalp will be closed as is customary. The subject will be followed for side effects within 72 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 120 days and 180 days. Risk assessment will include seizure, stroke, infection, tumor progression, and death.\n\nThe investigators aim to prove that this commonly surgical technique for head and neck cancers and reconstructive surgery is safe in a small human cohort of patients with resected recurrent GBM and may improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)."
