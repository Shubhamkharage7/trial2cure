            "briefSummary": "This study aims to determine if web-based eHealth delivery of pre-test and/or post-test counseling in cancer patients and/or those at risk for cancer can provide equal or improved cognitive and affective outcomes when compared to the standard of care delivery model.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cancer genetic testing has become a standard evidence-based practice, with established risk reduction and cancer screening guidelines for genetic carriers. With FDA approval for PARP inhibitors in patients with advanced breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer, there is an additional therapeutic rationale for testing all breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer patients for germline genetic mutations. Yet, access to genetic specialists is limited in many area, and the traditional model of pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic professional will not support the rising indications for cancer genetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of testing, while maintaining adequate patient outcomes.\n\nThis study aims to assess if traditional pre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling delivered by a genetic counselor can be replaced with a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention to provide critical data to inform optimal ways to deliver cancer genetic testing in patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer, while maintaining quality of care and favorable cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine if web-based eHealth delivery of pre-test and/or post-test counseling can provide equal or improved cognitive and affective short-term and 6-month outcomes as compared to the two-visit standard of care delivery model with a genetic counselor. The investigator's primary outcomes will be changes in knowledge and anxiety. Secondary outcomes will include uptake of testing, depression, cancer specific distress, uncertainty and health behaviors and provider time."
