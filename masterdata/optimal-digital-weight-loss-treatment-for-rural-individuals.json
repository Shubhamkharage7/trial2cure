            "briefSummary": "Over 130 million adults in the US experience overweight and obesity, and rural communities experience significantly higher rates of obesity and related chronic diseases. Although lifestyle interventions successfully produce clinically significant weight losses, the availability of weight management programs is limited in rural areas. Digital interventions offer an attractive alternative for delivering lifestyle programs to rural populations. However, in-person behavioral obesity treatment programs achieve better weight losses than digital programs, likely because in-person programs typically include personnel-intensive \"high touch\" treatment components. Some studies indicate that having a human \"behind the curtain\" of a digital program through emailed feedback or with the addition of online group sessions can significantly increase weight loss. Therefore, the aims of this study are to increase the public health impact of digital obesity treatment for rural populations by simultaneously investigating 3 \"high touch\" intervention components. The investigators will conduct a highly efficient experiment with participants residing in non-urban areas recruited online from across the United States. Participants (N=616; 22% racial/ethnic minority; 40% male) will be randomized to: (1) weekly facilitated synchronous group video sessions (yes vs. no); (2) type of self-monitoring feedback received (counselor-crafted vs. pre-scripted); and (3) individual coaching calls (yes vs. no). These components will be layered onto our 24-week evidence-based, interactive digital weight loss program delivered to groups of eligible individuals. Based on the results of the experiment, The investigators will identify an optimized program in which each component (or combination of components) contributes meaningfully (at least 1.5 kg greater weight loss at 6-months) to enhanced weight loss. The investigators will also exploratory analyses of weight trajectories 6-months post-treatment (i.e., at 12-months) to elucidate extended impact of the specific components on weight control. Ultimately, this research will set the stage for confirming the most promising digital behavioral weight loss intervention that can be used without geographic borders to reduce obesity rates among rural residents and provide the evidence needed to establish best practice policies for broadly effective digital approaches to weight control."
