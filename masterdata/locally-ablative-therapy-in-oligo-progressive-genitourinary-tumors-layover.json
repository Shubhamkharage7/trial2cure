The primary endpoint is disease control at 3 months, defined as continuation in systemic cancer therapy without any changes or permanent discontinuation for 3 months following first day of ablative local therapy. Participants will receive ablative local therapy per standard practices in addition to their systemic therapy and will be followed for up to 5 years following ablative local therapy. Participants will be assigned stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or interventional radiology (IR) ablation therapy per the discretion of treating radiation oncologist and/or interventional radiologist."
