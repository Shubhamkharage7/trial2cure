A severe chronic condition such as renal failure \\[defined as abnormalities in kidney structure or function that are present for more than 3 months and have health implications. The disease is classified on the basis of cause and category of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (G1 to G5) and albuminuria (A1 to A3) (KIDIGO, 2017). See the following table\\], congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association III/IV), cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia associated with thromboembolic events (e.g., atrial fibrillation), unstable or advanced ischemic heart disease, hyperviscosity, or any other condition that the Investigator believes is likely to interfere with evaluation of the study drug or with satisfactory conduct of the trial.\n14. History of a malignant disease other than properly treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin within 24 months prior to ICF signature.\n15. History of pharmacoresistant epilepsy or multiple episodes of migraine (defined as at least 1 episode within 6 months of ICF signature) not controlled by medication.\n16.
