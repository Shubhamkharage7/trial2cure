It provides 2D and 3D visualization of Ultrasound (US) images and the ability to fuse and register these images with those from other imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance (MR), Computed Tomography, etc. It also provides the ability to display a simulated image of a tracked insertion tool on a computer monitor screen that shows images of the target organ and the current and the projected future path of the interventional instrument. DynaCAD 5.0 is an image analysis and planning system that will provide off station, pre planning and review of interventional study data. It interfaces with the Uronav 4.0 fusion guidance system.",
