Participants will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to either PRIME (investigational) or the traditional exercise program (standard of care).",

The objective of this study is to determine whether PRIME exercise training can outperform traditional (COMBO) exercise training to improve outcomes in HFrEF patients. The study aims to test 92 HFrEF patients (46 randomized to PRIME and 46 to COMBO training) over a 5-year period. Data will be collected at each visit and patients will return for a 6-month follow up from the date of the final visit."

Intensity will be adjusted so that the difficulty remains in the target zone. The resistance component involves eight exercises, two sets of 10 repetitions, initially prescribed at 50-60% 1 repetition max.
