The researchers will biopsy the tumor before injection and then again at the time of the larger operation to assess whether any effect of the treatment can be measured.",
            "detailedDescription": "Immunotherapy for advanced cancers of the abdomen can be quite effective, but not all tumors are responsive to this type of treatment. There is intense interest in new methods to convert non-responsive tumors into responsive tumors. One such method is to inject chemical constituents of micro-organisms into tumors in order to stimulate the immune system to recognize the tumor as foreign and mount an immune response to treatment.\n\nProvide a concise and brief, one-paragraph summary of your research project.
