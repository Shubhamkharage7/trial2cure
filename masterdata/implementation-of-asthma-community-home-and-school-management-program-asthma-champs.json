As part of a stepped wedge pragmatic trial the investigators will:\n\n1. Evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored implementation plan of Asthma CHAMPS in 32 Baltimore city elementary schools to reduce asthma disparities.\n2. Conduct a pragmatic trail using a stepped wedge design to evaluate implementation of a school and home asthma intervention program to reduce asthma-related absences, healthcare utilization and exacerbations and improve asthma control, among children enrolled in 32 Baltimore City elementary schools.\n3. Use qualitative methods (observation and semi structured interviews) to obtain stakeholder feedback (parents, community health workers, school personnel and administrators) on impact of Asthma CHAMPS, identify potential refinements in intervention and implementation strategies, and evaluate impact of local adaptation and fidelity on implementation success and sustainability."
