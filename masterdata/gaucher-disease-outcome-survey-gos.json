No experimental intervention is involved. Patients undergo clinical assessments and receive care as determined by the patients' treating physician.\n\nThe objectives of the registry include to evaluate the safety and long-term effectiveness of velaglucerase alfa, to characterize patients receiving velaglucerase alfa or other Gaucher Disease-specific treatments, to gain a better understanding of the natural history of GD and to serve as a database for evidence-based management of Gaucher Disease over time in real-life clinical practice.",

However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of new patients due to the pandemic.\n\n24 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19 situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the COVID-19 pandemic."
