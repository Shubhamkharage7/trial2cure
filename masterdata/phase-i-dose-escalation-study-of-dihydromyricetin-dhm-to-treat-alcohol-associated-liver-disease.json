            "briefSummary": "The current proposal is designed as a first-in-human Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum tolerated dose of DHM among healthy volunteers using a purified form of DHM from a local cGMP compliant source (Master Herbs, Inc).",
            "detailedDescription": "Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a bioactive flavonoid from an edible plant (ampelopsis grossedentata), is reported to have multiple protective effects against chemical-induced liver injuries. For example, the antioxidant activity and cellular metabolic protective effects of DHM may act via the AMP kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent Sirtuin (Sirt)-1 energy regulating pathway. Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence supporting the use of DHM for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and the possible reduction/prevention of alcohol-associated liver disease in animal models. DHM may represent a novel approach to counteract alcohol-induced liver damage and promote alcohol metabolism via changes in hepatocellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial biogenesis driven by the AMPK/Sirt-1/PGC-1\u03b1 axis.\n\nThese preclinical data suggest the potential of DHM as a novel therapeutic agent in alcohol-related diseases. However, further study in humans is warranted. While DHM has been used for herbal tea in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years, and there has been a small clinical trial using DHM in China among individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, there have been no controlled human studies published that have assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, or optimal dosing of DHM in humans.\n\nDHM is marketed as a dietary supplement in the United States and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a drug. Because the FDA has little control over the quality of herbal products such as DHM, it is necessary to quantitatively estimate the potentially active ingredients and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile with oral administration.\n\nThe current proposal is designed as a first-in-human Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum tolerated dose of DHM among healthy volunteers using a purified form of DHM from a local cGMP compliant source (Master Herbs, Inc)."
