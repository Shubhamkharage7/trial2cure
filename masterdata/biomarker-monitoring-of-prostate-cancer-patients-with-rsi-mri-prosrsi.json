            "detailedDescription": "Participants will undergo RSI at three time points: before therapy (MRI #1), after neoadjuvant ADT (MRI #2), and after radiotherapy (MRI #3). Treatment response will be assessed primarily by absence of biochemical recurrence (PSA \u22652 ng/mL greater than nadir) within 3 years of completing radiotherapy. Change in RSI cellularity index from MRI #1 to MRI #2 will be evaluated for prediction of participants who will experience biochemical recurrence within 3 years, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We hypothesize that RSI cellularity index will be an early biomarker for treatment effectiveness in prostate cancer treated with ADT and radiotherapy."

Continuous variables will be splined; only main effects will be considered. The cross-validated AUC for this model will be reported with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval using Efron's bias-corrected and accelerated (bca) method. If the lower bound on the 95% confidence interval of the AUC excludes 0.55, RSI cellularity index will be declared \"viable\" for identifying participants who will recur within the three-year post treatment. If declared \"viable\", a Cox model for predicting recurrence time will be fit, and the hazard ratios for RSI will be used to describe the adjusted associations supported by the data between RSI cellularity index and recurrence time.",
