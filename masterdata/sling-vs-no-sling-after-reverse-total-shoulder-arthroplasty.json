            "briefSummary": "This study involves patients who will be undergoing a reverse total shoulder replacement at Duke University. 100 eligible will be randomly assigned into one of two groups, a sling or no sling group. Patients in the sling group will wear a sling for three weeks after their surgery while the no sling group will only wear a sling three days after their surgery. Patients will follow their doctors normal follow up visit schedule after surgery, with visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not a sling is necessary after the nerve block has worn off postoperatively for patients undergoing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Patients who are scheduled for a reverse total shoulder with the participating investigators will be approached for potential participation in the study.\n\nBefore the surgery, subjects will be randomly assigned to either the Sling (control) group or the No-Sling (investigational) group. The Sling, or control, group will wear a sling through 3 weeks postoperatively. The No Sling (investigational) group, will wear a sling either through 3 days postoperatively.\n\nFollowing surgery, patients will be followed at their standard of care visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after their surgical date. The investigators will collect data from these standard of care visits including PROs (including but not limited to ASES and SANE), Adverse events data, and physical exam data including range of motion. Patients will be followed through their two-year visit and then taken off study."
