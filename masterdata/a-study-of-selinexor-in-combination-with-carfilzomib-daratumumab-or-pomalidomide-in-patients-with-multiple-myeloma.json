            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, 2-arm (with an additional exploratory arm), open-label, multicenter study looking at the response rate of patients receiving selinexor (KPT-330), in combination with carfilzomib, daratumumab or pomalidomide.\n\nMultiple Myeloma patients with documented disease progression or refractory disease while on current treatment with any carfilzomib-containing regimen (arm 1), any pomalidomide-containing regimen (arm 2) or any daratumumab-containing regimen (exploratory arm) will be included in the study. Patients will be assigned to the respective groups according to their current treatment. If a subject has received more than one of the above therapies, then assignment will be made at their physician's discretion (e.g treatment decision can be made based upon patient and physician preferred tolerance.).\n\nPatients will receive treatment until progressive disease (PD), death, toxicity that cannot be managed by standard of care, or withdrawal, whichever occurs first.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 2b, two-arm, open-label, multicenter study of Sd (selinexor 100, 80 or 60 mg) in combination with carfilzomib, or pomalidomide in patients with MM previously treated with carfilzomib or pomalidomide respectively, and refractory to prior treatment. An additional exploratory arm will focus on patients treated with SD in combination with daratumumab.\n\nThis study will enroll approximately 96 patients overall (43 in each of the arms and 10 additional patients in the exploratory arm. Patients will be assigned to the respective arms based on their previous treatment.\n\nPatients who are relapsed or refractory to their current carfilzomib-based regimen will be enrolled on Arm 1 and will receive the following treatment regimen on a 28-day cycle:\n\nCarfilzomib 56 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15. They will also receive dexamethasone 40 mg (or 20 mg if patient is \u2265 75 years old) once weekly and Selinexor 80 mg on days 1, 8 and 15.\n\nPatients who are relapsed or refractory to their current pomalidomide-based regimen will be enrolled on Arm 2 and will receive the following treatment regimen on a 28-day cycle:\n\nPomalidomide 4 mg po daily for 21 days combined with Dexamethasone 40 mg (or 20 mg if patient is \u2265 75 years old) once weekly and Selinexor 60 mg days 1, 8 and 15.\n\nFor arms 1 and 2, 13 patients will be accrued in each arm in the first stage. If there are 3 or fewer responses in these 13 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 30 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 43 (in each arm).\n\nFinally, in the exploratory arm, we will enroll up to 10 patients who are relapsed or refractory to their current daratumumab-based regimen. Patients enrolled on the exploratory arm will receive the following treatment regimen on a 28-day cycle:\n\nDaratumumab on current schedule (16 mg/kg IV days 1,8,15,22 for cycles 1-2; days 1 and 15 for cycles 3-6; day 1 for cycle 7 and on) combined with Dexamethasone 40 mg once weekly (or 20 mg if patient is \u2265 75 years old) and Selinexor 100 mg once weekly.\n\nThe Investigator may remove a patient from study treatment using criteria described in Section 10.2. Patients may decide to discontinue study treatment for any reason. Patients who elect to discontinue study treatment should be encouraged to continue in the study so that follow-up information on disease progression, other antineoplastic therapy, symptoms and survival status may be obtained. However, patients may elect to withdraw consent and decline further participation in the trial at any time.\n\nThe Investigator must determine the primary reason for a patient's discontinuation of study treatment and record this information on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients who are prematurely withdrawn from study treatment are not eligible to re-initiate study treatment on this protocol at a later date."
