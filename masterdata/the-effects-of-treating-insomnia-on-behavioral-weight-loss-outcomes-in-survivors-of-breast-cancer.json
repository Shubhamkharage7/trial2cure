            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose a randomized controlled clinical trial in 250 women with a history of early stage breast cancer who are overweight or obese with insomnia to test whether a brief, cognitive-behavioral intervention for insomnia (CBT-I) prior to behavioral weight loss (CBT-I+BWL) is superior to a sleep education control (EDU) condition followed by behavioral weight loss (EDU+BWL). The investigators will measure outcomes at baseline, 8 weeks (after completing CBT-I or EDU and prior to BWL), and at 3, 6, and 12 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The entire study will span a 14-month period and involves one video screening visit (V1) and 4 in-person assessment visits (V2-V5) and 27 video sessions (6 for sleep intervention or sleep control and 19 for BWL). After passing an initial phone screen, participants will be scheduled for in-depth screening (V1). The investigators will complete urine samples for pregnancy and substances, administer study measures, obtain weight, height, anthropometrics and randomize at in-person visit (V2). The overall framework of the BWL intervention is social cognitive theory (increasing self-efficacy and social support) with motivational interviewing (MI) as an approach to helping participants engage in established behavior change strategies (e.g. self-monitoring, stimulus control, goal setting, feedback, etc.) aimed at reducing dietary intake and increasing physical activity (PA). Body composition will be assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), which measures total and regional fat, lean tissue and bone mass. The investigators will conduct DEXA scans at two time points (V1 \\& V5).The investigators' primary endpoint is % total weight loss (TWL) at 12 months. The investigators will measure weight in light clothes without shoes, using a digital scale and height to the nearest 0.1 cm using a calibrated stadiometer, according to standardized procedures."
