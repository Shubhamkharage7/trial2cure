This study will evaluate the feasibility of a cognitive and affective intervention combining Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy (CRT), and modifiable lifestyle factors to address the cognitive and affective dysfunctions associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or those with cognitive complaints.\n\nThe study team hypothesizes that combining evidence-based cognitive and affective therapies (CRT+CBT) with lifestyle modifications is feasible and will improve the cognitive performance and Quality of Life (QoL) in patients with MCI and participants caregivers compared to usual care."

Recognition Hits are calculated as the number of correct responses to target items, and Recognition False Alarms are calculated as the number of incorrect responses to nontarget items.
