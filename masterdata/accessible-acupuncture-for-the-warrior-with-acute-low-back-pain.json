Subjects will be randomized into one of four study groups receiving either 1) NSAIDs only (naproxen 500mg by mouth twice a day as needed) or 2) acupuncture to include use of GV 26 with manual tonification (twisting or rotating the needle) plus NSAIDs (naproxen 500mg by mouth twice a day as needed) or 3) Battlefield Acupuncture in both ears (which includes the points cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega-2, point zero and shen men) plus NSAIDs (naproxen 500mg by mouth twice a day as needed) or 4) GV26 with manual tonification + Battlefield Acupuncture in both ears (which includes the points cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega-2, point zero and shen men) plus NSAIDs (naproxen 500mg by mouth twice a day as needed).
