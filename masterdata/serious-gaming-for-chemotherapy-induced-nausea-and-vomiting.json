Early reinforcement of standard education and re-framing any preconceived beliefs about the ability of nausea and vomiting to be managed will increase preventative self-management behaviors and improve patient outcomes. Participants will be in the study for 6 chemotherapy treatment cycles. This could be 12 to 24 weeks depending on if they receive treatment every 2, 3 or 4 weeks."
