            "briefSummary": "Risk of Veteran suicide is elevated during the first year of transition from military service to civilian life. Most Veteran suicides occur among Veterans who are not connected to VA healthcare. Suicide prevention and connection to care are therefore critical for recently transitioning Veterans. Transitioning Veterans require services to provide them with suicide prevention education, skills to manage their transition effectively, and support in their access to VA healthcare. Convenient, accessible, palatable, patient-centered care options that are cost-effective, easy to implement nationwide, and target domains known to mitigate suicide risk are needed during this critical transition period. This proposal would bridge this important healthcare gap using STEP-Home-SP, a transdiagnostic, non-stigmatizing, skills-based workshop. STEP-Home-SP will provide Veterans with suicide prevention education, skills to improve transition, support to access VA care, and a platform to decrease social isolation early in their military to civilian transition, thereby reducing suicide risk downstream.",
            "detailedDescription": "Veterans face a \"deadly gap\" during their first year of transition from military to civilian life with limited available psychiatric services and increased suicide risk factors. During this critical transition period, Veteran suicide rate is double that of active service members and the general Veteran population. An average of 20 Veterans die from suicide each day, but only 6 of the 20 use VA services. VA care engagement has been shown to mitigate suicide risk; therefore, promoting engagement during the \"deadly gap\" could be essential to suicide prevention. Transitioning Veterans require outreach and services to provide them with support in their access to VA healthcare, suicide prevention education, and skills to manage their transition effectively. This proposal would bridge this important healthcare gap using STEP-Home. STEP-Home is an evidence-based, transdiagnostic, video telehealth rehabilitation workshop to improve reintegration, social support, and functioning among Veterans with high clinical comorbidity. STEP-Home is non-clinical, cost-effective, and skills-focused to maximally engage Veterans not participating in treatment who may be resistant to traditional \"mental health\" diagnostically focused approaches. To date, STEP-Home has not been adapted for the unique needs of recently transitioning Veterans or augmented for suicide prevention. This proposal will adapt and refine STEP-Home specifically for recently transitioning Veterans and add suicide prevention content and skills to create STEP-Home-SP. The proposed pilot study is designed to support STEP-Home and suicide prevention content experts in their refinement and evaluation of STEP-Home-SP. The investigators will utilize the VA/Department of Defense Identity Repository (VADIR) to recruit recently transitioned Veterans nationwide. In Aim 1, the investigators will develop STEP-Home-SP by adapting the STEP-Home telehealth intervention to specifically target recently transitioned Veterans and augment the workshop to include suicide prevention. In Aim 2, the investigators will conduct a two-arm proof-of-concept acceptability and feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of STEP-Home-SP versus Enhanced Usual Care (EUC=current standard of care + educational packet on suicide risk and connection to VA care) in recently transitioned Veterans. Lastly, the investigators will explore reintegration status, VA care initiation, and candidate outcomes for STEP-Home-SP relative to EUC to inform a future full-scale RCT. If successful, fostering social, vocational, and community connection; building emotion regulation and impulse control skills; facilitating safety planning; and providing education and access to VA care upstream should result in decreased suicide risk during this critical transition and beyond."
