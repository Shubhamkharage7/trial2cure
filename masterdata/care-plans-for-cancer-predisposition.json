            "detailedDescription": "As over 15% of pediatric cancers are associated with a cancer predisposition, it is increasingly becoming standard of care for children with cancer, as well as those with suspected hereditary risk, to be evaluated for germline cancer predisposition. Unfortunately, the increase in pediatric genetic testing has exceeded the pace of research supporting effective cancer surveillance in positive cases. Additionally, guidelines for cancer predisposition management are not easily accessed or understood by families; thus, there is often a disconnect between the understanding and retention of such information relayed to families.\n\nIn this study, Investigators will develop and evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of digital care plans for Cancer Predisposition Syndromes (CPS) with accompanying text message reminders for children and adolescents with a known CPS. Digital care plans and text messages will be created for 10 common CPS. Investigators will use a quasi-experimental design with pre and post testing of the same cohort, before and after delivery of care plan and accompanying messages. To evaluate the impact of the digital care plans, Investigators will compare assessments of the same cohorts at 3 and 6 months time points."
