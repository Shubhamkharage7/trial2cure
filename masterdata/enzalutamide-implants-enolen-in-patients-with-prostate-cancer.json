Study participants will have placement of the drug eluting Enolen implants. Six to twelve weeks later, the patient will undergo a repeat MRI followed by standard of care radical prostatectomy.\n\nParticipants will be followed for an additional 6-12 weeks post surgery. Clinical labs and correlative sample collection and patient quality of life questionnaires will be administered at follow-up visits."

Highly effective forms of contraception include:\n\nVasectomy Condom with spermicide\n\nPartner use of one of the following methods:\n\nPostmenopausal \\>1 year or age \\>55y Bilateral tubal ligation Intrauterine devices (IUDs) Hormonal implants (Implanon, Nexplanon, etc.) Combination oral contraceptives Progestin-only injections (Depo-Provera) Hormonal patches Vaginal Ring Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, the treating physician should be informed immediately.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior radiotherapy or surgery for prostate cancer\n2. Ongoing hormonal therapy for prostate cancer or hormone therapy \\<3 months prior to the start of treatment\n3. Prior prostate procedures such as transurethral resection of the prostate, transurethral microwave thermotherapy of the prostate, high-intensity focused ultrasound or minimally invasive Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) procedure\n4. Study participant unwilling or unable to undergo MRI, including participants with contra-indications to MRI, such as cardiac pacemakers, non-compatible intracranial vascular clips, etc.\n5. Metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device that distorts the quality of prostatic MR images.\n6. Study participants who, because of age, general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic status cannot give valid informed consent.\n7. Use of 5 alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., Finasteride or Dutasteride) within 3 months of screening.\n8. Presence of any metastatic disease.\n9. No evidence of extracapsular extension of disease.\n10. Study participants, who in the opinion of the treating clinician, would be at increased risk of refractory urinary retention due to a transperineal procedure such as the Enolen implant.\n11. History of prostate infection within 2 years.\n12. No intercurrent medical condition or circumstances that would preclude prostatectomy.\n13. History of bleeding diathesis or currently on anti-coagulation therapy that cannot be safely discontinued for implant procedure.\n14.
