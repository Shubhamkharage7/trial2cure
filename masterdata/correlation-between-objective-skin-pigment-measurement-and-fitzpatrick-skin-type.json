It is used by dermatologists to classify skin tone and assess the risk of skin cancer.\n\nThe Fitzpatrick scale encompasses six gradings, from I to VI. However, this does not include all skin tones, as there are significantly more not encompassed within the scale. The aim of this study is to incorporate objective measurements when identifying a patient's Fitzpatrick skin type."
