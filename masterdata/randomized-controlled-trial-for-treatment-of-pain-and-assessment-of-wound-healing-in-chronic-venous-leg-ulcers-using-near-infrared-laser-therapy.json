            "briefSummary": "The laser emits an infrared light that heats the skin and underlying tissues with the purpose of temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, as well as stiffness associated with arthritis. The laser also causes a temporary increase in blood flow. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether laser therapy can provide pain relief and speed the healing of venous leg ulcers.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Summus Laser Cube is an FDA cleared light-emitting device for applying infrared to provide topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, muscle spasm, pain and stiffness associated with arthritis and promoting relaxation of the muscle tissue and to temporarily increase local blood circulation.\n\nThere will be a total of 20 subjects involved in this study. The study will only involve participants being treated at the Wake Forest University Health Sciences Wound Care Center. Ten participants will be randomized to the treatment arm and receive therapeutic laser therapy applied to the ulcer area. The other ten participants will receive a sham laser therapy, where the light emitted by the laser is visible, but not powerful enough to provide a therapeutic effect. During the first weekly visit, patients will have the wound debrided (dead or dying tissue will be removed),and the size of the ulcer measured and photographed. A wound dressing will be applied, followed by a compression wrap.\n\nAfter one week patients will return to the Wound Care clinic and the size of the wound will be evaluated. If the wound has decreased by less than 30%,the patient will be randomized into the protocol. The patient will then have weekly visits, to include a survey, wound measurements, survey, photos,and laser treatments. The length of the study is a maximum of 17 weeks (less if the patient heals faster). The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether laser therapy can provide pain relief and speed the healing of venous leg ulcers."
