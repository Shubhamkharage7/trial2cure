            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe drug IL-15 activates the immune system. The drugs nivolumab and ipilimumab unblock immune cells. The drugs together may allow immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells, causing tumors to shrink.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test the effects and maximum dose of IL-15, nivolumab, and ipilimumab.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 18 and older who have cancer that does not respond to treatment\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Heart, blood, and urine tests\n* Scans\n\nTumor biopsy: A small needle removes a tumor sample.\n\nParticipants will be in 1 of 3 treatment groups:\n\n* IL-15 with nivolumab\n* IL-15 with ipilimumab\n* IL-15 with nivolumab and ipilimumab\n\nParticipants will take the drugs in four 6-week cycles. IL-15 is injected under the skin. The other two drugs are injected into an arm vein over 60-90 minutes. Participants may need to stay at the hospital 2-3 hours after the first dose of any drug to watch for side effects.\n\nEach cycle will include:\n\n* Weekly blood and urine tests\n* 5 IL-15 injections\n* 1 ipilimumab injection if applicable\n* 3 nivolumab injections if applicable\n* Scans and a tumor biopsy on day 42\n\nAfter cycle 4, participants will stop taking IL-15. They will continue the other drugs until they can no longer tolerate the side effects or their cancer gets worse. Those cycles will include:\n\n* Blood tests on 3-4 days\n* Urine tests on 1 day\n* 1 ipilimumab injection if applicable\n* 3 nivolumab injections if applicable\n* Scans every other cycle\n\nAfter participants stop treatment, their doctor will monitor their side effects for 4 months or until they go away.",
            "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND:\n\n* IL-15 is a stimulatory cytokine that activates the immune system, inducing proliferation of T lymphocytes and NK cells. Administration of recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) has been shown to result in a dramatic increase of circulating CD8+T cells and NK cells; these changes in immune cell populations suggest potential for anti-tumor activity.\n* Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), block the engagement of specific T-cell signaling pathways by tumor cells. These regulatory pathways typically act to downregulate T cell activity and are co-opted by tumors to allow the malignant cells to evade the immune response.\n* The combination of rhIL-15 with two checkpoint inhibitor therapies has potential to lead to enhanced immune activation, resulting in anti-tumor T cell responses that are effective in refractory cancers.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of subcutaneous administration of rhIL-15 given in combination with the anti- CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab and the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in patients with metastatic or treatment-refractory cancers.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\n* Assess the clinical activity of rhIL-15, ipilimumab, and nivolumab combination therapy as characterized by RECIST 1.1 and immune RECIST (iRECIST) response rate of patients treated in this trial.\n* Investigate the biological effects of this combination on circulating T cell subsets and on PD-1/PD-L1 expression and immune cell activation in tumor tissue.\n\nELIGIBILITY:\n\n- Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or treatment-refractory cancers.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN:\n\n* The first 4-6 patients enrolling in the study will be placed into lead-in doublets with a combination of rhIL-15 and either nivolumab OR ipilimumab; once toxicity is cleared in both doublets (i.e., 2 patients enrolled on each doublet remain free of DLTs for 6 weeks) and a safety analysis is reviewed and approved by the IRB, new patients will be enrolled directly onto the triple agent combination.\n* For the first four 42-day cycles on the triplet, patients will receive SC rhIL-15 on days 1-8 and 22-29, intravenous (IV) nivolumab on days 8, 22, and 36, and IV ipilimumab on day 8. Cycles 5 and onwards will not include treatment with rhIL-15.\n* Patients will be encouraged to report any and all adverse events, given the high likelihood of toxicities with the triplet combination therapy.\n* Blood for PD endpoints will be collected throughout the study and tumor biopsies will be collected pretreatment and on C1D42 (optional during the doublets and triplet escalation phase, mandatory during the triplet expansion phase)"

Subjects must not have received radiotherapy in the 2 weeks prior to C1D1. Subjects who had grade greater than or equal to3 irAE (excluding endocrinopathies) during previous treatment with one of the checkpoint inhibitors are excluded from the trial; subjects who had grade 1 or 2 irAE (including serious AEs) that have resolved to grade 1 are eligible at the discretion of the PI.\n\nSubjects with primary brain cancers or active CNS metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n\nHistory of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to any of the agents on this trial.\n\nConcurrent anticancer therapy (including other investigational agents) with the exception of hormone therapy for breast or prostate cancer. Patients that have received treatment for a different cancer previously and have been disease-free for less than one year are excluded.\n\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, cognitive impairment, active substance abuse, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the view of the Investigator, would preclude safe treatment or the ability to give informed consent and limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nInability or refusal to practice effective contraception during therapy or the presence of pregnancy or active breastfeeding. Because there is no significant preclinical information regarding the risk to a fetus or newborn infant, pregnant or breastfeeding women will be excluded from participation in this trial.\n\nDocumented HIV infection or positive serology. Since rhIL-15 treatment stimulates the subjects immune system to attack their tumor, the defective immune systems of subjects with HIV makes responses to this treatment much less likely to provide benefit and these subjects are not eligible for this trial.\n\nHistory of severe asthma (subjects with a history of mild asthma that are on or can be switched to non-corticosteroid\n\nbronchodilator regimens are eligible).\n\nPatients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded.
