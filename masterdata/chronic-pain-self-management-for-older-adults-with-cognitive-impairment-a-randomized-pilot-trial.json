The main questions it aims to answer are whether this program is feasible and acceptable, and whether it shows potential for improving pain-related outcomes. Intervention group participants will receive education and support from a community health worker in 7 weekly telephone sessions, and will watch a series of educational videos discussing a variety of chronic pain self-management skills. A control group will not receive the program, but after the final data collection point will be invited to attend a one-time remote session that summarizes intervention content, and will receive all program materials. Researchers will compare intervention and control groups after the program ends to see if the intervention group has less pain interference with daily activities."
