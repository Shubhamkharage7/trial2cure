            "detailedDescription": "Immunotherapeutic treatment with check-point inhibitors has increased survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that does not have any mutation to be targeted. However, the concept that tumors evade immune surveillance through a variety of mechanisms, and that activating the immune system can lead to tumor regression in a variety of tumor types has been known for decades. Thus, this study combines the effects to blocking 2 different pathways- inhibition of PD-1 pathway and angiogenic pathway via inhibition of VEGR signaling to improve survival as blocking each pathway individually has demonstrated a modest increment. There has been no study using nivolumab in combination with a VEGFR2 inhibitor, a drug which has both anti-angiogenic and pleotropic immunomodulatory effects and may synergize with the effect of an anti-PD-1 agent, in solid tumors. Activating the anti-tumor effects of T cells by utilizing multiple pathways of both nivolumab and ramucirumab is an endeavor which merits investigation.\n\nThus, the study investigates the synergistic effect of targeted anti-antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and immune-suppressive activity of VEGF-inhibitor ramicirumab expecting a favorable overall survival in NSCLC patients, with the additional benefit of tolerable toxicities."
