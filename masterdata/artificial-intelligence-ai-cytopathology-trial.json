To compare accuracy of preliminary diagnosis results between ROSE and AI at bedside versus final pathology report.\n\nResearch design This is a prospective single center study to compare performance characteristics in the interpretation of EUS FNA/FNB samples between AI and ROSE.\n\nProcedures to be used Eligible patients will undergo EUS guided FNA/FNA of PSLs using standard of care. Sample slides are prepared by a cytopathologist at bedside and observed under a microscope. At the same time, the slides are scanned using a slide scanner and those images are saved for interpretation by AI at a later time."
