The study will also compare the effect of treatment on health-related biomarkers. All participants will receive varenicline, a medication used to treat tobacco use dependence, counseling, and cessation resources (i.e., links to text-based support, self-change booklet). Varenicline helps to reduce cravings for tobacco use and decreases the pleasurable effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products.",
            "detailedDescription": "Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be determined via initial online screening and then confirmed with tele-video/phone call final screening. Non-pregnancy verification will be ascertained via remote pregnancy test.\n\nAll participants will be asked to provide assessments (as described below) throughout the sampling process to assess cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use behavior, varenicline use, and use of cessation resources.\n\nThis is a 12 week, open-label study of varenicline."
