Eligible participants will be randomized (assigned) to one of the following interventions: 1) Virtual genetics navigator, a mobile-optimized website, designed by the investigators, that delivers tailored messages and content; 2) two motivational interviewing (MI) telephone calls delivered by trained genetics health coaches; or 3) usual care.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial will be conducted in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and a network of oncology practices in Michigan, the Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium (MOQC).\n\nAs of April 2023 we were approved by our IRB to expand our inclusion criteria and recruitment cohort. This expansion will enhance our reach to individuals who are not in the acute stages of clinical care as well as individuals who are not in oncology care currently yet still qualify for genetic testing based on their family history of cancer alone or in combination with any personal cancer history. These expansions will also support the unburdening of oncology practices - who continue to face downstream, resource-limiting affects from the COVID-19 pandemic - across the state. The goal and aims of the study remain the same."
