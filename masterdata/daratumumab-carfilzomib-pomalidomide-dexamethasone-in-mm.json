Patient with known or suspected COPD or asthma must have an FEV1 test within 28 days prior to study registration.\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to C1D1.\n* Patient has any other medical, psychiatric, or social condition that would preclude participation in the study, pose an undue medical hazard, interfere with the conduct of the study, or interfere with interpretation of the study results.\n* Toxicity from previous anticancer therapy must resolve to baseline levels or to grade \u22641, except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy.",
