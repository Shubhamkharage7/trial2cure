Relative assessment of bone marrow status between total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) and conventional TBI.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Correlation of dual energy computed tomography (DECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging with biological samples for cellularity/adiposity.\n\nII. Feasibility of fluorothymidine F-18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging biomarker as a predictor of treatment response.\n\nIII. Correlation of FLT PET imaging with biological correlate for leukemia. IV. Characterize relative distribution of leukemia in bone marrow (BM) environment.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I (TLMI+FLT/TMLI): Patients may undergo optional fluorothymidine F-18 PET scan over 2 hours at baseline, on days 30 and 100, at 1 year, and at time of relapse. Patients undergo DECT and water-fat MRI scan over 30 minutes at baseline, on days 30 and 100, at year 1, and at time of relapse.
