The analgesic effects will also be evaluated of the topical system in pediatric and adult participants with minor soft tissue injuries over a 14-day treatment course. To collect principal investigator-reported global response to therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Open-label, controlled study in pediatric and adult participants with minor soft tissue injuries. One-hundred fifty (150) participants between 6 and 11years old; 12 and 16 years old; and 18 and 45 years old will be enrolled, with equal numbers in each of the three age groups. The 50 adults enrolled will serve as the control. Participants will be seen by the principal investigator (PI) or designee at the clinical site, at entry and Visits 2 and 5 following the first topical system application, with the last visit scheduled on either Day 14 or the day after the participant experiences pain resolution. Visits 3 and 4 will be conducted via telehealth. At each study visit, adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be recorded, local tolerability at the application site scored on a 7-point scale, and pain assessed by participants using the Wong-Baker FACES scale. Vital signs will be measured at the screening visit and Visits 2 and 5.\n\nParticipants will also assess pain twice daily (morning and evening) at home in the Participant Diary using the same Wong-Baker FACES scale. Blood samples will be obtained from each participant at Visit 2, 24 hours (\u00b1 1 hour) after initial topical system application at Visit 1, and at the time of study discontinuation (with a topical system in place) for determination of plasma diclofenac concentration and plasma activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). At the End-of-Study (EOS) Visit the principal investigator will provide an assessment of global response to therapy on a 5-point scale.\n\nParticipants will be asked to apply the Licart topical system once per day for a maximum of 14 days or until pain resolution, whichever occurs first.\n\nThis study will assess efficacy by the following assessments: Plasma diclofenac concentration, 24 hours (\u00b1 1 hour) after initial application (Visit 2) and EOS Visit; Pain score assessment by participant using the Wong-Baker FACES scale: every day (Participant Diary) and study visits on Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5; and Principal investigator assessment of global response to therapy on a 5-point scale.\n\nThis study will assess safety by the following assessments: Vital signs will be measured at the screening visit and Visit 2 and 5; AE reporting at each study visit; Local tolerability on a 7-point scale at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5, or the day after pain resolution, with a topical system applied to the injured area; Plasma diclofenac concentration, 24 hours (\u00b11 hour) after initial topical system application (Visit 2) and EOS Visit; and Plasma activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 24 hours (\u00b11 hour) after initial topical system application (Visit 2) and EOS Visit.\n\nThe primary endpoints of the study are: Diclofenac pharmacokinetic profile (Pediatric population vs Adult population; Two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) \\<4 ng/mL); Local tolerability; AEs; and Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).\n\nThe secondary endpoints of the study are: Participant-reported pain scores; Global response to therapy; and Vital signs.\n\nAll participants who receive at least one topical system will be subjected to classic safety and efficacy analyses. All participants who receive at least one topical system and have at least one blood draw to support determination of plasma diclofenac concentration will be subjected to the pharmacokinetic analysis. An evaluable participant population with adequate compliance and follow- up may also be analyzed.\n\nContinuous variables will be presented as sample size, means, medians, standard deviations, range and 90% CI. Categorical variables will be presented as sample size, number of observations, percentages and exact 90% CI.\n\nThe participant population will be stratified by appropriate age categories and the effects of age may be analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or multiple regression methods.\n\nPlasma diclofenac concentration in pediatric participants will be compared with those of adults using repeated measures mixed models (participants will have reached steady-state blood concentration by the time of the first blood draw)."
