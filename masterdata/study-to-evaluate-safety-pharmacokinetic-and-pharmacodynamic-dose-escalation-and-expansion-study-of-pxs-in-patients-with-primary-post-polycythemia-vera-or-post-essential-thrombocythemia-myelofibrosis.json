            "detailedDescription": "The study consists of three phases: a dose escalation phase, a cohort expansion phase, and an add-on phase.\n\nThe dose escalation phase will follow a 3+3 design with a starting dose of 100 mg twice daily, and a treatment duration of 4 weeks. Patients will be able to participate in more than one dose level.\n\nDuring the cohort expansion phase, up to 24 patients will be treated at the dose determined appropriate based on safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the dose escalation phase, for a period of up to 6 months. Patients from the dose escalation phase will be able to participate in the cohort expansion phase.\n\nIn the add-on phase PXS-5505 will be given to patients, already receiving a stable dose of ruxolitinib, for a period of 12 months. Up to 15 patients will enrol in the add-on phase in order to obtain 12 patients with at least 1 month's exposure to PXS-5505 on top of ruxolitinib.\n\nNote: The decision to include an add-on phase, where PXS-5505 is to be given on top of a stable ruxolitinib dose, was taken following a review of the data (safety, PK and PD) from the cohort expansion phase.\n\nThere will be no washout period between dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts."
