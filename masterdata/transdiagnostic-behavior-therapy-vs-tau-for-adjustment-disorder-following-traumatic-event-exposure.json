Despite its high prevalence, no evidence based treatment for AjD has been subjected to randomized controlled trials. This study seeks to build on the research team's pilot work across several disorders study to benefit service members and Veterans with AjD, a highly prevalent but frequently inadequately treated condition.\n\nThe investigators will compare the effects of Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT) vs treatment as usual which is Moving Forward Problem Solving Therapy (TAU-PST) on AjD symptom outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that TBT will result in greater overall symptom reduction compared to TAU-PST.",
            "detailedDescription": "Adjustment Disorder (AjD) is the most common mental health condition diagnosed in Active Duty personnel, and is diagnosed following an extreme stress event such as traumatic loss of a comrade, serious accident or injury, or other intense stress event. Despite its high prevalence, no evidence based treatment for AjD has been subjected to randomized controlled trials.\n\nCurrently, the VA suggests a problem solving cognitive behavioral therapy, but this recommendation is not based on replicated, randomized controlled trials. Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT), is based on key 'active components' of existing evidence based treatments such as Prolonged Exposure and Behavioral Activation, has been designed by this research team to be easily trained and inexpensively disseminated, and has been evaluated in a series of pilots with anxiety and depression disorders that, importantly, represent the key symptom classes of adjustment disorder.\n\nThus, the rationale for the proposed trial is that the research team has done preliminary efficacy testing of an easily exportable intervention that has impact on the key symptoms of adjustment disorder, and the standard of evidence demands replicated, randomized controlled trials to determine if initial signals of positive effect are sustained.\n\nThe study will use a 2 group repeated measures randomized controlled design to evaluate effectiveness of TBT for AjD compared to treatment as usual (TAU-PST). Participants will be randomly assigned in equal numbers (n = 75; N = 150) to one of two treatment arms: (1) TBT or (2) TAU-PST. Participants assigned to TBT will receive 6, 30-45-minute, manualized, individual therapy sessions. Participants assigned to TAU-PST will receive 6, 30-45-minute sessions of Problem-Solving Therapy. Dependent measures will include Department of Defense (DoD) specified common data elements and specific measures of AjD, PTSD, anxiety, depression, and functioning collected by blinded assessors at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up."
