Eligible participants will be treated with study medication for 3 weeks followed by a 2 week safety follow-up following the end of study treatment. The total duration of the study is up to 9 weeks. A single pharmacokinetic (PK) sample will be taken from each participant, in a prespecified PK sampling window at visit 5, for population PK analysis.\n\nA total of 168 participants (56 per treatment arm) will be randomized at Visit 2."

Medications not covered in allowed medications or prohibited medications must be cleared by the Medical Monitor prior to enrolling the subject.\n9. Use of psychotropic medications including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics within 14 days of Baseline.\n10. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within the 30 days preceding study enrollment.\n11.
