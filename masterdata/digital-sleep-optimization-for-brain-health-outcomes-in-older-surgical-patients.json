We propose to determine if digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) is feasible for treating older surgical patients with insomnia symptoms and to examine the effects of dCBT-I on sleep, cognitive trajectory, mood, pain, activity, and function after surgery. The Sleep Optimization for Brain Health Outcomes in Older Surgical Patients (SLEEP-BOOST) is a pilot randomized, controlled, singled-blinded (participant) trial in major orthopedic joint surgery patients that will build on a previously clinically tested CBT-I mobile application paired with a wearable device (wrist actigraphy)."
