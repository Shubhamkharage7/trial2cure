The adaptive strategies are designed to target patient- and system-level determinants identified in preliminary data, including delayed communication of results, individual and structural barriers to accessing treatment, and suboptimal care coordination between referring and cancer treatment clinics. The strategies draw upon key principles in behavioral economics and are supported by systematic evidence of the effectiveness of nudge strategies in preventive, HIV, and cancer care. The overarching rationale for the study is that enhancing coordination, communication, and navigation through centralized outreach and nudge strategies will increase timely treatment adoption and be scalable and sustainable in the long-term."
