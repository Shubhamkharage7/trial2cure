The World Health Organization (WHO) released conditional guidelines for this intervention, which include targeting azithromycin distributions to children 1-11 months of age in high mortality settings. The proposed trial aims to demonstrate and evaluate large-scale implementation of azithromycin to children aged 1-11 months old in the context of a programmatic setting while monitoring mortality and resistance antimicrobial resistance.",

A total of 2,490 communities within selected CSIs will be included .\n\nAll communities in both arms receive routine health services offered by community health workers working for the Niger Ministry of Health's community health program.\n\nMortality will be monitored through birth histories. Mortality and morbidity will also be monitored using routinely collected community and clinic visit data. Antimicrobial resistance will be monitored in a subset of eligible CSIs."
