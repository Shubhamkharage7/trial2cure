            "detailedDescription": "Scientific problem:\n\nHair thinning and hair loss are problems that affect both men and women. A variety of diet, lifestyle, life-stage, ethnicity/race, and genetic factors contribute to the thinning and loss of hair. While hair loss is not a condition that is life-threatening, it is life-impacting. Hair loss negatively affects confidence and is associated with decline in quality of life While FDA-approved treatments do exist, access or ease of use may be difficult, or use limited to men. Ingredients like biotin, silicon, and herbals have been marketed for hair, skin, and nail benefits. The studies on their benefits are equivocal, requiring continued research investments to guide evidence-based recommendations for use. The availability of an oral supplement that is safe and effective for everyday use may present a new option for men and women concerned with hair thinning or hair loss.\n\nSpecific aims The objective of this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled study is to assess the effectiveness of a novel dietary ingredient formulated with 10 mg of biotin and 10 mg of silicon for improving the appearance of hair and skin in a generally healthy adult population. The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate the impact of daily use on hair growth. In addition, the impact of supplementation on other hair and skin parameters will be evaluated. The study will include both analytical measures and a subjective questionnaire in order to connect analytical outcomes with observable changes in appearance."
