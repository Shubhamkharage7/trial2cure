In order to have a sufficient pool of retrospective patients for matching, retrospective data will be collected for a minimum of 300 patients. The historical control cohort will be accrued from the same pool of institutions participating in the prospective study. Eligibility criteria will be standardized between the prospective investigational treatment arm and the historical control. Within this analysis, propensity score (PS) matching will be used to reduce bias due to potential differences in key covariates between the prospective and retrospective cohorts."
