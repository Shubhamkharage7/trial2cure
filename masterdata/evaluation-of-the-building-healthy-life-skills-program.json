            "briefSummary": "The goal of this intervention trial is to learn test whether participation in the Building Health Life Skills Program leads to improvements in psychological well-being and stress management skills for people who are experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Will participation in the Building Healthy Life Skills Program lead to better skills in managing negative emotions?\n* Will participation in the Building Healthy Life Skills Program lead to improvements in psychological well-being, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life?\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete three surveys: one prior to the first session of the program, one at the end of the program, and one three months later. The surveys include measures of skills for managing negative emotions, mood states, sleep quality, health-related quality of life, illness experiences, and history of childhood adversity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Community members who are experiencing homelessness and receiving support services from the Merced County Navigation Center and who have enrolled in the center's Building Healthy Life Skills Program will be invited to participate in this intervention evaluation study. The Building Healthy Life Skills program is a 10-week program designed to provide participants with an understanding of how abuse, neglect and household dysfunctions during childhood affect emotional, social, and cognitive well-being; and to provide training in emotion regulation skills, including adaptive emotional processing and expression, mindfulness, and cognitive reappraisal. The sessions are two hours in duration and conducted in classroom style. Open enrollment will be conducted four times a year, serving approximately 60 individuals."
