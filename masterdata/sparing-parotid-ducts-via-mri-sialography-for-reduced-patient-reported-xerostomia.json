            "briefSummary": "Radiation-induced xerostomia (dry mouth) is one of the most common and severe toxicities experienced by patients undergoing radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Radiation-induced dry mouth is a frequently experienced symptom and persists after treatment, potentially indefinitely. Current practice does not specifically attempt to spare the parotid ducts, where stem/progenitor cells are believed to preferentially reside, and considers the entire salivary gland to have equal function. New radiation therapy planning and conducting strategies are needed to reduce this toxicity and maximize patient quality of life post-treatment.\n\nThis randomized Phase II study explores the contribution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided salivary gland duct definition to decrease patient-reported xerostomia in patients with oropharynx cancer receiving radiation therapy. The severity of xerostomia will be measured by patient-reported (PRO) symptoms, saliva secretion, saliva pH, and buffering."
