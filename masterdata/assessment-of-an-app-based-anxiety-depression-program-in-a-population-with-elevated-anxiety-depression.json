            "briefSummary": "Generalized anxiety disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of tension and worry with physical symptoms including increased blood pressure. Approximately 20% of US adults reported an anxiety disorder in the past year and an estimated 31% of US adults reported anxiety at some time in their lives. Anxiety can be experienced throughout one's life and levels of anxiety can increase with stressful life events, physical health conditions, and medication use. Chronic, untreated anxiety has been linked to headaches, dizziness, depression, high blood pressure, heart disease, digestive disorders, and a worsened immune system - greatly impacting one's overall quality of life (QOL).\n\nAnxiety and depression are highly comorbid, with approximately 50-60% of those with anxiety symptoms also experiencing depression symptoms. Experiencing these disorders and symptoms comorbidly may further worsen one's mental health and overall QOL. Untreated, chronic depression can heighten symptoms of depression leading to increased risk of heart disease, sleep disruptions, weight gain/loss, a weakened immune system, physical pains, and suicide attempts.\n\nAnxiety and depression are commonly treated using various psychotherapeutic techniques including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy techniques administered by a licensed therapist. However, therapy has many barriers to treatment including insurance not covering treatments, overall treatment cost, unsure where to seek treatment/no access to a therapist, and therapy being unavailable and inconvenient due to scheduling during the workday. As such, app-based mental health tools have increased in popularity to improve access and affordability to effective mental health treatments.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to examine the effectiveness of a guided anxiety/depression app-based program by Headspace, which uses CBT with mindfulness to improve anxiety and depression symptoms in a population with elevated baseline anxiety and/or depression. The study will employ a 2-arm app-based intervention involving 1 active intervention and a waitlist control for a duration of 3 weeks, followed by a 3-week follow-up assessment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will complete the informed consent procedure and the baseline assessment consisting of the study's primary outcomes of anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-8) and the secondary outcome measures including sleep quality using the PSQI, perceived stress using the PSS-10, mindfulness using the MAAS, well-being using the WEMWBS, and report use of prescription medication. After the baseline assessment, participants will be randomized into one of two groups (Headspace Anxiety/Depression Program or waitlist control). Participants will participate in the intervention/waitlist control group for 3 weeks. Having completed the 3 week intervention, participants will complete the post-intervention assessment consisting of the primary and secondary outcome measures. Finally, participants will complete the follow-up assessment 3 weeks after post-intervention with a questionnaire to assess changes in routines (including physical activity, prescription medication use or treatments), and the primary and secondary outcome measures."
