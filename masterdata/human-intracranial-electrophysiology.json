            "briefSummary": "This study will enroll patients with epilepsy who are being evaluated for epilepsy surgery and have electrodes implanted in the brain and/or have electrodes on the scalp. Additionally, this study will recruit normal and online controls (participants who do not have epilepsy). Participants will be asked to participate in 1 to 2 (30-90 minutes) daily sessions designed to test aspects of human cognition such as memory, speech, language, feeling, movement, attention, sound perception, and emotions. Generally, this will involve working on a computer, looking at pictures or watching videos, and answering questions. Additionally, participants may be asked to be hooked up to additional equipment such as eye tracker, electrical stimulator, heart rate monitor, sweat monitor or other non-invasive equipment. The overall aim of this study is to use human intracranial electrophysiology (the recording of the electrical activity of the human brain) to study localization and function of the human brain.",
            "detailedDescription": "This project aims to study the mechanisms of brain function by using Human Intracranial Electrophysiology (HIE) methods and is a continuation of the \"Localization of Human Brain Function\" study done at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). HIE refers to the recording of brain signals using electrodes which are surgically inserted into the human brain for the clinical purpose of localizing the origins of epileptic seizures.\n\nSecondary to clinical goals, such patients with intracranial EEG electrodes can be safely recruited to participate in research studies, i.e. the research \"piggybacks\" on procedures that are performed strictly for a clinical purpose. Brain signals obtained using HIE methods during performance of specific tasks have unique properties rich with insight into the inner workings of the human brain. HIE methods can be used together with electrical brain stimulation (EBS) techniques to better understand relationship between brain and behavior. Furthermore, HIE methods can be recorded together with other non-invasive bio-physiological data streams such as pupillometry, electrodermal activity (EDA), cardiac monitoring, and respiratory monitoring to understand the relationship between the brain and many aspects of human physiology."
