Individuals who meet inclusion criteria at the facilities collecting data will be invited to participate. If they agree to participate, they will randomly and blindly (via concealed envelopes) be assigned to the control (routine treatment) or the sensorimotor treatment group. Data collection will occur at 3- and 6-weeks post initiation of skilled therapy and will include measurement of joint position sense, function via the Patient Rated Wrist and Hand, pain via the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and range of motion at the digits and wrist.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is an interventional study investigating the effectiveness of sensorimotor activities in addition to traditional occupational therapy intervention versus traditional intervention only for patients following a distal radius fracture with volar plate fixation. A convenience sample of patients from 2 outpatient orthopedic hand therapy departments will be invited to participate in the study.\n\nThe treatment for both groups will be identical with one group receiving the addition of sensorimotor activities. Participants will be divided into one of the two groups. They will be made aware that at any point they can choose to no longer participate in the study, and it will not affect their treatment."
