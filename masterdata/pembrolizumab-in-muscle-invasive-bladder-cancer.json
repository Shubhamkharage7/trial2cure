After completing two cycles of pembrolizumab, subjects will undergo a restaging MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with a standard acquisition protocol (as outlined in the protocol) as well as CT chest. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis may be performed if there are contraindications to MRI. Patients will also undergo a restaging cystoscopy and biopsies/TURBT as outlined in the protocol.\n\nPatients achieving a clinical complete response to treatment (defined in the protocol) will proceed with \"maintenance\" single agent pembrolizumab followed by surveillance. All other patients will proceed with standard of care local therapy as per their treating physicians followed by \"adjuvant\" pembrolizumab."
