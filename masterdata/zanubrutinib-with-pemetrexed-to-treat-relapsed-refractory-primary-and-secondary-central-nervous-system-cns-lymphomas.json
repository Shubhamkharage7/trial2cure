Assessments include how well people respond to this treatment, whether their disease gets better or worse, and their survival. Safety of this treatment and its side effects also will be assessed.",

Zanubrutinib is an oral drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as safe and effective to treat certain lymphoma types."
