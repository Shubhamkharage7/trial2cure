The study will consist of 2 parts: a Phase 1, with safety, dose-finding, and dosimetry components, and a Phase 2, with assessment of efficacy and safety utilising the dose selected from Phase 1. Both phases will include subjects with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive mCRPC as detected using 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 diagnostic IMP."

Any uncontrolled significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition or laboratory finding that would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with study participation or interpretation of individual subject results.\n11. Ongoing treatment with bisphosphonates for bone-targeted therapy.\n12. Severe urinary incontinence that would preclude safe disposal of radioactive urine.\n13. Single kidney or renal transplant or any concomitant nephrotoxic therapy that might put the subject at high risk of renal toxicity during the study in the judgement of the investigator.\n14. Clinically significant abnormalities on a single 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening.\n15. Previously received external beam irradiation to a field that includes more than 30% of the bone marrow or kidneys.\n16. Previous treatment with any of the following: PSMA targeted radionuclide therapy, Strontium-89, Samarium-153, Rhenium 186, Rhenium-188, Radium-223, hemi-body irradiation.\n17.
