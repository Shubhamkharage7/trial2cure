To our knowledge, there is no consensus in the literature on what symptoms constitute a wearing-off effect, nor is there a single validated scale that measures wearing-off effect. The current study will explore the wearing-off effect associated with OCR and OMB, using a variety of validated scales assessing MS symptoms (i.e., fatigue, mobility, pain, depression, cognition), as well as some global questions on wearing-off. In addition, impact of worsening of MS symptoms on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and their work productivity will be assessed using relevant MS-specific validated scales",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be a non-interventional, primary data collection study in patients with MS treated with an established anti-CD20 treatment regimen (OCR or OMB) in the United States. Patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study will be surveyed at four timepoints at the beginning and the end of OCR or OMB treatment cycles according to the following assessment schedule:\n\n* Assessment 1. 0-10 days before 1st dose post-enrollment (index dose)\n* Assessment 2: 5-14 days after index dose\n* Assessment 3: 0-10 days before 2nd dose post-enrollment (follow-up dose)\n* Assessment 4: 5-14 days after follow-up dose dose"
