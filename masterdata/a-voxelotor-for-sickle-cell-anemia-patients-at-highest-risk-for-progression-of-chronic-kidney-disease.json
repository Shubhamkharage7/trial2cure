Any condition affecting drug absorption, such as major surgery involving the stomach or small intestine (prior cholecystectomy is acceptable)\n10. Participated in another clinical trial of an investigational agent (or medical device) within 30 days or 5 half-lives of date of informed consent, whichever is longer, or is currently participating in another trial of an investigational agent (or medical device)\n11. Inadequate venous access as determined by the investigator/site staff\n12. Medical, psychological, or behavioral conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may preclude safe participation, confound study interpretation, interfere with compliance, or preclude informed consent\n13.
