            "briefSummary": "Primary purpose is to identify individuals who have PCD due to a genetic mutation within the DNAI1 and other genes of interest to help refer participants to future clinical studies for this rare disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "The aim of this study is to identify individuals with Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) through a screening questionnaire that enriches for likely pathogenic gene mutations in DNAI1 and other genes of interest associated with PCD. Identified individuals will be referred to relevant upcoming clinical trials. This study will also obtain information on the proportion of individuals with PCD who have mutations in DNAI1, and other PCD genes of interest. Additional goals include increasing the awareness of patients and healthcare providers (HCPs) of the importance of genetic testing in PCD, and engaging their interest in future clinical studies.\n\nPCD is a genetically heterogenous disease characterized by impaired ciliary movement in the lungs, paranasal sinuses, reproductive system, and Eustachian tubes. PCD can result in a range of clinical presentations, including pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections, chronic sinus infections, and recurrent ear infections, among others. The estimated incidence of PCD is one in 10,000 people. Mutations in over 40 genes have been shown to cause PCD, with commonly implicated genes being DNAH5, DNAI1, and DNAH11.\n\nThere is currently a lack of effective diagnostic tools for PCD; an estimated 46,000 people with PCD remain undiagnosed in the United States. Genetic testing represents a potential method to diagnose PCD.\n\nIndividuals with a confirmed PCD diagnosis, or those strongly suspected to have PCD by HCPs, will complete an online informed consent form and a questionnaire to identify pathogenic mutations. Following consent, individuals will be sent no-cost genetic testing kits and guidance on collecting saliva samples. The saliva samples will be assessed by whole exome sequencing for a number of the genes implicated in PCD, including DNAI1. Individuals with identified DNAI1 mutations will be referred to the ReCode Therapeutics, Inc.'s RCT1100 Virtual Waiting Room and retained for potential future clinical trials through a continuing engagement scheme. Individuals with other PCD-causing mutations will also be retained for potential future clinical trials. Counselling will be available to all individuals in the study."
