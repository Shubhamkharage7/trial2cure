            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial evaluates how a virtually supervised exercise intervention in combination with group counseling affects inflammation and the bacterial composition (microbiome) of the gut in smokers who are at high risk for lung cancer. Physical exercise has been shown to reduce lung cancer development and to have beneficial effects on the gut microbiome and inflammation. Group counseling may promote adherence to the exercise intervention by empowering participants to exert greater control over their behavior and environment. This clinical trial may help researchers understand how exercise impacts inflammation and the microbiome in people at risk for lung cancer and whether or not exercise with counseling can improve health outcomes in high-risk individuals.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of establishing a multi-component virtually-delivered exercise intervention trial with longitudinal biomarker and microbiome collection in the Ohio State University Lung Cancer Screening Clinic (OSULCSC).\n\nII. To determine the impact of the multi-component virtually-delivered exercise intervention on the microbiome and inflammatory biomarkers.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Participants receive the supervised aerobic and resistance exercise intervention over 1 hour via telehealth twice a week (BIW) in weeks 1-8 and once a week (QW) in weeks 9-12 and then continue with unsupervised exercise sessions BIW in weeks 13-52. Participants also attend group counseling sessions over 1 hour QW in weeks 1-8 and bi-weekly in weeks 9-12. Participants also wear a Fitbit throughout the trial and undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and follow up.\n\nGROUP II: Participants receive usual care consisting of education on standard recommendations for physical activity, the benefits of exercise, and an example of a light walking program. Participants also wear a Fitbit throughout the trial and undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and follow up.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, participants are followed up at 12 weeks and 1 year."
