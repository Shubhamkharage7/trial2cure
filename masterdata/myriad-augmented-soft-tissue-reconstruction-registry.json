Surgical technique for the participants reconstruction is at the discretion of the attending physician. Use of Myriad Matrix\u2122 or Morcells as part of the surgery shall be per the products Instructions for Use. Myriad Matrix\u2122 devices may be implanted or used for dermal regeneration as part of the participants surgical procedure. Myriad Morcells\u2122 may be used for dermal regeneration and in combination with the Myriad Matrix\u2122 devices. The participants post-operative care is at the discretion of the attending physician.\n\nEarly and late-stage healing outcomes will be assessed as part of the study and as part of standard of care.\n\nThrough the course of treatment and following up care de-identified patient data (quantitative qualitative assessment measures and digital images) will be captured and from the basis of the registry dataset."
