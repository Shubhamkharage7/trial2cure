The Investigator will perform ordinal logistic regression accounting for repeated measures data for participants who are not using contraception. The Investigator will assess participant characteristics to see if the Investigator need to adjust for other covariates including age, race, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI).\n\nSince contraception can mask an elevated FSH surge from gonadal failure, the Investigator will perform a similar model for participants on contraception using AMH only."
