Patients will receive two sessions prior to inpatient admission for HCT, and four sessions in the two weeks of hospitalization following HCT, for a total of six intervention (or control) sessions.\n\nPrimary Objective: Determine the feasibility of implementing MAP-I among HCT recipients under first autologous HCT for MM."
