            "briefSummary": "Participants will be randomized into one of two different experimental groups: 1) Exercise group and 2) No exercise (control group). Subject participation in the study will involve a series of metabolic tests before and after participants undergo a 10% weight loss program (with or without exercise training depending on group randomization). After completing this weight loss portion of the study, participants will then be required to adhere to a high calorie diet program to regain half of the weight the participant lost - followed by the same series of metabolic tests.",
            "detailedDescription": "Exercise is among the first line treatments for obesity and obesity-related diseases, yet it is shocking how little is known about how exercise works to improve health. Expanding the knowledge about novel exercise-induced adaptations in fat tissue of obese individuals and furthering the understanding about mechanisms underlying these adaptations could lead to innovative approaches for preventing and treating insulin resistance and obesity-related diseases.\n\nOverall, the researchers believe that exercise training modifies key processes in subcutaneous fat tissue that may contribute to an increase body fat storage capacity (without increasing fat mass). The research team anticipates that exercise will evoke an even more potent adaptive response when fat tissue is dynamically changing in response to alterations in nutritional status (i.e., weight loss and weight regain).\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of two different experimental groups: 1) Exercise group and 2) No exercise (control group). Subject participation in the study will involve a series of metabolic tests before and after participants undergo a 10% weight loss program (with or without exercise training depending on group randomization). After completing this weight loss portion of the study, participants will then be required to adhere to a high calorie diet program to regain half of the weight the participant lost - followed by the same series of metabolic tests. After the participant completes the study, the study team will help the participant to lose more weight. Total involvement in the study for each participant will likely be about 8-10 months."
