The researchers will test different doses of 2141-V11 to see which dose is safest in people. The researchers will also do tests to see how the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of 2141-V11. This study is one of the first to test 2141-V11 in people, and the first to test 2141-V11 delivered through a catheter into the bladder."
