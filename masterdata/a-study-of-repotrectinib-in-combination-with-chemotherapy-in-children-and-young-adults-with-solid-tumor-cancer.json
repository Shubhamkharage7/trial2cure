            "briefSummary": "This study will test the safety of the study drug, repotrectinib, in combination with chemotherapy (irinotecan and temozolomide) in children and young adults who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We researchers will try to find the highest dose of the study drug that causes few or mild side effects in study participants. When the researchers find this dose, we will evaluate it in a different group of participants to find out whether repotrectinib in combination with chemotherapy is an effective treatment for children and young adults who have advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Another purpose of the study is to look at the way the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of repotrectinib.",
            "detailedDescription": "Part A : TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) will be given orally (without regard to food) once daily for 14 days, then increased to twice daily for remainder of cycles and concurrently administered with chemotherapy backbone described below. If a patient is enrolled on DL3, cycle length will be 21 days, repotrectinib will be administered once daily x 14 days followed by twice daily if tolerated for remainder of therapy. For patients less than 12 years old or less than 50kg, adult equivalent dosing (AED) will be used Approximately 4-24 pediatric subjects will be enrolled into 2-4 dose levels (pending if DL-1 or DL-1b are utilized), with maximum of 6 subjects per dose level according to the 'rolling 6' design. Starting dose of TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) will begin at dose level (DL) 1.\n\nPart B (PK expansion cohort for patients \\<12 years old): Up to six patients \\<12 years old will be included in a PK expansion cohort after the maximum tolerated dose in Part A has been determined. The number of patients included in part B will be based on the the number of patients \\<12 years old enrolled on part A. A minimum of 6 patients \\<12 will be included in parts A and B combined.\n\nPhase 2: Patients will be enrolled into one of the following 3 cohorts and will be treated at the RP2D of TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) plus chemotherapy as determined in Phase 1.\n\nCohort 1 (Neuroblastoma ALK point mutation) Cohort 2 (Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor) Cohort 3 (Exploratory)\n\nOf note for patients enrolled to Dose Level 3 (21 day cycles), there will be no D22 assessements performed."

Females of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy during the study and agree to the use of 2 effective contraceptive methods (hormonal and barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and in the following 1 month after discontinuation of study treatment. Men with partner(s) of childbearing potential must take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering a child from screening until 6 months after discontinuation of study treatment and to use appropriate barrier contraception or abstinence.\n* Ability to comply with outpatient visits, laboratory testing, and study procedures during study participation\n* The patient, parent or guardian must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent approved (in addition to pediatric assent, if required) by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any screening or study specific procedures.\n* Age:\n\n  * Phase 1 (Part A): \u2264 30 years old (age at C1D1)\n  * Phase 1 (Part B): \\< 12 years old (age at C1D1)\n  * Phase 2: \u2264 30 years old (age at C1D1)\n* Disease:\n\n  * Phase 1: Pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors (including primary CNS tumors).
