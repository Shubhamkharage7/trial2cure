Specifically, the investigators are looking to assess the optimal implementation of such machine learning algorithms in simulation scenarios to best engender trust and improve usability. Participants will be randomized to either machine learning algorithm alone or algorithm with a large language model interface and exposed to simulation cases of upper GIB.",
            "detailedDescription": "The experiment will deploy a previously validated machine learning algorithm trained on existing clinical datasets within simulation scenarios in which a patient with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (at low, moderate, and high risk for poor outcome) is evaluated.\n\nPrior to the simulation, a baseline educational module about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and clinical decision support will be provided to all participants. The investigators will establish psychological safety by detailing what is available in the room, the opportunity to call a consultant, and availability of laboratory and radiographic studies. Each clinical scenario will run for approximately 10 minutes based on real patient cases where vital signs change over time and laboratory values are made available at specific points in the assessment. The study will evaluate the effect of a large language model-based interaction with the machine learning algorithm with interpretability dashboard compared to the machine learning algorithm with interpretability dashboard alone. Each participant will receive three scenarios in randomized order of risk.\n\nFor the large language model interaction arm, participants will be provided the computer workstation a LLM chatbot interface of the algorithm and interpretability dashboard For the machine learning dashboard arm, participants will be provided the computer workstation with the algorithm and interpretability dashboard."
