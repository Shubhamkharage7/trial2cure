            "briefSummary": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises from abnormal immune cell-mediated injury to beta cells that make insulin. The injured beta cells can then no longer make the needed amount of insulin to stay healthy. However, in the early stages of T1D, some beta cells are still alive and functioning. Treatment to protect the beta cells against injury at this time could slow the progress of disease. Denosumab is an approved treatment for osteoporosis (a disease that thins and weakens the bones), high blood calcium levels, bone cancer, and other bone problems in patients who have cancer. The research team has found that the bone pathway that denosumab works on to treat these bone conditions also has effects on the health of the beta cells. Lab studies suggest that denosumab may protect and/or increase the number of beta cells and improve how well they work. This study will test whether denosumab is safe and improves beta cell function and blood sugar control in people with early T1D.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1/2, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of denosumab for improving beta cell function and glycemic control among patients with early T1D and detectable C-peptide. The efficacy of denosumab will be evaluated by changes in C-peptide level during mixed meal tolerance test and achieving a clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction at 12 months. Subjects will be followed for 12 months for adverse events and for changes in beta cell function and glycemic control parameters.\n\nSubjects will be randomized with a 2:1 treatment to placebo ratio. The treatment group will enroll 30 subjects with the denosumab regimen of 60 mg given subcutaneously every 3 months for a total of 4 injections. The placebo arm will enroll 15 subjects and be administered with normal saline placebo given subcutaneously every 3 months for a total of 4 doses."
