Additionally, an exploratory arm will enroll 20 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who are scheduled to receive EV in combination with pembrolizumab as standard of care. All subjects will have histologically and radiographically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2, and meet baseline laboratory data as outlined in the section 4.1."
