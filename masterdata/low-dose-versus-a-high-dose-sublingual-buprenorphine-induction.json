Study participants will be randomized to either the low-dose (n=20) or high dose (n=20) group and dispensed medication daily for one week. Thereafter, they will be treated according to the MATClinics usual schedule of clinic visits. The number and timing of visits may vary according to whether the participant is still using illicit opioids. Follow-up visits for the study will be at one and three months.The primary objective is to determine whether patients randomly assigned to low versus high dose induction regimens are more likely to complete the 7-day induction period. Secondary outcomes are the number of patients who develop precipitated withdrawal or other adverse events, experience subjective opioid withdrawal symptoms, use adjunctive medications (hydroxyzine, loperamide, dicyclomine, clonidine, ibuprofen, methocarbamol, trazodone, ondansetron) provided by the clinic, recommendation of the medication induction scheme to other patients, and treatment retention at 1- and 3- months post induction."
