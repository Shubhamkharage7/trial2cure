            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThis research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) genetic mutation. The EGFR gene produces a protein that helps cells divide. Specific changes or a mutation in the genetic information causes abnormal cell division and can lead to lung cancer. Patients who have NSCLC with an EGFR gene mutation can be treated by drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). They may stop (or \"inhibit\") the effect of the mutation in the EGFR gene.\n\n- Osimertinib has been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for this disease."

Screening for chronic conditions is not required. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with osimertinib.\n  * cardiac ejection fraction of \\< 45%\n  * Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol\n* Known to be T790M+ (on pre-treatment tumor or plasma) or known germline T790M.

Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of osimertinib on the development of the fetus are unknown, and there is potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with osimertinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with osimertinib.",
