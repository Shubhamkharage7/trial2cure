Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days.\n* Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT).\n* Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.\n* Breast feeding women.\n* Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the prior 2 weeks.\n* Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 2 weeks.\n* Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment.\n* Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib.\n* Resting ECG with QTc \\> 500 ms and/or indication of uncontrolled cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g. unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, electrolyte disturbances, etc.), or patients with congenital and/or family history of long QT syndrome.\n* Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks. During the study, if co-administration of a strong or moderate inhibitor is required because there is no suitable alternative medication, exception to this criterion may be allowed with a suitable dose reduction of olaparib.\n* Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for phenobarbital or enzalutamide and 3 weeks for other agents.\n* Persistent toxicities (\\> Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia.\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery.\n* Poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n* Unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication.\n* Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the product.\n* Known active hepatitis (i.e. Hepatitis B or C) due to risk of transmitting the infection through blood or other body fluids.\n* No packed red blood cells and/or platelet transfusions within the last 28 days prior to study entry.",
