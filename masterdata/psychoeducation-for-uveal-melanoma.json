UM patients face an uncertain course of survivorship in terms of their visual acuity, treatment-related side effects, and risk for eventual metastasis of the cancer. Learning about patients' thoughts and reactions to informational resources may better support patients during ocular melanoma survivorship.",

To assess the efficacy of the psychoeducation intervention (compared to the control condition) in modifying illness perceptions of disease control, chronicity, and coherence (i.e., to become less threatening) over the course of the follow-up period.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy of the psychoeducation intervention (compared to the control condition) in reducing the degree of participant's depressive and anxiety symptoms over the course of the follow-up period.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants watch two fifteen-minute educational videos and receive a mental health resource information sheet on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive enhanced treatment as usual and receive a mental health resource information sheet on study."
