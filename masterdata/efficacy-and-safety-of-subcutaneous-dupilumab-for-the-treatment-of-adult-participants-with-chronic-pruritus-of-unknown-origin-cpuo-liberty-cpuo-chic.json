Study B design may be adapted based on the results of Study A.\n\nFor both Study A and B, after an up-to-4-week screening period, participants with severe pruritus (worst-itch numerical rating scale \\[WI-NRS \u22657) will enter a 4-week run-in period during with a non-sedative antihistamine and an emollient (moisturizer). Participants with severe pruritus (WI-NRS \u22657) at baseline will be randomized (1:1) to be treated for 24 weeks (Study A) or 12 weeks (Study B) with either dupilumab or matching placebo in addition to their antihistamine and emollient regimen.
