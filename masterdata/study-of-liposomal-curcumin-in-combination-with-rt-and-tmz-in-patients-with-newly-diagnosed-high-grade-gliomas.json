            "detailedDescription": "This study is a Phase 1/2, single-center, single-institution, open-label, dose-escalation study in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade malignant gliomas. Dose finding will be performed using a time-to-event Bayesian optimal interval (TITE-BOIN) rule-based schema.\n\nThe primary objectives of the study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose /recommended phase 2 dose of Liposomal Curcumin (LC) in combination with radiotherapy (RT), and TMZ and adjuvant TMZ in newly diagnosed High-Grade Gliomas, and to determine the safety and tolerability of LC IV infused over 3-hours.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to estimate the safety and tolerability of LC in combination with standard RT and TMZ and adjuvant TMZ, to determine the feasibility of weekly LC infusion, defined as the number of patients being able to complete 80% of the planned doses of LC, 80% of RT, and 60% of TMZ within the first 10 weeks of treatment, and to assess efficacy as defined by overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) observed for each dose level.\n\nThis study is an unblinded, sequential treatment intervention employing 3 dose levels.\n\nApproximately 50 patients will be screened to achieve up to 30 patients assigned to study intervention.\n\nThe duration of treatment for each patient will be up to 34 weeks. Treatment starts with the beginning of infusion and ends, if tolerated, at the end of Cycle 6 of adjuvant TMZ."
