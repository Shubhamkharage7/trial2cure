            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nInfluenza (flu) vaccinations are required for all NIH staff members who have direct contact with patients. COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for persons 6 months of age and older. Researchers want to learn about immunity in NIH staff members who get a flu and/or COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo understand what happens to the body s immune system throughout the year after getting the flu and/or COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older who work at NIH and plan to get the current season s flu vaccine and/or COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will not get any vaccines as part of this study.\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history and medicine review. They will get a survey via email. It will ask about their flu and SARS-CoV-2 history and vaccinations.\n\nParticipants will have 12 monthly visits at NIH. If during that year they get both flu and SARS-COV-2 vaccines, their participation will be extended.\n\nOnce a month, participants will be contacted. They will discuss any new medicines, recent vaccinations, or changes in medical history.\n\nOnce a month, participants will have blood drawn.\n\nOnce a month, participants will have nasal sampling. A small, flat absorptive strip will be placed in the nostril to soak up mucus. Participants will press against the outside of their nostril with their finger for 1 minute.\n\nParticipants may be able to collect samples at home and mail them to NIH if they are not able to visit in person.\n\nParticipation will last for about 12 13 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nYearly influenza vaccination is necessary due to short-lasting influenza immunity and changing strains of circulating influenza. With limited effectiveness of yearly influenza vaccines and the ongoing potential for an influenza pandemic, there is a need for a better understanding of influenza immunity to develop improved vaccines. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) vaccines have been developed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is a critical need to also understand the changes in long-term immunity in those who receive a SARS CoV-2 vaccine to develop improved vaccines. We will investigate the changes in long-term immunity of NIH workers after vaccination with influenza and/or SARS-CoV-2 and throughout the following year via blood and nasal sampling.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nCharacterize the systemic anti-influenza humoral immune response to vaccination over 1 year.\n\nCharacterize the systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response to vaccination over 1 year.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nCharacterize the nasal mucosal anti-influenza humoral immune response to vaccination over 1 year.\n\nCharacterize the nasal mucosal anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response to vaccination over 1 year.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n1. Systemic anti-influenza antibodies as measured by:\n\n   1. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers\n   2. Neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) antibody titers\n   3. Anti-Hemagglutinin (HA) head antibody quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (immunoglobulin \\[Ig\\] M, IgG, IgA)\n   4. Anti-HA stalk antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)\n   5. Anti-Neuraminidase (NA) antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)\n2. Systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as measured by:\n\n   1. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)\n   2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n1. Mucosal anti-influenza antibodies from nasal samples as measured by:\n\n   1. Anti-HA head antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)\n   2. Anti-HA stalk antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)\n   3. Anti-NA antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)\n2. Mucosal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from nasal samples as measured by:\n\n   1. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)\n   2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)\n\nStudy Population:\n\nNIH staff (N=100) who are 18 years and older. NIH staff may include employees and contractors, fellows and volunteers. Accrual ceiling N=150.\n\nDescription of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:\n\nParticipants will be enrolled at the NIH Clinical Center (CC).\n\nStudy Duration:\n\n5 years"
