            "briefSummary": "Engagement in HIV medical care and adherence to HIV medications are both essential in improving health outcomes among people living with HIV (PLH), but PLH living in rural areas-who suffer higher mortality rates than their urban counterparts-can confront multiple barriers to care engagement and adherence, especially as they face the logistical, medical, and social challenges associated with aging. This project will test the efficacy of two interventions to determine their impact on HIV health outcomes and quality of life among rural, older PLH living in the Southern U.S. The two interventions, adapted from evidence-based interventions and delivered remotely, are: (1) supportive-expressive peer social support groups and (2) strengths-based case management. We hypothesize that both interventions will increase viral suppression, antiretroviral therapy adherence, and health-related quality of life and decrease depressive symptoms. Results from this study will provide us with tools to improve health outcomes for rural older people living with HIV."
