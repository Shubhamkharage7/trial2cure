            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nBrain activity produces magnetic fields. These fields can be measured outside the head. Existing technology, called MEG, measures these fields. Researchers are testing a new type of magnetic field sensor called OPM. They hope it can help pinpoint with very high accuracy where brain activity is generated.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo develop and test a new type of sensor for measuring the magnetic fields produced by brain activity.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people ages 18-65 who had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan under protocol 17-M-0181.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants may be asked to complete sessions on both the traditional MEG instrument and the OPM array.\n\nFor the MEG, 3 small coils will be placed on the participant s face with tape. Their head will be positioned inside the MEG device.\n\nFor the OPM, sensors are housed in a 3d printed array. The sensors will be attached to a cap placed on the participant s head.\n\nFor both scans, participants will be seated in a chair inside a magnetically shielded room. They may complete several tasks. In one task, plastic cells will be placed on their fingers. Puffs of air will be sent to these cells, which will stimulate the sense of touch. Other tasks may include the following stimuli: visual (such as checkerboards), auditory (such as beeps and tones), or language (words and letters).\n\nResearchers may also obtain recordings while they stimulate the nerve in the participant s forearm using electrical current in small electrodes.\n\nParticipation is expected to last for 1 day. Additional optional scans may be offered for up to 1 year....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis protocol is a technical development protocol to characterize an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) array used for measuring magnetic brain signals. We hypothesize that with our OPM arrays, we can achieve similar or better spatial resolution to that of a conventional MEG system.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective 1: To fully characterize the performance of an OPM MEG array.\n\nPrimary Objective 2: To demonstrate that the OPM system can produce somatotopic maps accurately differentiating receptive fields of each finger. If successful, we will additionally determine if the system can differentiate receptive fields of each phalanx.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: OPM array characterization parameters including signal to noise, sensitivity, bandwidth, and spatial\n\nresolution, and comparison to similar parameters acquired on a standard SQID system.\n\nSecondary Endpoint: Somatotopic representations of the digits of the hand"
