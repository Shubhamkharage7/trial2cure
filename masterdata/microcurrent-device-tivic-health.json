This study is a prospective randomized controlled study. Enrolled subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either an active neuromodulation study device or a sham device that appears identical to the active device while emitting no therapeutic microcurrent. Subjects will self-treat with the device at home and will be followed for 2 weeks after FESS."
