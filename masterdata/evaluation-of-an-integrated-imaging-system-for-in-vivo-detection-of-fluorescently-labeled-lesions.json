Specifically, this study will test the sensitivity and specificity of the Smart Goggles to detect indocyanine green (ICG) accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer patients after peritumoral injection of ICG (Cardio-GreenTM), under standard-of-care application conditions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective -Positive fluorescence signal in SLNs imaged by the Smart Goggles system.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* Confirmation of ICG within lesions per histologic tissue exam by SLN biopsy.\n* Comparison of lesions detected by the Smart Goggles vs. lesions detected using SPY/Quest/PDE vs. gold standard of gamma probe and blue dyes.\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\n-Collection of preliminary data for a future, powered study for lymphatic mapping in breast cancer\n\nStudy Design This is an unpowered pilot study to determine the sensitivity of the new Smart Goggles device, for detection of ICG fluorescence in SLNs of breast cancers in a clinical setting. The investigators have chosen to examine ICG as the contrast agent and breast cancer as the clinical target, because this agent is FDA-approved and is regularly used for lymphatic mapping (skin cancers). The study team will be applying ICG for the same length of time as the standard-of-care procedures including radiotracers and blue dyes. The study involves a single visit, lasting \\~3-4 hours total. Multiple SLN biopsies will be performed if multiple SLNs are identified."

The prototype system has 2 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensors housed on a printed circuit board (PCB) with imaging lenses and emission filters optimized for ICG dye. The light source provides concurrent excitation centered at 780 nm and white light illumination with OD6 level cut-off.
