The study agent will be assessed for safety (stopping rules defined) and antiviral activity.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary purpose of this phase I study is to assess the safety of administering donor-derived CSTs in immunocompromised participants for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Related and unrelated donors of participants who are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be enrolled for screening and production of CSTs from peripheral blood. Following product manufacturing, participants who have undergone HSCT will receive donor-derived CSTs for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThis will be a dose escalation study with separate study arms for adult (Arm A) and pediatric (Arm B) recipients of HSCT who are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants who have undergone HSCT and test negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection will be enrolled and receive one dose of CST product derived from their HSCT donor for prophylaxis. Participants aged \u226518 years and \\<80 years will be enrolled on Arm A and participants who are \u226512 years of age and \\<18 years of age will be enrolled on Arm B. Investigators will test three doses: 1x107 /m2, 2x107 /m2, and 4x107 /m2. At least 3 adult participants (Arm A) will be enrolled at each dose level before pediatric participants (Arm B) are enrolled. At each dose level, treatment of the first two adult participants enrolled at that dose level will be staggered at least 28 days apart and each will be followed for the 45-day safety monitoring period to assess safety and efficacy. Once the third adult participant on any given dose level has completed their 45-day safety monitoring period and the safety and efficacy data is reviewed and approved by the FDA, then adult participants can be escalated to the next dose level and pediatric participants can start enrollment at the dose level completed by the adult participants. If participants show evidence of safety and at least 2 of 3 have evidence of antiviral immune reconstitution against SARS-CoV-2, investigators will enroll pediatric participants at that dose level following FDA approval.\n\nAdditionally, infusion of pediatric participants enrolled at each dose level will be staggered at least 28 days apart, and all enrolled participants will be followed for 45 days for safety monitoring after CST infusion."

Participants with neurological or psychiatric disorders that would, in the opinion of the investigators, place them at increased risk of harm, impact the investigator's abilities to screen for adverse events in the subject, or impair the subject's ability to provide informed consent.\n17. Participants receiving checkpoint inhibitors within the previous 3 months prior to CST infusion, including nivolumimab, pembroluzimab, or other related medications.\n18. Participants with proven or suspected MIS (in both adults and children) based on the CDC definition and investigator judgement.\n19. Participants who are breastfeeding.\n20.
