            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test IC14 (atibuclimab) in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and who have an implantable cardoverter/defibrillator in place. ACM is also called arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARV) or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The main questions the study aims to answer are the effect of treatment on blood markers of inflammation, safety, and pharmacokinetics. There will also be measurements of myocardial imaging of C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2+) immune cells (optional), monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias using the patient's pre-existing intracardiac cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) and a Holter monitor, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), and blood tests. Results will be compared to baseline; there is no inactive placebo treatment group.\n\nParticipants will be asked to undergo screening and baseline testing, then receive 4 intravenous infusions with blood measurements before and after the infusion (including 24, 48, and 72 hours and 7, 14, and 28 days). Participants will be offered specialized scanning of the heart muscle, and will be asked to provide recordings from their ICD, undergo Holter monitoring twice, and have electrocardiograms (ECG), echocardiograms (ECHO) and blood tests.",
            "detailedDescription": "This proof-of-concept study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of IC14 administered via IV infusion in patients with ACM.\n\nIn preclinical studies, anti-CD14 treatment prevented the development of ventricular dysfunction and cardiac damage in a mouse model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe objective of this study is to determine whether IC14 treatment reduces markers of inflammation and disease biomarkers in ACM patients treated with IC14. Secondary objectives are to further characterize the effect of IC14 treatment on CCR2+ cell myocardial infiltration measured by myocardial positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging, ventricular premature contractions (VPCs), other arrhythmias, ICD discharges, NYHA functional classification, and quality of life.\n\nTo characterize safety of IC14, the following assessments are to be performed: clinical biochemistry (safety analyses), ECG, ECHO, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and formation of anti-drug antibodies.\n\nFinally, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters will be conducted. These include blood test measurements levels of the drug and its binding to its target in the serum and on cells.\n\nThis study will assign 5 patients to intravenous (IV) administration of IC14 (atibulcimab) at 20 mg/kg. The study drug will be administered every three weeks via IV infusion, for a total of 4 infusions (12 weeks of treatment)."
