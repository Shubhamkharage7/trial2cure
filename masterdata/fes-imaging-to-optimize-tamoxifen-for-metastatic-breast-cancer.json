A common driver of resistance are known ESR1 mutations that lead to constitutively active receptor signaling and transcriptional regulation that is always \"turned on\" despite the absence of estrogen. Patients with ESR1 mutations are expected to have decreased binding affinity for tamoxifen and thus may be underdosed on standard therapy. \\[18F\\]-fluoroestradiol Positron Emission Tomography/Computed tomography (FES-PET/CT) imaging is a novel functional imaging technique that can non-invasively measure ER\u03b1 expression and inhibition in metastatic ER\u03b1+ breast cancer. The proposed a pilot study uses FES-PET/CT imaging to measure ER\u03b1 blockade to determine the optimal dose of tamoxifen in patients with ESR1 mutations."

If equivalent medication is not available, QTcF should be closely monitored.\n* Tamoxifen has demonstrated vaginal bleeding, birth defects and fetal loss in pregnant women.

Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must not be pregnant (confirmed by a negative urine/serum pregnancy test within 14 days of tamoxifen treatment). In addition, a medically acceptable method of birth control must be used such as an intrauterine device (IUD), use of a double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream), or total abstinence during the study participation and for 3 months after last dose of study drug. Women who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) are not considered to be WOCP.\n* Ongoing treatment with other investigational agents. Participants cannot be receiving concomitant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, experimental therapy or any other therapy not otherwise outlined by the trial for the purposes of anti-cancer treatment.\n* History of uterine malignancy unless participant has had hysterectomy with no evidence recurrent disease for \u2265 3 years from definitive therapy.\n* Concurrent malignancy except for the following:\n\n  * Basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer\n  * In situ cervical cancer\n* The following medications are contraindicated or must be used with caution.\n\n  * Contraindicated:\n\n    * CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 strong inhibitors\n    * CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 strong inducers\n  * Use with caution:\n\n    * CYP2C9 sensitive substrates\n    * CYP2D6 moderate inhibitors or inducers\n    * CYP3A4 moderate inhibitors or inducers\n\nNote: Transdermal products designed for systemic delivery must be assessed for interaction potential. Topical products not designed to provide systemic delivery (including inhaled products, ophthalmologic products and transvaginal preparations) do not need to be considered.\n\nContraindicated medications are not allowed. Participants taking these concurrent medications are ineligible unless they can discontinue or switch to alternative medications prior to initiation of study drug (at least 5 half-lives).\n\nUse with caution agents are permitted if a) discontinuation is not feasible or b) no acceptable alternatives are available as determined by the treating physician; however, caution should be used. Consider monitoring by symptoms, labs or drug levels and dose adjustments of the medication.\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent clinically significant illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.",
