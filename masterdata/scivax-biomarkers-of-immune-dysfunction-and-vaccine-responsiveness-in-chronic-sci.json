            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research study is to measure a person's immune response to a vaccine by measuring types of circulating white blood cells (WBC) and the substances they produce in blood, including antibodies, proteins, and ribonucleic acids (the body's genetic blueprint for making proteins).\n\nThe research will study two populations: uninjured people and people living with spinal cord injury (SCI), who are often at increased risk of infections. We will measure and observe over time any differences in immune responses to vaccines between those groups or among people with SCI according to their injury severity or level.\n\nThe overall goal of this study is to increase knowledge of immune responses to vaccination against influenza virus that causes the flu, and to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. There is currently a lack of information about what influences individual responses to vaccines and why people with SCI are at typically at increased risk of infection. Results from this study may teach us how to improve vaccination strategies and other ways to fight infections in uninjured people and in people with SCI"
