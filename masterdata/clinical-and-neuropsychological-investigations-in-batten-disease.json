This study will also refine and validate the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS) as a clinical rating instrument for Batten disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Batten Disease is an inherited disorder that causes progressive cognitive and behavioral decline in children. There have been no systematic clinical studies of Batten Disease using standardized rating instruments with known inter-rater reliability and validity.\n\nThe Batten Study Group developed the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS), a clinical rating instrument used to assess the motor, behavioral, and functional capabilities of individuals with Batten disease. Using the UBDRS, study investigators will evaluate participants approximately every year to track disease progression. The UBDRS is the primary natural history tool, but the study also includes neuropsychological assessment, adaptive function, quality of life measures, and other measures to assess the impact of Batten Disease. Participants will be examined at the University of Rochester Batten Center, Batten Disease Support and Research Association annual meeting, or remotely via televideo. Information related to racial and ethnic background, medical history, symptoms, medications, and diagnostic testing will be collected."
