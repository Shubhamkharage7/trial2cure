This study will include 3 cohorts: healthy volunteers for whole body dosimetry estimates (n=6-8, Dosimetry Cohort), patients undergoing evaluation for recurrent high grade glioma after radiation therapy (n=10, high grade glioma (HGG) Cohort), and patients with brain metastases from extra-cranial solid tumors before and after radiation therapy (n=10, Metastasis Cohort). Exploratory assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of MeFAMP for distinguishing recurrent/progressive brain tumors from radiation-related treatment effects will also be performed for subsequent trial design. The study will complete accrual and safety assessment in the Dosimetry Cohort before recruiting for the HGG and Metastasis Cohorts."
