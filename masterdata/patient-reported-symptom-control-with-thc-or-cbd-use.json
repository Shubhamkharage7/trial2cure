To determine the patient's reported preference for cancer pain improvement with opioids, opioids with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-marijuana and/or opioids with cannabidiol (CBD).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the association between perception of cancer-related symptom relief and use of THC-marijuana and/or CBD.\n\nII. To compare patient perception of THC-marijuana and/or CBD versus (vs.) cancer treatments in treatment of cancer.\n\nIII. To evaluate patient report of adverse effects experienced while using THC-marijuana and/or CBD.\n\nIV. To evaluate patient reported concerns while using THC-marijuana and/or CBD. V. To evaluate patient attitude of dosing, forms and use of THC-marijuana and/or CBD.\n\nVI. To evaluate demographic, physical and psychosocial factors that influence patient perception and attitudes of THC-marijuana and/or CBD.\n\nVII. To explore the difference of patient perception of THC-marijuana and CBD in cancer centers in a legalized vs. a non-legalized state.\n\nVIII. To explore the patient reported preference of THC-marijuana and CBD for cancer pain and symptom relief of patients in a Supportive Care Center vs. Integrative Medicine Center at University of Texas (U.T.) MD Anderson.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients' medical records are reviewed and then complete questionnaires over 27 minutes."
