Although smoking, alcohol intake, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are linked to HNSCC, only a small proportion of individuals exposed to these factors develop cancer and not all cases progress. Thus, additional environmental or host factors must contribute to HNSCC. The Study Team and others have observed significant oral dysbiosis in human HNSCC cases, both before and after treatment. This study aims to determine whether dysbiosis actively contributes to HNSCC and if so, the underlying molecular mechanisms."
