            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of larotrectinib in treating patients with NTRK gene amplification positive solid tumors that have spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). Larotrectinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine overall response rate (ORR) to larotrectinib sulfate (larotrectinib) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring NTRK amplification and pan-TRK expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), calculated as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response and as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 and Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria in primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) in subjects with CR or PR as best response.\n\nII. To estimate the proportion of subjects with any tumor regression as best response.\n\nIII. To evaluate the growth modulation index (GMI) following initiation of larotrectinib.\n\nIV. To evaluate overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) following initiation of larotrectinib.\n\nV. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on the proportion of subjects with best response of CR, PR, or stable disease lasting \\>= 16 weeks following initiation of larotrectinib safety.\n\nVI. To assess the safety profile and tolerability of larotrectinib.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 amplification by next-generation sequencing of tumor biopsies.\n\nII. To characterize TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC signaling in fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsies, with the aim of elucidating TRK biology and modifiers of response to larotrectinib.\n\nIII. To characterize concurrently activated oncogenic pathways in fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsies, with the aim of elucidating TRK biology and modifiers of response to larotrectinib.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive larotrectinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who experience disease progression and are deriving clinical benefit from larotrectinib may continue treatment per physician discretion.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, and then every 3 months for 2 years."

Subjects with a known history of Gilberts disease and an isolated elevation of indirect bilirubin are eligible\n* Serum creatinine \\< 2.0 x ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate \\>= 30 mL/minute using the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n* Ability to comply with outpatient treatment, laboratory monitoring, and required clinic visits for the duration of study participation\n* Willingness of men and women of reproductive potential to use two effective birth control methods, one used by the subject and another by his/her partner, for the duration of treatment and for 3 months following study completion\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to the planned start of larotrectinib or five half-lives, whichever is shorter, and without clinically significant toxicities from that therapy\n* Prior progression while receiving approved or investigational tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting TRK. However, subjects who received less than 28 days of such treatment and discontinued because of intolerance or toxicity are eligible\n* Symptomatic or unstable brain metastases that needs corticosteroid usage. Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases or primary CNS tumors are eligible\n* Uncontrolled concurrent malignancy that would limit assessment of efficacy. Allowed diseases may include, but are not limited to in situ cancers of cervix, breast, or skin, superficial bladder cancer, limited-stage prostate cancer, and basal or squamous cancers of the skin\n* Active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, unstable cardiovascular disease or other systemic disease that would limit compliance with study procedures. Unstable cardiovascular disease is defined as:\n\n  * Persistently uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) \\> 150 mmHg and/or diastolic BP \\> 100 mmHg despite antihypertensive therapy\n  * Myocardial infarction within 3 months of screening\n* Stroke within 3 months of screening\n* Inability to discontinue treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP450), 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor or inducer prior to start of treatment\n* Pregnancy or lactation",
