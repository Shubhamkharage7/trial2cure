Our team's central hypothesis is that medication adherence and cardiovascular self-care (and eventual glycemic control, cholesterol control, health care use/cost) will improve with an intervention tailored to the unique context of CV-H.\n\nThis protocol addresses a pilot study to test patient perceptions of the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures and refine the CV-Homes treatment manual through test cases (n=8). With a hypothesis that the CV-Homes manual and study procedures will be feasible and acceptable to CV-H as measured by self-report and post-treatment interview."
