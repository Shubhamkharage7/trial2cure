Up to 173 subjects with chronic pain related to peripheral nerve will be enrolled by approximately 15 qualified sites. Subjects who are eligible for a StimRouter will be enrolled in order to evaluate the subject's experience at pre-implant, the implant, and post-implant for up to 24 months. Based on routine care, subjects will be seen at day of implant, within 2 weeks post-implant, 3 months post-implant, 6 months post-implant, 9 months post implant, 12 months post-implant, and 24 month post-implant."

Subject who has chronic pain of peripheral nerve origin\n3. Subject is eligible for StimRouter as determined by the Clinician.\n4. Subject has a score of 5 or higher on the Pain NRS for average pain specific to the area(s) of chronic pain being treated over the past 24 hours\n5. Subject is planned to be scheduled for implant of StimRouter.\n6. Subject has a life expectancy greater than 6 months as determined by the Clinician.\n7. Subject who is able to read, understand, and voluntarily sign the IRB-approved informed consent form prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures.\n8. Subject who is able to understand and complete required assessments.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject has other concomitant treatment or medical condition that, in the opinion of the Clinician, prevents the subject from study participation.\n2. Subject who, for implantation in the trunk, has an implanted demand-type cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator.\n3. Subject has or plans to have a Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS), Peripheral Nerve field Stimulation System (PNfS), Dorsal Root Ganglion system (DRG), or implantable infusion pump.\n4. Subject who has an implanted device in the area for StimRouter implantation without sponsor approval. Maintain a minimum separation distance of 6 inches (15 cm) between the StimRouter system and all other active implanted devices.\n5. Subject who requires, or is likely to require, diathermy at the implant site.\n6. Subject who requires, or is likely to require, therapeutic ultrasound at the implant site.\n7. Subject who has a cancerous lesion present near the target stimulation point.\n8. Subject with a bleeding disorder, which, in the opinion of the investigator, is a contraindication to device placement.\n9. Subject who has an active systemic infection.\n10. Subject who is immunocompromised and/ or determined by the Clinician to be clinically inappropriate for the procedure and implant.\n11. Subject who has an active or existing skin disorder or irritation, which, at the Clinician's discretion, precludes the use of skin gel electrodes.\n12. Subject who currently require or is likely to require Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) within the MRI exclusion zone: the entire StimRouter lead must be at least 50 cm from the center of the MRI system's bore (the iso-center) and at least 16 cm outside of the MRI coil measured from the edge of the MRI coil.\n13. Subject who has a history of adverse reactions to local anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine).\n14. Subject who is pregnant, plan on becoming pregnant, or is breastfeeding during the study period.\n15. Subject who is participating in any other study that could affect the outcome of the registry, such as a spinal stimulation study.\n16. Subject who is in litigation related to their pain, or who has a pending or active worker's compensation claim. (A patient receiving long-term medical care from a settled Worker-s Compensation claim would not be excluded.)\n17. Subject who declines to provide written consent or follow-up.",
