Three Samples of peritoneal washings will be collected and send to pathology. First washing will be collected after entering the abdominal cavity, second washing will be done after completion of hysterectomy and containment of the uterus in the bag, and the third washing after scalpel morcellation of the uterus in the containment bag and extraction within the bag. Extraction of the specimen will be done either through the vagina or through a mini laparotomy incision (2-3 cm)."
