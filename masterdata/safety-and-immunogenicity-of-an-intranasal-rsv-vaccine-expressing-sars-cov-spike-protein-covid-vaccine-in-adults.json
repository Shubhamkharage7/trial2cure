The investigational vaccine, MV-014-212, is a live attenuated vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that is expressing the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. MV-014-212 is administered as drops or a spray in the nose. Specifically, this study analyzes the safety of, and the immune response to, the vaccine when administered to healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 69 years who are seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 and have not received a prior vaccine against COVID-19."

Resolved childhood asthma is not exclusionary.\n* Immunocompromised state due to comorbidities or other conditions as detailed in the study protocol\n* Nasal obstruction (including due to anatomic/structural causes, acute or chronic rhinosinusitis, or other causes)\n* Receipt of any other SARS-CoV-2, other experimental coronavirus, or experimental RSV vaccine at any time prior to the study\n* Healthcare worker, long-term care or nursing home facility resident or employee, member of an emergency response team, or other occupation with high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and those working outside the home in customer facing occupations (e.g. waiter, cashier or store clerk, public transportation or taxi driver)\n* Positive serum pregnancy test during Screening and/or positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1\n* Breastfeeding during any period of study participation\n* Occupational or household exposure to children \\<5 years of age or to immunocompromised persons\n* Receipt of or scheduled to receive any other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prior to Day 1. Once dosed with MV-014-212, subjects should not receive an authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine until after the Day 57 visit (single-dose subjects) or the Day 92 visit (two-dose subjects)\n* Any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the PI, precludes study participation. This includes acute, subacute, intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial",
