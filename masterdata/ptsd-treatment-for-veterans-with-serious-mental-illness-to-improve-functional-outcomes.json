            "briefSummary": "PTSD is common among Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI). Co-occurring PTSD and SMI lead to poorer mental health and physical functioning than either diagnosis alone. Despite known high prevalence rates of PTSD in SMI populations as well as disparities in prevalence and treatment use for Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC), little research has been done to: a) evaluate leading treatments for PTSD in individuals with SMI, and b) develop culturally responsive methods to integrate with PTSD treatments for SMI Veterans. This study aims to address research and clinical gaps by: a) testing the feasibility and acceptability of Written Exposure Therapy (WET), a VA evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD in Veterans with SMI, and b) incorporating culturally responsive assessment methods. Results from this study will inform whether WET and culturally responsive assessment are feasible to implement, acceptable to Veterans with SMI, and worth examining in standard or optimized form in a larger clinical trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "Project Background: PTSD is prevalent among Veterans and others with serious mental illness (SMI), contributing to substantial mental and physical health impairments. Written Exposure Therapy (WET) is a new evidence-based practice for PTSD that may have special clinical utility for Veterans with SMI and PTSD. However, such Veterans have been largely excluded from PTSD clinical trials, and no WET trials to date have focused on an SMI population. Further, there are significant race and ethnicity disparities in PTSD and SMI prevalence and treatment, even in Veterans Health Administration. For instance, persistence and chronicity of SMI and PTSD are higher for Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) underlining the need for PTSD EBPs to be delivered in culturally responsive ways.\n\nProject Objectives: The proposed CDA-2 research will address research and clinical gaps by integrating culturally responsive assessment methods and testing the feasibility and acceptability of WET among Veterans with SMI and PTSD. The first step of this research will focus on administering culturally responsive assessments and WET to Veterans with PTSD and SMI in a training trial (n = 10), including qualitative interviews exploring participants' experiences with and views of these instruments and WET. The second step will involve completing a small randomized controlled trial of WET to examine feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of WET, and to preliminarily explore changes to clinical outcomes and functioning among 48 Veterans randomized to WET (n = 32) vs. a PTSD psychoeducation control intervention (n = 16). We will assess rates of recruitment, initial intervention engagement, and session attendance (feasibility); Veteran satisfaction with WET (acceptability); and preliminarily explore response to WET. The final step of this research will involve conducting a process evaluation to consider ways to optimize WET for future clinical trials to improve functional recovery for Veterans with SMI. This evaluation will synthesize information from: 1) WET interventionist notes and 2) qualitative interviews with a subset of Veterans in the WET condition (n = 15).\n\nProject Methods: This project will include: 1) delivering WET with the CFI during a training trial followed by qualitative interviews with Veterans with PTSD and SMI; 2) completing a randomized control trial (RCT) with 48 Veteran participants, monitoring fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability; and 3) studying Veterans' experiences of WET and culturally responsive assessment methods through qualitative interviews. The investigators will measure functional outcomes during the RCT at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up using clinician-rated and self-report questionnaires for preliminary exploratory analysis, preparatory to a future full RCT if WET proves promising."

The \"PTSD 101\" protocol consists of psychoeducation on topics related to PTSD symptoms and an introduction to PTSD-related coping skills. Its duration and structure will be similar to WET (5 weekly individual 50-minute sessions). To parallel the time an attention given in individual WET sessions more closely, participants will quietly review any written materials or videos that are a part of the manualized curriculum for 30 minutes of the session, bookended by a 10-minute check-in with their provider on symptoms and introduction to new materials at the start of session and another 10-minute debrief of reviewed materials at the end of session.",
