We will examine whether patients who receive dara-based regimens are more likely to have renal recovery compared to patients who do not receive dara-based regimens and to patients who receive plasma exchange. Given the infrequency with which plasma exchange is performed on a single-center level, we will compare outcomes among patients treated with plasma exchange, utilizing data from the multicenter study to those patients who were treated with daratumumab-based regimens without plasma exchange versus non- daratumumab-based regimen."
