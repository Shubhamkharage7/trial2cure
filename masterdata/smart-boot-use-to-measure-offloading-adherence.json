            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to help people with diabetes who develop neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). These ulcers, or sores, if left untreated can increase the chance of amputation. Part of the treatment is to have the person wear a diabetic shoe or boot to help their foot heal. Sometimes people don't wear the boot like they are told. The investigators want to compare three different kinds of diabetic boots to see if they can help make it easier for people to wear their boots as instructed.\n\nThe investigators will look at three groups of participants: the first group will wear a boot that can't be taken off. The second group will wear a boot that can be taken off, and they will get counseling about how important it is to follow instructions as to how often and when to wear the boot. The third group will wear a \"smart\" boot, which will interact with the person through a smart watch and smart phone, and give them direct feedback about how they are doing with following their boot wearing prescription.\n\nThe investigators will also be looking at how much physical activity, like walking, the participants do. And they will compare how well participants sleep and rate their quality of life in the three different boots. The investigators think that giving participants information about how much they are wearing their boot using readily available technology will help them to follow the doctor's directions better, and help their wounds heal faster."
