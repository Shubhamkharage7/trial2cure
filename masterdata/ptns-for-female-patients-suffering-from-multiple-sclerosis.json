            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot, single blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial to assess the benefit of PTNS in treating OAB symptoms in MS patients. The data generated by this study would provide support for a future multi-institutional, randomized prospective trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. It is caused by loss of myelin, the outer protective layer of the neuron, resulting in a disruption of the signal potentials that flow through the neurons. This can lead to a variety of sensory, visual, and motor disturbances. MS affects almost 1 million people in the United States with the prevalence being two to three times higher in women than in men. Over 80% of MS patients suffer from lower urinary tract symptoms, with bladder overactivity (OAB) and urinary incontinence (UI) being the predominant bladder dysfunctions. OAB is characterized by sudden feeling of urgency, frequent urination, and urge incontinence. Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) is an FDA approved treatment for OAB and is recommended as third line treatment for OAB by the American Urological Association (AUA) and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU). However, it is not approved for MS and as such these treatments are not covered by insurance.\n\nHere the investigators propose a pilot, double blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial to assess the benefit of PTNS in treating OAB symptoms in MS patients. The data generated by this study would provide support for a future multi-institutional, randomized prospective trial."

Another gel electrode will be placed on the top of the foot just above the small toe for conduction. These two electrodes will be connected to the TENS unit lead wires for sham stimulation. A third, inactive, gel electrode, will be placed near the medial aspect of the calcaneus to mimic the PTNS treatment. The TENS electrode will be connected by lead wires to the TENS unit set at 20 HZ.
