            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates the use of an imaging scan (18F-rhPSMA-7.3 positron emission tomography \\[PET\\]/magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\]) for identifying patients who are at risk of having their disease spread to the lymph nodes in those undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized). Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/computed tomography (CT) has emerged as an option to stage newly diagnosed high risk prostate cancer patients. PSMA PET/CT has demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy for identifying metastasis. PET is procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is used. Because cancer cells often use more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body. MRI is procedure in which radio waves and a powerful magnet linked to a computer are used to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. These pictures can show the difference between normal and diseased tissue. This study may help researchers learn whether 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/ MRI may improve predicting which patients are at risk of lymph node metastases and who are suitable candidates for pelvic lymph node dissection in patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate the diagnostic ability of flotufolastat F-18 gallium (18F-rhPSMA-7.3) PSMA PET/MRI prior to radical prostatectomy in newly diagnosed, high-risk prostate cancer patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Calculating the specificity, positive-predictive value, and negative-predictive value for the detection of lymph node positivity.\n\nII. Investigating the rates of biochemical recurrence (BCR) as measured by post-operative prostate specific antigen (PSA) (PSA \\> 0.20) at pre-defined timepoints in patients.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/MRI up to 30 days prior to standard of care (SOC) robotic radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients also undergo CT or MRI, bone scan and tissue collection during screening.\n\nUpon completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months post-surgery."
