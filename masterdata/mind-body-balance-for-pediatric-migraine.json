Mind and body approaches can significantly help these youth, but getting access to this type of treatment is a challenge for families. Our mind and body study will test a mind and body intervention package delivered by health care professionals (i.e., nurses) introducing coping skills to youth ages 10 to 17 that have migraine.\n\nUsing a factorial design and the multiphase optimization strategy \"MOST\", in this study we are able to evaluate different doses of 3 treatment components (1. Duration of mind and body skill introduction session; 2. Home practice support intensity; and 3. Adherence prompt phone call) in one project. A screening experiment will be conducted to determine the dose of each treatment component for future evaluation of the optimized intervention package in a pragmatic or SMART trial."
