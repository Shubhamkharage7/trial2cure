All youth will receive Tools for Life and two 30-minute virtual follow-up visits (at 2- and 6-weeks post intervention) focused on connectivity to culture and obtaining support from intergenerational social networks in their home communities. Half of the youth will also receive MISN in addition to Tools for Life. Both interventions will be delivered virtually by a wellness team comprised of Alaska Native community behavioral health aides, prevention specialists and/or Elders who function in their communities as natural healers."
