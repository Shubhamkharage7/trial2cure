            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized, single-stage study to evaluate the efficacy of Elotuzumab and Iberdomide therapy post-Idecabtagene Vicleucel in participants with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Iberdomide has demonstrated some antitumor activity in laboratory studies.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Elotuzumab as a treatment option for Multiple Myeloma. Dexamethasone, also FDA approved, is a type of steroid and is usually combined with other chemotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers, such as myeloma and leukemias. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Iberdomide as a treatment for Multiple Myeloma.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, bone marrow biopsies, blood and urine tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), X-rays, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.\n\nIt is expected about 49 people will take part in this research study.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene, a BMS company, are supporting this research study by providing study drug and providing funding for the trial."
