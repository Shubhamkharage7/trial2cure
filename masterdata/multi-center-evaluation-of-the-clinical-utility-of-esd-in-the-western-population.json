Patients in whom ESD is considered as part of their standard medical care will be offered to participate in this study. The physician performing the procedure will also discuss the study with the subjects. If the patient agrees to participate, he or she will be given the informed consent form and allowed enough time to read it. Opportunity to ask questions will be provided. If the patient agrees to participate, he or she will sign the consent form and a copy will be provided. Data will be prospectively recorded according to the data collection form. ESD will be performed as medically indicated. The investigators from each respective center on this project will also be in charge of the medical care of the patients enrolled in the study. Follow-up will be carried out as medically indicated and no additional studies or clinic visits will be needed specifically for the purpose of this study."
