            "briefSummary": "Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has been successful in patients with rotator cuff arthropathy, proximal humerus fractures, failed primary total shoulder arthroplasty or failed hemiarthroplasty, and massive irreparable rotator cuff tear. Patients who undergo an RTSA report pain relief and functional range of motion. It has been more than 20 years since the advent of the RTSA construct but an immediate post-operative rehabilitation with active shoulder range of motion has not been prospectively studied in comparison to the traditional post-operative rehabilitation highlighted by Boudreau et al.12 Investigators plan to prospectively follow our patients following RTSA undergoing an immediate active shoulder rehabilitation (IASR) vs traditional rehabilitation in a randomized controlled fashion. Investigators plan to document clinical outcomes, complications and cost effectiveness out to 1 year.\n\nThe study will hopefully fulfill the Triple Aim model for HealthPartners by improving the health of the population, improve the experience of each individual, and make healthcare affordable by decreasing the total cost of care."

There will be 2 groups, one undergoing the immediate active shoulder physical therapy protocol consisting of four quadrant stretches and full active motion of the shoulder from post op day 1 in the hospital. The second group will follow the traditional TRIA physical therapy protocol consisting of PT (standard of care) followed by a gradual return to active range of motion of the shoulder beginning by week 6, calling for 18 physical therapy visits. The physical therapy will occur where the patient is most comfortable receiving it.",

A goniometer will be used measuring to the nearest degree. The range of motion for forward elevation will range between 0-180 degrees with a higher number indicating a better outcome.
