This trial extends the safety results from recently completed Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in mild-to-moderate AD participants (NCT01409915, COMIRB#12-1273), using sargramostim that was administered five days per week for three consecutive weeks and in which there were no incidence of drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs)."

Is in the judgement of the Principal Investigator likely to be non-compliant with study protocol, including, but not limited to, leaving the area of the study for any extended period; or separate from the designated caregiver/informant, without acceptable replacement, for any of the scheduled assessment visits during the study.\n  2. Is unable to cooperate because of a language problem or because of a developmental disability.\n  3.
