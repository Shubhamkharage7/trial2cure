            "briefSummary": "The study will assess the safety and efficacy of BXQ-350 plus modified FOLFOX7 (mFOLFOX7) and bevacizumab in participants who have newly diagnosed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon/rectum. The study will also evaluate if the administration of BXQ-350 with mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab may diminish oxaliplatin induced sensory neurotoxicity, enabling participants to receive the total and planned doses of mFOLFOX7.\n\nAll participants will receive BXQ-350 by intravenous (IV) infusion along with standard of care doses of mFOLFOX and bevacizumab. The study is divided into two stages: Stage 1 will be open label and will enroll participants at increasing dose levels of BXQ-350 in order to determine the Stage 2 dose. Stage 2 will be blinded; participants will receive BXQ-350 at the established Stage 1 dose or placebo.",
            "detailedDescription": "BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a cell membrane phospholipid (clinical formulation BXQ-350).Due to the presumed mechanism of action of BXQ-350, Bexion anticipates that it may have an impact on ceramides, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, pre-clinical results demonstrated that BXQ-350 induced neurite generation and protection in vitro in the PC-12 and NS20Y cell lines and significantly decreased oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in a model of CIPN. Thus BXQ-350 may represent a new approach to deliver a neuropathy benefit.\n\nThe unique combination of BXQ-350 along with its proven safety profile, potential efficacy, and possible neuropathy benefit makes BXQ-350 a worthwhile candidate to use in combination with standard of care treatment for mCRC to not only enhance the standard treatment of mCRC, but also to evaluate its ability to alleviate side effects related to oxaliplatin-induced sensory neurotoxicity."

Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective. The participants chosen method(s) must be confirmed as highly effective prior to study entry.\n12. Participant is capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants must not meet any of the following criteria:\n\n1.
