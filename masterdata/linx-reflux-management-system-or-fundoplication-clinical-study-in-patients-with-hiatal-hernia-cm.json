Subjects will be enrolled by invitation only by participating investigators. Enrollment will consist of 300 LINX MSA patients and 150 fundoplication patients with a total of 450 from 4 sites within the United States. Data will be collected for up to 6 years.The primary objective of this study is to determine the long-term incidence of hiatal hernia recurrence in patients who undergo hiatal hernia repair of a large (\\>3 cm) hernia with LINX\u00ae device placement, and to compare this with hiatal hernia recurrence rates in patients who underwent hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication."
