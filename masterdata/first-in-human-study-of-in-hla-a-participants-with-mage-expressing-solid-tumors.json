This is a first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of CDR404 in adult patients who have the appropriate germline human leukocyte antigen HLA-A\\*02:01 tissue marker and whose cancer is positive for MAGE-A4.",

To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacologically effective dose range (PEDR) for CDR404\n2. To assess preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of CDR404\n3. To characterise the pharmacokinetics of CDR404\n4. To characterise the immunogenicity of CDR404\n5. To assess translational biomarkers"
