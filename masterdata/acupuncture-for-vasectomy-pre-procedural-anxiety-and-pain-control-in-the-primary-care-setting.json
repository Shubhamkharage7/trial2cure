            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will compare auricular (ear) and body acupuncture (Koffman protocol) versus clinic standardized pre-vasectomy medications to determine which has better outcomes at improving pre-procedural anxiety and procedural pain relief and medication usage in adult male patients following vasectomy. In this efficacy trial, the investigators hypothesize that acupuncture will provide therapeutic anxiety and pain relief during and after vasectomy. The investigators will measure anxiety immediately before and prior to the procedure and before and after the intervention via a standardized anxiety scale (comparative). The investigators will also measure pain control immediately after the procedure using Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS). At the post op check (2-4 days after procedure) subjects will fill out a patient satisfaction survey. During the recovery period over 2 weeks, a medication usage diary will be kept by the subject including the time when the patient returns to full duties."
