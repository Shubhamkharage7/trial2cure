            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to test SIRPant-M, an autologous cell therapy, alone or in combination with focal external-beam radiotherapy in participants with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Two dose levels of SIRPant-M are being tested. The main question this study aims to answer is if SIRPant-M alone or in combination with radiotherapy is safe and well-tolerated.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label phase 1 study of SIRPant-M studied in serial cohorts either alone (monotherapy), or combined with low-dose focal external-beam radiotherapy (XRT) in patients with relapsed- or refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Both B-cell and certain T-cell NHL (select PTCL; CTCL) are eligible. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of autologous SIRPant-M, delivered by 3 intra-tumoral injection, given either alone or combined with 2.5 Gy focal XRT.\n\nA course (cycle) of SIRPant-M is prepared from a single mononuclear apheresis, and comprises 3 equal ITI doses, administered at 2-day intervals. A low dose (90x10\\^6 cells split over 3 injections) and a high dose (300x10\\^6 cells split over 3 injections) of SIRPant-M are evaluated. In cohorts receiving supplemental radiation, each cell injection will be followed by 2.5 Gy radiation directed at the injected tumor site (7.5 Gy total).\n\nDose escalations will be staggered using the 3+3 Phase 1 design, and safety will be monitored by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The SRC may direct additional- or intermediate dose levels to be evaluated, as guided by emerging data."
