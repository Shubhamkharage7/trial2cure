            "briefSummary": "This study will include patients with invasive cervical cancer that wish to keep their fertility as much as possible in the future after treatment.\n\nPatients who receive surgery alone may experience long-term side effects including infertility. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether giving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery can maintain fertility in patients with invasive cervical cancer.\n\nThe neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will consist of a platinum-based chemotherapy drug cisplatin or carboplatin, with a chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel. These are common chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of women with cervical cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "All participants will first receive neo-adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Once the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been completed, participants will be assessed by imaging scans to see whether they have a response to the treatment.\n\nIf participants are responding to treatment, they will then have a trachelectomy. After surgery, participants will be assessed and the study doctor will determine whether adjuvant treatment is needed. Adjuvant treatment may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or have a hysterectomy done.\n\nIf participants do not respond to or their disease worsens after neo-adjuvant treatment, participants will receive adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or have a hysterectomy done."
