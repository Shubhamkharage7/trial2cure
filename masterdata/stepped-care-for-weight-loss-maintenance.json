            "briefSummary": "This study is a 3-group, parallel design, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in approximately 258 adults with obesity that will investigate whether a 16-week behavioral weight loss treatment and a 52-week stepped-care digital health intervention can improve the maintenance of a \u2265 5% weight loss.\n\n16-week run-in (Phase 1). To qualify for randomization, participants must lose \u2265 5% of initial weight in the 16-week run-in. This loss will be achieved with the provision of weekly-group lifestyle counseling, which includes a partial meal replacement diet.\n\n52-week randomized trial of 3 weight loss maintenance strategies (Phase 2): Participants who have achieved \u2265 5% weight loss during Phase 1 will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups:\n\n1. Participants in the Usual Care group will be emailed monthly educational modules with information on maintaining weight loss.\n2. Participants in the SELF group will receive a wireless \"smart\" body weight scale and a wearable physical activity tracker, and daily text messages with tailored feedback to assist in weight loss maintenance.\n3. Participants in the STEP group will be enrolled in an intervention that consists of 4 steps that are progressive and based on response to treatment. After 13 weeks at each step, participants who do not maintain a \u22655% weight loss or regain 2 percentage points of weight from the participants randomization value will move to a higher intensity step. Participants who maintain weight loss will stay at the same step."
