            "briefSummary": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. There are currently no studies examining the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in patients with normal (negative) EMG studies. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the duration of symptom improvement post corticosteroid injection in patients with negative or mild EMG studies. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire will be given to patients undergoing corticosteroid injections for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome to assess their response to the injection. Investigators will collect data retrospectively. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) is administered as per standard protocol to all patients with CTS who have a negative or mild EMG study. The BCTQ assesses the patient's self-reported symptom severity and functional status. Investigators will analyze this data with respect to demographics as well as numbness in the median n. distribution, nocturnal numbness, weakness/atrophy of the thenar musculature, Tinel's sign, Phalen's test, loss of 2-point discrimination, Quick-Dash score, and grip strength score.\n\nThe primary outcome will be the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire outcome score under the different EMG conditions.The secondary outcomes will be numbness in the median n. distribution, nocturnal numbness, weakness/atrophy of the thenar musculature, Tinel's sign, Phalen's test, loss of 2-point discrimination, QuickDash score, and grip strength score. Both outcomes will be examined in patients with negative or mild EMG readings. This information will allow orthopedic physicians to gain a better understanding of the duration of symptom improvement post-corticosteroid injection, allowing them to fine tune their treatment plans for CTS patients."
