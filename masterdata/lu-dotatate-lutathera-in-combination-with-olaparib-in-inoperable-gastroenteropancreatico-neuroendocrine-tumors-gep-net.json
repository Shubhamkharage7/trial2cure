            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nA neuroendocrine tumor is a rare type of tumor. It comes from body cells called neuroendocrine cells. Sometimes, these tumors develop in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. Researchers want to find out if a combination of drugs can shrink these tumors.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if people with certain neuroendocrine tumors can take a combination of 2 drugs, Lutathera and Olaparib, without having severe side effects, and if this treatment makes the tumors shrink.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults 18 and older who have a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreas or intestine that cannot be cured by surgery and has somatostatin receptors on the cells.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened under protocol 01-C-0129. They may have a tumor biopsy.\n\nEligible participants will get Lutathera through an intravenous (IV) infusion every 8 weeks for 4 cycles. One cycle is 8 weeks. Each cycle includes a follow-up visit at week 4. For the IV, a small plastic tube is put into an arm vein.\n\nParticipants will also take Olaparib by mouth twice a day for 4 weeks of each cycle. They will use a medicine diary to track the doses.\n\nDuring the study, participants will have physical exams. They will have blood and urine tests. They will fill out questionnaires about their general well-being and function. Their heart function will be tested. They will have scans of their chest, abdomen, and pelvis. One type of scan will use an IV infusion of a radioactive tracer.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit about 4 weeks after treatment ends. Then they will have follow-up visits every 12 weeks for 3 years. Then they will have yearly phone calls.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas are a rare and heterogeneous, but clinically important, group of neoplasms with unique tumor biology, natural history, and clinical management issues.\n* While the treatment of localized NETs is surgical resection, a variety of therapeutic options are available for patients with advanced NETs. These include medical control of excess hormone levels and associated symptoms, cytoreductive surgery for patients with advanced disease, radioembolization, chemoembolization, systemic chemotherapy, interferon, longacting somatostatin analogs, receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy, and or liver transplantation.\n* Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) have been shown to be overexpressed in a number of human tumors, including neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and NETs, among many others.\n* Lu-177-DOTATATE (Lutathera) is a SSTR-agonist agent which emits ionizing radiation that causes DNA damage to its target cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms. In addition, ionizing radiation has also been shown to induce cell death through what is known as the bystander effect, a phenomenon where cellular signaling from irradiated cells towards non-irradiated cells induces cellular damage and eventually death in nearby surrounding cells.\n* Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Olaparib has an established safety\n\nprofile and it is under investigation in several different cancers.\n\n- The rationale behind using combination therapies in cancer stems from the potential of synergistic mechanisms of action of the involved agents. Olaparib is a PARP-inhibitor which blocks the repair of single-stranded DNA breaks and is especially effective when combined with other agents which induces DNA damage.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Phase I:\n\n  * Characterize the safety profile and tolerability of the olaparib + Lu-177-DOTATATE combination.\n  * Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) dose of the combination using the 3+3 dose escalation design.\n* Phase II:\n\n  * Measure the Best Overall Response Rate (BOR) by RECIST 1.1 at the MTD dose at completion of 4 cycles of treatment.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Clinical diagnosis of GEP-NET disease, histologically confirmed to be consistent with neuroendocrine tumor.\n* Inoperable disease (metastatic, non-candidate for surgery with curative intent, locally advanced into vessels or other critical structures, etc.).\n* Age \\>=18 years.\n* Must have presence of SSTR+ disease as documented by positive Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan within 12 weeks prior to anticipated treatment.\n* ECOG Performance Status \\<= 1.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Open-label, single-arm, single-center, phase I/II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Lu-177-DOTATATE + olaparib combination in patients with inoperable GEP-NET.\n* For phase I, a standard 3+3 design will be used to determine MTD. It is estimated that approximately 15 to 24 patients will be required. Phase II will involve the use of a Simon optimal two-stage design to determine sample size and interim stopping rule.\n* Assuming a combination of inevaluable patients or loss-to-follow-up of 10%, up to 24 patients will be accrued to phase I and 15 patients to phase II including the 6 phase I patients at MTD, with a total accrual ceiling of 42 patients to allow for a small number of inevaluable patients."

Cerazette (Merck Sharp \\& Dohme) is currently the only highly efficacious progesterone- based pill available\n    * Combined pill PLUS male condom: Normal and low-dose combined oral pills\n    * Injection PLUS male condom: Medroxyprogesterone injection (eg, Depo-Provera \\[Pfizer\\])\n    * Implants PLUS male condom: Etonorgestrel-releasing implants (eg, Nexplanon \\[Merck Sharp \\& Dohme\\])\n    * Patch PLUS male condom: Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system (eg, Xulane)\n    * Intravaginal device (eg, ethinyl estradiol-/etonogestrel-releasing intravaginal devices such as NuvaRing \\[Merck Sharp \\& Dohme\\]) PLUS male condom\n    * Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (eg, Mirena \\[Bayer\\]) PLUS male condom.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients who have any GEP-NET lesions that are negative by Ga-68-DOTATATE-PET imaging but positive by FDG-PET imaging, unless they have progressed on at least one other line of prior systemic treatment (such as chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and the majority of their tumor lesions are Ga-68-DOTATATE-avid.\n* Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with study drugs.\n* Other known co-existing malignancies except non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, unless definitively treated and proven no evidence of recurrence for 5 years.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.\n* Patients with persistent toxicities (\\>= CTCAE grade 2) with the exception of alopecia, caused by previous cancer therapy and toxicities deemed irreversible/stable expected to interfere with study drug administration in the opinion of the Principal Investigator.\n* Patient s weight exceeding PET table tolerance (\\> 400 lbs).\n* Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, hypertension (\\>180/110), arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients with symptomatic, uncontrolled brain metastases. NOTE: Patients with previously treated brain metastases are eligible if asymptomatic and may be on a stable dose of corticosteroids as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment.\n* Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease by imaging and clinical assessment as assessed by the treating investigator for 28 days before enrollment.\n* Concomitant use of known strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors within 2 weeks before enrollment.\n* Concomitant use of known strong or moderate CYP3A inducers within 5 weeks (for enzalutamide or phenobarbital) and 3 weeks for other agents before enrollment.\n* Patients that have had major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment and have not recovered from any effects of any major surgery.\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication.\n* Previous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplant (duCBT).\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or Lutathera or any excipients of these products.\n* Resting ECG indicating uncontrolled cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, QTcF prolongation \\>500 ms, electrolyte disturbances, etc.), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome.\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.\n* Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with study drugs. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Patients with known active hepatitis (i.e., Hepatitis B or C).\n* Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib and/or any previous treatment with any systemic radionuclide agents.\n* Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study.\n* Previous treatment with Lu-177-DOTATATE.",
