            "briefSummary": "The overarching objective of this study is to make it easier for parents of children with medical complexity (CMC) to take care of their children after discharge home from the hospital and reduce the chance of post-hospitalization morbidity (meaning bad outcomes such as readmissions) after discharge. CMC, or those with multiple chronic conditions, progressive conditions, or technology dependence, are at high risk for post-hospitalization morbidity.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will take place in 3 phases at 2 sites: Bellevue Hospital Center (BHC) and Hassenfeld Children's Hospital (HCH). Parents of CMC with a prior or current admission will be recruited at these two sites, as well as pediatricians who care for these children in the inpatient setting for the following 3 aims:\n\n* In Aim 1, parents of CMC and pediatricians will be interviewed to understand their views on what makes it challenging, and what can make it easier, for parents to understand and follow the instructions they get from the hospital about how to take care of their CMC after leaving the hospital. The study team will also ask pediatricians what may make it difficult to provide relevant education to families.\n* In Aim 2, a tool will be designed to make it easier for parents to understand and follow the discharge instructions for their CMC. The study team will use structure of existing tool, findings from Aim 1, and extensive interviews and testing of the tool with parents and pediatricians as the new tool is designed.\n* In Aim 3, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to study the impact of the tool on parent comprehension and adherence (or how well they can follow) their child's discharge instructions, as well as its impact on post-discharge morbidity (such as readmissions and emergency department visits). Parents will be randomized to either receive usual hospital care and instructions or the intervention/tool (in addition to the usual care and instructions). The study team will also ask parents who receive the intervention about its usability."
