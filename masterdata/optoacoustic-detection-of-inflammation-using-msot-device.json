            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm, 3-cohort study that is designed to provide safety information regarding the use of the Acuity MSOT device in the clinical setting, and the ability of MSOT imaging data to correlate with clinical findings identified via pathology or radiology.\n\nThe device will be used to obtain images of the areas of inflammation in the above patients for investigational use only, to compare to clinical pathology and patient's medical record. Patients will go through standard care procedures prior to imaging. Medically established diagnostic procedures will be used to detect areas of inflammation associated with GVHD, Crohn's, or colitis. Images using the MSOT device will be obtained through intact skin. A second MSOT scan will be performed for all patients 4 weeks post treatment. The temperature of the patient's skin will also be measured prior to and after MSOT imaging.\n\nMSOT imaging will be for research only and no treatment decisions will be based on the MSOT images obtained."
