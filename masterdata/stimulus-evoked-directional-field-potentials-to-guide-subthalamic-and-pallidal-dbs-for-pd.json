            "detailedDescription": "The investigator's goal is to better understand how deep brain stimulation (DBS) modifies local neuronal activity and to pioneer device technologies that can record local DBS-evoked potentials (DLEPs) to guide therapy. Together, Neuromodulation eXperiment Testbed system (NEXT) with a novel 16-contact directional lead (Argyle) are uniquely suited for these purposes. The investigator's vision is for NEXT to guide both electrode targeting during surgery and programming in clinic, eventually as an integrated component of the implanted pulse generator. The results will inform directional DBS for PD and serve as a model for translation to other diseases where knowledge on DBS circuit interactions is at an even earlier stage."
