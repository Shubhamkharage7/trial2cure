            "briefSummary": "Neurocognitive decline after radiation therapy is one of the most concerning complication for brain tumor patients and neuro-oncologists. There are increasing technological advances in evaluating the brain's neural connections responsible for the neurocognitive processes. For example, resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is an advanced imaging method that can identify the spatiotemporal distribution of the intrinsic functional networks within the brain (also referred to as resting state networks (RSNs) without requiring specific tasks by the imaged participants. Although there is evidence that shows that avoidance of specific neural networks during radiation therapy planning can lead to improved preservation of neurocognitive function afterward, it is important to first identify the most vulnerable and clinically relevant RSNs that correspond to cognitive decline. In this study, the investigators will prospectively perform RS-fMRI and neurocognitive evaluation using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIHTB-CB) on patients with gliomas before and after radiation therapy to generate preliminary data on what RSNs are most vulnerable to radiation injury leading to cognitive decline. A benign brain tumor cohort will also be followed to serve as control. The investigators will also evaluate the feasibility of incorporating RS-fMRI with radiation planning software for treatment optimization."
