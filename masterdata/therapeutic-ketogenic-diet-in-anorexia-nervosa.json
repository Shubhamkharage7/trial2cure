            "briefSummary": "This study will investigate the effects of therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) on eating behavior including drive to restrict, body dissatisfaction, mood and anxiety in individuals with anorexia nervosa who have been weight normalized (body mass index of 17.5 or greater) but continue to struggle with eating disorder behaviors including a high drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction.",
            "detailedDescription": "For this 14-week study, the investigator will recruit twenty individuals with anorexia nervosa who have been weight normalized but continue to have high impairment from the illness with a high (2 standard deviations above average) drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction and a high drive for food restriction and thus are at high risk for full relapse. Study participants will be carefully assessed and oriented to the ketogenic diet according to the procedures in our small previous trial (Calabrese, et al., 2022). The study will be conducted in a university medical environment, showing feasibility and safety in a typical medical setting. A commercial supplier will provide the ketogenic diet. After ketosis induction over two weeks, study participants will be assessed weekly for ketosis and mood, anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms.\n\nPrimary Objective 1 is to test the effects of ketogenic diet in individuals with anorexia nervosa who are weight recovered but continue to suffer severely from drive for thinness and are at very high relapse risk. Participants will be evaluated for tolerability of the study and weight trajectory. Primary Objective 2 is to assess improvement in AN symptoms and behaviors in relation to the ketogenic diet over a 12-week course. Participants will be assessed for specific symptoms such as drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction, fear of eating and weight gain. Primary Objective 3 is to assess the underlying genetic basis for the treatment effect of the ketogenic diet."
