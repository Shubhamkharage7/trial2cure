Topical afimoxifene is a quick-drying medicated gel that may block the growth of breast cancer cells when applied to the breast skin. The purpose of this research is to determine what effect, if any, differences in skin type between women have on the delivery of topical afimoxifene to the breast tissue, and whether radiation affects the delivery of topical afimoxifene to breast tissue.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To identify the skin features that drive inter-individual variation in dermal drug permeation between individuals.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To relate breast tissue drug concentration to skin histology, skin vascularity, skin transporter proteins, and skin features measured using confocal reflectance microscopy.\n\nII. To assess the feasibility of transdermal drug delivery to the radiated breast.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients apply afimoxifene gel topically once daily (QD) to both breasts for 4 weeks and then undergo core needle biopsies of both breasts.\n\nPatients receive follow up phone call 21-35 days after biopsy."
