Healthy male and female participants between the ages of 18 and 55 will be enrolled into this study. This study is looking to examine:\n\n* The effect of food on the single dose PK of plixorafenib administered with cobicistat.\n* The effect of cobicistat administration on the single dose PK of plixorafenib.\n* The safety of plixorafenib administered alone and with cobicistat in a single dose regimen in healthy participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, randomized, 3-period crossover, study. On Day 1 of each period (Days 1, 8, and 15 of the confinement), participants will receive a single oral dose of plixorafenib administered either with or without cobicistat, under fasting conditions or following a standardized high-fat/high-calorie meal. PK blood and urine samples will be collected at pre-dose and at several post-dose time points. There will be a washout period between doses. Participants will be confined for total of 19 days."

Using contraception, including 1 highly effective nonhormonal methods (eg, intrauterine device) in combination with a barrier contraception (eg, male or female condoms, diaphragm, spermicide, etc.) from start of plixorafenib administration until 30 days after the last plixorafenib administration, and having a negative serum or urine \u03b2-hCG pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) at screening and check in.\n4. Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must be sterile (confirmed by documented azoospermia 90 days after the procedure) or agree to use (from check-in until 90 days after discharge) one of the following approved methods of contraception: male condom with spermicide; sterile sexual partner (males must still agree to use condom with their surgically sterile female partner if unable to provide documentation of partner's sterility); or practice abstinence during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug (abstinence is acceptable only as true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant, periodic abstinence won't be allowed); or use of an intrauterine device with spermicide by female sexual partner; a female condom with spermicide; a contraceptive sponge with spermicide; an intravaginal system; a diaphragm with spermicide; a cervical cap with spermicide; or oral, implantable, transdermal, or injectable contraceptives.\n5.

The participant has a history or other evidence of illness, test abnormalities, or any other conditions which would make the participant, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study.\n6. The participant has any history of alcoholism or drug abuse, or excessive alcohol consumption (regular alcohol intake \\>21 units per week for male participants and \\>14 units of alcohol per week for female participants) (1 unit is equal to approximately \u00bd pint \\[200 mL\\] of beer, 1 small glass \\[100 mL\\] of wine, or 1 measure \\[25 mL\\] of spirits) within 3 months before screening.\n7. The participant has positive results on screen for drugs of abuse or alcohol (Section 6.2.3 \\[Other analyses\\]) at screening visit or Day -1.\n8. The participant is a smoker or has used nicotine or nicotine-containing products (eg, snuff, nicotine patch, nicotine chewing gum, mock cigarettes, or inhalers), marijuana, and cannabinoids within 1 year before the first dose of study drug.\n9. The participant has donated blood in the past 90 days prior to screening or has poor peripheral venous access.\n10.

Female participant of childbearing potential who is pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant within 90 days after the last dose of study drug.\n14. The participant has received an investigational drug, biologic, or device within 3 months or 5.5 half-lives of the investigational drug (whichever is longer), before receiving study drug.\n15. The participant has used any systemic medications, including vitamins and over the counter items, during the 14 days (or 5 times the elimination half-life of the medication, whichever is longer) before receiving study drug or will require their use during the study. Inducers and inhibitors of metabolic enzymes and/or transporters (in particular CYP3A inhibitors or inducers, P-gp, and BCRP), and herbal preparations, nutritional supplements (eg, St. John's Wort), or foods, including grapefruit juice, grapefruit/grapefruit-related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges, pomelos), which have been shown to produce metabolic enzyme or transporter induction or inhibition, are prohibited before 5 half-lives of the investigational drug prior to check-in (Day -1). Paracetamol \u2264 3000 mg/day will be allowed up to 2 consecutive days before dosing and during the outpatient phase of the study, as needed.\n16. The participant has been on a diet incompatible with the on-study diet, in the opinion of the investigator or designee, within 30 days prior to the first dosing and throughout the study.\n17.
