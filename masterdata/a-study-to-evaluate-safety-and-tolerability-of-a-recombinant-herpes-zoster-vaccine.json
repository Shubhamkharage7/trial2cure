            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial is to study the safety and tolerability of a recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (LZ901) and sponsored by Beijing Luzhu Biotechnology Co., Ltd. It is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study in healthy people aged 50 to 70 years inclusive. The study is to protect adults against shingles (herpes zoster / varicella zoster virus(VZV)). There will be about 66 participators who will receive two-dose injection at the upper arm.\n\nLZ901 vaccine is made up of a tetramer of VZV glycoprotein E (VZV gE-Fc) and adsorbed with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. This adjuvant can raise the immune response to a lot of antigens. It is the most widely used and safe adjuvant in various types of vaccines worldwide.\n\nIn this study:\n\n1. The participation is voluntary.\n2. Before the study, participants will receive some tests for screening. If qualified, investigators will officially invite them to join this study.\n3. The study vaccine is LZ901 with two different dose levels (50\u03bcg/0.5 mL, 100\u03bcg/0.5 mL). The placebo, which is saline solution, has no active drug. Participants will receive one of three as above mentioned.\n4. Participants will be enrolled in one of four cohorts. If participants are enrolled in Cohorts 1 or 2, they will receive LZ901. If participants are enrolled in Cohorts 3 or 4, they will have a 2 out of 3 chance (66%) of receiving LZ901 and 1 out of 3 chance (33%) of receiving placebo.\n5. In Cohort 3 and 4, the study staff and participants will not know which study treatment participants will be receiving. However, the study doctor can get this information in case of an emergency.\n6. Participants will stay at the clinic for 30 minutes after each vaccination to observe if there are any uncomfortable.\n7. This study will last about 8 months and will include about 8 study visits to the clinic. During this period, participants will receive a follow-up phone call and/or email by the study staff to follow the condition closely for safety, and record on diary/contact card.\n8. Participants will receive some tests during the study, include safety tests such as physical examination, vital signs measurements, blood tests, urinalysis. Participants will be measured the levels of specific antibodies to see if the vaccine works well.\n\nThis study is for research purposes only. Participants may not receive any direct benefits from participating in this study but have a chance to be in a study that may help others in the future."
