Develop and implement a perioperative precision analgesia platform (PPAP) by linking genomics to opioid metabolism, CPIC guidelines, precision dosing, clinical safety, and personalizing analgesia\n\nAim 2. Implement and evaluate PPAP in children undergoing major inpatient surgery, posterior spinal fusion (PSF)\n\n1. Determine genetic factors predisposing children to immediate and long-term postoperative methadone and oxycodone related adverse effects including RD, PONV, opioid dependence, and CPSP The investigators postulate that specific CYP2B6, ABCB1, OPRM1, FAAH, and CYP2D6 variants identify children at risk for poor pain relief, RD, PONV, opioid dependence, and CPSP in the postoperative period.\n2. Determine genetic variants-based perioperative dosing and outpatient prescribing of opioids\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 variants will explain pharmacokinetic variations of methadone and oxycodone, determine the right doses, and implement precision opioid use for optimal clinical outcomes"
