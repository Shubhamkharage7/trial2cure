In the reSET app you will get the chance to earn rewards for two activities: (1) completing a module and (2) providing a negative urine drug screen in exchange for a motivational or monetary prize. You will have 12 weeks to complete as many modules as you like, about 4 modules per week. Each module takes approximately 10-15 min. Every 3-4 days you will meet with the same study team member to provide a urine drug screen from a place comfortable for you (e.g. home) which will be observed and read via Zoom.",
