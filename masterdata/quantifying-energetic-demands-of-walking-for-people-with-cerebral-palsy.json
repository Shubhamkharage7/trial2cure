            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the underlying mechanisms that contribute to high energy costs for people with cerebral palsy (CP) as they walk.\n\nThe investigators will characterize the cost landscape of children with CP, quantifying the magnitude of cost (net nondimensional oxygen consumption) associated with walking and common sub-tasks of walking, such as supporting and stabilizing the body.",
            "detailedDescription": "Children with CP use large amounts of energy to walk and move, leading to fatigue and limiting participation. For people with CP the energetic cost of walking is on average over two times higher than typically-developing (TD) peers. This means that for people with CP, walking is as tiring as jogging or climbing stairs. An energetic cost of this magnitude restricts activities of daily living (ADL) and causes exhaustion.\n\nWhile the investigators and many others have sought to reduce these energetic costs through surgical interventions, rehabilitation, orthotics, or other assistive devices, these strategies have failed to result in meaningful reductions in energy. To design strategies that successfully reduce walking costs, the investigators must first understand the underlying mechanisms contributing to elevated cost in people with CP. This basic-science research will provide the foundation to create evidence-based strategies to decrease energy costs, minimize fatigue, and increase quality of life for people with CP and other neurologic injuries."
