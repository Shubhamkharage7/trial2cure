The overall goal is to examine the preliminary efficacy of iSIPsmarter in a 2 group \\[iSIPsmarter vs. static Patient Education (PE) website\\] by 4 assessment (Pre, 3-, 6- and 18-month follow-up) design. The generated pilot data will allow us to better understand efficacy and engagement outcomes among Black participants. We anticipate trends that iSIPsmarter will be more efficacious at reducing SSB consumption than a PE website at post assessment."
