            "detailedDescription": "The principal investigator's central hypothesis is that a tailored implementation intervention (toolkit) that integrates the known advantages of using telemedicine for burn consultation with new knowledge regarding clinician perceptions and the setting in which they work will improve the feasibility, acceptance, intention to use, and uptake of burn teleconsultation. The implementation intervention will enable rapid burn teleconsultation implementation under crisis circumstances and assist clinicians to virtually connect the person caring for a burn patient anywhere to the entire burn team's expertise. The study results will lead to more robust national crisis, wartime, and disaster response plans, improve quality of burn care, and decrease morbidity and mortality from serious burn injury, regardless of injury location."
