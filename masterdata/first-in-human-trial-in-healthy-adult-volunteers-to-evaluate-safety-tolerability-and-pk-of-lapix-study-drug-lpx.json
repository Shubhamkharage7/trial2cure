Clinical laboratory evaluations performed at screening, are within acceptable normal reference ranges (Grade 1 abnormalities may be acceptable if deemed necessary by the investigator. Grade 2 or higher would be exclusionary).\n7. Subjects who are willing and able to adhere to study protocol requirements including but not limited to scheduled outpatient visits, inpatient hospital stay, laboratory tests, and 12-lead ECG.\n8. Contraception - All subjects (male and female) must agree to use any two of the highly effective contraception methods listed below. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication for 6 weeks after the last dose in females and for 90 days after the last dose for males.\n\n   a.

Sexual abstinence -this is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated about the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.\n\nb. The following applies to all male subjects in the study: i. Sexual abstinence- this is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention.

History of or current compulsive abuse of alcohol or positive test for alcohol at screening or Day 0 of Visit 1\n10. History of or current use of or positive test at screening or Day 0 of Visit 1 for drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine \\[PCP\\], crack, opioid derivatives including heroin, and amphetamine derivatives.\n11. Consumption of any beverages or food containing alcohol or drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine \\[PCP\\], crack, opioid derivatives including heroin, and amphetamine derivatives from screening until donating the last sample of the study\n12. Use of medications for the timeframes specified below, except for medications exempted by the Investigator on a case-by-case basis because they are judged unlikely to affect the PK profile of the study drug or subject safety (e.g., topical drug products without significant systemic absorption):\n\n    * prescription medications within 14 days prior to dosing or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer;\n    * over-the-counter products and natural health products (including herbal remedies homeopathic and traditional medicines, probiotics, food supplements such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, and protein supplements used in sports) within 14 days prior to dosing or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, except for the occasional use of paracetamol (up to 2 g daily);\n    * any prescription or over-the-counter medication or natural health products used for the treatment of irregular bowel transit (e.g,. diarrhea, constipation) within 4 weeks prior to dosing;\n    * depot injection or implant of any drug within 3 months prior to dosing;\n    * use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic metabolism (including St. John's Wort \\[hypericin\\]) within 14 days prior to dosing.\n13. The subject has participated in another investigational study involving any investigational product within 60 days, or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the dose of the study drug.\n14. Pregnant or lactating women or women currently undergoing infertility treatments or women who intend to become pregnant during the time of study enrollment.\n15.
