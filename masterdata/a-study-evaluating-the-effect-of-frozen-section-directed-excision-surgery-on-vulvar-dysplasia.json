            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare \"Frozen-Section Directed Excision\", which has been a proven method of surgery used in dermatology, versus the current, standard method called \"Wide Local Excision\" to treat high-grade vulvar dysplasia.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, single-blinded study. The target population is adults \u2265 18 years of age with histological or cytological confirmation of VIN 2, VIN 3, VIN 2/3 or High-grade Dysplasia NOS with a planned excisional procedure, with high suspicion by the enrolling investigator that gross surgical margins of \u2265 3 mm can be achieved without laser or other destructive procedures. One group of subjects will be assigned to the Frozen-Section Directed Excision surgery arm and will undergo this procedure. The other group of subjects will be assigned to the Wide Local Excision (standard of care) arm and will undergo this procedure. The randomization will be 1:1, meaning for every subject who gets assigned to the Frozen-Section Directed Excision surgery arm, one will also be assigned to the Wide Local Excision arm. There is a 50% chance of getting randomized to either the Frozen-Section Directed Excision procedure or Wide Local Excision. Information regarding the surgery procedure, the amount of time the surgery procedure takes, and total amount of pain medication required during surgery and while in the surgery recovery area will be collected. The study team will also look at recurrence rates (return of the cancer) in six months, if any other therapies are required, and subject satisfaction related to the surgery, recovery, and sexual function by using questionnaires before and after the procedure."
