To perform imaging assessments of an early-stage magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system on patients using low field magnetic strength. Collect qualitative data from the image assessments to optimize device performance using a low field magnetic resonance imaging device in a simulated use environment; Collect qualitative data from the image assessments using a high field magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and ultrasound devices. Generate anonymized image data for post-acquisition evaluation, performance measuring and planning for subsequent study size"
