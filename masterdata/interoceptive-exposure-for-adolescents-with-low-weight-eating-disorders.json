Primary outcomes are expected body weight and clinical impairment. Three mechanisms of change (Autonomous Eating, Non-Judgmental Body Awareness, and Extinction Learning) will be examined in a process mediation models of change.",
            "detailedDescription": "A total of 120 individuals with Anorexia Nervosa ages 12-18 will be enrolled to either 20 sessions of outpatient Exposure-based Family Therapy (IE) or Family Based Therapy (FBT). The aims of the study are to test the comparative efficacy and primary mechanisms of change after 6 months of treatment and at one year post-treatment and to explore the mediators and moderators of the primary outcomes at these endpoints. All recruitment and study procedures will take place through the Center of Excellence in Eating and Weight Disorders at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Assessments will take place at 2-, 4-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months following baseline."

Early sessions include using exposure to foods and counterconditioning to pair a positive stimulus with a food that would typically produce food avoidance. Parents are trained to model this at home. Sessions mid-way through address the use of non-judgmental description of appearance during mirror exposure. Sessions at the end of the 20 weeks are focused on recognizing change, planning for future obstacles, and developing a relapse prevention plan to continue practicing distress tolerance, counter-conditioning, and food/body exposure.",

The therapist makes careful and persistent requests for united parental action toward re-feeding and/or regulating eating habits, the primary concern at this point of the treatment, and the therapist tries to create and reinforce a strong parental alliance around efforts at feeding the child.",
