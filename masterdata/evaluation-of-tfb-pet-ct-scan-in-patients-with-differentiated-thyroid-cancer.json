Diagnostic imaging is necessary for planning treatment, monitoring therapy response, and identifying sites of recurrent or metastatic disease in differentiated thyroid cancer. 18F-TFB PET/CT may accurately detect recurrent and metastatic thyroid cancer lesions, with the potential to provide information for patient management that is better than the current standard of care imaging practices.",

Evaluate fluorine F 18 tetrafluoroborate (18F-TFB) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients with intermediate or high risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and compare to the current clinical standard.\n\nII. Assess the impact of 18F-TFB PET/CT on clinical management.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive fluorine F 18 tetrafluoroborate intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan on study."
