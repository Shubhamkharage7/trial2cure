This study will also explore the concurrent role of poor oral health in supporting and driving chronic immune activation and inflammation in HIV infection.\n\nFollowing enrollment in study, patients will be followed up every 6 months for approximately 2.5 years (30 months). During this period, comprehensive medical records will be obtained, and study data will be updated every 6 months; questionnaires will be handed to patients periodically to assess quality of life and effects of xerostomia on QoL; social history will be assessed using TAPS; oral health will be evaluated every 6 months and blood, saliva, and oral swabs collected every 6 months. DXA scan and panoramic radiographs will also be taken at baseline and 24 months.\n\nAt the end of the study, caries rate, periodontal health, bone loss, QoL, salivary quantity and composition, presence or absence of white/red lesions, as well as inflammatory cytokines and immune activation markers will be assessed."
