Participants will attend a Screening Visit to confirm eligibility and then return to the clinic within 21 days to be randomized into the study. Randomized participants will receive a single dose of their allocated study medication (225 mg BNC210 or placebo) and approximately 1 hour later participate in a behavioral assessment task. After 1 week, a safety follow-up assessment will be conducted by phone/video conference."
