Participants will be enrolled in the study and randomized in their preoperative clinic visit. On the day of surgery, they will receive the intervention they were randomized to. 10 patients will be randomized to the intercostal block group, 10 patients will be randomized to the cryo-ablation plus intercostal block group, and 10 patients will be randomized to the serratus plane catheter plus intercostal block group. They will be followed throughout their hospital stay until discharge for data collection purposes. Once the patient is discharged from the hospital, post-operative follow-up in the Swedish Thoracic Surgery Clinic will be collected up to 1 year post-operatively."
