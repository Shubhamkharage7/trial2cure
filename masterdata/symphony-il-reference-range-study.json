            "briefSummary": "Symphony IL-6 is a device that quantitates human IL-6 by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA) from whole-blood specimens. Use of Symphony IL- 6 removes the need for plasma separation before testing. Symphony IL-6 comprises two components, the Symphony Fluorescence Immunoanalyzer and the Symphony IL-6 Cartridge. Whole blood is added to the cartridge and then up to six cartridges can be inserted into the immunoanalyzer. After 20 minutes a readout and printout are given with a quantitative IL-6 concentration. The used cartridges are fully enclosed and can be easily disposed of in general hospital bio-waste. Given the nature of this device and its portability, there is potential for future deployment as a point-of-care (POC) device.\n\nThe objective of this study is to establish a reference range for Symphony IL-6 in a cohort of apparently healthy individuals."
