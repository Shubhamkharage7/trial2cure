Prior research suggests that social support plays an important role in regulating emotional responses, a process called social emotion regulation. This study will test whether a history of IPT and/or ethno-racial discrimination influence the social regulation of arousal and vigilance. Social regulation will be tested by contrasting responses under conditions with and without social support."
