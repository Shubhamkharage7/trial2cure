            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to compare two snacks, one with honey and nuts and the other with sugar and nuts, on glucose levels before and after eating these snacks.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that honey and nuts will have an additive effect on the reduction of postprandial glucose response. The investigators further hypothesize that consumption of honey paired with nuts will retain the benefit of sugar consumption in satiety and reduction of metabolic stress.",
            "detailedDescription": "Consuming sugar creates a feeling of satiation, and may buffer metabolic stress. However, prolonged postprandial hyperglycemia has been identified as a potential risk factor in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Nuts, which are recommended to be consumed as part of a Mediterranean diet, up to 2 servings per day, have been shown to dramatically reduce postprandial glucose response to carbohydrates. Additionally, honey, which is typically used as an added sugar within a Mediterranean diet pattern, has a lower glycemic index than table sugar and may result in a reduced postprandial glucose response relative to other nutritive sweeteners. However, it is not yet known whether honey can work additively with nuts to further reduce postprandial glucose response over the reduction caused by nuts alone.\n\nHoney has been shown to produce equivalent or greater satiety to regular table sugar and there is some indication that honey can improve immediate/working memory. Therefore, combined consumption of honey and nuts may offer a way to maximize the benefits of carbohydrate consumption on satiety and metabolic stress reduction while minimizing its negative effects on metabolism. However, it is not yet known whether sugars contained in the more complex food matrix of honey, consumed together with a food like nuts can impact satiety and metabolic stress in the way that has been observed for sugar."
