            "briefSummary": "We will perform a randomized sham-controlled trial of aiTBS to an anxiosomatic circuit in patients with anxiety-related disorders (i.e., panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder). 80 participants with an anxiety-related disorder (defined below) will receive 50 active or sham TMS treatments over 5 days (following the SAINT protocol, which is FDA-cleared for MDD. The primary outcome will be the BAI, with a modified recall window to reflect the short treatment interval. Participants randomized to sham will be offered an open-label crossover extension.",
            "detailedDescription": "We recently derived a novel TMS target for anxiety via lesion and brain stimulation mapping methods. We prospectively tested this target in a sample of participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) with comorbid anxiety symptoms and found that it was more effective for anxiety (median change 60.0% vs 39.8%, p=0.01) than the conventional TMS target for MDD with comorbid anxiety. While these results are promising, it remains unclear how our target works for anxiety-related disorders as opposed to MDD comorbid anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we used conventional 10 Hz TMS, but accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) has now been shown to improve outcomes and is now an FDA approved treatment protocol. Finally, we tested the translational hypothesis that stimulating different circuits can modify different behaviors; clinical efficacy was a secondary outcome.\n\nThis double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled aiTBS trial will test the efficacy of our novel anxiety target. 80 participants with anxiety-related disorders (i.e., panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder) will receive 50 active or sham TMS treatments over 5 days. Changes in anxiety symptoms/processes will be assessed via validated measures (primary outcome measure: Beck Anxiety Inventory) during treatment and follow-up visits up to one-year post-treatment. Participants randomized to sham who do not respond will be offered an open-label crossover extension."
