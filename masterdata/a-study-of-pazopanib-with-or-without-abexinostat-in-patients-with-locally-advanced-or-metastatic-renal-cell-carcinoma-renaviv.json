At the time of disease progression, patient treatment assignment will be unblinded, and those patients randomized to the pazopanib plus placebo treatment arm will have the option of crossing over to receive treatment with a combination of pazopanib plus abexinostat. After providing written informed consent, patients will be screened for study eligibility within 28 days before their first dose of study drug. After screening assessments, patients who are eligible for inclusion in the study will be randomized and receive their first dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), within 7 days of randomization. A treatment cycle is 28 days in length. Patients may continue to receive study drug until any of the following events: the development of IRC-verified radiographic progression as assessed by RECIST version 1.1, clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, another discontinuation criterion is met, withdrawal of consent, or closure of the study by the sponsor. No maximum duration of therapy has been set."
