Study outcomes include patient-reported symptoms and objectively assessed sleep parameters assessed before treatment, during and after 10 weeks of MAD intervention (during pregnancy) and postpartum.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to explore MAD as an alternative treatment option for OSA in pregnant women. We are recruiting a small number of 10 healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated OSA (absence of significant cardiovascular, metabolic or neurocognitive consequences) who, after being offered CPAP as the recommended standard treatment, prefer to use a MAD over CPAP. All patients are recruited from a single center. We would like to get a first impression on the comfort level of these women with the MAD and their self-reported compliance and any improvement of symptoms with treatment. Additionally, we would like to test efficacy in controlling OSA with pregnancy progression. Finally, we would like to derive overall treatment effectiveness of the MAD in pregnant women as defined as a combination of efficacy and compliance."
