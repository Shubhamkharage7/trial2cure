Participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (exoskeleton training with TSCS, or exoskeleton training without TSCS). Participants in both groups will undergo a baseline evaluation, then take part in 24, 1-hour training sessions at Craig Hospital. After the 24 sessions have concluded, participants will undergo a post-treatment evaluation as well as a follow-up evaluation four weeks after training is completed. Researchers will compare the two groups by evaluating the following areas:\n\n* walking ability and speed\n* lower extremity strength, activation, and spasticity\n* trunk control\n* bowel and bladder function"
