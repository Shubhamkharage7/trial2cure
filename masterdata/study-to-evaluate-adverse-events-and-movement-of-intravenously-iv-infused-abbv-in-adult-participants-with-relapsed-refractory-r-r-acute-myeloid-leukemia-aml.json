This study is to evaluate how safe ABBV-787 is and how it moves within the body in adult participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Adverse events and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABBV-787 will be assessed.\n\nABBV-787 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of AML. Participants will receive ABBV-787 in escalating doses until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Approximately 60 adult participants with a diagnosis of AML will be enrolled worldwide.\n\nParticipants will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of ABBV-787 during the approximately 3 year duration a participant is followed.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests and checking for side effects."
