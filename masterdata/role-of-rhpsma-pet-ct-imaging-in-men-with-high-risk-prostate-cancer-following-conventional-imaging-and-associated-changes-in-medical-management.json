            "detailedDescription": "Consented patients will be screened to determine eligibility for the study prior to investigational product (IP) administration. In addition to their routine clinical work-up, which will include 99mtechnetium-biphosphonate bone scan and abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and chest CT per local practice, and before the scheduled radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), or radical pelvic radiation therapy, patients will receive 8 mCi (296 MBq) \u00b1 20% rhPSMA-7.3, delivered as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection, followed by PET imaging. For each patient, the PET imaging results will be reported to the responsible physician prior to the planned treatment. Imaging results and further procedures/treatment plan should be discussed with the patient within 7 days after rhPSMA-7.3 imaging (this may be conducted by telephone at the clinician's discretion). Within 45 days post-IP administration, the patient will receive treatment as follows:\n\n* Standard of care surgical treatment of PCa, including PLND; or\n* If the rhPSMA-7.3 PET scan detects M1 lesion(s):\n\n  * A biopsy/surgery and/or additional imaging to confirm M1 lesion(s) will be required prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT with conventional imaging for detecting metastatic disease in men with high-risk prostate cancer and the impact on medical management of these men. Accurate staging of newly diagnosed PCa assists in directing appropriate treatment strategies. In patients with high-risk PCa, the primary goal of imaging is to detect extra-prostatic disease. The identification of metastatic disease may significantly change the planned treatment regimen from locoregional to systemic therapy"
