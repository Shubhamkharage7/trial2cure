            "briefSummary": "Depression is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and this comorbidity contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality of women. The menopausal transition or perimenopause is a period of vulnerability for both depression and CVD, making it a key time to study this critical public health issue. This research will preliminarily explore whether disruption in two novel stress pathways 1) the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) and their relationship may underlie the link between these illnesses. Findings will provide important insight into potential mechanisms by which depression during perimenopause may increase risk for CVD in midlife women, which will inform potential risk reduction and treatment strategies that can improve health outcomes in this population.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study uses an experimental stress task to induce mild social stress and activation of two physiological stress pathways (the RAAS and ANS) that may be be involved in the association between perimenopausal depression and risk for cardiovascular disease in women. Perimenopausal women with mild-moderate depressive symptoms and healthy women without any psychiatric history will be enrolled. All participants will complete the same study procedures.\n\nDuring the first visit (conducted remotely) consent will be obtained. After consent, participants will answer questions about their psychiatric history as part of a standardized psychological assessment (the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and medical/reproductive history, including current medications. They will also complete brief questionnaires about their current mood symptoms and history of exposure to trauma. Risk for self-harm using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) will be assessed. After it is determined that a participant is eligible based on these assessments, she will then be given instruction for how to prepare for the second study visit, including refraining from exercise, alcohol, caffeine for at least 4 hours prior to the visit. Dietary education is also provided and participants are asked to keep a food journal for 3 days prior to the second study visit to standardize nutritional content prior to the second study visit.\n\nDuring the second visit (conduced in-person in a laboratory setting) participants will complete a brief stress task. All of these visits will be conducted between 2-6 in the afternoon/evening.This visit will have four components:\n\n1. Orientation: participants will be oriented to the study visit and taught how to do the saliva collection. Height and weight will be measured and a urine pregnancy test completed. The CSSRS will be repeated for safety.\n2. Rest period: this includes a 30-minute resting period in the seated position. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on mood, anxiety, sleep and menopausal symptoms. 2 electrocardiogram (EKG) leads and nodes will be applied for the heart rate monitoring portion. During any residual time white noise will be played and the lights dimmed to promote relaxation.\n3. Completion of the stress task (the Trier Social Stress Test or TSST): this task involves social evaluation, speech, and math related stress and takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants are introduced to a 1-2-person committee. The participant will assume the role of a job applicant who is invited for a personnel interview with the committee. Anticipation: The participant prepares for 5 minutes. Speech (5 mins): The committee asks the participant to deliver her talk for 5 minutes. The committee responds with prepared questions to ensure that the talk lasts for 5 minutes. Serial Subtraction (5 mins): The committee members will give the participant a number to start from and then ask them to subtract a number from that original number and then continue to subtract that same number, saying aloud the answers until they get to zero.\n4. Recovery and debriefing: during this phase the participant rests alone. After recovery is complete the study team will debrief with the participant about the nature of stress task and answer any questions.\n\nSample collection: blood and saliva will be collected immediately prior to and following the stress task. Saliva is also collected at 10 and 20 minutes after the stress task. Heart rate will be measured through the duration of the stress task and recovery period.\n\nThe third visit includes a brief telephone call with the principal investigator to review participation in the study and answer any questions."
