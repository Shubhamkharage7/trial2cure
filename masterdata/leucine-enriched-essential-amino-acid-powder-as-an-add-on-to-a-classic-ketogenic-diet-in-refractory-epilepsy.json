The study will enroll patients who have previously been compliant with their classical KD regimen for at least 28 days prior to enrollment and have experienced some response (\u226540% reduction in seizures), but not complete response (\\<90% reduction in seizures) to dietary management with KD. Study duration is 84 days and will have 3 remote study visits (Baseline- Remote Visit 1, Dose Adjustment- Remote Visit 2, and Final- Remote Visit 3) and a pre-screening communication via telephone/video."
