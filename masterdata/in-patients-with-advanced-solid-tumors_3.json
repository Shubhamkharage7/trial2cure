Each part will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period, an end of treatment visit and a safety follow-up of approximately 30 days after the last dose. IPG7236 will be given on an empty stomach (either one hour before or two hours after a meal) twice daily (approximately every 12 hours) in continuous 28-day cycles."
