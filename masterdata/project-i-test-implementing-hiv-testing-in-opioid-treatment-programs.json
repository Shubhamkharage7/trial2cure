            "briefSummary": "This study will test two active evidence-based \"practice coaching\" (PC) interventions to improve opioid treatment programs' (OTPs') provision and sustained implementation of on-site 1) HIV testing and linkage to care and 2) HIV/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and linkage to care among patients seeking/receiving substance use disorder treatment.\n\nAims are:\n\nAim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the PC interventions on improving patient uptake of HIV testing in OTPs including the incremental impact of the HIV/HCV intervention on HIV testing.\n\nAim 2: To examine, using mixed-methods, the impact of the PC interventions on the initiation and sustained provision of HIV testing and timely linkage to care.\n\nAim 3: To evaluate the health outcomes, health care utilization, and cost-effectiveness of the PC interventions compared incrementally to one another and to the control condition.\n\nPrimary Hypothesis:\n\n1. The two PC interventions will result in significantly higher proportions of patients tested for HIV than the information control condition during the \"initial impact\" period (7-12 months post-randomization or T3), controlling for the proportion of patients tested during the baseline period, T1 (Primary) and during the \"sustained impact\" period, 13-18 months post-randomization or T4 (Secondary).\n2. The HIV/HCV PC intervention will result in significantly higher proportions of patients tested for HIV than the HIV PC intervention during the initial impact period (7-12 months post-randomization or T3), controlling for the proportion of patients tested during the baseline period, T1 (Secondary) and during the \"sustained impact\" period, 13-18 months post-randomization or T4 (Secondary).",
            "detailedDescription": "Using the most recent National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) data available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as the sampling frame, 51 sites will be randomly selected to participate in the study. Site randomization to condition will occur on a rolling basis. Selected sites will be invited to participate in the study and randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions (17 sites per condition) -- information control, HIV PC, and HIV/HCV PC. The control condition will be an HIV testing informational product consisting of the official NIDA/SAMHSA Blending Initiative product, \"HIV Rapid Testing in Substance Abuse Treatment Programs,\" ARTAS intervention information and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) information that will be provided to OTPs to educate and motivate them about the importance of offering on-site HIV testing and linkage to care. In the active PC conditions, champions and key OTP staff will be provided coaching and support for the implementation of an innovation (i.e., offering HIV testing on-site and linking persons living with HIV to care) and for sustaining resulting improvements in testing.\n\nDe-identified aggregate client data on HIV and HCV testing and linkage to care will be provided by the sites for four 6-month-long time intervals: T1 (up to 6 months prior to randomization), T2 (during the intervention/control period, up to 6 months post-randomziation), T3 (7-12 months post-randomization), and T4 (13-18 months post-randomization). Qualitative and quantitative site-level data will also be collected immediately preceding randomization and again during interval T3."
