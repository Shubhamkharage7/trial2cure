PPT will be defined as the point at which the participant verbally indicated that the pressure first changed to slight pain. A lower PPT value (Kgf) represents greater pain sensitivity. PPT will be assessed 3 times at each location and averaged. Furthermore, changes in PPT after exercise has been used to assess the degree of exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH).
