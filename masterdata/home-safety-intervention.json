As such, VA/DoD guidelines for the care of individuals with elevated suicide risk include recommendations that clinicians deliver interventions to reduce access to lethal methods of suicide among patients who are identified as having elevated suicide risk. However, no interventions have been developed or tested among Veterans with elevated suicide risk. The aim of this study is to pilot test a lethal means safety intervention developed specifically for Veterans who seek care in VHA clinical settings and are identified as having elevated suicide risk.",
