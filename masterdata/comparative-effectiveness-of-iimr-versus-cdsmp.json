            "briefSummary": "The study will enroll 600 people with serious mental illness who receive services at Centerstone in KY or TN and will compare two different evidence-based self-management interventions: Integrated Illness Management and Recovery (I-IMR), a program developed by the study team at Dartmouth that trains people with serious mental illness on physical and mental health self-management, and the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP), a program largely focused on physical health self-management that has been used widely in the general population.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study will be the first to compare two commonly used but substantially different, evidence-based self-management interventions. Integrated Illness Management and Recovery (I-IMR), is an individually-tailored, 16-session, integrated program combining both physical and mental health self-management specifically developed for people with SMI. In contrast, the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is a group-based, 6-session, chronic disease self-management program largely focused on physical health self-management alone. I-IMR is delivered by community mental health providers or by community outreach workers, while CDSMP is co-delivered by two peers or by a health professional and a peer. Both programs have been widely recommended, disseminated, and used. The proposed parent study will randomize people with serious mental illness to I-IMR (n=300) and CDSMP (n=300)."
