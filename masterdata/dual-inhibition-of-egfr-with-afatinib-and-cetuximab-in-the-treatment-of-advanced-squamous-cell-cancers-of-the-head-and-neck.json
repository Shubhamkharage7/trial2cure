After a baseline evaluation and biopsy (where feasible), they will be treated with weekly/bi-weekly intravenous cetuximab and daily oral afatinib. Biopsy will be repeated where feasible after 4 weeks (window of +1 week) on therapy and again at disease progression or end of treatment.\n\nTreatment will continue until disease progression or development of Grade 3 or higher drug related toxicities that fail to resolve to Grade 2 despite appropriate supportive care."

Cetuximab use is not permitted for recurrent/metastatic disease\n* Radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Palliative radiation to target organs may be allowed up to 2 weeks prior to enrollment, as long as there are other target lesions that can be monitored for response to study treatment.\n* Known hypersensitivity to afatinib or its excipients\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men who are able to father a child, unwilling to be abstinent or use highly effective methods of birth control prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for at least 4 weeks after treatment has ended.\n* Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial.\n* Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study or interfere with the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the test drug.\n* Concomitant malignancies at other sites that are being actively treated with systemic therapy\n* Requiring treatment with any of the prohibited concomitant medications that cannot be stopped for the duration of trial participation.\n* Clinically significant interstitial lung disease.\n* Known history of untreated viral hepatitis or HIV.\n* Patients with parenchymal brain metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy\n* Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis",
