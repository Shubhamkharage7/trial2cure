Data collected will be used to better characterize the natural history and longitudinal trajectory of the disease. This will be done through the standardized data collection including validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the active evaluation of prevalent and incident comorbidities and adverse events, and the recording of medication utilization patterns. Personal information is also collected from each consenting registry subject allowing for linkages to other public or private clinical and administrative databases, as well as to databases maintained by organizations focused on the care and treatment of GPP for the purposes of clinical, market, or outcomes research.\n\nThis provides an opportunity to evaluate other aspects of the disease and its treatment, including but not limited to clinical and drug cost-effectiveness, health care resource utilization, and subject adherence."
