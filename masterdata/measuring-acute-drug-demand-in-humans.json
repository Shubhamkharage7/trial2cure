Suvorexant is not approved as a treatment to reduce drug use but is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat insomnia (trouble falling asleep or staying asleep). This study consists of a screening visit and an approximate 14 to 16 day inpatient (overnight) stay at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Participants will be stabilized on hydromorphone, randomly assigned to receive either suvorexant or placebo, and complete 5 experimental sessions that include taking blinded study medications."
