Participants on the waiting list for kidney transplant will be given the standard 2 doses of Shingrix. Those participants who have been transplanted by 16 months, may be given a 3rd dose of Shingrix.",
            "detailedDescription": "Herpes Zoster (HZ) is a common complication of kidney transplant because of the immune suppressive drugs necessary to prepare the recipient for the transplanted organ and to protect it from rejection. The use of the live vaccine, Zostavax, in transplant recipients is contraindicated due to their impaired immune status. This study is being done to determine vaccine responses to the FDA approved shingles vaccine, Shingrix, in patients with chronic renal failure eligible for kidney transplant. Persistence of immune responses after kidney transplantation, and immunologic advantage of a third dose of Shingrix to renal transplant recipients will be assessed. Additionally, safety, tolerability, and occurrence of HZ will be evaluated. 60 participants will be enrolled from the renal transplant services at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus."
