            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to help providers develop an interdisciplinary treatment pathway for functional neurological disorder (FND) at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and will involve psychiatry, speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. The study will also help providers to evaluate the treatment pathway and publish results regarding the process and outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Prospective Study: Adult patients, and pediatric patients and their parent/guardian who are referred to the UAB functional neurological disorder (FND) clinical pathway will be screened for eligibility. Overall 750 participants (250 adult patients, 250 pediatric patients and their parent/guardian) will be enrolled in the prospective study.\n\nFor patients for whom an FND inpatient consult has been requested, the consulting psychologist will screen eligible participants. For outpatient FND patients, the psychiatry FND clinic scheduling coordinator will screen patients for eligibility. Potential eligible participants will provide verbal consent during the screening phone call.\n\nOnce verbal consent has been obtained, participants will be given the pre-treatment survey questions (via email for outpatient referrals, via a tablet computer for inpatient consults). These surveys will be different for adult FND patients, children with FND, and parents/guardians of children with FND; each survey will contain the appropriate consent/assent form. Participants will complete the pre-treatment surveys once they sign the appropriate consent/assent form.\n\nDuring each outpatient visit with a clinician, patients will be administered the one-item Clinical Global Improvement Scale and asked about retrospective symptom frequency, which will be entered directly into the electronic health record (EHR). If patients are seeing physical, occupational, or speech therapy (PT/OT/Speech), the clinician will enter clinical measures directly into the EHR. Following the course of FND treatment, participants and parents/guardians (where applicable) will complete the post-survey questionnaires.\n\nParticipants may be asked to provide full facial pictures and/or videos before treatment and after treatment.\n\nRetrospective study: EHR data of participants who recieved FND treatment at UAB FND clinical pathway from Jan 2020 to May 2023 will be collected retrospectively. 500 records will be screened for potential inclusion in the study. Overall, data will be extracted from 350 patient records.\n\nThe research team will utilize EHR entries to pull any clinical data related to FND treatment visits (inpatient consults, outpatient psychiatry/PT/OT/Speech). This EHR data collection will be both retrospective and prospective, and include all records related to FND treatment, including neurology, PT/OT/Speech, and psychiatry notes.\n\nThe cost of participant's standard medical care will be billed to them and/or their insurance company in the usual manner. Participants will not be paid for participation in the study."
