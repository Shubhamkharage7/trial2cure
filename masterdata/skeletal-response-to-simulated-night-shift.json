The specific aim of the study is to determine if NSW acutely uncouples bone turnover markers (BTMs), if sympathetic tone is a mechanism for this disruption and if a resumption of a normal sleep/wake pattern reverses BTM uncoupling. Our hypothesis is that NSW will reversibly uncouple BTMs via increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tone."

Individuals with a history of most psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders will be excluded, such as but not limited to depression, anxiety, alcoholism, drug dependency, schizophrenic disorders, and personality disorders (performed by medical history and physician interview).

Sleep disorders will be screened by self-report and physician interview including use of validated sleep questionnaires (PSQI, Epworth sleepiness scale, and Berlin sleep questionnaire for sleep apnea). The following scores will be used to exclude those with sleep disorders: PSQI \\>5, Epworth Sleepiness Scale \\>9.\n* Individuals on medications known to affect bone turnover (e.g., glucocorticoids, osteoporosis medications);\n* Use of medications/supplements/drugs that impact sleep or bone metabolism (such as but not limited to sleep medications, marijuana, etc.) within one month (participants can be studied at a later date).\n* Dwelling below Denver altitude (1,600 m) 1 month prior to enrollment.\n* Greater than moderate caffeine (\\>500 mg/day) or alcohol use (\\>14 standard drinks/ week or \\>5 drinks in one sitting)\n* Inability to travel to the CU-AMC campus for study visits.\n* Individuals with restrictive diets (e.g., vegan)\n* Individuals with 25OHD \\< 20 ng/mL (may be studied at a later date)\n* Individuals with eGFR \\< 60 mL/min/1.73m2 as this is known to affect CTX measurements.\n* Z-score \\< -2.0 for bone mineral density at the L-spine, femoral neck, or total hip on baseline DXA as compared to the DXA machine's normative database.\n* Symptoms of active illness (e.g., fever) at time of enrollment; note - participant may be studied at a later date.\n* Restrictive diets that cannot be accommodated by the CTRC Nutrition Core\n* Any other reason that participant may not be able to safely complete the entire study, at PI discretion",
