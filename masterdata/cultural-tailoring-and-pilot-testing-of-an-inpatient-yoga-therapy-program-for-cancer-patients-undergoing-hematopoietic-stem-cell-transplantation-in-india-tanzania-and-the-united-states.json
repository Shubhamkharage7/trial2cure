We will conduct semi-structured interviews with patients from each center to examine cultural norms, culturally sensitive language, and specific factors relevant to yoga and psychosocial support.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To optimize the HSCT YT program using an iterative process. Fifteen patients from each center (or until thematic saturation based on exit interviews) will participate in the yoga program two weeks prior to the transplant and throughout the first 30 days of the HSCT. Sessions will be delivered in person, via telehealth (Zoom), or in combination.\n2. To examine the feasibility of adherence and follow-up completion. We will declare the intervention feasible if: (a) at least 50% of patients complete a minimum of 50% of the 12 YT sessions, and (b) at least 60% of participants complete follow-up measures at 2 months after transplant (\u00b1 7 days)."
