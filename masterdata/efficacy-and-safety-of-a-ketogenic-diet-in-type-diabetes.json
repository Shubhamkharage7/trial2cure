            "briefSummary": "Despite strong evidence that tight control of blood sugar reduces the risk of diabetes complications, most people with type 1 diabetes do not achieve recommended blood sugar targets. This randomized controlled trial will test whether a very-low- carbohydrate ketogenic diet can effectively and safely improve blood sugar control in adults with type 1 diabetes.",
            "detailedDescription": "A very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (\u226450 g carbohydrate/day) could reduce glycemic variability, total daily insulin requirement, and HbA1c in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Indeed, several case series and observational studies of using a ketogenic diet (KD) in people with T1D have observed such benefits. However, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the efficacy of KD for \\>7 days in people with T1D. In addition, there are serious concerns regarding the safety and tolerability of a KD in patients with T1D, including the potential for an increased risk of hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, decreased bone mineral density, and impaired quality of life. This study is a 26-week RCT to evaluate the clinical efficacy, metabolic function, safety, socio-behavioral impact, acceptability and potential for dissemination of an isocaloric KD compared with an American Diabetes Association-recommended control diet in adults with T1D."
