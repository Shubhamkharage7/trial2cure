The lay VA volunteer will provide patients with education about precision medicine and support in their care. Researchers will compare a control group who will receive their usual oncology care as provided by clinical teams at the VA. There will be no change in their care.\n\nAll participants will be asked to complete a survey at the time of enrollment in the study, and also at 1 month. This survey will measure patient participation in their cancer care, satisfaction with healthcare decisions, and overall questions about knowledge of precision medicine."
