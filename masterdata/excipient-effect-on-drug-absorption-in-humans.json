Investigators will assess the effect of SLS on the absorption of fexofenadine by measuring SLS and fexofenadine concentrations in plasma and stool samples and determine the change in AUC (area under the curve), Cmax and other pharmacokinetic parameters, between Treatment Arms 2 or 3 and Treatment Arm 1."
