            "detailedDescription": "The investigators baseline postoperative ileus (POI) rate in the setting of open abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) is similar to patients undergoing an open bowel resection and often prolongs patients' hospital stay. Therefore, the investigators aim to determine whether the use of sugammadex has a clinically significant impact on return of postoperative bowel function and prevention of POI in these patients.\n\nThe primary outcome is GI-2: postoperative time until passage of 1st bowel movement and tolerance of solid food.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize:\n\n* postoperative time to return of bowel function (GI-2) after open AWR will be significantly shorter for patients who receive sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade when compared to those receiving standard of care (neostigmine/glycopyrrolate).\n* patients who receive sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade will have a reduced incidence of POI requiring nasogastric tube (NG) placement, and decreased length of hospital stay when compared to standard of care.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine if the use of sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal reduces the time to postoperative GI-2 bowel function compared to neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for neuromuscular blockade reversal.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To determine if sugammadex reduces the incidence of postoperative NG placement compared to neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for neuromuscular blockade reversal.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To determine if sugammadex reduces postoperative length of stay following AWR compared to neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for neuromuscular blockade reversal."
