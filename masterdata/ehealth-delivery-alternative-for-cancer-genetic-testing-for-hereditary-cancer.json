            "briefSummary": "This randomized non-inferiority study will use a 2x2 design where traditional standard-of-care pre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling delivered by a genetic counselor are replaced with a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention to provide critical data to inform optimal ways to deliver clinical genetic testing in eligible individuals, while maintaining quality of care and favorable cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Germline cancer genetic testing has become a standard evidence-based practice, with established risk reduction and cancer screening guidelines for genetic carriers. Access to genetic specialists is limited in many areas in the US, and the traditional medical delivery model of pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic professional will not support the rising indications for genetic testing. Recent data from the National Health Interview Survey found that \\<20% of eligible patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer underwent genetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of offering web-based eHealth delivery alternatives of pre/post-test genetic counseling to provide equal or improved timely uptake of genetic services and testing, and short-term cognitive (e.g. understanding), affective (e.g. distress and uncertainty) and behavioral (risk reducing and screening behaviors and communication to providers and relatives) outcomes in patients with barriers to genetic testing as compared to the traditional two-visit delivery model with a genetic counselor."
