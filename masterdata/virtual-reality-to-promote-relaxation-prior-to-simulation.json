            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this prospective feasibility study is to assess the implementation of a VR-based intervention in patients who are pending initiation of RT. The investigators hypothesize that this intervention will be safe and feasible. If 75% of enrolled patients complete the VR intervention (defined as at least 8 min before permanent discontinuation), then feasibility will be met. Ten minutes' length is likely to be tolerated by most patients and likely to provide benefit. The maximum length of the VR video is 11 minutes. Patients will still be evaluable after 8 minutes of the video as this provides ample time to practice mindfulness based breathing exercises.\n\nAs this is a feasibility study, investigators and participants will not be blinded to study procedures. Potential study participants will be adult patients who are undergoing simulation for radiation treatment planning at the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine at Penn Medicine. This is a single site study. No interim analyses or sub-studies are planned. Based on the expected accrual of 25 patients, futility and early termination will be triggered if 6 participants fail to meet the conditions described above."
