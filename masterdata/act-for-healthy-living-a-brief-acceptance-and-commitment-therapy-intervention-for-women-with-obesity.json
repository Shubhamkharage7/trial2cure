            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate if a 4-hour acceptance and commitment therapy workshop can help the adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyle behaviors in women with obesity. The objectives are as follows:\n\n1. To assess changes in ACT-related constructs before and after the workshop\n2. To assess changes in other psychological constructs that have been shown to hinder successful weight management before and after the workshop\n3. To assess changes in dietary and physical activity behaviors before and after the workshop. Participants will complete baseline questionnaires and anthropometric measures at three time points: baseline, 1 week after the workshop, and 1 month after the workshop. Researchers will compare an active intervention group to a waitlist control group to investigate the efficacy of the workshop.",
            "detailedDescription": "Acceptance and commitment therapy interventions demonstrate efficacy for weight loss. ACT-based workshops represent an innovative and potentially scalable application of this approach to obesity treatment. 70 women will be recruited to participate. Half of the participants (n = 35) will receive a brief ( approximately 4-hour) workshop that aims to facilitate the development and maintenance of healthy lifestyle behaviors using ACT principles such as valued living and committed action. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1-week, and 1-month post-intervention."
