            "detailedDescription": "Design. Current activities consist of a Feasibility study to test all activities prior to the full study. The Feasibility study will involve only 5 centers and each participant will be involved for only 3 months. The study will consist of a four arm, patient level randomized trial (N=125). Comparators: Rescue Inhaled Corticosteroids (R-ICS) versus azithromycin versus R-ICS plus azithromycin versus enhanced usual care patients. All arms will include home monitoring of asthma symptoms using various approaches. R-ICS therapy will consist of a corticosteriod/formoterol inhaler, or a stand-alone ICS inhaler used with usual rescue therapy or when available a combination corticosteroid/albuterol inhaler, the initial azithromycin dose will be 500mg (10mg/Kg) three times a week and may be titrated down to 250mg (10mg/Kg) three times per week for side effects. Exacerbations will be blindly adjudicated. Individuals who experience three exacerbations in \\< 12 months in the full study will have their treatments \"stepped-up,\"unless in the dual treatment arm; control participants going to R-ICS and single therapy participants to dual therapy. In the full study, after a step-up participants will be followed for an additional 12 months. There will be no step-up during the Feasibility phase. Individuals completing either of the azithromycin arms will be offered 6 additional months of follow-up after stopping the azithromycin only."
