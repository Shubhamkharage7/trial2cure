The proposed study will address this public health issue by developing a communication-based intervention designed to improve Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) patients' and care partners' understanding of the disease trajectory, engagement in ACP, distress and care partner burden, and completion of advance directives and receipt of goal-concordant care at the end-of-life. Therefore, this study is aligned with the National Institute on Aging's long-term goal to improve the quality of care for ADRD patients and CMS's goal to increase engagement in ACP.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goals of this study are to: (1) develop a communication-based intervention, called KNow the Optimal Way (KNOW) for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) patients and care partners that includes theoretically grounded communication strategies (e.g., acknowledgment, validation of fears) and distress management techniques (e.g., deep breathing, muscle relaxation); (2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention; and (3) test the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on ADRD patients' and care partners' preparedness for and engagement in advance care planning (ACP), completion of advance directives, and understanding of disease trajectory (primary outcomes) as well as patient-care partner concordance on the person with dementia (PWD)'s healthcare values, perceived need for ACP, psychological distress, communication quality, and care partner burden (secondary outcomes)."
