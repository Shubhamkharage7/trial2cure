            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility/acceptability of the Diabetes Staging System (DSS) in Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) teams and its ability to increase sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like-1 peptide (GLP-1) use in Veteran patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Diabetes Staging System (DSS) is a novel type 2 diabetes (DM2) staging system patterned after Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) cancer staging that uses the number of macrovascular and microvascular complications and most recent A1C and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to determine DSS stage which reflects disease severity. The DSS stage is then linked to specific evidence-based clinical interventions that decrease morbidity and mortality. One of the most important clinical interventions of the DSS is recommending a SGLT2i/GLP-1 agonist in DM2 patients with CVD which helps address the inequity of low overall SGLT2i/GLP-1 use. The DSS has been adapted into a CPRS-DSS template available to all PACT providers within the Durham VA system which could address the racial differences in SGLT2i/GLP-1 agonist use. DSS offers a systematic approach to DM2 care (Stage DM2 -determine medical therapy based on DM2 stage) that has the potential to address inequities related to SGLT2i/GLP-1 overall use and racial differences in use. Primary Care Aligned Teams (PACT) are best positioned to use the DSS because they treat the vast majority of Veteran DM2 patients. This pilot proposal will seek to address inequities in SGLT2i/GLP-1 agonist use within in the VA by examining the feasibility and acceptability of the DSS among 12 different PACT teams within the Durham VA Medical System by measuring its ability to increase SGLT2i/GLP-1 agonist after 6 months of DSS implementation."
