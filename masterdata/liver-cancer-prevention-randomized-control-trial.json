We will randomize eligible HOPE Clinic patients to (i) a 6-month self-management intervention to help participants implement behavioral changes to manage their disease or (ii) a wait-list control group that will receive the intervention after their 6-month assessment.\n\nSecondary objective:\n\nEvaluate changes in behavioral risk factors for liver fibrosis or steatosis (body composition, physical activity, diet, medication adherence, alcohol use), metabolic syndrome, and patient activation and other behavioral determinants."
