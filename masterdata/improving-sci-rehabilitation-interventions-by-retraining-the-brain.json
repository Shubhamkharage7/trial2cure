            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase I/II Multi-site Clinical Trial. In this phase I/II randomized controlled study, 49(up to 54) cervical spinal patients with upper limb impairments will receive non-invasive brain stimulation tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) to the area in the brain controlling the weaker muscle of the weakest upper limb while receiving training for 15 sessions over several weeks up to 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be motor limb impairment, and secondary outcomes will be tests of functional ability, spinal excitability, and strength and dexterity. Safety and feasibility of pairing tDCS with rehabilitation will also be explored and include adverse effects, subject/investigator blinding, and attrition to 3 month follow-up."
