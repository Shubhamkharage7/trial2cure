Secondary purposes include comparison of total equivalent opioid dosage above baseline opioid use at end of treatment, quality of life metrics, swallowing function, feeding tube dependence, and protocol compliance in patients managed with best support care with or without prophylactic gabapentin. Rates of gabapentin-related side effects and discontinuation will also be investigated.",
