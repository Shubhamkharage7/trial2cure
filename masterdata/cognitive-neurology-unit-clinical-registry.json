            "detailedDescription": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with brain deposition of extracellular amyloid and intracellular tau. It causes progressive cognitive impairment, especially memory, and is invariably fatal. Currently, there is no effective treatment for AD. A new and promising method involves the use of anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibodies (anti-amyloid mAbs) to reduce amyloid accumulation in brain. There are currently two anti-amyloid mABs, aducanumab and lecanemab, approved by the FDA under FDA's \"accelerated approval\" pathway. However, so far there is only a single phase 3 study that unequivocally demonstrates clinical efficacy of anti-amyloid mAB therapy1. This study is designed to help determine the therapeutic benefit of anti-amyloid mABs therapy by treating AD patients in our clinic with anti-amyloid mABs and measuring cognitive impairment and functional outcomes over the course of the treatment period and beyond. This study has 4 specific aims.\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 1: TO CREATE A CNU ANTI-AMYLOID MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY REGISTRY\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 2: TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANTI-AMYLOID MABs SLOW COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 3: TO IDENTIFY ANY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SIDES EFFECTS AND PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 4: TO ESTABLISH THE TIME COURSE OF CLINICAL BENEFITS"
