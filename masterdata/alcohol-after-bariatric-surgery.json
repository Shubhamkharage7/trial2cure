            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to learn how the body processes ingested alcohol and how alcohol affects mood and blood sugar in both men and women after undergoing sleeve gastrectomy. The main question\\[s\\]it aims to answer are:\n\n* Are there differences in the way that ingested alcohol is handled in men versus women after sleeve gastrectomy?\n* What is the consequence of drinking alcohol on an empty stomach versus after a meal on blood sugar control after undergoing sleeve gastrectomy?\n\nParticipants will participate in two types of alcohol tests (alcohol given orally or administered intravenously) after not eating anything overnight or after having a meal.\n\nResearchers will compare men and women who underwent sleeve gastrectomy with men and women who had no surgery, are of similar age and body composition, and have similar alcohol intake patterns.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary goal of the proposed study is to determine sex-related differences in the impact of Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) on the pharmacokinetics (Aim 1), subjective effects (Aim 2), and glycemic effects (Aim 3) in the fasted versus prandial state when alcohol is ingested or given intravenously clamped (the gold standard to measure alcohol elimination rate and acute alcohol tolerance). We will use a cross-sectional study to compare participants who underwent SG surgery 1-5 years ago with matched non-operated controls (both sexes). This project will answer the questions of whether there are sex-related differences in the impact of SG on alcohol's pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects, whether drinking alcohol with a meal is effective post-SG, and clarify the site of alcohol first-pass metabolism in men. Findings from this study will contribute to evidence-based recommendations on the impact of SG on alcohol-related toxic effects and could help expand the knowledge base of sex-related differences in human alcohol pharmacokinetics."
