Data will be prospectively and retrospectively collected on about 10,000 patients undergoing hip preservation at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Patients who are candidates for surgical intervention of the hip are potential participants.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine whether hip arthroscopy reduces or improves post-operative outcome measures compared to pre-operative measures (including patient reported outcomes \\[PROs\\], revision surgery, conversion to total hip arthroplasty, and return to sport) in patients with FAI and labral tears.\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to be able to better gauge (by assessments of patient satisfaction and psychometric thresholds of success) the progress made by recent advancements in arthroscopic hip preservation procedures with longitudinal follow-up.\n\nThe focus of this clinical trial will be the data collected prospectively."
