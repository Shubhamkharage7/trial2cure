            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES This study aims to compare patient outcomes (patient reported outcomes, pain medication use, length of stay, major complications, and time to first bowel movement) between subjects that receive either 20 mg of PO prednisone or 1 mL of 4 mg/mL of IV dexamethasone sodium phosphate and a control group.\n\nOUTLINE Participants are patients who elect to participate in the study prior to scheduled thoracic and/or lumbar spine fusion surgery at Oregon Health and Science University. Participants undergo their scheduled spine fusion surgery. After surgery, participants are randomized into either the study drug group or the control (non-treatment) group. If randomized into the study drug group, participants will orally take a daily dose of 20 mg of prednisone (1 mL of 4 mg/mL dexamethasone sodium phosphate if unable to tolerate oral administration) on postoperative days one and two."
