Can the current HOBSCOTCH program be successfully translated for Spanish speaking people with epilepsy?\n2. Will people with epilepsy who speak Spanish experience improved quality of life similar to that found in people with epilepsy who received the HOBSCOTCH program in English?\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* attend nine, one-hour virtual (online and/or by telephone) HOBSCOTCH-SPANISH sessions with a one-on-one certified bilingual HOBSCOTCH coach\n* complete a brief clinical questionnaire about their diagnosis of epilepsy\n* complete two questionnaires before and after the HOBSCOTCH sessions about their quality of life and about memory and thinking processes\n* keep a short daily diary about their seizures, symptoms and use of the self-management strategies taught in the HOBSCOTCH program\n* complete a brief Satisfaction Survey and a 3 question survey about shared decision making after the entire HOBSCOTCH program"
