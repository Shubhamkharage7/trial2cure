Infants with torticollis will be concurrently enrolled in physical therapy treatment until the torticollis is resolved. A normal, unaffected population will be studied to compare typical growth to the growth of infants undergoing active treatment.",

At 4, 5, and 6 months of age, if the head shape has not resolved, they will be given the option to pursue treatment with a cranial remolding orthosis. All affected infants will undergo active treatment until the head shape is resolved or the infant is 12 months of age (whichever comes first).\n\nNormal infants will be evaluated at 2, 6, and 12 months of age and will not be enrolled in any active treatment.\n\nAll infants will return at 12 months of age for a final evaluation."

These will be used to calculate the asymmetry and proportion of the skull and track growth.\n\nMeasurements include 3-dimensional measurements: 1) An FDA-approved non-invasive, eye-safe laser scanner called the STARscanner will be used to track measurements throughout treatment.
