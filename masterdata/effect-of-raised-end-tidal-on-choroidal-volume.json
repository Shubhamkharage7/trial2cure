            "briefSummary": "This study is to investigate the relationship between arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and vitreous pressure on the choroidal volume by integrated intraoperative OCT imaging under eye exams under anesthesia.",
            "detailedDescription": "Children with normal eyes undergoing an exam under anesthesia or a non-intraocular eye procedure will have one eye examined after research consent is taken. Children have very elastic ocular tissues. When they are having an intraocular procedure positive vitreous pressure can cause the iris to prolapse out of the eye and this can cause intraoperative and postoperative complications. The causes of the positive vitreous pressure have been speculated to be due to an increase in choroidal volume. The Choroid is a layer of blood vessels sitting between the sclera and the retina. Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an imaging tool that allows an optical section of the retina, choroid and sclera to be examined. The subfoveal choroidal thickness has been shown to be a consistent area that can be measured with reliability that the anatomical site of measurement is consistent. By varying the end tidal CO2 the thickness of the choroid will be measured and at the same time the intraocular pressure taken using a pneumatonometer. The OCT is integrated into the operating microscope and is used to take a scan of the fovea. Three scans will be taken after 5minutes of the particular end tidal pCO2. In order to ensure the choroidal thickness is not being influenced by the axial length of the eye, the axial length will be measured using an ultrasound probe at the beginning of the measurements just once. In order to ensure that the position of the head and body is not influencing the choroidal thickness a spirit level will be used to ensure a flat operating bed at the beginning of the measurements."
