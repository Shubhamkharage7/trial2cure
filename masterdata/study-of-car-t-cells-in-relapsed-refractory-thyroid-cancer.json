            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AIC100 CAR T Cells and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of AIC100 in patients with relapsed/refractory poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer that are BRAF wild-type, including newly diagnosed, or BRAF mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer after failure of BRAF mutant specific therapy.\n\nUpon enrollment, patients will undergo apheresis for collection of autologous lymphocytes. The autologous T cells will be transfected and expanded in vitro to generate the AIC100 CAR T Cell product. After lymphodepleting chemotherapy, AIC100 CAR T Cells will be infused.\n\nThe study drug product, AIC100, consists of autologous CAR T cells targeting intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on thyroid cancer. In addition, AIC100 cells express the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2), which should enable imaging of AIC100 CAR T Cells."
