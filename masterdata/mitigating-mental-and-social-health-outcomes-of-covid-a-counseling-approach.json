            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to develop a comprehensive mental health counseling program purposed to address the social determinant of health impacts of the coronavirus disease of2019 (COVID-19). The main questions the investigators aim to answer are: 1) What are the mental and social determinant of health impacts of a COVID-19 diagnosis, and 2) What are the impacts of a counseling program implemented to address those impacts? Participants will participate in individual interviews, attend individual and group counseling, and be provided resources related to their social determinants of health needs.",
            "detailedDescription": "The social determinants of health (SDOH) are an important social justice issue affecting various quality of life outcomes (e.g., physical and mental health). COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the SDOH of underserved and minority communities, including those in Southern New Mexico (NM). However, there is a lack of research on specifically how COVID-19 has affected individuals' SDOH, inhibiting prevention and response from mental health professionals and their interprofessional collaborators. Counselor education researchers have also not yet conducted outcome-based studies in this area. This research will support the development of a comprehensive, SDOH-focused mental health counseling program aimed to assess for and address the SDOH impacts of COVID-19 for individuals in Southern NM. This research will include in-depth assessment of participants' SDOH needs pertinent to COVID-19. Counseling may cover topics directly related, but also adjacent, to the participant's COVID-19 diagnosis and its impact. Participants will be provided resources and referrals specific to those needs, and engage in individual and group mental health counseling services aimed to mitigate the adverse mental and social health outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, this research should provide understanding of (1) the SDOH impacts of COVID-19, (2)feasibility of a mental health counseling program purposed to address such needs, and (3) the mental health and SDOH-related impacts of such a counseling program."
