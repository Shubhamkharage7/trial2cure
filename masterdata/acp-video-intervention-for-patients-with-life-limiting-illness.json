The study investigators would like to assess whether a home-ACP video can improve patient-clinician communication about patients wishes for their medical care and lead to more patient-centered care.\n\nThis study is a randomized clinical trial of a Home-ACP intervention among 500 adult patients with serious illness receiving medical care at home with the Clover Health House Calls Program. Study participants will be assigned to one of two groups. In one group, participants will continue to receive usual care with their home-based care team. In the second group, participants will continue to receive their usual care with their home-based care team and also view an ACP video that helps them understand ACP and provides education about ACP and hospice care."
