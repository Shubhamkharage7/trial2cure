The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about exercise in veterans with new respiratory symptoms after deployment to Southwest Asia. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Do veterans with new respiratory symptoms after deployment have heart or lung abnormalities that contribute to difficulty exercising?\n2. Does high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improve fitness and symptoms?\n\nStudy participants will complete the following:\n\n1. Study Visits 1A and 1B: Exercise test (VO2max test), echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), blood tests, questionnaires\n2. Exercise program: 12 weeks of 3x/week supervised HIIT on upright stationary bicycle (\\~40 minutes each) and 3x/week home aerobic exercise (45 minutes each)\n3. Study Visits 2A and 2B: Exercise test (VO2max test), echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), blood tests, questionnaires"
