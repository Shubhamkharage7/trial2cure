            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nRare tumors of the genitourinary (GU) tract can appear in the kidney, bladder, ureters, and penis. Rare tumors are difficult to study because there are not enough people to conduct large trials for new treatments. Two drugs-sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and atezolizumab-are each approved to treat other cancers. Researchers want to find out if the two drugs used together can help people with GU.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test SG, either alone or combined with atezolizumab, in people with rare GU tumors.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 years and older with rare GU tumors. These may include small cell carcinoma of the bladder; squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder; primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder; renal medullary carcinoma; or squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood and urine tests. They will have tests of heart function. They will have imaging scans. They may need a biopsy: A small needle will be used to remove a sample of tissue from the tumor.\n\nBoth SG and atezolizumab are given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm.\n\nAll participants will receive SG on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day treatment cycle. Some participants will also receive atezolizumab on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nBlood and urine tests, imaging scans, and other exams will be repeated during study visits.\n\nTreatment may continue for up to 5 years.\n\nFollow-up visits will continue for 5 more years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Urothelial carcinoma (UC) represents the most common histology for tumors of the bladder and urinary tract.\n* A minority of patients have primary tumors of the bladder/urinary tract consisting of rare histological variants, including small cell carcinoma, primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder (urachal or non-urachal), or squamous cell carcinoma. Some tumors may contain elements of UC mixed with these variants or may be entirely composed of such variants.\n* Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common histology for cancers of the renal parenchyma. Renal medullary carcinoma is a rare histology of kidney cancer, which is associated with sickle cell trait and other hemoglobinopathies.\n* Rare tumors of the genitourinary (GU) tract often have more aggressive clinical course, but lack standard of care treatment regimens, since these patient populations are poorly represented or excluded from most clinical trials.\n* Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is an antibody-drug conjugate of an IgG 1 monoclonal antibody targeting trophoblastic cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) with a chemotherapeutic payload of SN-38. SN-38 is an active metabolite of irinotecan and acts as a topoisomerase I inhibitor.\n* SG has demonstrated clinical activity in solid tumors. In phase II clinical trials, SG has demonstrated efficacy in metastatic UC after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.\n* Atezolizumab is an anti- programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) ICI that is approved for advanced/metastatic UC in patients ineligible to receive platinum therapy.\n* There are currently no clinical trials for SG monotherapy or SG/atezolizumab combination in rare GU tumors.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To determine clinical efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan (SG), either alone or in combination with atezolizumab, as defined by objective response rate (ORR), in participants with rare metastatic non-prostate genitourinary tumors\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n* ECOG performance status \\<= 1\n* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic GU tumors of the following histologies: small cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder or urinary tract; or renal medullary carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.\n* Participants must have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease on cross-sectional imaging.\n* Participants may have received any prior programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 axis ICI treatment.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is an open label, non-randomized phase II trial with two arms.\n* All participants will receive SG.\n* Participants without prior treatment with any PD-1/PD-L1 axis ICI (checkpoint inhibitor na(SqrRoot) ve) will be eligible to receive concurrent atezolizumab.\n* SG will be administered intravenously (IV) at 10 mg/kg on D1 and D8 of 21-day cycles.\n* Atezolizumab will be administered IV at 1200mg on D1 of 21-day cycles.\n* Treatment will be given in 21-day cycles continuously for a maximum of 5 years, or until signs of progression or intolerable side effects.\n* The accrual ceiling will be set at 60 to allow for inevaluable participants and screen failure."

History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n* Anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the study.\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.\n* Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during SG or atezolizumab treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of SG or atezolizumab. Note: Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain a live virus and locally authorized/approved COVID-19 vaccines are permitted.\n* Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently) with the exception of participants with indwelling catheters (e.g., PleurX(R)) who are allowed.\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium \\> 1.5 mmol/L, calcium \\> 12 mg/dL or corrected serum calcium \\> ULN).\n* Significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class II or greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, unstable arrhythmia, or unstable angina) within 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* Prior treatment with immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies (for Arm 2 only).\n* Participants with prior malignancy within the previous 2 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or low risk Gleason 6 prostate cancer, among others.\n* Participants with severe uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements, evaluated by history, physical exam, and chemistry panel.",
