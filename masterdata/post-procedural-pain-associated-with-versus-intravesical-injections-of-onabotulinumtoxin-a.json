            "briefSummary": "Currently, in clinical practice there has been no standardization in the number of injections a single dose of intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin A is administered in. Given the increasing use of this treatment modality, the aim of this study is to compare outcomes for patients given a 100 unit dose of onabotulinumtoxin A split into 5 as compared to 20 injections for the treatment of overactive bladder or urgency urinary incontinence refractory to medical treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxin A for treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder and urgency urinary incontinence refractory to anticholinergic or \u03b2-agonist treatment was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013. Since then, multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the treatment. Currently, Allergan, Inc. and the FDA recommend the intravesical administration of onabotulinumtoxin A with dilution to 100 units/10 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, as 20 injections of 0.5 mL each. Currently, in clinical practice there has been no standardization in the number of intravesical injections, with a single dose of onabotulinumtoxin A being administered in as few as 1 injection to as many as 40 injections into the detrusor muscle. Given the increasing use of this treatment modality, the investigators aim to compare patient outcomes for patients given a 100 unit dose of onabotulinumtoxin A split into 5 as compared to the recommended 20 injections for the treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder or urgency urinary incontinence refractory to medical treatment."
