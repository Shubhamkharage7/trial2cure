All herbal or traditional Chinese medicines (e.g., St. John's Wort), within the 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of SM17, and continuing use if applicable, will be reviewed by the PI and the Medical Monitor. Written documentation of this review and acknowledgment is required for subject participation.\n19.

Is unwilling to avoid rigorous exercise for at least 48 hours prior to first dosing.\n27. Is unwilling to avoid caffeinated beverages for at least 4 hours prior to first dosing.\n28. Is receiving or has received any investigational drug (or is currently using an investigational device) within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit. The 30-day window (or 5 half-lives) will be derived from the date of the last blood collection or dosing, whichever is later, in the previous study to the screening visit of the current study.\n29. Is receiving or has received any biologics within 90 days or until the expected PD effect has returned to baseline (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit. The 90-day window will be derived from the date of the last blood collection or dosing, whichever is later, in the previous study to the screening visit of the current study.",
