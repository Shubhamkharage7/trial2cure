A physician will oversee the informed consent process, after which participants will be surveyed on demographics, medical/surgical history, physical examination, comorbidities, and any current symptoms. Informed consent will be done electronically (preferable) or on paper. Informed consent may be done in-person or remotely, depending on patient preference. Information related to HIV, hepatitis B and C, other infectious diseases, or substance use disorder will also be obtained if applicable. Site staff may collect vital signs, fingerpick testing, urine drug screens, blood draws, EKG, and pregnancy tests. Some testing may be recommended in a fasting condition. A doctor will review medical history and results of the above evaluations with the participant to determine study suitability via clinical interview. The doctor may reach out to the patient's current treating physicians, other providers, and pharmacies to determine eligibility for clinical trials. A follow-up phone call may be needed to discuss testing results and/or trial eligibility. If a participant is deemed eligible for future trials and if the participant remains interested, counseling on contraception requirements for trials will be discussed."
