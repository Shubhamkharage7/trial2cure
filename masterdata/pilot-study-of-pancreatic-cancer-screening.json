(BRCA), ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM), or PALB2 screened for pancreatic cancer. This study may lead to a greater understanding of cancer and potentially, improvements in cancer screening and treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the event rate of abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings in screened study participants.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the rates of high-grade pancreatic neoplasia precursors (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-high-grade dysplasia (HGD)) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-3 \\[PanIN-3\\]) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) among all study participants.\n\nII. To understand rates of procedures (biopsies and surgeries) among all study participants.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To create a biorepository of all participants through the collection of saliva, blood, and tissue, combined with imaging findings and robust clinical annotation of patient health behaviors in all study participants.\n\nII. To explore knowledge, attitudes, and anxiety related to pancreatic cancer screening at annual intervals in all study participants.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: GROUP I: Participants may opt to undergo MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or alternating MRI/MRCP and EUS annually for 10 years or complete questionnaires over 10 minutes and undergo blood, saliva and tissue sample collection.\n\nGROUP II: Participants may undergo MRI/MRCP or alternating MRI/MRCP and EUS annually for 10 years."
