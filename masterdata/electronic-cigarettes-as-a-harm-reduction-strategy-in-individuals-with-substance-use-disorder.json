            "briefSummary": "Patients in addiction treatment have exceptionally higher rate of cigarette smoking and very low quit rates compared to the general population. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of using e-cigarettes as a method for harm reduction and the effects of providing e-cigarettes (or placebo e-cigarettes) on smoking outcomes among patients in addiction treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Electronic nicotine delivery devices often referred to as e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that deliver vaporized nicotine when inhaled. Corresponding with the growth in media attention, marketing and promotion, awareness and use of e-cigarettes has increased dramatically. A large proportion of those using e-cigarettes use them to reduce the number of cigarettes they are smoking or to help them quit. Use of an e-cigarette by smokers unwilling or unable to stop smoking completely might be a good approach to reducing cigarette consumption as the e-cigarette imitates some behavioral aspects of cigarette smoking and contains nicotine. Moreover, the few existing studies on the effect of e-cigarettes on tobacco withdrawal and craving suggest promising potential to assist smokers in coping with smoking urges and decreasing cigarette use."
