The investigators hypothesis that patients who receive the SCPB will have a lower VAS rating on average than those who receive local infiltration following internal jugular venous cannulation. To test this, the investigators will be approaching eligible patients for inclusion in a research study. If the patients consent, the patients will be randomly assigned the standard of care treatment or the SCPB. The investigators will then ask the patients to rate pain following insertion of the central line. The investigators will also evaluate different aspects of the patient's hospital course to evaluate their outcomes."
