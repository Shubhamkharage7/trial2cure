Adolescents, parents, and clinicians will participate in the project to advance to following Research Aims: 1) Assess the comparative effectiveness of CAMS and SPI+ compared to usual care, 2) Evaluate the mechanism of change accounting for the therapeutic effects of the interventions 3) Identify moderators of treatment effects. Participants and their parents will receive study assessments at baseline, 2-week, 1-month, 2-month, 6-month, and 12-month timepoints. Study assessments will ask about participant demographics (sample characterization), suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, service utilization, self-assessed risk, treatment integrity, sleep, family cohesion, and social experiences. Youth participants and their legal guardian both consent to participate in the research procedures."
