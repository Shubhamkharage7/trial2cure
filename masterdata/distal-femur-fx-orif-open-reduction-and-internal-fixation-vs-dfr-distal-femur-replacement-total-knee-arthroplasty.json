Fixation of these fractures can be challenging due to altered anatomy for the TKA and the presence of the metallic femoral component and have a relatively high complication rate. As a result, some surgeons elect to treat these fractures with a distal femur replacement total knee arthroplasty (DFR). The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate periprosthetic femur fractures treated with ORIF or DFR and compare various outcomes measures (Get up and go times, KOOS Jr score)",

Fixation of these fractures can be challenging due to altered anatomy for the TKA and the presence of the metallic femoral component and have a relatively high complication rate. As a result, some surgeons elect to treat these fractures with a distal femur replacement total knee arthroplasty (DFR). Several small retrospective studies have compared outcomes with mixed results. To the authors' knowledge there are no prospective studies evaluating the outcomes after treatment of periprosthetic distal femur fractures.
