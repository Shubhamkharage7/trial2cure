            "briefSummary": "This study entitled Community-Centered Interventions for Improved Vaccine Uptake for COVID-19 (CIVIC): Getting to Yes, Michigan!, is designed to increase vaccine uptake among populations that experience COVID-19 related disparities. The investigators will focus on the four counties within Michigan where a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 is within African Americans and Latinx communities, i.e., Wayne, Genesee, Kent and Washtenaw Counties. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, CIVIC will leverage: its long term relationships with the communities involved, an established CBPR Steering Committee developed and the knowledge gained as a Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) grant recipient, the resources and networks of the University of Michigan CTSA (MICHR), and the expertise of our academic partners to identify and understand factors that contribute to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in African Americans and Latinx communities in Michigan. The investigators will develop and test interventions based on community-centered approaches to achieve a primary goal of increased vaccine uptake.\n\nThe investigators will achieve this goal with the following aims:\n\n1. Increase understanding of the barriers and drivers of vaccine uptake and hesitancy;\n2. Increase vaccine uptake and decrease vaccine hesitancy through the implementation and evaluation of a multi-component intervention; and maintain, enhance, and evaluate the effectiveness of the CIVIC partnership to equitably engage all partners.",
            "detailedDescription": "Like many states across the country, COVID-19 cases and deaths have impacted communities of color in Michigan at disproportionately higher rates than whites. A staggering reality is that while African Americans represent only 13.6% of Michigan's population, they represent 40% of the deaths from COVID-19.\n\n* Half of the cases and deaths in Michigan occurred in Wayne County.\n* Other Counties in the lower half of Michigan have similar disparities including Genesee, Washtenaw, and Kent.\n* In Genesee County, where African Americans represent 20.3% of the population, they represent 35% of COVID-19 cases and 45% of deaths.\n* In Washtenaw County, nearly half of the cases to date are located in two majority low-income zip codes in the city of Ypsilanti. African American residents, who make up 12% of the Washtenaw population, disproportionately constitute more than a quarter of the cases.\n* And in Kent County, while 10.8% of the population is Latinx, this ethnic group makes up 32.4% of COVID-19 cases.\n\nPreliminary data from the state reveal that these disparities will likely worsen due to significant hesitancy, fear, mistrust and misinformation regarding the COVID-19 vaccine if nothing is done to change current trends."

Messages that enhance autonomy and perceived competence and are consistent with a person's values and goals will be more effective in changing behavior than messages focusing on external rewards. To link vaccination to broader values and goals, participants will select 3-4 goals from approximately 20 values/goals. Individually tailored messages will link each of these values to vaccination. We will also tailor testimonials based on member values and communication style preference.",
