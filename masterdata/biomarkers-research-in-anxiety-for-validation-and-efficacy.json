The biomarkers are hypothesized to have adequate stability (ICC: \\> .5) in the absence of intervention.\n* To determine which baseline biomarker scores predict response to a manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for treating anxiety, Being Brave.\n* To determine which biomarkers are sensitive to treatment response."
