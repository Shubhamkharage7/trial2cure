The primary hypothesis is that a virtual quality improvement-based consult intervention will improve the rate of in-hospital evidence-based cardio-renal-metabolic medication use, particularly SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Approximately 200 patients meeting eligibility criteria will be included in the study. Patients will be assigned into study groups, as defined by randomization of their treating clinician team to receiving the virtual consult versus not."
