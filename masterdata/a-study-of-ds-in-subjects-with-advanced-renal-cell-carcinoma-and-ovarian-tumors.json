The main goals of this study will be to investigate the recommended dose of R-DXd that can be given safely to participants, assess the side effects of R-DXd, and evaluate the effectiveness of R-DXd.",
            "detailedDescription": "R-DXd is an antibody drug conjugate that specifically binds to CDH6 on the cell surface of target cells, which leads to the internalization of R-DXd into the cells. MAAA-1181a that is released from R-DXd in the target cells inhibits cell replication and induces cell apoptosis.\n\nThis study will evaluate R-DXd given as a single agent once every 21 days. The dose escalation phase will enroll participants with OVC and RCC, and is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of R-DXd and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Following the selection of the RDE, the dose expansion phase will be initiated to evaluate clinical activity of R-DXd."
