Data will be collected at enrollment, procedure, discharge, 1, 3, 6 and 12- months to assess the safety and effectiveness of the System. Testing for recurrence of atrial fibrillation will include a 12-lead ECG at 1, 3, 6 and 12-months post-ablation, weekly event recorder transmissions after the 3- month follow-up visit through the 12-month follow up, and a 24-h continuous Holter ECG recording at 6 and 12-months post ablation.
