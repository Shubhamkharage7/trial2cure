            "briefSummary": "The current research study will add continuous glucose monitoring devices to the evidence-based text messaging diabetes education program for patients with type 2 diabetes for 6 months. Results on the effectiveness of this intervention will be compared for non-insulin using patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "The current research study seeks to investigate the impact of incorporating Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) into the evidence-based text messaging diabetes education program, Dulce Digital, focusing on individuals with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) who are not on insulin therapy. This innovative approach stems from the rationale that real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can offer valuable insights into glycemic control, thereby enhancing diabetes self-management. In standard care, individuals with T2D, particularly those not on insulin, may not routinely have access to CGM devices. The CGM device, an integral part of recommended diabetes therapy, is FDA approved for use in all people with diabetes. However, reimbursement for CGM devices varies by health plans, and currently, Centers for Medicare \\& Medicaid Services (CMS) does not reimburse for their use in non-insulin-using diabetes, except in cases of repeated severe hypoglycemia. Despite this, the investigators hypothesize that there are both clinical and financial benefits to providing a CGM device during diabetes self-management education for individuals with non-insulin-using T2D. This study aims to determine if adding a CGM device for this patient category yields significant benefits, contributing to the understanding of the potential advantages and informing future diabetes care practices."
