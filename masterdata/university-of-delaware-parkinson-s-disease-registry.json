Participant recruitment is a significant challenge to the success of Parkinson's disease research and we need your help more than ever in moving the field forward and improving the lives of people who have Parkinson's disease. Recruitment of study participants can be facilitated by maintaining registries of people who agree to be contacted for future studies.\n\nThe purpose of the University of Delaware Participant Recruitment Registry for Parkinson's Disease Research is to create a registry that includes the contact information and basic health information pertaining the participant's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The registry will streamline recruitment and enrollment in a variety of research studies focusing on topics such as, but not limited to: brain changes in Parkinson's disease, balance and gait in Parkinson's disease, exercise and its effect on motor function.\n\nTo be in the registry individuals must have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and have an interest in participating in research studies.\n\nTo become a member of this registry, primary information including contact information and some general medical information are needed."
