            "briefSummary": "Military service members admitted to inpatient psychiatry for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) represent an at-risk group for continued SITBs and rehospitalizations in the post-discharge period. However, there is an absence of evidence-based interventions designed to be delivered on inpatient psychiatric units to reduce the risk of post-discharge SITBs. To address this gap, the investigator's research group developed Written Exposure Therapy for Suicide Prevention (WET-SP), a brief, scalable, suicide-specific psychotherapy based on the written disclosure paradigm. Written disclosure, in which an individual writes about a personally stressful experience and the related thoughts and feelings, yields improvements across physical and psychiatric domains. Pilot data suggest that written exposure also yields reductions in SITBs. Yet, no study has adapted the written exposure paradigm specifically to target the amelioration of distress associated with suicidal crises and examined whether implementing WET-SP reduces the risk of subsequent SITBs and suicide-related hospitalizations.\n\nThe primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of WET-SP, in reducing the incidence and severity of SITBs in active duty military service members following a psychiatric hospitalization due to suicidal ideation, suicide plans, or a suicide attempt. Secondary objectives are to evaluate a potential mechanism of change (i.e., decreases in thwarted belongingness \\[cf. social disconnectedness\\]) and moderator of outcomes (i.e., arc of narrative \\[cf. linguistical parameters of the written narratives generated during treatment\\]). Participants randomized to WET-SP + TAU will receive five sessions of WET-SP delivered by the study team during their psychiatric hospitalization plus treatment-as-usual (TAU). Participants randomized to TAU will receive daily contact and patient-centered care delivered by the acute psychiatric inpatient unit provider team (e.g., psychiatrists, therapists, case managers). TAU includes psychiatric assessment, initial stabilization, nurse case management, medication management, treatment of medical comorbidities, group and individual therapy, and discharge planning. Outcome assessments will be administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 10-, 20-, and 30-week follow-ups."
