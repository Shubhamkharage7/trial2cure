            "detailedDescription": "This is a 4-year R01 project to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an at-home transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) device to mitigate pain in persons receiving hemodialysis (HD) on account of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Pain is a highly common and morbid condition among persons with ESKD requiring HD. Because the current method of managing pain in this population typically involves the use of analgesic medications that confer substantial health risks, novel non-drug therapies are needed to reduce pain and lessen reliance on opioid and other drug therapies. The investigators will undertake a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of an at-home neuromodulatory device to mitigate pain and improve other salient outcomes (e.g., mood, quality of life) in a stratified sample of Hispanic or Latino(a), Black or African American, and non-Hispanic White ESKD patients requiring HD. However, no individuals will be excluded based on race/ethnicity"
