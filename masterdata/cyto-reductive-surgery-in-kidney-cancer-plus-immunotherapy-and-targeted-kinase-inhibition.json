            "detailedDescription": "People with metastatic kidney cancer are usually treated with medications to slow the growth of the cancer. In addition, people who still have the kidney where the cancer started may have the kidney removed during the course of treatment. This surgery is done in order to decrease the amount of tumor in the body. This surgery is referred to as a cytoreductive nephrectomy. In the current study, nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is being administered in combination with cabozantinib, a targeted therapy. The combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. In this study, treatment consists of cabozantinib and nivolumab plus a cytoreductive nephrectomy. Eligible subjects, who have not received prior therapy for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, are treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab for approximately 3 months prior to undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy. After nephrectomy, patients who are benefiting from treatment may resume cabozantinib and nivolumab. This study will help investigators to understand the immune effects of cabozantinib and nivoluamb in the kidney tumor and will provide information on the potential clinical benefit associated with cytoreductive nephrectomy in combination with cabozanitnib and nivolumab."
