            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the comparability of ianalumab exposure following the sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration of one injection of 300 mg/2 mL auto-injector (AI) versus two injections of 150 mg/1 mL pre-filled syringe (PFS), and to assess the safety and tolerability of ianalumab following the s.c. administration of both devices in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sj\u00f6gren's disease (SjD), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nA second optional cohort may be included with the objective of demonstrating the comparability of pharmacokinetics of ianalumab between 1 x 2 mL Pre-filled Syringe (PFS) and 2 x 1 mL PFS.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study consists of the following periods:\n\nScreening period (up to 4 weeks):\n\nFollowing the signing of the informed consent, patients will be assessed for eligibility during this period of up to 4 weeks.\n\nTreatment Period 1 + Treatment Period 2, (Week 0 to Week 24):\n\nAfter completion of the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized at the Baseline visit (Week 0) to one of the 2 treatment sequences (treatment switch at Week 12) in a ratio of 1:1 described below:\n\n* Cohort 1:\n\n  * Sequence 1: ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (2 x 1 mL PFS) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 1 and ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (1 x 2 mL AI) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 2\n  * Sequence 2: ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (1 x 2 mL AI) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 1 and ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (2 x 1 mL PFS) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 2\n* Cohort 2 (Optional):\n\n  * Sequence 1: ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (2 x 1 mL PFS) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 1 and ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (1 x 2 mL PFS) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 2\n  * Sequence 2: ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (1 x 2 mL PFS) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 1 and ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (2 x 1 mL PFS) monthly + SoC in Treatment Period 2 In addition, within each sequence, patients will be further randomized to one of the predetermined injection sites with equal allocation, resulting in a total randomization combination of four (2 sequences x 2 injection sites) for Cohort 1 and six (2 sequences x 3 injection sites) for Cohort 2, respectively.\n\nExtended Treatment period (Week 24 to Week 72): After completion of Week 24 assessment, all patients (who did not discontinue during treatment period) will have the option to enter the extended treatment period to receive ianalumab 300 mg s.c. (Cohort 1: 2 mL AI; Cohort 2: 2 mL PFS) monthly up to Week 68. The end of treatment (EOT) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last study treatment administration, i.e., at Week 72.\n\nMandatory Post-Treatment safety follow-up period (from Week 72 to Week 88): Participants who completed the last study treatment or prematurely discontinued from study treatment will enter the post-treatment safety follow-up period.\n\nConditional Post-Treatment safety follow-up period (from Week 88 to Week 176) Post-treatment follow-up will be performed until B-cell recovery or up to 2 years. B-cell recovery is defined when CD19+ B-cell counts return to \\>= 50 cells/\u03bcL or \\>= 80% of baseline value, whichever occurs earlier."
