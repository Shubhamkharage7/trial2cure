Identifying functional impairments is essential for clinicians to provide optimal care to older adults, and on a population level, understanding function can help anticipate service needs. Yet uptake of standardized measurement of functional status into patient care has been slow and inconsistent due to the burden posed by current tools. The purpose of the proposed QUERI Partnered Evaluation Initiative is to implement and evaluate a patient-centered, low-burden intervention to improve measurement of functional status in VA primary care settings nationally. The investigators hypothesize that implementing this intervention will increase identification and improve management of functional impairment among older Veterans while providing key data to inform VHA strategic planning related to long-term services and supports.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background: Maintaining functional status, or the ability to perform daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and preparing meals, is central to older adults' quality of life, health, and ability to remain independent. Identifying functional impairments - defined as having difficulty or needing help performing these activities - is essential for clinicians to provide optimal care to older adults, and on a population level, understanding function can help anticipate service needs. Yet uptake of standardized measurement of functional status into routine patient care has been slow and inconsistent due to the burden posed by current tools. The purpose of the proposed QUERI Partnered Evaluation Initiative is to implement and evaluate the Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT) Functional Status Screening Initiative (hereafter \"PACT Function Initiative\"), a patient-centered, low-burden intervention to improve measurement of functional status in VA primary care settings nationally.\n\nSignificance/Impact: Implementing routine measurement of functional status in primary care has the potential to improve identification and management of functional impairment for older Veterans. Improved management includes increasing access to services and supports, reducing potentially preventable acute care utilization, and allowing Veterans to live in the least restrictive setting for as long as possible. The proposed QUERI Partnered Evaluation Initiative is directly aligned with national VA strategic priorities including VA's Aging in Place and Aging and Frail Veterans initiatives (Objective 2.2) and developing Data as a Strategic Asset (Objective 4.2) to inform evidence-based decisions.\n\nInnovation: The PACT Function Initiative is novel because it addresses prior barriers to functional status measurement. It incorporates Veteran and caregiver preferences while minimizing burden for primary care teams and maximizing clinical effectiveness. Implementing this intervention will provide functional status data that is directly actionable for patient care while creating a repository of data to inform VA strategic planning.\n\nSpecific Aims: (1) Measure clinician- and organization-level reach, adoption, implementation, and sustainment of the PACT Function Initiative; (2) Compare the effectiveness of a standard versus enhanced implementation bundle to improve adoption; (3) Measure patient-level clinical effectiveness of the intervention; and (4) To inform future GEC initiatives, test the effectiveness of EHR-based frailty screening for identifying Veterans at risk for functional impairment. The investigators hypothesize that implementing the PACT Function Initiative will result in increased identification and improved management of functional impairment among older Veterans while providing key data to inform VHA strategic planning related to long-term services and supports.\n\nMethodology: In partnership with GEC and Primary Care, the investigators will implement and evaluate the PACT Function Initiative using a hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness cluster-randomized adaptive trial design with three phases: pre-implementation, implementation, and sustainment. The investigators will use the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to guide implementation and evaluation. During pre-implementation, the investigators will engage stakeholders and develop local adaptations to maximize intervention-setting fit. During implementation, the investigators will launch a standard bundle of implementation strategies (champions, system-level audit and feedback), identify sites with low uptake, and randomize those sites to receive continued standard vs. enhanced strategies (technical assistance, clinician-level audit and feedback).\n\nNext Steps/Implementation: Establishing routine, standardized measurement of functional status and frailty among older Veterans will provide data to inform the delivery of proactive interventions to prevent and delay the development of functional impairment and improve quality of life, health, and independence."
