            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a novel decision support tool called PRIME (Preference Reporting to Improve Management and Experience), which combines values-elicitation with tailored feedback to patients and providers, improves patient-reported values-concordance of initial treatment decisions compared to usual care.",
            "detailedDescription": "In the last decade, remarkable advances in drug development have led to the approval of 52 new therapies for patients with hematologic malignancies. These new approvals are increasingly enabling clinicians to personalize chemotherapy decisions to achieve what matters most to patients. Therefore, accurately assessing patient preferences is critical to personalizing treatment decisions, particularly among older adults, who face high treatment-related morbidity and/or shorter anticipated survival.\n\nPatient preferences have traditionally been inferred from face-to-face conversations. However, numerous studies, including several systematic reviews, have demonstrated that this process alone is inadequate to reliably capture patient preferences. To support standard shared decision making, multiple stakeholders strongly advocate the development of validated patient-reported measures that accurately capture patients' preferences. In recent guidance about the care of older adults with leukemia, the American Society of Hematology explicitly recommends the development of novel decision support tools to address this growing challenge in patient-centered care. Improved shared decision making has been associated with increased patient-reported quality of care and satisfaction, and a reduction in healthcare utilization.\n\nThis study will determine the effectiveness of a novel decision support tool called \"PRIME\" (Preference Reporting to Improve Management and Experience) to improve the values-concordance of initial treatment decisions. Using best-worst scaling, a validated values-elicitation method, PRIME provides a personalized report to providers and patients of their most important treatment priorities.\n\nIn this pragmatic trial, participants will be randomized to receive decision support with PRIME or usual care prior to their first visit with their oncologist. The primary outcome will be clinically significant improvement in values-concordance of the initial treatment decision (on CollaboRATE, a validated 12-point measure)."
