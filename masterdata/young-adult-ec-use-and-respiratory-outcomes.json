Public health officials and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can now regulate ECs. The proposed study uses naturalistic assessments called ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to understand how ECs use may impact the respiratory health of youth and young adult users compared to never-using peers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Using a prospective longitudinal design, 150 youth and young adults aged 18-25 years (100 exclusive-EC users; 50 never-users) will complete 5 sessions (baseline, 3-,6-, 9-, and 12-months). Sessions will include naturalistic measures such as measures of respiratory health, questionnaires, and nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) nasal samples. To assess acute changes in pulmonary functioning related to tobacco product use, participants will complete twice daily EMA and home-based spirometry for the 2 weeks following the Day 1 session and the 2 weeks prior to each follow-up zoom session. Never-users will participate in a brief 15-30-minute individual interview consisting of questions related to reasons for never-EC use and other protective factors that will be used to build future prevention messaging."
