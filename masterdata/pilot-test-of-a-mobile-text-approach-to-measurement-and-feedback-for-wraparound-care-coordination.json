            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this SBIR is to test a novel mobile and text-based measurement and feedback system tailored to WSM. Investigators will recruit 10 care teams (50 care team members total: 10 managers/administrators, 10 supervisors, and 30 care coordinators), 30 caregivers, and 15 youth/young adults (14+ yo) with SED currently enrolled in WSM. Caregivers of minor children aged 5-17 and caregivers of young adults 18-26 will be invited to participate. However, only parents with youth aged 14-17 will be invited to consider participation for their children, as well, and young adults age 18-26 will have the opportunity to participate without a caregiver If a caregiver has multiple children enrolled in Wraparound, we will select one child to invite to participate. Of those eligible, investigators will select 30 caregivers and up to 15 youth/young adults (14+) that have access to a mobile device. These participants will be informed of the project by members of their care team and asked to complete a consent to contact if they are interested in learning more about the research study. Interested families will be asked to review consent materials and sign up online. Caregivers and youth/young adults will participate in a 30-minute study orientation meeting and then interact independently with the system over a 4-week period. During this time, care team members will have access to the SMART-Wrap website, where they can view the survey feedback from their families. Care team members will be expected to interact with the system throughout the test period and may adjust care based on the feedback they receive. Within 5 days of the last text message, caregivers and youth/young adults will complete a brief survey evaluating the prototype in the following areas of usability, acceptability, and feasibility, as well as complete the 10-item System Usability Survey (SUS). Care team members will complete a similar survey that asks about these same areas, but also includes items about compatibility with existing wraparound treatment planning and implementation, interoperability with existing electronic record management systems, duplicative vs. complementary with existing systems, and added value over existing methods. Following completion of their evaluation, participants will be invited to take part in 45-minute interviews or virtual focus groups (separately for care team members, caregivers, and youth/young adults). Of the participants that agree, 10 care team members, 10 caregivers, and 10 youth/young adults will be selected to complete the virtual focus group."
