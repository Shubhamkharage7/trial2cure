The PPROM Registry aims to identify possible causes of PPROM, evaluate trends in expectant management, measure maternal and fetal care, and to review short term and long term outcomes of affected pregnancies and births.",
            "detailedDescription": "Detailed Description\n\nPreterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (pProm) is a factor in 40% of preterm births. The earlier in pregnancy pProm occurs, the greater the potential latency period. Threats to the pregnancy include placental abruption, umbilical cord prolapse, infection, and insufficient pulmonary development, and preterm delivery. Management of pProm may include immediate delivery, induction, or expectant management.\n\nIt is still unclear what is considered best practice for the course of treatment in pProm pregnancies and post- delivery care of pProm babies in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU), as well as the long term outcomes of pProm survivors. Unfortunately, there are few recent studies available for review and those that exist often do not reflect the current treatments or innovations that have taken place, especially in neonatal care. Many of the studies available focusing on pProm have very small sample sizes, as well as very short follow-up post-delivery, resulting in a wide range of reported outcomes, especially regarding the morbidity and mortality associated with pProm.\n\nThe pProm registry is the first of its kind and will provide a large cohort of data for study. The purpose of this registry is to better understand pregnancies and births impacted by pProm. This includes how pProm is managed in pregnancy and in how pProm neonates are cared for in the NICU; identifying trends in expectant management, and to detect short term and long term outcomes of those affected."
