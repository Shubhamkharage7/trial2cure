            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of standard of care chemotherapy with or with out stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to a limited amount of places in the body (oligometastatic). Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy may help improve tumor control, decrease risk of tumor spreading more, decrease side effects, and prolong survival.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Compare progression free survival (PFS) between stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) + standard chemotherapy versus (vs.) standard chemotherapy alone in patients with oligometastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Confirmed response rate. II. Overall survival. III. Adverse events. IV. Longitudinal assessment of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA).\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate fatigue, and other patient-reported outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients undergo SBRT once daily (QD) or every other day for 5 fractions, and receive chemotherapy per standard of care.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive chemotherapy per standard of care.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 14 days, and then every 8-12 weeks for 2 years."
