            "briefSummary": "The effects of exercise on prevention and improved control of chronic diseases, reduced mortality, and improved quality of life are well established. Exercise has been shown to prevent heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, depression, and certain types of cancers. In addition to prevention, physical activity is included in the standard or care for many chronic diseases and used in treatment. For example, the American Diabetes Association has identified positive health behaviors like physical activity as foundational in the treatment and management of disease and improving overall quality of life.\n\nThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Exercise is Medicine Program (EIM) is a physician referral program that aims to increase physical activity to prevent and reduce complications from chronic disease.\n\nThe integration of technology among a 65+ population of EIM participants provides a novel approach to improving individual's health. Thus, our study aims to provide EIM participants aged 65+ with smartwatches in the hopes of increasing their overall physical activity levels."

Over the course of the program, the EIM fitness specialist reviews Fitbit data and progress towards goals, sending push notifications for encouragement and reminders. A personal training session is conducted, followed by sixteen group sessions including up to eight participants. The final session includes updating goals, incorporating Fitbits, and providing an updated exercise prescription. Upon program completion, participants will attend monthly webinars and health coaching sessions at 6- and 12-months post-program.
