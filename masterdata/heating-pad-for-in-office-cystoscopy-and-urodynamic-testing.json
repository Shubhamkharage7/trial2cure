            "briefSummary": "Patient frequently report experiencing discomfort associated with cystoscopy or urodynamic studies (UDS), and a small percentage of patients refuse these important procedures due to discomfort or fear of discomfort. Heating pads are an inexpensive and low-risk way to reduce patient discomfort during these procedures, which to our knowledge has not been investigated in the United States.",
            "detailedDescription": "Invasive office procedures such as cystoscopy and urodynamic studies (UDS) are commonly performed for many urologic and Urogynecologic conditions including, but not limited to, incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urinary retention, hematuria, and other lower urinary tract symptoms. Cystoscopy involves the insertion of a rigid or flexible cystoscope through the urethra and into the bladder. Urodynamic studies involve the placement of urethral and rectal catheters. Both cystoscopy and UDS involve filling the bladder with fluid, and these procedures are essential to the diagnosis and management of many of the conditions listed above.\n\nWhile both procedures are office procedures that are generally well tolerated, some patients can experience significant discomfort, pain, or anxiety. Some nonpharmacologic therapies have been investigated to relieve anxiety, pain, and distress, such as music and aromatherapy. Heating treatments are also known to reduce muscle pain by increasing local blood flow and decreasing distress. The use of a heating pad has become an established complementary modality in some invasive procedures. A previous study from South Korea has shown benefit of heating pad use for anxiety, pain, and distress during cystoscopy and UDS; however to our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the effect of heating pad use on patients in the United States, who may have inherent demographical differences compared to patients from South Korea."
