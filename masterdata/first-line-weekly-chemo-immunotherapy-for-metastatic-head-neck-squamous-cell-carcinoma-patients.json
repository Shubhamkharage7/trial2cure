Prior treatments are allowed if they were administered with curative intent prior to incurable progression of disease. Prior treatments for other cancers are also allowed.\n* Untreated, symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression.\n* History of autoimmune pneumonitis requiring high-dose systemic steroids (equivalent prednisone \\>20 mg/day for \\>1 week).\n* History of greater than or equal to Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction to carboplatin or paclitaxel.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because paclitaxel and carboplatin are Class D agents with significant potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
