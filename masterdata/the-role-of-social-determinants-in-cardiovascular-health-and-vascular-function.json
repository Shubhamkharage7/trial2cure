We hypothesize that individuals of a lower social economic position are at greater risk of impairment in the large organ that is responsible for blood movement in the body and artery stiffness. Additional sims include identifying the influence of depression on vascular function and measure the interaction between depression and social determinants of health. We hypothesize that impairment will be greater in individuals with depression than in individuals without. Finally we will compare a comprehensive metabolic project against the social determinants of health and depression, hypothesizing that more severe social determinants of health and depression will increase the risk of cardiovascular disease."
