            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nChanges to the sense of taste or smell can change eating behavior. This may contribute to obesity. Researchers want to see how taste and smell perceptions that affect food choices may differ between people with obesity and without obesity.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo understand the role that senses of taste and smell play in food intake.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18-65 with obesity and without obesity\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have a neurological and sensory exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will be checked for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. They will complete questionnaires about their eating habits, alcohol use, and smoking history.\n\nParticipants will have 2 study visits.\n\nParticipants will give stool, urine, blood, hair, nasal, and saliva samples. These samples will be used for gene testing.\n\nParticipants will have their weight, height, and hip and waist circumference measured. They will have an imaging scan that measures body composition.\n\nParticipants will complete questionnaires about their health, eating habits, and food preferences.\n\nParticipants will have taste tests and smell tests. They will have sensory tests to assess their response to stimuli.\n\nParticipants will have a dietary assessment. They will complete a food diary and a diet history questionnaire.\n\nParticipants will get a meal to eat. Data will be collected about their experience.\n\nParticipants will complete a sleep diary and wear a watch to measure their activity....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study involves comparison of taste and smell measures between obese and non-obese individuals. Taste and smell perceptions will be assessed in terms of their influence in food intake and food choices. We hypothesize that obesity negatively affects taste and smell perception thus affecting eating behavior.\n\nObjectives:\n\nObesity is a major public health concern in America. An unhealthy diet is a recognized risk factor for the development of obesity. Public health efforts to modify eating behaviors have had limited success. Not only does an unhealthy diet contribute to obesity, but it can also lead to changes in gut microbiota that likely result in inflammation and changes in transcriptomic activity. Taste and smell perceptions, which can influence food choices and food consumption, may differ between obese and non-obese individuals. Currently, little is known about the underlying mechanisms causing variations in taste and smell systems in individuals with obesity, which limits the interventions currently available to address this critical issue. Findings from this study can be used to design more effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity, to identify targets and strategies for countermeasures to prevent or improve obesity and its comorbidities, and to suggest ways to enhance dietary interventions. Moreover, findings will foster new lines of investigation for reducing risk of diet related conditions and for developing novel behavioral and pharmacological avenues of treatment and prevention. The proposed research is aligned with the overall mission of the National Institutes of Health to promote health and disease prevention. The findings from this study will ultimately lead to the development of personalized interventions for individuals with obesity and concurrent taste and smell alterations. Lastly, approaches included in this proposal are innovative and highly applicable to other complex health phenomena in which biological variations in inflammation and taste and smell perception impact an individual s health.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: The primary dependent measures for this study are taste and olfaction measures.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Secondary measures include inflammatory markers, exosomes, microbiota, gene expression, DNA methylation, biological measures and personal factors."
