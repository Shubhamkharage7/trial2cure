            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to compare the effect of different ways to place the component that goes at the top of the humerus (upper arm) in reverse total shoulder replacement. Some surgeons place the humeral tray component sitting on the bone while others place it in the bone. Changing the way that the humeral component is placed may change how much the arm can raise up or turn out/in after surgery for some patients. This study compares patients with inlay humeral component (tray sits in the upper arm bone) versus onlay humeral component (tray sits on top of the upper arm bone) to see if there are differences in range of motion or function after surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to determine if active external rotation two years postoperatively varies based on whether an inlay or onlay humeral component is used in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). The study also aims to determine whether active forward elevation, abduction, scapular notching, and functional outcomes two years postoperatively vary based on whether an inlay or onlay humeral component is used in reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Patients undergoing primary RTSA by Dr. J. Michael Wiater, Dr. Brett Wiater, or Dr. Alexander Martusiewicz at Beaumont Health will be screened for eligibility. Following informed consent, participants will be randomised (1:1) to one of the following groups: 1) RTSA with inlay humeral component (Tornier Perform Stem Reverse+) or 2) RTSA with onlay humeral component (Tornier Ascend Flex stem). At baseline, participants will complete study questionnaires, receive a range-of-motion (ROM) exam, and standard of care x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans. These evaluations will be repeated at 3 months, 12 months and 24 months."
