            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to compare whether soft tissue augmentation placed in the donor site following a gum graft harvesting leads to volumetric changes compared to non-augmented sites in the palate. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Are there tissue thickness changes between the two groups (control group and augmentation group)?\n* Are there volumetric changes in the donor site (palate) between the two groups in the short and long term? Participants will receive a gum graft and then based on what group they were randomly assigned, they will receive either a collagen matrix where the gum graft was taken (on the palate) or nothing will be placed.\n\nResearchers will compare non-augmented sites with augmented sites to see if there is a change in tissue thickness and volume.",
            "detailedDescription": "The randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the potential effect of post-harvesting donor site augmentation on palatal volumetric changes following connective tissue graft harvesting.\n\nThe study investigation is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to have 20 participants in each group. The palatal thickness will be clinically assessed and a digital intraoral scan of the palate will be performed pre-operatively. A subepithelial connect tissue graft will then be harvested from the palate. Patients will then be randomly assigned to receive/not receive augmentation of the donor site, using a collagen sponge. Palatal thickness measurements and intraoral scans will be repeated at 2-, 4-, and 6-months postoperatively."
