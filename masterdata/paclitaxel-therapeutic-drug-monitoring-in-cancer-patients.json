            "briefSummary": "The goals of this prospective, observational cohort study are to determine the feasibility of implementing paclitaxel therapeutic drug monitoring for cancer patients and explore the relationship between paclitaxel drug exposure and the development of neuropathic symptoms.\n\nThis trial studies if paclitaxel can be consistently measured in the blood of patients with solid tumors undergoing paclitaxel treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Nerve damage is one of the most common and severe side effects of paclitaxel. The ability to consistently measure paclitaxel in the blood may allow doctors to control the dose of paclitaxel, so that enough chemotherapy is given to kill the cancer, but the side effect of nerve damage is reduced.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective:\n\n\u2022 Determine the feasibility of monitoring paclitaxel serum drug levels in patients with a solid tumor (e.g. lung, breast, and gynecologic cancers) for which Paclitaxel is the standard of care.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* Compare Paclitaxel serum drug levels among patients with differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.\n* Compare mitochondrial function within circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells among patients with differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.\n* Compare the ability of pulsed electromagnetic field to modulate immune cells of individuals experiencing differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment."
