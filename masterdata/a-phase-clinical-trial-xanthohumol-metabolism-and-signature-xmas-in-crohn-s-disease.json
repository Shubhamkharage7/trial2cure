            "detailedDescription": "This is a double-masked, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial of xanthohumol, which is a constituent of hops (Humulus lupulus). Hops and its constituents have a long history of use for a variety of conditions. However, knowledge is limited regarding the measurable biological markers of human exposure, and the role of xanthohumol metabolism by microorganisms present in the gut, particularly in individuals with gut pathologies such as Crohn's Disease. This information is necessary for the development of xanthohumol as a potential therapeutic intervention in such conditions."

Microbiome metadata will be deposited into database of Genotypes and Phenotypes.\n\nMetagenomic nucleic acid sequence data will additionally be deposited in Metagenomic Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) at Argonne National Laboratory, along with associated metadata.\n\nMicrobiome summary files (e.g., tables cataloging: sample metadata, taxon or protein family abundances across samples) publicly available through github.",
