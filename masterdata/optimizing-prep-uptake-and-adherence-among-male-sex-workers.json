It is anticipated that most of the papers and data-based projects/presentations will happen in year 3, when all of the baseline data is collected, and the 3 month outcome has occurred for all participants. Sharing of the findings will involve a primary paper describing the study outcome and a paper that describes the intervention, as well as submitting to lead workshops on the intervention approach at relevant national meetings and conferences. Raw data for additional analysis will be available to outside individuals through contacting the MPIs. Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the MPIs' web pages. Contact information for the MPIs will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.",
