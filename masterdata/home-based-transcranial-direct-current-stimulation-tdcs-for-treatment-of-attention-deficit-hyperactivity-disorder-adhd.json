Further, the investigators are investigating whether there is a dose-dependent response to tDCS.",
            "detailedDescription": "This mechanistic clinical trial will be the first of its kind to assess the clinical and cognitive efficacy of tDCS, and its relationship to physiological target engagement. It will also provide critical knowledge about tDCS dosing in a therapeutic context (i.e. 30 days of daily tDCS). Last, it will assess the feasibility and acceptability of home-based neuromodulation therapies for ADHD, reducing the most significant obstacle for the implementation of devices therapies (i.e. daily visits to the hospital for several weeks) and facilitating access to advanced therapeutics to a large population of patients with ADHD. An additional goal of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of home-based neuromodulation therapies for ADHD, reducing the most significant obstacle for the implementation of devices therapies (i.e. daily visits to the hospital for several weeks) and facilitating access to advanced therapeutics to a large population of patients with ADHD."
