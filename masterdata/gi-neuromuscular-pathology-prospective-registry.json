Biopsy samples of those who do not have gastroparesis but are undergoing surgery on the digestive system will be collected after the patients consent to be on the trial. These patients will serve as our control group population. Detailed medical history will be collected and the study group patients will be asked to complete two questionnaire to assess the severity of the symptoms. They will be followed in the clinic at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post implantation."
