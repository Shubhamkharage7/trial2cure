            "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of treatment involving a single infusion of donor-derived regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg) in first time, living donor renal transplant recipients.\n\nDCreg will be prepared from monocytes obtained by leukapheresis from prospective (non-mobilized) living kidney donors and infused into the respective recipients 7 days before renal transplantation. This study will enroll 28 subjects (14 recipients, 14 donors). The duration of follow-up will be:\n\n* 1 week following the leukapheresis procedure for donors and\n* 2 years following their DCreg infusion for kidney recipients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This clinical trial is a single-center, open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1 study, enrolling N=14 de novo kidney transplant recipients and their respective living donors. The study objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a single infusion of donor-derived regulatory dendritic cell (DCreg) treatment.\n\nTransplant recipients will receive combination immunosuppressive agents according to the site's Standard of Care (SOC) regimen, with two exceptions:\n\n* mycophenolic acid (MPA) will be initiated 7 days before transplant, at the time of donor DCreg infusion, instead of on the day of transplant; and\n* the pre-transplant dose of MPA will be half the standard post-transplant dose, due to increased drug bioavailability in recipients with low kidney function defined by glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n\nConsequently, participants will be maintained on triple immunosuppressive therapy with MPA, tacrolimus, and prednisone after transplant, a combination regimen widely applied as SOC at many transplant centers in North America and worldwide.\n\nNote: Participants will not be withdrawn from known effective therapy for the purpose of participating in this research."
