The study will define a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MVT-5873 as monotherapy (Group A), in combination with a standard of care chemotherapy (Group B), for a Q2 week schedule (Group D), an MTD of MVT-5873 for a Q4 week schedule (Group C), and an MTD for a Q2 week schedule of MVT-5873 in combination with mFOLFIRINOX (Groups E and F). Each group will utilize a conventional 3+3 study design to identify the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).\n\nFollowing the definition of an MTD in each group, the RP2D of MVT-5873 as a single agent and in combination with mFOLFIRINOX will be defined. Following the completion of the dose escalation phase for each group, an expansion group of up to 30 additional subjects will be treated at the RP2D for the respective group. In Group D, subjects will be subdivided into two groups of up to 15 subjects: subjects without peripheral blood expression of CA19-9 and subjects with peripheral blood expression of CA19-9. MVT-5873 pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) will be determined in each group.\n\nGroup A, B, and C are no longer open for enrollment."
