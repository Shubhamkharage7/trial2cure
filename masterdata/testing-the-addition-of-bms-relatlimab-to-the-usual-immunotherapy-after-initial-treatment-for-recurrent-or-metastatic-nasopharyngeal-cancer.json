            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests the addition of BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to the usual immunotherapy after initial treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Relatlimab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The usual approach of treatment is initial treatment with chemotherapy such as the combination of cisplatin (or carboplatin) and gemcitabine, along with immunotherapy such as nivolumab. After the initial treatment is finished, patients may continue to receive additional immunotherapy. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. Giving BMS-986016 in addition to the usual immunotherapy after initial treatment may extend the time without the tumor cells growing or spreading longer than the usual approach in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if adding BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to nivolumab maintenance therapy shows a signal of improved progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in patients who do not progress following treatment with platinum-gemcitabine-nivolumab combination in the first-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (R/M NPC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if adding BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to nivolumab maintenance improves overall survival (OS) compared to nivolumab maintenance alone.\n\nII. To compare patterns of failure (local-regional relapse and distant metastasis) between treatment arms.\n\nIII. To determine if adding BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to nivolumab maintenance improves objective response, duration of response, and disease control rate compared to nivolumab maintenance alone.\n\nIV. To evaluate the tolerability of nivolumab-BMS-986016 (relatlimab) maintenance and assess and compare toxicity between arms based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) criteria.\n\nV. To evaluate baseline plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA (\\< 2000 copies/mL versus \\[vs.\\] \\>= 2000 copies/mL) as a prognostic biomarker.\n\nVI. To validate post-induction plasma EBV DNA (detectable \\[\\>= 1 copies/mL\\] vs. undetectable \\[0 copies/mL\\]) as a prognostic biomarker.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To collect blood and tissue specimens for future translational science studies.\n\nII. To assess post-induction plasma EBV DNA (detectable \\[\\>= 1 copies/mL\\] vs. undetectable \\[0 copies/mL\\]) as a predictive biomarker.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle, cisplatin IV or carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients who do not progress radiologically are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo CT or MRI on study. Patients also undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or bone scan as clinically indicated.\n\nARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and relatlimab IV over 30-90 minutes. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo CT or MRI on study. Patients also undergo PET/CT or bone scan as clinically indicated.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months in years 3-5, and then annually."

Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist \\[registered trademark\\]) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that are approved by the local drug regulatory authority of the participating region are allowed.\n* No known history of grade 3-4 allergic reaction or hypersensitivity reaction to cisplatin, carboplatin, or gemcitabine.\n* No known history of grade 4 hypersensitivity (or infusion) reaction to any monoclonal antibody. Patients who had prior grade 3 hypersensitivity (or infusion) reaction but could tolerate resumption of the antibody treatment after appropriate pre-medication are eligible.\n* PRIOR TO STEP 2 REGISTRATION:\n* Collection of plasma EBV DNA at baseline is mandatory for all patients prior to Step 2 registration and induction treatment.\n\n  * Note: Submission of the baseline sample will be batch shipped.\n* PRIOR TO STEP 3 REGISTRATION/RANDOMIZATION: PATIENTS WITHOUT PROGRESSIVE DISEASE (PD) ONLY:\n* All patients must have received minimum of 3 cycles, and up to a maximum of 6 cycles of induction treatment within 20 weeks from cycle 1, day 1 of induction treatment (i.e., patients must have completed all induction treatment within 20 weeks from cycle 1 day 1, including the treatment breaks). Patients must have completed 6 cycles of induction treatment, except in the following circumstances:\n\n  * Significant dose delays as a result of treatment-related toxicities.\n  * Intercurrent illness(s), that rendered the patient unable to continue induction treatment.\n  * Note: If a patient received \\< 6 cycles of induction treatment for reasons other than the above circumstances, they will not be eligible for randomization.\n* A CT scan within 30 days prior to Step 3 registration/randomization is required. If the most recent scan performed is not within this time frame, a repeat scan is required to assess response.\n* Did not meet any criteria that result in permanent discontinuation of study treatment during induction treatment phase.\n* Must meet the criteria for starting/resuming a new cycle of maintenance treatment.\n* Did not experience any nivolumab-related autoimmune toxicities that would result in permanent discontinuation of nivolumab during the induction treatment phase.\n* Collection of the plasma EBV DNA post-induction treatment is mandatory.\n\n  * Note: Submission of the post-induction sample will be batch shipped.",
