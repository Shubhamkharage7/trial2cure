            "briefSummary": "The objectives of the RECONFIG clinical study are to :\n\n1. To identify the time to the first diagnosis of cognitive motor dissociation (CMD) in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients and to investigate whether these patients will clinically follow commands earlier after the hemorrhage.\n2. To determine whether CMD independently predicts long term functional outcomes (6-month mRS scores) in ICH patients, and is associated with long term cognitive and quality of life outcomes.\n3. To determine the EEG response to verbal commands of the motor imagery paradigm between patients with and without sensory aphasia.\n\nThe overall goal is to determine predictors and the trajectory of neurological recovery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Unconsciousness is common after an acute brain injury such as a brain hemorrhage, and recovery is poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is a key impediment to the development of novel strategies to improve outcomes and is one of the main reasons that prognostication of recovery of consciousness and functional outcomes is inaccurate. One-fifth of clinically unconscious patients with acute brain injury are able to follow commands using a simple, bedside EEG motor imagery test that directly measures brain activity associated with the attempt to move. This state is called cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). Pilot data indicate that CMD patients are more likely to clinically recover consciousness and have better longterm functional outcomes than non-CMD patients. To integrate these findings into clinical practice, there is a need to better understand the trajectory of CMD. This will only be possible in a tightly-controlled study with a homogenous patient cohort that is well characterized early after the injury and captures long-term outcomes.\n\nRECONFIG is a multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional observational study in patients who have a clinical diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage and that are unresponsive at the time of enrollment. One hundred and fifty subjects will be recruited over 4 years at 2 sites. Subjects will be assessed with behavioral measures and MRI during the acute hospitalization. Patients will be followed for 6 months to determine the functional outcome (primary outcome measure). Additionally, the investigator will study conscious intracerebral hemorrhage patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and aphasia to determine the impact of aphasia."
