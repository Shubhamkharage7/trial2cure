Data consisting of lifestyle factors, medications, physical activity, years before conventional cancer diagnosis is also worthwhile for to determine early detection. This is only achievable with longitudinal tracking of a large number of healthy individuals and identifying those who do develop cancer over time.",

All adults 18 years of age and older undergoing upper or lower endoscopy for routine medical care will be eligible for this study."
