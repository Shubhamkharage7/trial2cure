            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of injecting certain cells produced in bone marrow called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) into salivary glands. The main question it aims to answer is whether injection of MSCs into salivary glands results in any improvement in dry mouth.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* have bone marrow collected using a needle\n* undergo a salivary gland ultrasound\n* complete questionnaires\n* receive an injection of the bone marrow cells into a salivary gland",
            "detailedDescription": "This single-center phase I dose-escalation with expansion cohort, open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study will assess the safety and tolerability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for treatment of xerostomia, focusing on xerostomia with inflammatory etiology (e.g., Sj\u00f6gren's disease \\[SjD\\], graft-versus-host disease \\[GVHD\\]). An initial cohort of subjects (n=6) will receive a unilateral injection of MSCs at dose level 0. If unilateral treatment is tolerated, a dose escalation cohort (n=8-18) will receive bilateral injection of MSCs. Dose escalation will proceed using a standard 3+3 design and once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is defined, 12 additional patients will be accrued to the expansion phase.\n\nFollowing the completion of screening/baseline procedures, eligible participants will undergo bone marrow aspiration in order to obtain MSCs.\n\nThe MSC investigational product will be injected into one or both submandibular glands under local anesthesia at the interventional visit."
