Both interventions involve 8 weekly sessions and an online platform with additional content and learning. Participants can stay on all their medications during this study. Information from this study may help determine how to better treat migraine.",

Participants from across the United States with migraine may be eligible to participate. This study does not require any in-person visits. All assessments and surveys will be completed virtually and/or online. Participants will independently complete an initial online screen. Participants will attend a scheduled phone or videoconferencing call with a study team member to complete the baseline assessment and learn how to use the online platform. Participants will keep an online daily headache log and complete several online surveys throughout the study."
