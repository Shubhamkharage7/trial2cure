            "briefSummary": "In this study, a chest muscle sample (biopsy) will be taken and the muscle fibers will be removed from the sample and made into smaller strands or fragments. During this same procedure, those muscle fiber fragments (MFFs) will then be injected directly into the supraspinatus muscle. Once injected, the MFFs will remain in the supraspinatus where Investigators believe the MFF will become part of the participants' existing muscle and provide increased muscle size and strength, improving function (rotator cuff strength and stability).",
            "detailedDescription": "Muscle fiber fragment (MFF) therapy has shown pre-clinical and clinical promise in the treatment of bladder neck insufficiency/incompetent outlet. Fragmentation of muscle fibers derived from autologous muscle tissue can be injected through a needle into the sphincter region. The injected muscle fibers are able to assemble into long muscle fibers in the direction of host muscle fibers. More importantly, muscle progenitor cells residing on the fragmented muscle fibers survive and integrate into host vasculature and nerve to restore damaged muscle function. Preclinical results indicate that this technology can be used to repair and restore damaged sphincter function in urinary incontinence. The development of an autologous, readily available muscle fiber fragment treatment that may involve less risk and recovery time than those associated with the standard surgical therapies and urethral bulking agents, could alter the treatment paradigm of urinary incontinence. The study team hypothesizes that injected MFFs will incorporate into skeletal muscle and re-assemble along the fiber direction. The Investigators anticipate that the MFFs can safely be injected into the atrophied rotator cuff muscle and will help restore the functional contractile properties of the supraspinatus muscle following rotator cuff repair."
