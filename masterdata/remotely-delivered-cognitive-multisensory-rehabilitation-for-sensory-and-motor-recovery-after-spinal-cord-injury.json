By introducing remote cognitive multisensory rehabilitation (CMR), which has shown significant functional improvements due to neurological recovery when delivered in-person, transformative results that (i) provide a potentially effective new therapy within the healthcare system, accessible to more patients, and (ii) demonstrate brain function changes alongside improved function in chronic SCI are anticipated. The results will inform and justify a large scale federally funded clinical trial."
