Acceptable forms of birth control include abstinence, birth control pills, or any double combination of: intrauterine device (IUD), male or female condom, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap. Nonchildbearing potential for women is defined as postmenopausal (last natural menses greater than 12 months) or undergone a documented bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy. If last natural menses less than 12 months, a serum FSH value confirming post-menopausal status can be employed.\n  * Patient agrees to sleep on back until study tissue products are healed\n  * Patient agrees to abstain from aspirin, alcohol, or excessive caffeine until study tissue products are healed\n  * Patient agrees to not undergo NAC tattooing until completing study\n  * Patient can understand and willing to sign informed consent\n  * Patient desires bilateral nipple reconstruction with DCLNAC\n  * Subjects must be capable of providing written informed consent to the study procedures and for use of protected health information \\[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), if applicable\\]\n\n    * Specific Criteria\n\nGroup A:\n\n* Patient had a bilateral mastectomy with no radiation therapy\n* Patient has undergone a bilateral autologous breast reconstruction a minimum of 3 months prior to enrolling in the study\n\nGroup B:\n\n* Patient had a unilateral mastectomy with no radiation therapy\n* Patient has undergone a unilateral autologous breast reconstruction a minimum of 3 months prior to enrolling in the study\n\nGroup C:\n\n* Patient had a bilateral mastectomy and received radiation unilaterally\n* Patient has undergone a bilateral autologous breast reconstruction a minimum of 3 months prior to enrolling in the study\n\nGroup D:\n\n- Patient had unilateral or bilateral mastopexy (with or without augmentation) or reduction mammaplasty and suffered nipple complications (i.e., necrosis, projection loss)\n\nGroup E:\n\n* Patient had unilateral or bilateral mastectomy\n* Patient had unilateral or bilateral autologous breast reconstruction a minimum of 3 months prior to enrolling in the study\n* Patient did not receive radiation to the autologously reconstructed breast\n* Patient had unilateral or bilateral nipple reconstruction that failed (i.e., necrosis, projection loss)\n\nGroup F:\n\n- Implant based reconstruction\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient has a history of delayed wound healing\n* Patient has a history of Vitamin C deficiency\n* BMI\\<18.5 or \\>40 kg/m2\n* Patient has a history of allergic reaction to any decellularized biologic matrix product\n* Patient is currently smoking or using tobacco or nicotine products (i.e., patch, gum, vaping or nasal spray) or has used such products in the past 6 months\n* Patient is currently receiving bilateral breast radiation or completed less than 3 months prior to screening\n* Patient has any systemic disease that would impede wound healing, such as diabetes or connective tissue disorders\n* Patient is pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period\n* Patient has any type of disease or disorder that in the investigator's opinion would make the patient unfit for the study, including active infection anywhere in the body.\n* Acute mastitis in either breast\n* History of an autoimmune disorder\n* Use of any medications currently or in the past 3 months that would impair wound healing, such as long-term use of systemic steroids (inhaled, limited topical, short-term oral use and intra-articular steroids are acceptable)",
