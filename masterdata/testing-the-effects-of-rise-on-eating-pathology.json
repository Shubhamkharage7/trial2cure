            "briefSummary": "Interoception is the process of perceiving one's bodily sensations. Interoception is critical for survival and maintaining homeostasis, as it motivates sensation- and need-specific autonomic reflexes and adaptive behaviors (e.g., eating when hungry, terminating eating upon fullness, drinking when thirsty). Not all individuals have accurate interoceptive abilities. Individuals with eating disorders often have low perception of gastrointestinal, pain, and emotion sensations. Interoceptive dysfunction is believed to influence the development and maintenance of many forms of psychopathology. Identifying effective ways to restore accurate interoceptive processing is an important aim for clinical researchers. The goal of the present study is to continue to test the effectiveness of a training for interoceptive dysfunction that aims to reconnect individuals with eating disorders with their internal sensations, which is called, Reconnecting to Internal Sensations.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are individual differences in how well people are able to recognize interoceptive sensations. Research supports a role for impaired interoception in the etiology of eating disorders (EDs), with the idea being that individuals who are out of touch with hunger and/or satiety are more vulnerable to restrictive and binge eating behaviors, respectively. Researchers have connected interoceptive impairment to self-injurious behaviors more broadly, including both direct (i.e., non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts) and indirect (i.e., ED behaviors) forms. The investigators have found support for the supposition that impaired interoception-or bodily disconnect-allows people to inflict pain (whether that be through ED behaviors or self-injury) upon themselves, as it is much easier to harm something one is unattached to versus something one cares for. Thus, improving interoception (e.g., helping people connect better with their bodies) may improve ED outcomes. This project seeks to test an accessible, online intervention designed to improve interoception and thereby reduce ED symptoms."
