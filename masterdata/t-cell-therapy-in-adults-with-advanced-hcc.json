The trial is suitable for adult subjects (\u2265 18 years of age) diagnosed with GPC3-positive HCC, who have failed or not tolerated at least two (2) different anti-HCC systemic agents.\n\nPhase I has concluded and a Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) has been determined. We are now conducting Phase II to further confirm the safety profile of ECT204 and evaluate its efficacy.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, dose escalation, multi-center, Phase I/II clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational ARTEMIS\u00ae ECT204 T-cell therapy in adult patients with GPC3-positive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, a patient's T cells are collected and genetically modified to express Eureka's proprietary anti-GPC3 ARTEMIS T cell receptors (AbTCR). These modified T cells are then reintroduced into the patient to specifically seek out and destroy GPC3-expressing cancer cells.\n\nPhase 1 (Dose Escalation Phase): Completed; RP2D of ECT204 was determined.\n\nPhase 2 (Expansion Phase): The expansion phase includes 2 study arms.\n\nArm A: Subjects will receive ECT204 as monotherapy\n\nArm B: Subjects will receive pre-treatment with regorafenib (STIVARGA\u00ae) before ECT204 administration.\n\nThe active assessment period of the study will continue for 2 years. Subjects will be followed for assessment of treatment safety and overall survival during Long Term Follow-Up (LTFU; year 2 -15)."
