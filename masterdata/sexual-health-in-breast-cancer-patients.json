The objectives are as follows:\n\n1. To characterize the sexual well-being of women longitudinally throughout the continuum of care, from initial diagnosis into survivorship.\n\n   We predict that treatment will adversely affect sexual well-being, and that patient factors, clinical factors, and treatment choices will influence changes in sexual well-being.\n2. To identify gaps is sexual health education provided at the time of diagnosis or during treatment and to determine the appropriate timing of sexual health education delivery."
