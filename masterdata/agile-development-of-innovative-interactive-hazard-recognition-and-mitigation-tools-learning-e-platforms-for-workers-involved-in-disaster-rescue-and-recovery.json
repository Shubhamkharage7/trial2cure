            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to assess Pocket Ark (PA), which is a mobile e-learning and assessment platform for use by flood remediation workers in the field. The purpose of the mobile application is to provide workers with real-time data to assist with making safe decisions during the planning phase in the flooded zone and provide a communications platform to improve logistics between operational bases and workers during and after the deployment to the flooded zone. Pocket Ark incorporates an action planner, scenario-based PPE training content, assessments (both knowledge and health-risk), personal security protection, and resource location features for workers involved in disaster rescue and recovery. Individual construction worker's readiness to be safely deployed to flooded and post-flood environments will be assessed.",
            "detailedDescription": "Enrolled participants will be asked to complete: 1) basic demographic and occupational health information; 2) a simulated wage contract with an employer; 3) a pre-behavioral capability test; and 4) a post flood disaster scenario, which is based on an actual flooding event that has occurred. Participants will be asked questions regarding their response to different challenges he/she might encounter in a post flood construction event and then the correct answer will be provided for learning. Information will be largely graphical, and workers can take the module over the course of several days. Educational material will be based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Emergency Management Institute and the Center for Construction Research and Training disaster preparedness programs.\n\nFinally, participants will complete: 5) a post behavioral capability test and 6) a brief medical questionnaire of the participant's medical history. Based on the results of the educational testing and the completed medical response, a Readiness Index will be calculated for the participant and relayed to both the participant and the worker advocacy organization. This readiness index will be derived from achieving a passing score of 70% of behavioral capability on the educational and scenario modules, successful completion of the health screening questionnaire, and successful completion of a wage contract.\n\nA brief acceptability assessment and exit interview survey will be completed by participants, and it will assess the program's usefulness, evaluate for technical glitches encountered, request suggestions for future implementation, and derive ratings on PA perceived impact.\n\nAdditionally, a worker advocacy staff member who normally conducts disaster preparedness training and a member of the worker advocacy program upper management will be asked to go through the training and answer questions regarding program usability from their perspective."
