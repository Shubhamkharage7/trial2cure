            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nDiseases related to human papillomavirus (HPV) include warts, lesions, and cancers. ICL is idiopathic CD4 T cell lymphocytopenia. People with this rare disease get more HPV-related diseases than other people do. The diseases are more severe and harder to treat in people with ICL. Researchers want to see if the vaccine GARDASIL 9 can help people with ICL.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the effects of the vaccine GARDASIL 9 in people with ICL.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18-65 with ICL\n\nHealthy volunteers the same age\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood and pregnancy tests.\n\nParticipants will have a baseline visit with:\n\n* Physical exam\n* Medical history\n* Oral rinse collection. Participants will gargle a small amount of a saline solution, then spit it into a cup.\n* Apheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A machine will separate the blood and keep some parts for research. The rest will be returned to the participant through a needle in the other arm.\n* Examination for HPV-related disease. Female participants will have a Pap test.\n\nResearchers will collect swabs from some participants skin or genital lesions.\n\nParticipants will get 3 doses of the study vaccine over 6 months as a shot in the upper arm or thigh muscle. They will repeat the screening tests each vaccine visit.\n\nParticipants will record their temperature and side effects for several days after vaccinations.\n\nParticipants may have visits after vaccinations.\n\nParticipants will have 2 follow-up visits in the 18 months after the last vaccine. They will repeat most of the baseline tests.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "As observed in other immunocompromised individuals with selective or combined T cell deficits, the prevalence and morbidity of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease is increased in patients with idiopathic CD4 T cell lymphocytopenia (ICL). The high burden and aggressive clinical course of HPV-associated disease in patients with ICL requires the development of effective preventive measures in this specific population. The protection from a broader range of HPV types offered by the 9-valent vaccine is expected to be particularly beneficial in this population. This applies even to patients with a history of type-specific HPV-associated disease, as this population may remain at a higher risk of acquisition of infection with new oncogenic HPV types even with increasing age. However, the immunogenicity of vaccines and in particular HPV preventive vaccines has never been systematically studied in patients with ICL.\n\nThis will be a phase 2, open-label study to assess the immunogenicity of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 9-valent HPV recombinant vaccine GARDASIL 9 in patients 18- through 70-years-old with ICL, irrespective of HPV serostatus, presence of HPV-associated diseases, or previous immunization with bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine, as well as healthy controls matched to the ICL patient group for age and gender. The study will take place at a single site (National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD). Participants will be assessed at baseline for history and/or clinical evidence of HPV-associated disease. Those with a history of or current HPV skin or mucosal disease will undergo clinically indicated evaluation and be referred for clinical care as needed. We will administer the vaccine in a population of ICL patients ranging in age from 18 through 70 years old according to the standard 3-dose schedule approved by the FDA for individuals 9 through 45 years of age, with the second and third doses administered at least 2 months and at least 6 months, respectively, after the first dose. Follow-up visits will occur 1 and 18 months after completion of the vaccination schedule. Blood will be collected at each study visit for safety and immunogenicity testing."
