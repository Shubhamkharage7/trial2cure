            "briefSummary": "12 adults with spastic CP will complete 6 baseline sessions and 24 down conditioning sessions held 3 times/week. All clinical and physiological assessments collected at baseline will be reassessed after study completion, and follow ups after 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months. The soleus H reflex (electric analogue of the stretch reflex) will be elicited in all sessions. In each session, participants will complete 20 baseline trials and 225 down conditioning trials to decrease the magnitude of the H-Reflex.",
            "detailedDescription": "Individuals with CP face significant challenges due to spasticity that causes activity and participation restrictions with increase in secondary conditions. This is caused by injury to the upper motor neurons causing disruption to the neural circuitry responsible for maintaining motor tone. A novel intervention, OC of the H reflex has shown promising effects to reduce spasticity and improve motor function in people with stroke and spinal cord. Its many known benefits include easy administration, non-invasive technique, no side effects, and long-term retention. In the study, the investigators will attempt to decrease the increased muscle tone of individuals with CP. If successful, it will not only provide evidence for future clinical application but also broaden the scope for alternate or supplementary non-invasive treatment approaches to decrease spasticity."
