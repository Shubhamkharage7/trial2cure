            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the study is to learn if a program for newborn mom's can improve detection of complications after delivery and help women get medical care quickly and easily. Participants will be asked to complete a survey at the time of enrollment and at 3 additional times. All surveys can be completed via cell-phone or email. All women will be followed for 1-year after delivery. Women that enroll will be assigned to one of two groups: usual in person care OR usual in-person care PLUS a text message-based program that will ask about sign and symptoms of complications that may occur after delivery. If there is a concern, a nurse advocate will call on the phone to discuss options and help refer to care if needed. Participants will be paid for their time in completing surveys."
