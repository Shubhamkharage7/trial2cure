            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial studies the side effects, best dose, and effect of tagraxofusp and decitabine in treating patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Tagraxofusp consists of human interleukin 3 (IL3) linked to a toxic agent called DT388. IL3 attaches to IL3 receptor positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers DT388 to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving tagraxofusp and decitabine may help to control the disease in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of tagraxofusp-erzs (tagraxofusp) in combination with decitabine.\n\nII. To assess overall response (OR) rate to tagraxofusp in combination with decitabine.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess overall survival (OS), duration of response, relapse-free survival (RFS) and safety profile.\n\nII. Correlative studies.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of tagraxofusp-erzs followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1-5, and tagraxofusp-erzs IV over 15 minutes on days 1-3. Cycles of decitabine repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with tagraxofusp-erzs repeats every 28 days for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months."
