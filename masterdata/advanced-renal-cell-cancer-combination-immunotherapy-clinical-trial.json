The study will plan to enroll 120 eligible patients randomized in a 2:1 fashion to Arm A and Arm B. Patients in all IMDC Risk Groups are included. This study utilizes a Simon's two stage design which is described in the protocol. Patients randomized to Arm A will receive botensilimab in combination with balstilimab. Patients randomized to Arm B will receive ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab. Study treatment on both arms will continue until toxicity, disease progression or a maximum of 96 total weeks (12 weeks induction, 84 weeks maintenance)."

WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) within 1 week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n11. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception.\n12. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior adjuvant or systemic therapy for RCC.\n2. Prior treatment with an anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 agent, anti-CTLA4 antibody or a VEGFR TKI or anti-VEGF antibody including in the adjuvant setting.\n3.

Expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy while on trial (including maintenance therapy with another agent, radiation therapy, and/or surgical resection).\n5. Currently known active and definitive CNS metastases. Patients who have treated brain metastases (with either surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)) may be eligible. Patients must not have taken any steroids \u2264 2 weeks prior to randomization for the purpose of managing their brain metastases. Repeat imaging after SRS or surgical resection is not required so long as baseline MRI is within 4 weeks of registration. Patients with multiple brain metastases treated with SRS (with or without WBRT), are not excluded. Patients with definitive CNS metastases treated with only WBRT are ineligible. Patients with potential CNS metastases that are too small for treatment with either SRS or surgery (e.g. 1-2 mm) and/or are of uncertain etiology are potentially eligible, but need to be discussed with and approved by the sponsor-investigator.\n6. Persistent toxicity of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 Grade \\> 1 severity that is related to prior therapy. NOTE: Sensory neuropathy or alopecia of Grade \u2264 2 are acceptable.\n7. Known severe (Grade \u2265 3) hypersensitivity reactions to fully human monoclonal antibodies, antibody, or severe reaction to immuno-oncology agents, such as colitis or pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids; or has a history of interstitial lung disease, any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma.\n8. Known condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\>10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of randomization. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses \\<10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. NOTE: Corticosteroid use as a premedication for IV contrast allergies/reactions is allowed.\n9. Active known or suspected autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment within 2 years of the start of study drug (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Subjects with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g., celiac disease) are permitted to enroll.\n10. Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency based on investigator discretion.\n11. Active infection requiring systemic therapy within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n12. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class \u2265 II), or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.\n13. Legally incapacitated or has limited legal capacity.\n14. Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n15. Prior allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant, except for corneal transplants.\n16. Major surgery (e.g., nephrectomy) less than 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n17. Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years from screening except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.\n18. Any condition including medical, emotional, psychiatric, or logistical that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude the participant from adhering to the protocol or would increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or interfere with the interpretation of safety results.\n19. Receipt of a live/attenuated vaccine within 30 days of first study treatment. The use of inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines (eg, Fluzone\u00ae) will be permitted on study without restriction.",
