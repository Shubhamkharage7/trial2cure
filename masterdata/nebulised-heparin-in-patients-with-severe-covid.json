Individual studies are being conducted in multiple countries, including Australia, Ireland, the USA, and the UK.\n\nMechanically ventilated patients with confirmed or strongly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, hypoxaemia and an acute pulmonary opacity in at least one lung quadrant on chest X-ray, will be randomised to nebulised heparin 25,000 Units every 6 hours or standard care (open label studies) or placebo (blinded placebo controlled studies) for up to 10 days while mechanically ventilated. All trials will collect a minimum core dataset. The primary outcome for the meta-trial is ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Individual studies may have additional outcomes."

The sample can be a nasal or pharyngeal swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or another sample from the patient.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Enrolled in another clinical trial that is unapproved for co-enrolment\n* Heparin allergy or heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT)\n* APTT \\> 120 seconds and this is not due to anticoagulant therapy\n* Platelet count \\< 20 x 109 per L\n* Pulmonary bleeding, which is frank bleeding in the trachea, bronchi or lungs with repeated haemoptysis or requiring repeated suctioning\n* Uncontrolled bleeding\n* Pregnant or might be pregnant. Females aged 18-49 years are excluded unless there is documented menopause or hysterectomy or a pregnancy test was performed and is negative.\n* Receiving or about to commence extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)\n* Myopathy, spinal cord injury, or nerve injury or disease with a likely prolonged incapacity to breathe independently e.g. Guillain-Barre syndrome\n* Acute brain injury that may result in long-term disability\n* Usually receives home oxygen\n* Dependent on others for personal care due to physical or cognitive decline\n* Death is imminent or inevitable within 24 hours\n* The clinical team would not be able to set up the study nebuliser and ventilator circuit as required including with active humidification\n* Clinician objection\n* Refusal of participant (person responsible) consent.",
