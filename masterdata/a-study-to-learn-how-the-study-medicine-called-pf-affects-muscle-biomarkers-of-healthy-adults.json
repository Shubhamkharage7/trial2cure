            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to understand how the study medicine (PF-07293893) affects muscle biomarkers. Biomarkers are like clues or signs in our body that can help doctors understand our health. PF-07293893 is being studied as a possible treatment for people with heart disease who have reduced ability to exercise. This study aims to see how the study medicine affects muscle biomarkers related to the ability to exercise.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who:\n\n1. Are males 18 to 65 years of age and females who are not able to become pregnant;\n2. Have body mass index of 16 to 32 kilograms per meter square and a total body weight of more than 50 kilograms (110 pounds);\n3. Over prior 4 weeks have an average of less than:\n\n   -150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout each week. Moderate-intensity physical activity feels somewhat hard. Your breathing becomes faster, but you are not out of breath. You can hold a conversation, but you cannot sing.\n\n   AND\n\n   -75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout each week. Vigorous-intensity physical activity feels challenging. You are breathing fast and deep. You cannot say more than a few words without pausing.\n\n   OR\n\n   -An equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity activity.\n\n   Participants will stay at the study clinic for about four days. On the third day, participants will take the study medicine or placebo (dummy pill) by mouth once at the study clinic and then stay at the study clinic for another day. During this time, the study team will check the treatment and take some blood and muscle tissue samples from the leg. This will help to understand if the study medicine affects muscle biomarkers. Participants will return to the study clinic for a follow-up visit or receive a follow-up telephone call about a month later."
