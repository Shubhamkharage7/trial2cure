            "briefSummary": "This study is about determining if an aerobic and resistance exercise intervention is feasible in patients diagnosed with acute or chronic GVHD (Graft-Versus-Host Disease) after having an allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n\nThe names of the study interventions involved in this study are:\n\n* Aerobic and resistance exercise (A+R) - Home-based aerobic and resistance exercise program\n* Attention control (AC) - Home-based stretching program",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a feasibility study, which is the first-time investigators are examining an aerobic and resistance exercise (A+R) in patients diagnosed with acute or chronic GVHD after having an allogeneic stem cell transplant and if participating in a specific exercise program can improve glycemic control, body composition, physical fitness and function, and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nThis study consists of participants randomly assigned in 2(A+R):1(AC) ratio to one of two groups:\n\n* Aerobic and resistance exercise (A+R), or\n* Attention control (AC)\n\nThe A+R group will be asked to perform aerobic exercise, which can improve cardiovascular (heart) and lung function, and resistance exercise (e.g., dumbbell lifting), to help build muscle mass and strength. The AC group will be asked to perform stretching only and not to change their activity behavior.\n\nAll participants will also undergo four testing visits involving four blood draws and three body composition scans via a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).\n\nParticipants will be in this research study for 6 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 36 people will take part in this research study."
