Additionally, continued drinking risks worsening cognitive decline and dementia progression, while worsening cognitive impairment contributes to drinking escalation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to improve cognition in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dimentias (ADRD) and separately reduce heavy drinking in alcohol use disorder. Our objective is to optimize rTMS for simultaneous mitigation of both drinking and cognitive dysfunction in older adults.",
            "detailedDescription": "Alcohol misuse is a risk factor for early onset cognitive impairment, contributing to 10% of early onset dementia, with risk corresponding to consumption. Additionally, continued drinking risks worsening cognitive decline and dementia progression, while worsening cognitive impairment contributes to drinking escalation. Notably, there exists no intervention targeting the intersection of alcohol misuse and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. It is unclear whether alcohol contributes to a specific form of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and furthermore whether the impairments and structural brain changes represent classical ADRD neurodegenerative patterns. Despite the unclear etiopathogenesis, there is emerging evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to upregulate executive/cognitive control circuitry can improve cognition in ADRD, and separately reduce heavy drinking in AUD. Our long-term objective is to optimize rTMS for simultaneous mitigation of both drinking and cognitive dysfunction in older adults towards breaking this cycle and thwarting progression to dementia."
