            "briefSummary": "Poor quality of primary care providers' vaccine recommendations lead to low adolescent human papillomavirus vaccination rates and hundreds of thousands of adolescents unnecessarily at risk for HPV-associated cancers and diseases. Though a previous provider communication intervention, called PCOM, was found to be effective for increasing adolescent HPV vaccination in primary care, its dissemination is limited by the need for significant research team involvement to teach providers how to use the intervention's components. To address this, investigators propose to develop and test a virtual version of PCOM, use mixed methods to assess contextual factors affecting its use compared to the original PCOM intervention, and develop an optimized version of PCOM for broad dissemination to increase adolescent HPV vaccination nationally.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal is to develop a \"Virtual\" version of the PCOM intervention (\"PCOM-Virtual\") and compare its efficacy for increasing HPV vaccination among adolescents to that of the original PCOM intervention (\"PCOM-Standard\"). Using Dissemination \\& Implementation (D\\&I) science principles to develop and evaluate the PCOM-Virtual intervention for non-inferiority, investigators anticipate that to have a \"shelf ready\" intervention and associated \"User Manual\" that can be easily incorporated into practices broadly to improve the practice's adolescent HPV vaccination rates.\n\nSpecific Aims are to: (1) develop the \"PCOM-Virtual\" intervention using principles of D\\&I Science; (2) compare the efficacy of \"PCOM-Virtual\" versus \"PCOM-Standard\" in improving adolescent HPV vaccine utilization; and (3) examine whether practice, patient and provider characteristics are associated with variability in the efficacy of PCOM-Virtual and PCOM-Standard."
