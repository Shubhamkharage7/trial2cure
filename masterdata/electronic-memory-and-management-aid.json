            "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized, web-based training intervention that was developed to teach use of an Electronic Memory and Management Aid (EMMA) application. The app-based system is designed to support everyday memory, daily activity management and positive health behavior engagement for older adults with subjective cognitive complaints or mild cognitive impairment. The investigators will also evaluate the degree to which a clinician is needed to oversee the uptake and utilization of the EMMA app during the web-based training intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, \"Technical Support Only\" group (T-only group) and \"Technical + Clinician Support\" group (T+C group). Participants will be enrolled in the study for 6 months.\n\nParticipants who pass initial phone screening criteria will participate in a 2-3 hour neurocognitive assessment over zoom to establish baseline cognition, prior to beginning the intervention. Participants will also complete questionnaires and a real-world measure assessing daily functioning. After the initial assessment is complete, participants will be given one-month to learn to use the EMMA app by completing the self-paced intervention via the adaptive, web-based training platform, which includes six lessons. EMMA device-use will be captured throughout the study by the app itself.\n\nA component of the self-paced, web-based intervention involves setting goals related to using the EMMA app. A clinician will monitor the training data and goals the T+C group participants make and conduct brief problem-solving and goal-refining sessions during the intervention weeks. These sessions are expected to be 10-15 minutes. To keep training on track, the T-only group will receive brief phone check-ins to monitor progression through the web-based intervention. Following training, there will no longer be any differences in the treatment of both groups, which will be monitored for an additional three months. Immediately following training and at the end of the 3 month monitoring period, all participants will complete the battery of questionnaires and answer a semi-structured phone interview. In addition, at the end of the 3 month follow-up, all participants will again complete the neurocognitive assessment and real-world measure of daily functioning."
