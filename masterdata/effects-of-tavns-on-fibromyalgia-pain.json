TaVNS is a portable, safe, and low-cost intervention, and according to some studies, taVNS may influence nociception and pain perception, which can lead to potential applications for various painful illnesses, including fibromyalgia (FM). This trial aims to investigate the clinical effects of taVNS on pain control in FM subjects."

Able to provide informed consent to participate in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subjects who have unstable medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, uncompensated cardiac issues, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or who have functional deficits, as self-reported.\n2. history of substance abuse within the past six months as self-reported (if the subject reports a history of substance abuse, we will confirm using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria).\n3. Presence of implanted cranial electronic medical devices (e.g., cochlear implants).\n4. pregnancy (as the safety of taVNS in the pregnant population (and children) has not been assessed (though the risk is non-significant), we will exclude pregnant women (and children).
