The study objective is to determine if impulsivity, inhibitory control, drug choice, and/or cognitive distortions predict opioid misuse and disability in patients with chronic pain. This is a prospective consented cross-sectional study characterizing behavioral and cognitive phenotypes using both patient-reported survey measures and cognitive testing. Outcome measures include correlations between impulsivity measures, opioid drug choice responses and cognitive distortion scores, and risk for opioid misuse (Primary outcomes: COMM scores, SOAPPR scores). Secondary outcomes is BPI measurement. A Certificate of Confidentiality will provide additional protections for participants."
