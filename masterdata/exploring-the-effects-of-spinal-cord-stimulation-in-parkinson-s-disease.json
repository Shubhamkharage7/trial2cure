            "briefSummary": "Parkinson Disease (PD) patients experience a variety of motor issues such as walking difficulties, loss of balance, and freezing while walking, which impacts their quality of life. Some symptoms, like freezing of gait (FOG), do not respond to medications typically used to treat PD. Current surgical procedures used to alleviate PD symptoms also do not always improve FOG. Since many traditional therapies have failed for the treatment of FOG, researchers have proposed the use of newer treatments. Recent research in animal models and clinical human data using SCS has produced promising results, specifically showing improvement in FOG with the use of SCS in patients with PD.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the management of freezing of gait (FOG) that does not respond to conventional treatments in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The investigators hypothesize that SCS significantly decreases FOG episodes in patients with PD.\n\n1. Assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary evidence of effectiveness of upper thoracic spinal cord stimulation for freezing of gait in Parkinson's (PD) patients.\n2. Explore the effects of two SCS programming paradigms on motor, nonmotor and quality of life measures in PD patients with freezing of gait.",
            "detailedDescription": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating motor phenomenon which may occur in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. It is characterized by episodes during which patients cannot generate effective forward stepping movements in the absence of motor deficits.\n\nFOG leads to reduced mobility, loss of independence, social embarrassment, and caregiver stress. While most motor features of PD respond robustly to dopaminergic agents and deep brain stimulation (DBS), there are currently no effective treatments for FOG.\n\nIndirect evidence from case reports of PD patients undergoing spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for neuropathic pain, has consistently described a positive effect of SCS on FOG. In addition, two recent reports demonstrated that thoracic SCS improved locomotion and FOG in patients with advanced PD. The promising role of SCS for the treatment of FOG in PD has encouraged us to assemble a multi-disciplinary team for the systematic investigation of the motor effects of SCS on FOG, locomotion and other parkinsonian features.\n\nThe current study integrates minimally invasive SCS and the use of robotic technology to determine objective gait parameters. The investigators propose a pilot study for the implantation of SCS to the spinal cord on PD patients with treatment-refractory FOG, including a longitudinal assessment of motor outcomes. Motors assessments will include: PAMSys and LEGSys to characterize gait, ActivePERS motion sensor to monitor ambulation parameters and overall activity at home, participants will also be given electronic tablets for the ActivePERS to collect real time information about falls."
