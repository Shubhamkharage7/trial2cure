            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if postpyloric feedings effectively improve objective measures of pulmonary health in preterm infants with chronic lung disease when compared with nasogastric (NG) feedings. This research will (1) determine the optimal nutritional management to prevent a common and costly complication of prematurity, and (2) use a novel crossover design that examines outcomes of clinical endpoints alongside biomarkers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) affects up to 50,000 preterm infants annually in the United States and is the most common complication of prematurity. Despite improving survival in preterm infants, incidence of BPD is increasing. Overall, 11% of infants are born preterm in the United States annually. While many outcomes of prematurity, including survival, have improved over time, the incidence of BPD has increased.\n\nNearly all babies with BPD require provision of feeds via an enteral tube due to feeding immaturity and ongoing need for respiratory support, and up to \u00bc of babies with the most severe forms of BPD require this long-term, and are discharged home with nasal or surgically placed feeding tubes. However, enteral feeding into the stomach frequently results in reflux in preterm infants. This may cause aspiration into the respiratory tract, which can result in further damage to the lungs and worsen respiratory outcomes.\n\nThe study will measure the impact of NJ feedings on lung disease severity in a prospective crossover trial among infants at high-risk of developing BPD.\n\nEach randomized patient will participate in two blocks of feeding, a nasogastric (NG) and a nasojejunal (NJ, postpyloric) block. Subjects will be randomized to either the control (NG) or intervention (NJ) feedings in the first block. Outcomes will be compared pairwise by subject between the NG and NJ blocks.\n\nThe findings of this study would be immediately impactful for neonatologists, pediatricians, pediatric pulmonologists, pediatric gastroenterologists, advanced practitioners, and nutritionists who determine nutritional strategies for preterm infants."
