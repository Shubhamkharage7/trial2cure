Patients in the intervention group will participate in the six PRISM sessions over 3 months. At 3 months following enrollment, patients in both groups will again complete study measures. We will define feasibility as a) the proportion of eligible patients who enroll and b) the proportion of patients who complete the intervention among those randomized to intervention. We will define preliminary efficacy as the change in mean resilience from baseline to 3 months after randomization between those randomized to intervention and usual care. Exploratory analyses will examine PRISM's impact on patient-centered outcomes of quality of life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and perceived competence for health care."
