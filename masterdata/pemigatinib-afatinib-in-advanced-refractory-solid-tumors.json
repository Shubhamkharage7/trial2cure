            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label phase Ia/Ib study to evaluate safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination of pemigatinib and afatinib in patients with FGFR-altered refractory advanced solid tumors.\n\nThis study includes 2 parts: phase 1a dose escalation and phase 1b dose expansion.\n\n* In the phase 1a dose escalation study patients with FGFR-altered refractory advanced refractory solid tumors will be enrolled.\n* In the phase Ib dose expansion study, patients with FGFR-altered cholangiocarcinoma will be recruited into 2 cohorts: FGFR inhibitor-na\u00efve cholangiocarcinoma and FGFR-inhibitor-pretreated and resistant cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nThis research study involves the study drugs Afatinib and Pemigatinib.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long there is benefit and no unacceptable side effects. Participants will be followed for up to 1 year. It is expected that up to 70 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved afatinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 rearrangement or fusion.\n\nThe FDA has not approved the combination of afatinib and pemigatinib as a treatment for any disease."

Patients who do not have adequate archival tumor tissue available are required to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy. If a fresh biopsy cannot be safely performed, the patient may be eligible with principal investigator approval.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known hypersensitivity to afatinib or pemigatinib or excipients of pemigatinib\n* For patients treated with a prior FGFR inhibitor, those with known activating mutation(s) in the FGFR2 kinase domain on ctDNA or biopsy analysis within 8 weeks of start of study drugs; activating mutations in the FGFR2 kinase domain seen on ctDNA or biopsy analysis prior to the 8-week timepoint may be allowed after discussion with the study PI.\n* Systemic or liver-directed anticancer therapy within 2 weeks; or anticancer monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to planned start of pemigatinib and afatinib.\n* Patient has adverse events from prior therapy that have not resolved to \u2264 grade 1; exceptions for non-clinically meaningful adverse events (AEs) can be made with input from the principal investigator.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to planned start of pemigatinib and afatinib (tumor biopsy, biliary stent or catheter placement, and feeding tube placement are not considered major surgical procedures).\n* Received prior palliative non-CNS radiation within 2 weeks or extended-field radiation administered within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Subjects must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. Fibrotic pulmonary disease from prior radiotherapy is permissible with approval of the study PI.\n* Known pre-existing interstitial lung disease\n* Current hypovitaminosis D requiring supraphysiologic (eg 50,000 IU/weekly) to replenish the deficiency. Vitamin D supplements are allowed.\n* History and/or current evidence of clinically significant ectopic mineralization/calcification or non-tumor related alteration of calcium-phosphorus homeostasis.\n* History and/or current evidence of clinically significant corneal or retinal disorder confirmed by ophthalmological examination\n* Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis\n* Chronic nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea considered to be clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator. This includes significant or recent gastrointestinal disorders with diarrhea as a major symptom\n* Clinically significant active malabsorption syndrome or other condition likely to affect gastrointestinal absorption of the study drug.\n* Patients with a history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically significant, and has potential for metastases or currently requires active intervention (except for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists in prostate cancer or hormonal therapy in breast cancer\n* Have history of hepatic encephalopathy of any grade\n* Patients with ascites requiring serial paracenteses\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases are not eligible. Patients with asymptomatic and treated brain metastases may participate provided that they are stable for \u2265 2 months. Patients with suspected or confirmed leptomeningeal disease are not eligible even if treated. Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are not eligible.\n* Clinically significant, active cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of 3, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia, or history of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to planned start of pemigatinib and afatinib\n* Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) \\> 480 ms on ECG conducted during Screening, or history of torsades de pointes or personal or family history of prolonged QT syndrome.Correction of suspected drug-induced QTcF prolongation can be attempted at the investigator's discretion and only if clinically safe to do so with either discontinuation of the offending drug or switch to another drug not known to be associated with QTcF prolongation.\n* Active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection (except for fungal nail infection), or other clinically significant active disease process which in the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor-investigator makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial. Screening for chronic conditions is not required.\n* Active hepatitis B virus (HBV)\n\n  -- Note: Controlled (treated) hepatitis will be allowed if they meet the following criteria: antiviral therapy for HBV must be given for at least 1 month prior to first dose of study drug, and HBV viral load must be less than 2000 IU/ml (104 copies/ml) prior to the first dose of study drug. Those on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 2000 IU/ml (104 copies/ml) should stay on antiviral therapy throughout the study treatment.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on anti-retroviral therapy for HIV(excluded due to potential drug-drug interactions between anti-retroviral medications and study treatment but HIV itself is not an exclusion).\n* Known or suspected active drug or alcohol use\n* Concomitant treatment with known strong p-gp inhibitor.\n* Use of any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers or moderate CYP3A4 inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n  -- Note: Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not prohibited\n* Pregnancy during the study or within 30 days of the last dose of study intervention. Also excluded are any persons of childbearing potential, including men who are able to father a child, who are unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the trial (see below section 3.3). Lactation and breastfeeding during the study or within 30 days of the last dose of study intervention is also not allowed. Female patients must have a negative pregnancy test (B-HCG test in urine or serum) prior to commencing study treatment.\n* Unable to swallow pills\n* Any other concomitant serious illness or organ system dysfunction which in the opinion of the investigator would either compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the study drug. Patients unable or deemed by the investigator as unlikely to comply with the protocol are also excluded.",
