Alteplase helps dissolve blood clots and is used to treat heart attacks, strokes, and clots in the lungs. Alteplase may help to control symptoms of breathlessness.",

To evaluate dyspnea using the Borg score at one week in patients with symptomatic septated malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) with inability to drain fully that are treated with intrapleural alteplase.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate dyspnea using the visual analog scale (VAS) scale at one week in patients with septated MPE and IPC and inability to drain fully that are treated with intrapleural alteplase.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive alteplase instilled into the IPC which is capped for 1-2 hours before the catheter is drained.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo instilled into the IPC which is capped for 1-2 hours before the catheter is drained. Beginning 1 week later, patients may receive alteplase as in arm I."
