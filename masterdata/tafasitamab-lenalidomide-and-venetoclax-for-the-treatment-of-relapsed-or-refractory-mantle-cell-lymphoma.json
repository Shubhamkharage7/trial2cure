            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax work in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back (after a period of improvement) (relapsed) or that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Tafasitamab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Lenalidomide is in a class of medications called immunomodulatory agents. It works by helping the immune system kill cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax together may kill cancer cells more efficiently in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma after treatment with tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax combination.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the complete response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma after treatment with tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax combination.\n\nII. To estimate the duration of response (DoR) in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma after treatment with tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax combination.\n\nIII. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma after treatment with tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax combination.\n\nIV. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma after treatment with tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax combination.\n\nV. To evaluate the safety profile of tafasitamab, lenalidomide and venetoclax combination in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the rate of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in peripheral blood by multi-color flow cytometry.\n\nII. To assess the correlation between MRD status with clinical outcomes such as DoR, PFS and OS.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients receive tafasitamab intravenously (IV), lenalidomide orally (PO) and venetoclax PO while on study. Patients may undergo lumbar puncture during screening. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan and blood sample collection and may undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tumor biopsy on study and during follow-up. Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, bone marrow biopsy, and bone marrow aspirate throughout the study.\n\nAfter treatment completion, patients follow up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year and then every 6 months until up to 5 years after entering the trial."
