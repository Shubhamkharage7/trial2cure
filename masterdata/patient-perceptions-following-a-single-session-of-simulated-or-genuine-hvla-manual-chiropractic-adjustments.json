Briefly, 30 eligible participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive a single session of either simulated/sham or genuine/real chiropractic spinal adjustments and be given a brief survey immediately following their session and 48 hours later that captures their perceptions and experiences regarding the intervention they received. This study is intended to inform a future multi-session, randomized, sham-controlled trial."
