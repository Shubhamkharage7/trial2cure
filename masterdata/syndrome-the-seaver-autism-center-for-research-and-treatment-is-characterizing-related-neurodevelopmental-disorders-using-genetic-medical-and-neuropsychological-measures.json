Disruptions in the FOXP1 gene cause a phenotype characterized by global developmental delay, speech deficits, mild dysmorphic features, and traits of autism spectrum disorder. This study seeks to characterize FOXP1-related neurodevelopmental disorders using a number of genetic, medical and neuropsychological measures.",

This series of assessments takes place over the course of a three-day period. It includes the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), parent interviews regarding developmental history and behavior, a psychiatric evaluation, a neurology assessment, as well as a clinical genetic evaluation that includes a physical and vitals exam. Affected individuals, as well as biologically related siblings, will also undergo a series of sensory assessments, including a research EEG, visual evoked potential, and an eyetracking assessment. Family members present for the visit will also be asked to provide a blood and/or saliva sample for research genetics."
