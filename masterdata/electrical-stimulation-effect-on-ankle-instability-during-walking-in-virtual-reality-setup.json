Participants will be asked to walk on a treadmill in a virtual reality cave. They will receive light electrical stimulation at the legs to improve your balance. The virtual reality image will sometimes shift in unexpected ways to challenge your balance. During the session, we will conduct a series of clinical assessments, including tests of functional performance and balance. Additionally, participants will be asked to fill out some questionnaires."

This is determined by comparing the average CoM during perturbed steps to non-perturbed steps for each participant, integrated across the first eight steps initiated by the heel strike that triggered the stimulus. We will measure CoM using kinetics and kinematic computed through a motion capture system(Qualysis).\n\nFor the unperturbed trials, we will use margin of stability (MoS) as the primary outcome measure. MOS refers to the distance between extrapolated center of mass, which includes center of mass position and velocity, and the base of support. It has been previously used to measure balance in children with cerebral palsy and Parkinson Disease.",
