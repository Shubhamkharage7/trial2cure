            "briefSummary": "Several members of the scientific community have suggested that breast neurotization can help return nipple sensation to patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction. There has been no randomized controlled study assessing the validity of these claims. The goal of this study is to evaluate if performing breast neurotization can help restore or improve return of nipple sensation to patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction. This will be a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial where patients undergoing bilateral reconstruction will serve as their own controls by receiving an intervention on one breast but not the other breast."

While these patients will be excluded from the formal analysis, the investigators will continue to follow them as a subgroup for analysis and comparison.\n* Men as they infrequently receive bilateral mastectomies due to breast cancer.
