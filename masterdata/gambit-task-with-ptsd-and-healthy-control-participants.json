The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the GAMBIT task improves mental health symptoms associated with PTSD over time. The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether the GAMBIT task promotes flexibility in inhibitory control network as determined by functional neuroimaging. Additional laboratory measures associated with cognitive flexibility, and clinician and patient-rated symptom data, will be collected."
