This study will use the standard dose of 80 mg/m\\^2, including the typical pre-medications as per University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center institutional standard. The only investigational component of this study is lengthening the infusion duration from 1-hour to 2 or 3 hours for a single dose in patients with low SMA."
