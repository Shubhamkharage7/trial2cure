Included in service provisions are elements of: \\[a\\] marriage and relationship education/skills, \\[b\\] marriage enhancement, \\[c\\] divorce reduction and \\[d\\] job and career advancement. The targeted service population for Project Harmony includes married/committed couples in the greater Orlando metro area.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary program consists of 12 hours of relationship education. The investigators seek to conduct an impact evaluation utilizing a randomized control trial (RCT) to compare outcomes of couples enrolled in either face to face relationship education or web-based relationship education to assess the impact of program structure on outcomes. By offering both face to face and online versions of evidenced based curricula, the investigators are directly addressing requests from ongoing needs assessments of our targeted population. The project is designed for couples 18 years and older; all participants in the face-to-face group will receive the Prevention and Relationship Education Program (PREP) 8.0 + Career Pathways Program (CPP) curricula whereas couples in the online group will receive the OurRelationship Intervention + CPP curricula."
