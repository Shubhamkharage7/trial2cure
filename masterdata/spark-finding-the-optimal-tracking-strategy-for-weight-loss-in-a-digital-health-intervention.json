            "briefSummary": "This optimization trial will examine three tracking (or \"self-monitoring\") strategies for weight loss -- tracking dietary intake, steps, and/or body weight -- all delivered through digital health tools. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the combination of these strategies that maximizes 6-month weight loss in the context of a standalone digital health intervention for adults with overweight or obesity.\n\nThe investigators will recruit 176 total participants to the trial. Recruitment will occur through remote channels. Interested individuals will be directed to an online screening questionnaire; those who are eligible will then be invited to attend an initial remote session with study personnel to ensure interest and eligibility in the study. The weight loss intervention will last 6 months, and all participants will receive a \"core\" treatment consisting of goal setting, behavioral lessons, action plans, and tailored feedback - all of which will be delivered remotely. Depending on which group participants are assigned to in the study, some individuals will be asked to track their dietary intake, their steps, and/or their body weight via digital tools. All study tasks will occur remotely, thus, participants never need to come in-person for any intervention or assessment tasks.\n\nThe investigators will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to identify the most effective combination of self-monitoring strategies. The factorial design will allow the research team to determine the unique and combined impact of each self-monitoring component on weight change. The primary outcome is weight change from baseline to 6 months. The research team will also assess self-monitoring engagement over 6 months and its association with weight change. To complement the main trial, the research team will also randomize half of participants to receive an interactive orientation video, in order to assess its impact on trial retention at 6 months. Overall, the information gathered from this trial will enable the construction of an optimized digital health intervention for weight loss that can be delivered remotely, which, if found to be effective, could have high potential for scalability."

Researchers will be asked to submit a data request in writing to the Principal Investigator so that the requested data can be made available while protecting the confidentiality of study participants and ensuring that the proposed research questions do not overlap with planned publication development by the project research team or other groups. The requested dataset will be free of identifiers that would permit linkages to individual research participants. The requestor must agree to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of the data and must indicate how they plan to store the data to demonstrate compliance with secure computing. All publications that emerge from this award will be publicly available via PubMed Central."
