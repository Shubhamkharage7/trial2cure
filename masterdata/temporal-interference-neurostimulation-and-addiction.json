            "briefSummary": "This project aims to develop a line of research using new non-invasive neurostimulation technology to treat adults with opioid use disorders (OUDs). In the short term, the investigators aim to identify novel target brain regions for neurostimulation treatment and characterize their effects behaviorally and neurally. In the longer term, investigators aim to use these preliminary data to justify NIH sponsored clinical trials to apply transcranial direct current stimulation and non-invasive deep brain stimulation to these areas to partially or completely disrupt addiction.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators hypothesize that temporal interference non-invasive deep brain stimulation (TI-NDBS) will be well tolerated and effective at manipulating brain activity and reducing drug cravings. The investigators will investigate whether stimulation with a mild current from temporal interference non-invasive deep brain stimulation (TI-NDBS) to the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), the anterior insula (AI), or the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) will reduce nicotine craving and seeking. The TI-NDBS is similar to the traditional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a method approved for use in a number of other studies. Other studies have shown there have been some effects of reducing craving with tDCS, however, tDCS cannot stimulate structures such as the ACC very effectively because tDCS cannot stimulate deeper brain regions. Thus, the Specific Aim ultimately will compare TI-NDBS with tDCS and sham stimulation. The study is broken up into four phases. The first two will involve device feasibility and identifying the best locations for the electrodes to be placed. In the third phase, the investigators will compare TI-NDBS with sham stimulation. In the fourth phase, the investigators will compare TI-NDBS with sham stimulation and with tDCS."
