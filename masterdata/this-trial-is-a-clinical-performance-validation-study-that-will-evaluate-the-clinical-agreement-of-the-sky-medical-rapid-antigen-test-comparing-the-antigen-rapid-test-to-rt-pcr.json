The test kit was evaluated in the U.S in which patients were sequentially enrolled and tested. Symptomatic subjects were enrolled within six days of the onset of symptoms from a multi-site prospective clinical study. A total of 69 Nasopharyngeal samples, were tested in one (1) CLIA waived investigational site by five (5) minimally trained operators in the U.S during the 2022 COVID-19 season.\n\nNP swab specimens collected from the patients with COVID-19 like symptoms in the U.S during the 2022 COVID-19 season and stored in BD universal transport media tube were provided by our site in the U.S. All the NP swab specimens were confirmed as positive or negative and validated with Ct value by the FDA EUA RT-PCR as a comparator method prior to the study. A total of 69 samples consisting of 39 confirmed positive nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, 30 confirmed negative NP swab specimens were collected. The specimens were aliquoted, randomized, and blinded into sample panels that were tested by each operator, using the instructions provided by the Quick Reference Instructions (QRI).\n\nAll the study samples were randomized and assigned with a unique study subject ID by the sponsor prior to testing at the study site. The expected results of the samples were completely blinded to the operators. All the samples were tested by five (5) operators according to the Quick Reference Instructions only."
