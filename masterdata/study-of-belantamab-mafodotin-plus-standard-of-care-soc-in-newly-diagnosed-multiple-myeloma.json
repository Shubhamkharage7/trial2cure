Participants will receive the combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) on a 3-week cycle until cycle 8, followed by the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) on a 4-week cycle thereafter as per dosing schedule. Participants will receive belantamab mafodotin on a schedule that is dependent on the cohort to which they are assigned. Belantamab mafodotin will be administered in combination with VRd every 3 weeks (Q3W), every 6 weeks (Q6W), or every 9 weeks (Q9W) to Cycle 8, and then in combination with Rd every 4 weeks (Q4W), every 8 weeks (Q8W), or every 12 weeks (Q12W) thereafter. Participants will complete an End of Treatment (EOT) visit at the point of study treatment discontinuation, followed by a Safety Follow-up visit 70 days after EOT."

A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least 1 of the following conditions applies:\n* Is NOT a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or Due to lenalidomide being a thalidomide analogue with risk for embryofetal toxicity and prescribed under a pregnancy prevention/controlled distribution program, and bortezomib having the potential to cause fetal harm, WOCBP participants will be eligible if they commit to either: abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR to use birth control as follows: Two methods of reliable birth control (one method that is highly effective and one additional effective (barrier) method), beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide treatment. Thereafter, WOCBP participants must use one method of reliable birth control that is highly effective for a further 3 months following discontinuation of belantamab mafodotin, or a further 6 months following discontinuation of bortezomib, whichever is longer.

Participants with isolated proteinuria resulting from multiple myeloma (MM) are eligible, provided they fulfil criteria.\n* Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder or other conditions (including lab abnormalities) that could interfere with participant's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures.\n* Evidence of active mucosal or internal bleeding uncontrolled by local therapy and not explained by reversible coagulopathy.\n* Current active liver or biliary disease (except for Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones, or otherwise stable chronic liver disease as per the Investigator's assessment).\n* Participants with previous or concurrent malignancies other than multiple myeloma are excluded.
