The purpose of this study is to establish a protocol for the collection and storage of tissue samples from patients with CTCL for future research studies. Collection and storage of tissue samples from control patients will also be carried out.",
            "detailedDescription": "CTCL is a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas characterized by chronic inflammation and accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. In order to carry out research to expand the knowledge and develop more effective treatments, tissue samples from CTCL patients with presumed or known disorders are required and tissue samples from control patients will be required to compare the differences between affected and healthy populations.\n\nScientists will be able to test new ideas and new technologies that are not apparent or available at the present moment from this tissue repository in the future. This type of information will thus be of great advantage to future patients with these diseases."
