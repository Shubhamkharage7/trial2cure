This mechanism may be susceptible to antiviral therapy that blocks viral replication, which has the potential to alleviate long COVID symptoms. This trial will study the safety and efficacy of Ensitrelvir (S-217622), an antiviral, to treat individuals with Long COVID in an adult population.",

Participants will be enrolled at a single center and randomized 1:1 to receive ensitrelvir fumaric acid (Ensitrelvir: S-217622), given orally for 5 days, or placebo. Subjects randomized to receive Ensitrelvir will take 375 mg on day 1, followed by 125 mg daily for 4 additional days. Evaluations will take place at baseline and at timepoints up to 60 days post-initiation of study drug."
