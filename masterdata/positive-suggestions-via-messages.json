The interventional group will listen to an audio recording of psychological support based on positive suggestion for about 30 min each day via headphones. At the time of ICU discharge, patients will be administered validated questionnaires to screen for symptoms of anxiety/depression (HADS), PTSD (IES-r), cognitive dysfunction (MOCA-blind), as well as evaluation of health status (EQ-5D). Six months post ICU discharge, patients will again be contacted and repeat the assessment with above questionnaires. Scores on the questionnaires will be compared between the groups at the two times points. Patient demographic data will also be obtained and assessed to contextualize study findings."

A total 300 subjects will be enrolled and randomized until 100 subjects per arm recruitment target is reached to allow for mortality and dropout.\n\nThe analysis will compare 6 month HADS-A by treatment arms using ANCOVA. The analysis will be conducted under a modified intention to treat principle, with subjects analyzed according to randomized arm, but excluding patients who die before follow up. Additional outcomes including HADS-D, MoCA-blind, and EQ-5D will be analyzed similarly using ANCOVA, and IES-R subscore\\>1.6 will be analyzed by Chi-square test.",
