            "briefSummary": "Vaping has emerged as a prominent public health crisis in recent years. In 2023, the National Youth Tobacco Survey found that more than 2.1 million adolescents endorse vaping, with 25% of those endorsing daily use. Many adolescents also perceive vapes as safer than cigarettes, and more acceptable to use both indoors and outdoors compared to cigarettes. Vapes are available in numerous device and delivery systems, with the psychoactive agent commonly including nicotine or cannabis, although these can be of a wide variety of concentrations and formulations. They may be ultra-compact and allow for ease of concealment. In addition, they are produced in a variety of appealing flavorings such as candy, desserts, and fruits. Other constituents include the liquids and aerosolized components of the vaping cartridges, including formaldehyde, acetone, glycerol, propylene glycol, acetaldehyde, and heavy metals. Many of the flavoring concentrates, as well as the vaporized solvents, have not been evaluated for long term safety. One of these additives, vitamin E acetate, present in primarily illicit vaping devices, rose to national attention in 2019 for a suspected link to the dramatic increase in vaping/e-cigarette associated lung injury (EVALI) cases, with over 60 confirmed deaths since that time.\n\nTo our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the lung ultrasound findings of asymptomatic vapers. However, there is data to suggest that vaping can lead to pulmonary toxicity in in-vitro and animal models, including increased inflammatory cytokines, hyperreactivity, and oxidative stress. In addition, studies found the risk of bronchitic symptoms is twice as likely in current adolescent vapers, compared to those who have never vaped before. Given the potential pulmonary toxicity of vaping, as well as the increased percentage of adolescent vaping activity in recent years, investigators aim to evaluate baseline lung ultrasound findings in adolescents who vape. Concurrently, investigators will assess if observing their lung ultrasound findings can alter their attitudes and behaviors towards vaping. Prior adult studies have found that showing patients' their atherosclerosis plaque increased the motivation to quit and cessation rates. Additionally, data in pregnant patients found real-time ultrasound feedback of smoking effects on the fetus lead to near abstinence in light smokers. Given the frequent use of point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department, investigators hope to assess an innovative intervention for cessation."
