            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates the side effects of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and acalabrutinib, and to see how well they work in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill cancer cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to recognize CD19, a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. These CD19-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill CD19 positive cancer cells. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving CD19 CAR T cells together with acalabrutinib may kill more cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety of adding CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched T-lymphocytes (CD19 CAR T cells) to acalabrutinib treatment. (Safety Lead-in) II. Estimate the complete response (CR) rate within 6 months after adding CD19 CAR T cells to acalabrutinib treatment. (Phase 2)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess best response, time to and duration of CR. II. Estimate the 1-year progression free survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS).\n\nIII. Describe the full toxicity profile.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess CD19-CAR T cell persistence. II. Assess CD19-CAR T cell activity as measured by CD19 B cell aplasia. III. Describe the duration of CR from completion of acalabrutinib. IV. Describe immunogenicity of CD19-CAR T cells in the presence of the BTK inhibitor.\n\nV. Characterize CD19 expression on tumor cells. VI. Describe cytokine profile after CD19-CAR T cell infusion. VII. Determine BTK and PLCG2 mutational status prior to treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -5 to 28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive CD19 CAR T cells intravenously (IV) on day 0. Treatment with acalabrutinib repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have not attained CR after the first disease assessment and tolerated the initial CAR T cell infusion may receive a second CAR T cell infusion in cycle 2.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months, then yearly for up to 15 years post CAR T cells infusion."

History of other malignancies, except for the following: malignancy surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative intent, adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the breast or cervix uteri, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; early stage prostate cancer on expectant management; malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease present for \u2265 3 years.\n20. Lactating women.\n21. Active chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) post-allogeneic HCT.\n22. Uncontrolled active infection:\n\n    * HIV positive or have active hepatitis B or C infection based on testing performed within 4 weeks of enrollment.\n    * Hepatitis B or C serologic status: subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are surface antigen negative will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded.\n    * Subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody positive (or have a known history of HBV infection) should be monitored quarterly with a quantitative PCR test for HBV DNA. HBV monitoring should last until 12 months after last dose of study drug. Any subject with a rising viral load (above lower limit of detection) should discontinue study drug and have antiviral therapy instituted and a consultation with a physician with expertise in managing hepatitis B. Subjects who are core Ab positive at study enrollment are strongly recommended to start Entecavir before start and until completion of study treatment.\n    * Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded.\n    * Subjects who are positive cytomegalovirus \\[CMV\\] DNA polymerase chain reaction \\[PCR\\]).\n    * Subject with any active significant bacterial, fungal or viral (other than those listed) infections.\n23. Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n\n    Noncompliance\n24. Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).\n\n    * Eligibility should be confirmed per institutional policies.",
