Part 1 will evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK of MK-6552 after administration of ascending doses in a single day to support a dose level decision for Part 2. Part 2 will investigate the PD of MK-6552 after single-day and multiple-day administration. Participants who complete Part 1 and demonstrate that they are able to tolerate at least one dose level of MK-6552 will participate in Part 2."
