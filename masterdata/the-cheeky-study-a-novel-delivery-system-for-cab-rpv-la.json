This study is designed to enroll a diverse population of trans women living with HIV who receive HIV care within collaborating primary care clinics. This study proposes using mixed methods to tailor and evaluate implementation and client outcomes when CAB-RPV LA is delivered through this integrated delivery model.\n\nThis will be a 9-month pilot study among 40 participants who will be provided CAB-RPV LA through an integrated trans-friendly delivery model using 4 implementation strategies to improve the adoption and integration of CAB-RPV LA delivery to trans women. These strategies are aimed at all levels of implementation - system, clinic, provider, and patient to maximize impact. The 4 strategies are a patient-centered injection site (Bridge HIV, SFDPH), patient-centered adherence support (peer health navigation and SMS platform with reminders and communication with staff), provider education, and improved clinic communication strategies.. CAB-RPV LA is being provided as standard of care and is not paid for by the study."

The clinic is staffed by physicians, nurses, and peer navigators who are experienced working with the trans community and are experts in delivery of injectable formulations. For patients unable to attend follow-up clinic visits, arrangements will be made for a clinical provider and peer navigator to conduct a home visit for injection delivery. This implementation strategy will overcome structural barriers where it is difficult to get a visit appointment, and when appointments are missed, even harder to re-schedule. The central location in a quiet, safe and trans-affirming clinical site will make injections easy-to-access. Because the Bridge HIV clinic is not a primary care site, injections can be delivered with minimal wait times due to low patient load relative to clinical capacity.",

Peer navigators will use this SMS platform to send appointment reminders, assess needs for re-scheduling, answer questions and triage concerns regarding CAB-RPV LA, and offer support for transportation or scheduling a home visit.

For this study, we will develop educational materials on the CAB-RPV LA regimen, including a summary of results from Phase 3 trials (ATLAS20, FLAIR21), the FDA labeling indication, and details about SFDPH's implementation of CAB-RPV LA within our safety-net system and our new delivery model.
