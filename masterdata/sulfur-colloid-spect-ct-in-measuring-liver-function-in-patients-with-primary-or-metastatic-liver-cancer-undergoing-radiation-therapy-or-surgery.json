Diagnostic procedures, such as sulfur colloid SPECT/CT scans, may measure normal liver tissue before, during and after treatment and help doctors plan better treatment for liver cancer patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts depending on which standard of care they are receiving outside of this study, as part of their cancer treatment: RT or surgery.\n\nAll patients have a total of 3 SPECT/CT imaging with 99mTc-SC. The first scan in both cohorts is routine medical care (not experimental) and takes place prior to initiation of RT or surgery. Two follow up scans are part of the protocol.\n\nCOHORT A (patients receiving radiation therapy per standard cancer treatment): The first follow up scan occurs at mid-RT, and the second one at 1 month post-RT.\n\nCOHORT B (patients undergoing surgery per standard cancer treatment): The first follow-up scan occurs 3-5 days postoperatively, and the second one at 1 month post-operatively. An additional intravenous (IV) contrast enhanced CT scan (70 second delay) will be obtained immediately following the SPECT/CT scan for all 3 SPECT/CT scans.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months."
