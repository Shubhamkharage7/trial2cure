            "detailedDescription": "(CHICA-CN) Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation - Child Neurology is software that works with the electronic health record (EHR) to improve the efficiency and quality of care in the outpatient setting. Built in partnership with the Child Neurology Foundation, CHICA's guidance is based on authoritative guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and others. The plan is to implement CHICA-CN in the Child Neurology Clinics at Wake Forest Baptist Health. To evaluate CHICA-CN the proposal is to look at data derived from three sources:\n\n1. Chart Review to evaluate quality of care based on measures derived from four algorithms developed from American Academy of Neurology quality measures and typically documented in the medical record. This will be a before-after study design in which measurements will be obtained before and after the installation of CHICA-CN.\n2. Parent Phone Surveys to Document the parent experience in terms of physician-patient communication, parent engagement, and satisfaction with use of the patient facing tablet interface. These data will be collected from families of patients identified for the chart review after the intervention.\n3. Physician user satisfaction measures, including perceived value of the system and ease of use in general and as regards individual clinical issues. Surveys will be administered to physicians and clinic staff who used CHICA-CN."
