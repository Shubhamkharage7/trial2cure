            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1. Adapt and integrate COAST-AL using a pre-implementation formative assessment guided by the CFIR. In-depth interviews and clinic observations with community clinic providers, clinic administrators, and MCHD and Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) officials will inform targeted Community-based testing, linkage through Project Connect, and Rapid Start into existing work flows (inner setting, process), identify opportunities to use publicly available data to inform testing outreach (outer setting), and explore provider attitudes towards Rapid Start (individuals).\n\nAim 2. Assess the clinical and implementation effectiveness of COAST-AL in six AL counties served by MCHD. Using RE-AIM, the investigators will evaluate the effects of COAST-AL on clinical and implementation outcomes on progress towards EHE goals. The primary clinical effectiveness outcome is days to viral suppression (VS) for new HIV diagnoses. The primary implementation outcome is the proportion of Zip Code Tabulation Areas with at least 15% of adult population tested for HIV (Reach).\n\nAim 3. Utilize a community-academic partnership to identify implementation strategies to support maintenance and future dissemination of COAST-AL. Using interviews, concept mapping, and nominal group techniques to inform implementation mapping, the investigators will work collaboratively with local and state health department stakeholders to identify and prioritize implementation strategies to sustain and implement COAST-AL in other health departments across AL and rural EHE(Ending the Epidemic)-focus states."
