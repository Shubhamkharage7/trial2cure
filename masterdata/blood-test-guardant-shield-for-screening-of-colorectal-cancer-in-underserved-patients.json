            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates the use of a blood test (Guardant Shield\u2122) for colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer and cause of death in the United States. Screening may help doctors find colorectal cancer early when it is easier to treat yet nearly a third of all people eligible for screening have never had a screening test performed. Currently, doctors use a stool- based test such as the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and visual tests such as a colonoscopy. Blood based testing such as Guardant Shield\u2122, may provide a quick and effective way to screen patients that are hard to reach or with limited access (underserved).",

Recruit women age 45 years and older who are in need of colorectal cancer screening from minority and underserved populations via a community mammography van.\n\nII. Obtain data regarding knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about colorectal cancer screening.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants undergo blood specimen collection and complete survey on study. Participants may optionally undergo standard of care FIT testing on study."
