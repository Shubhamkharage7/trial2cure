It will study SEA-CD70 to find out what its side effects are and if it works for AML and MDS. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer.\n\nThis study will have six groups or \"parts.\"\n\n* Part A will find out how much SEA-CD70 should be given to patients.\n* Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-CD70 is and if it works to treat patients with MDS.\n* Part C will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-CD70 is and if it works to treat patients with AML.\n* Part D will find out how much SEA-CD70 with azacitidine should be given to patients.\n* Part E will use the dose found in Part D to find out how safe SEA-CD70 with azacitidine is and if it works to treat patients with MDS or MDS/AML that has not been treated.\n* Part F will use the dose found in Part D to find out how safe SEA-CD70 with azacitidine is and if it works to treat patients with MDS or MDS/AML.",

The study will be conducted in up to 6 parts.\n\n* Part A is a dose-escalation cohort designed to identify the MTD or recommended expansion dose of SEA-CD70 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory (hypomethylating agent \\[HMA\\]-failure) MDS.\n* Part B is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS.\n* Part C is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory AML.\n* Part D contains dose-finding/dose optimization cohorts designed to evaluate the safety/tolerability and identify the recommended expansion dose of SEA-CD70 in combination with azacitidine in participants with 1) relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS or MDS/AML, and 2) previously untreated higher-risk per IPSS-M (Moderate High, High or Very High) MDS or MDS/AML.\n* Part E is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in combination with azacitidine in participants with previously untreated higher-risk per IPSS-M (Moderate High, High, or Very High) MDS or MDS/AML.\n* Part F is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in combination with azacitidine in participants with relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS or MDS/AML."
