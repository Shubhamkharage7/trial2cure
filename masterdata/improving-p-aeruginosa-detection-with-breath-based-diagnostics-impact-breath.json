The study is funded by the US NIH and the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Enrollment commenced in May 2019. Sputum, induced sputum, and oropharyngeal swabs will be collected and evaluated at each clinic as part of standard clinical practice. Excess sputum will be sent to Children's Colorado Hospital for molecular analysis. No swabs will be sent anywhere (other than the clinic from which they originate). Breath samples will be taken from all study participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "AIM 1: Refine and validate volatile biomarkers in the breath of adult and pediatric CF patients for detecting established P. aeruginosa lung infections. For each expectorating subject (n \u2265 288; 5 centers), the diagnostic accuracy of the volatile biomarker panel will be tested, with sputum culture as the standard.\n\nAIM 2: Quantify intra-subject breath variability of the target pediatric population. We will collect longitudinal breath samples for two years from P. aeruginosa-negative subjects (n \u2265 58; \\~60% non-expectorating) at 4 pediatric CF clinical centers. We will measure intra-subject variance in the breath signatures of expectorating and non-expectorating subjects, with the latter being the target population for the clinical trial. Two to 8 breath samples will be collected per patient."
