            "detailedDescription": "The Automated Reinforcement Management Systems Phase II (ARMS II) study is a phase II randomized controlled, non-medication assisted trial to determine the effectiveness of Contingency Management (CM) delivered remotely as a treatment for reducing alcohol consumption among drinking adults who want to reduce their consumption. The study will utilize an application developed by Managed Health Connections, Appropos Health, that connects to a Bluetooth breathalyzer to collect sample results and provide rewards to participants. Qualifying participants will be randomized into one of two groups, a Contingent or Non-Contingent group, and earn rewards based on the group they are randomized to. The contingent group will receive rewards on an escalating scale for submitting consecutive negative samples (0.00% BAC) at three time points per day: 11am, 4pm, and 9pm. The non-contingent group will earn rewards for submitting samples on time, independent of the test results. All rewards will be given in the form of electronic vouchers, which can be exchanged for a merchant of the participant's choosing. All participants will be invited to complete short, daily surveys, and will be called once per week by a research coordinator for a check in on the study's progress. All participants will be invited to the research clinic once per month. All participants will additionally receive positive messaging to reinforce positive behavior, or provide support to encourage a change in behavior."
