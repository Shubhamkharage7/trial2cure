Procedure Used: Radiofrequency Ablation\n\nRisks and potential benefits:\n\nThere are no risks associated with this study as it is a retrospective chart review. Potential benefits include the knowledge gained from this study which may be of help to patients in the future.\n\nImportance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result The knowledge gained from this study may be of help to other patients in the future.",

The device has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is a part of standard of care. You have been invited to join this research study because you require diagnostic or therapeutic evaluation of the Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia by RFA.\n\nThis is a single -site study being performed at the University of Texas Health Science Center. The study will enroll a total 1000 patients with GAVE. This study is purely observational and will collect clinical information regarding your GAVE"
