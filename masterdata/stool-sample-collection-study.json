            "detailedDescription": "Participants providing written informed consent to participate in the study will be provided with a stool collection kit with multiple components. Participants will perform whole stool collection at home using a standardized whole stool collection device designed to fit over the toilet seat. The kit will also include a small, white-capped collection tube which participants will be instructed to use to collect a stool sample from the whole stool to allow for a fecal immunochemical test (FIT). In addition, the kit will contain an investigational device that includes a collection scoop and buffering solution. The investigational device will be used by participants to collect a stool sample from the whole stool. After the two (2) samples are collected from the whole stool, a buffering solution will then be poured over the remaining whole stool. The residual buffered whole stool, the sample in the small, white-capped collection tube (FIT) and the partial stool sample in the investigational collection device will be returned to the Sponsor in a self-shipping box, per the instructions provided to the participants.\n\nAll stool samples will be provided \u22657 days post-colonoscopy and prior to initiating bowel preparation for surgery, and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or follow-up therapeutic colonoscopy."
