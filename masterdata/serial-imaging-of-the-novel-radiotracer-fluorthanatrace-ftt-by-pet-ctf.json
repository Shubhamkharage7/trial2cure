            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies how well fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in patients with solid tumors. Fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace is a radioactive tracer, a type of imaging agent that is labeled with a radioactive tag and injected into the body to help with imaging scans. PET/CT uses a scanner to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body. PET/CT with Fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace may allow more tumor cells to be found in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n- Evaluate fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace (\\[18F\\]Fluorthanatrace) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as an imaging biomarker of poly \\[ADP-ribose\\] polymerase (PARP)-1 activity in 3 cohorts of cancer patients: 1) ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal 2) breast cancer, and 3) non-ovarian, non-breast solid tumor.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n* Evaluate the safety of \\[18F\\]Fluorthanatrace.\n* Correlate \\[18F\\]Fluorthanatrace uptake measures with BRCA mutation status.\n* Correlate \\[18F\\]Fluorthanatrace uptake measures with poly \\[ADP-ribose\\] polymerase (PARP-1) activity in tumor tissue samples in patients who undergo biopsies.\n* Evaluate change in \\[18F\\]Fluorthanatrace uptake measures after therapy initiation with repeat imaging before and after treatment initiation.\n* To confirm the variability of imaging findings from repeated \\[18F\\]FTT PET/CT over 1 week before treatment initiation\n* Determine the change in \\[18F\\]FluorThanatrace uptake before treatment initiation and at time of clinical progression\n* Correlate \\[18F\\]FluorThanatrace uptake at time of clinical progression measures with genetic reversion mutation status\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously (IV) and undergo FDG PET/CT scan over 20-30 minutes if they have not already had one per standard of care. At least 20-24 hours later, patients receive fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace IV and undergo fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace (\\[18F\\]FTT) PET/CT over 1 hour.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours."
