The second is to get some initial information about how well the REGN6569 in combination with cemiplimab may help shrink certain types of cancer.\n\nThe study is also looking at:\n\n* Side effects that may be experienced by people taking REGN6569 alone and with cemiplimab\n* How REGN6569 and cemiplimab work in the body\n* How much REGN6569 and cemiplimab is in your blood\n* To see if REGN6569 can lower the number of Treg cells in tumors\n* To see if REGN6569 and cemiplimab can shrink tumors when given together"
