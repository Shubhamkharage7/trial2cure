This data will enhance understanding of the short-term safety, tolerability and effects of this novel therapeutic approach in the setting of CKD. The primary aims are to investigate the feasibility of the protocol and generate preliminary signals of efficacy and tolerability for two different doses of vagal nerve stimulation. The pilot estimates will be used to design a larger scale study that may lead to potentially targeted interventions to reduce cardiovascular (CV) mortality in the CKD population."
