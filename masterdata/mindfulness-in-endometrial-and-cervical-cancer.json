            "detailedDescription": "A diagnosis of cancer can be a major stress-inducing event. The prevalence of depression in patients diagnosed with cancer is estimated up to 16%. Practicing mindfulness is a cost-effective treatment which can also help manage treatment adverse effects and cancer-related symptoms.\n\nEven short exposure and practice of mindfulness exercises have demonstrated improved subjective and objective measurements of stress and anxiety with breast biopsies. Patients with breast cancer also have improved quality of life with mindfulness training. Self-guided mindfulness with smartphone applications, specifically the app Headspace, has been associated with positive benefits and ease of use in the general population and among cancer patients.\n\nA patient's inherent level of baseline mindfulness has been associated with lower pain scores following minimally invasive hysterectomy. This study did not specifically encourage practice of mindfulness exercises. Our own study of post-operative opiate usage in women following minimally invasive hysterectomy contains self-reported data of women using opiates to relax or help sleep. This suggests that mindfulness exercises may improve quality of life in these areas and thus reduce opiate usage. Patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy for treatment of endometrial cancer were specifically chosen as a study cohort to build on our own data and that currently reported in the literature as well as the highest incidence of this cancer as a gynecologic malignancy. The second study cohort chosen was women with cervical cancer undergoing definitive treatment with chemo-sensitizing radiation given the significant endeavor required for complete treatment. Additionally, these women are often younger with the diagnosis of cervical cancer often being their first major medical diagnosis."
