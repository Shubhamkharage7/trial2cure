            "detailedDescription": "Veterans with PTSD are a highly vulnerable population with tremendous disability and unmet needs. Few VA patients with PTSD now actually receive evidence-based psychotherapy because current exposure-based treatments have low uptake. The project goal is to expand the range of PTSD psychotherapy treatments available at Veterans Administration Medical Centers. This pilot trauma recovery proposal takes the next step in translating a brief efficacious psychotherapy developed and tested for panic disorder, Panic Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP) for Veterans with PTSD at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System (VA NYHHCS). PFPP was developed, manualized, and studied in RCTs over the past two decades. We hope that Trauma-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (TFPP), an adaptation of PFPP, with its high response rates in panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, and non-exposure protocol, will fill crucial gaps in Veteran care. A major challenge facing psychotherapy research is translating and implementing efficacious therapies to the community. No psychodynamic psychotherapy for anxiety or PTSD has achieved this in the US. This pilot RCT represents a paradigm shift in its approach to trauma. TFPP will be the only PTSD treatment for Veterans to incorporate Veterans' input into refinement of the treatment as this project progresses. TFPP targets aspects of traumatic experience and approaches Veterans' lives more broadly than the symptom-focused treatments the VA currently offers our traumatized Veterans."
