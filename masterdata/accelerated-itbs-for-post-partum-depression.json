The investigators further aim to characterize the anticipated anti-depressant effect of this treatment paradigm.\n\nStudy 2: The investigators are studying the feasibility and tolerability of 12 sessions/day of intermittent theta burse (excitatory) transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over 5 days for women with post-partum depression. The investigators aim to compare the two different treatment schedules.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study 1: This is an open-label study designed to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of a novel TMS treatment protocol to treat depression in women with post-partum depression. It is known that TMS can effectively treat depression. The FDA approved protocol lasts 6 weeks and is not feasible for many women with post-partum depression. The investigators are investigating a 6 day treatment for depression which may be more acceptable for this population. The investigators further aim to characterize the ant-depressant effect of this protocol in order to design a larger trial.\n\nStudy 2: In part 2 of this study, the treatment schedule is 12 sessions over 5 days that can be completed with 8. All other procedures, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and number of total pulses delivered is the same as study 1."

There will be 2 weeks of 10 sessions on each of three days for a total of six treatment days, divided by one treatment-free week between treatment weeks. In study 2, the accelerated paradigm will consist of 12 sessions per day for 5 total treatment days.
