We will adapt/integrate evidence-based strategies studied in less complex populations, for this vulnerable group. The HELPix (Health Education and Literacy for Parents) pictogram-based intervention, developed by our team, incorporates these strategies, with sizeable improvements found in medication knowledge, dosing errors, and adherence in outpatient general pediatric settings, but to date, HELPix has not been studied in NICU settings"
