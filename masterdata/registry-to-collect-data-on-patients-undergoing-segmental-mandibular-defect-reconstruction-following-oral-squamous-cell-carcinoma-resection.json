The maximum FU for each patient within the registry will be 2 years after mandibular resection.\n\nData collection will include confounding baseline data, tumor characteristics, neurological function, patient reported outcomes, quality of life as well as anticipated procedure-related adverse events (AEs). Available images will be collected and evaluated centrally to determine the location, positioning, osseointegration, bone quantity and quality of the transplants.\n\nDepending on the volume and quality of the collected data, different statistical analyses will be performed. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to find relationships between the different treatment modalities and their outcomes."
