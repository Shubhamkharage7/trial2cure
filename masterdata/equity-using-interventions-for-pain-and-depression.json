            "briefSummary": "This project is part of the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative (https://heal.nih.gov/). This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is phase 2 of a two-phase, 5-year project with the overarching goal of testing a decision aid (DA)/coaching intervention, tailored to Black patients with comorbid chronic pain and depression, to encourage use of and adherence to nonpharmacological pain treatments (NPTs).\n\nThis 2-arm pilot trial will aim to enroll up to 355 Black patients with comorbid chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression in primary care from an urban safety-net health system (Eskenazi) in order to randomize at least 304 patients. After the baseline assessment, patients randomized to the intervention will be asked to participate in 4 coaching sessions over approximately 12 weeks. Sessions will use Motivational Interviewing principles to foster openness to NPTs and self-efficacy by helping patients identify their goals and priorities, understand their NPT options, prepare them to discuss and choose options with their primary care providers (PCPs), and reinforce these choices to foster maintenance of these changes. DA contents will be integrated into these sessions, which will facilitate discussion of these options with their PCP. The first 3 sessions take place prior to the patient's next scheduled PCP visit; the final session occurs after this visit. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3 months (i.e., after completing the final coaching session), and 6 months.\n\nPatients randomized to the wait-list control group will receive usual care (in addition to study assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months). After completing the final assessment, they will then be given the DA and offered a 20-minute coaching session to walk them through it."
