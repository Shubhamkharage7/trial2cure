Participant will receive the experimental combination of drugs (AN0025, chemoradiation and durvalumab) and undergo laboratory tests and study procedures on specified days during the study period. Complete end of study evaluations and tests, and participate in post-study follow up every three months for two years. The time in the study will take approximately four to six hours during pre-study, study and end of study visits.\n\nPossible benefits of taking part may be improvement in your condition and slowing or stopping the growth of your cancer."
