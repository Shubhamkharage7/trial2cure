Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, the HCV viral load must be undetectable to be eligible for this trial.\n17.

Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n2. Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral absorption\n3. Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study).\n4. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen, per treating physician discretion, are not eligible for this trial.\n5. Treatment with any investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration.\n6. History of other malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except for appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, or Stage I uterine cancer.\n7.
