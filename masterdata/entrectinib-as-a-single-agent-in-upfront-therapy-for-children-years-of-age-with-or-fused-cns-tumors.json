Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients requiring bridging therapy prior to starting entrectinib may receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, etoposide IV over 1 hour on day 1 and 2, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2, filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or IV or pegfilgrastim SC on day 3.\n\nA gross total resection or significant debulking may become possible if a response to entrectinib is seen. If surgical resection is performed and a gross total resection is achieved, 24 cycles of entrectinib will be completed, including those before and after surgery.\n\nAfter treatment, patients will be followed for 5 years."
