During the ED visit, the child's parent/caregiver and the adolescent will complete several questionnaires related to mental health which include tools to measure anxiety and depression. Participants will be asked to complete these questionnaires again at 1 month and 3 months post enrollment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an observational, multicenter study to develop and validate a clinical tool to predict mental health problems in adolescents (after mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI).\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to develop and validate a clinical tool to predict which adolescents with mTBIs are at an increased risk for developing significant new or worsening mental health conditions. The investigators believe that at completion of this study they will have developed and validated a clinical prediction tool that will help clinicians define adolescents with mTBIs by risk of follow up mental health complications into low, moderate, and high-risk categories. This will provide clinicians with distinct risk categories on which make decisions about an adolescents care.\n\nThe investigators will also evaluate racial, ethnic, and social and economic differences in post-mTBI management across diverse populations of adolescents with mTBIs. The investigators believe that specific racial, ethnic, social, and economical characteristics will also be associated with unmet mental health needs in adolescents with mTBIs."
