            "detailedDescription": "To advance science, it is helpful for researchers to share information. They do this by putting data or biospecimens into one or more scientific databases (called registries or repositories), where it is stored along with information from other studies. Researchers can then study the information in other ways and combine information from many studies to learn even more. The researchers are asking for permission to store and share personal information in a research registry to help research studies in the future. The information will be available for any research question, such as research to understand what causes certain diseases in patients with solid organ transplant, development of new scientific methods, or the study of where different groups of people may have come from.\n\nInformation from participant's medical chart will be securely stored in the VCU database. This will include donor information (including COVID test results, radiologic findings, symptoms, treatments, cause of death etc.) as well as recipient information (including demographics, labs, biopsy findings if any, length of hospital stay, COVID transmission, graft function, immunosuppression, post-transplant complications and long term clinical outcomes like patient and graft survival, etc.). Data will be collected during routine clinical care.\n\nThe study will include the following tests:\n\n* Pre transplant COVID-19 PCR on the nasal swab (as standard transplant protocol), serum COVID-19 specific T-cell immune response, and serum COVID-19 spike antibody as a study protocol in all the recipients.\n* Posttransplant COVID-19 spike antibody in the serum around 4 weeks after the completion of induction Thymoglobulin as a study protocol in all the recipients.\n* Daily COVID-19 PCR in serum from post-operative day 1 till post-operative day 4 as a study protocol in the recipients with organ transplant from COVID-19 positive donors.\n* Posttransplant COVID-19 PCR nasal swab once around one-week post-transplant as study protocol in the recipients with organ transplant from COVID-19 positive donors.\n* COVID-19 T-cell specific immune response will be checked in the recipient's serum at 4 weeks post-transplant as study protocol in all the recipients.\n* According to the standard transplant protocol post-transplant donor-specific antibodies will be checked around 2 weeks post transplant and the results will direct the donor-derived cell-free DNA testing in all the recipients."
