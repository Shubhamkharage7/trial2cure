Primarily, the study will evaluate patient experience through collection of patient reported outcomes (PROs). The study will also collect and assess information on the therapies used such as first-line treatment selection, treatment sequence and duration, the drivers of physician selection of particular agents, and discontinuation of therapies.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine distinct patterns of change in the quality of life and symptom burden in mRCC patients receiving therapy.\n\nPatients will be identified and undergo consent and baseline assessments, including research blood collection and processing, by the study site team, this baseline visit will be their only clinic visits per protocol. All other visits are standard of care visits and outside the scope of the study.\n\nSubsequent follow up with be coordinated centrally by DCRI. Additional clinic data will be obtained via PCORnet data pull and Medicare claims. Patient reported outcomes, quality of life and medications data will be obtained via the DCRI Call Center through follow-up phone interviews."
