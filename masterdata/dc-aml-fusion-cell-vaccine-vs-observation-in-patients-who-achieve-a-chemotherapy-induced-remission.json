            "briefSummary": "This research study is studying a cancer vaccine called Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine (DC/AML vaccine) as a possible treatment for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).\n\nThe interventions involved in this study are:\n\n-Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine (DC/AML vaccine)",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the DC/AML vaccine as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab as a treatment for AML.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are determining if the DC/AML vaccine can be used safely in subjects with acute leukemia after finishing chemotherapy, and whether the DC/AML vaccine is capable of producing immune responses against leukemia alone. Cancer cells are foreign to the body and have unique markers that distinguish them from normal cells. These markers can potentially serve as targets for the immune system. An immune response is any reaction by the immune system; a complex system that is responsible for distinguishing us from everything foreign to us, and for protecting us against infections and foreign substances.\n\nThe Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine is an investigational agent that tries to help the immune system to recognize and fight against cancer cells. Unlike a standard vaccine that is used to prevent infections, cancer vaccines are being studied to see if they can fight cancers that are already in the body. Laboratory studies have shown that when dendritic cells and tumor cells are brought together, the dendritic cells can stimulate immune responses against the tumor and, in some cases, cause the tumor to shrink."
