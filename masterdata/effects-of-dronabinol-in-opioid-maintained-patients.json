            "briefSummary": "Twenty male and female (ages 18-70) participants with OUD currently receiving methadone or buprenorphine will be enrolled. Prior to their daily methadone or buprenorphine dose and thus at trough plasma levels of opioid, participants will receive dronabinol (2.5 mg, 5mg) or placebo. Subsequently, all participants will undergo laboratory testing of opioid-related outcomes. Pain sensitivity will be measured using a technique called the (QST) quantitative sensory testing, which involves the administering heat or cold stimulation. A Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and a pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Attentional bias will be measured using a visual probe task. Negative affect will be measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Cognitive performance will be measured by a comprehensive cognitive battery. The order of study medication administration will be counterbalanced order to minimize carryover effects. On the initial screening day and at the end of medication treatment, blood will be drawn to determine serum cytokine levels. One week after the last study medication dose, a follow-up session will be conducted during which participants will undergo urine toxicology testing and a safety evaluation before final discharge from the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over human laboratory study. Participants will be asked to come to the testing site for a total of four times: one initial screening session (\\~ 3 hours) and three test days (\\~ 6 hours each) where study medication will be administered, separated by at least 72 hours to limit carryover effects for dronabinol administration. Twenty male and female participants with OUD on MAT will be asked to arrive at approximately the same time each morning, coordinating with attendance at their opioid maintenance clinic. Subjects will be asked to refrain from using alcoholic beverages and drugs during study participation. Urine screens and breathalyzer measurements will be done before the test sessions to check abstinence from drugs (e.g., cocaine, illicit opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and amphetamines) and alcohol respectively. Those who are non-compliant will be discharged from the study. To minimize nicotine and withdrawal effects on cognitive performance, subjects who smoke will be advised to continue smoking as usual. Since we will provide a standard breakfast, participants will be asked not to eat for two hour before they arrive for the test sessions. A study nurse will confirm with their respective program that participants did not receive either methadone or buprenorphine that morning, and will call the program when testing is complete to permit dispersal of that day's methadone or buprenorphine dose. On the initial screening day and at the end of medication treatment, blood will be drawn to determine serum cytokine levels. Participants will undergo a variety of cognitive and self-report measures, as well as assessments to confirm restraint from illicit drug use and lack of adverse effects of medication. Prior to their daily methadone or buprenorphine dose and thus at trough plasma levels of opioid, participants will receive dronabinol (10 mg, 20 mg) or placebo. Subsequently, all participants will undergo laboratory testing of measures relevant to vulnerability to relapse, including physiological, subjective and cognitive outcomes. The order of study medication administration will be counterbalanced order to minimize the impact of potential carryover effects between the sessions. To date: 27 subjects completed the approve protocol.\n\nThis study was amended to reduce the study drug (dronabinol) to 2.5mg, 5mg, or placebo. This study is active with recruitment continuing under the new doses."
