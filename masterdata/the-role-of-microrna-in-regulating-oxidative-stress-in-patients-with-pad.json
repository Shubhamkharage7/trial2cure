Recent evidence suggests the role of miR-210 and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PAD and its association with mitochondrial function, oxidative metabolism, walking distances and quality of life. The protocol evaluates the mechanisms which miR-210 regulates oxidative stress and provides evidence of potential therapeutic strategies.",

They are also planning to recruit 50 non-PAD healthy control subjects.\n\nThe goal is to answer the main hypothesis that miR-210 gene expression is a master regulator of oxidative stress and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative metabolism, walking function and quality of life."
