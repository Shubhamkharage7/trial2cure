The study will evaluate treatment effects on weight and shape concern and explore the impact of intervention on weight loss outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial to test the effects of a 28-week treatment protocol that combines a modified body image intervention (The Body Project: weeks 1-4) with a 6-month standard behavioral weight management treatment (weeks 5-28). The combined protocol will be evaluated in comparison to a control group that receives an education only program during weeks 1-4 followed by the same 6-month weight management treatment. It will be tested among women with high body weight who report High Weight and Shape Concern and would like to lose weight.\n\nThe goals of the study are:\n\n1. To evaluate effects of a manualized intervention on Weight and Shape Concern prior to starting weight management.\n2. To evaluate the effects of the modified Body Project intervention on momentary weight/shape-related thoughts and overeating episodes during behavioral weight management.\n3. To conduct exploratory analyses comparing effects of the two treatment conditions on weight loss and other weight-related behaviors (e.g., exercise, adherence to self-monitoring)."
