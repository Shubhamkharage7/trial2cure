Emotion dysregulation is a significant suicidogenic factor that is understudied in people with psychotic disorders. The investigators propose to implement and evaluate an intervention targeting emotion dysregulation in people with psychotic disorders while employing rigorous statistical modeling and measurement techniques including Ecological Momentary Assessment, which will support future advanced research on suicide and suicide prevention for this high-risk group."
