The study will provide an understanding of how intensive medical therapy works in providing clinical benefit in women with nonobstructive plaque.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an ancillary substudy of the WARRIOR Trial (NCT03417388), a multi-site, PROBE design, that will evaluate an intensive statin/ACE-I (or ARB)/aspirin treatment strategy (IMT) vs. primary prevention risk factor therapy treatment strategy (UC) in 4,422 symptomatic (chronic angina or equivalent) women with non-obstructive CAD (\\<50% diameter narrowing).\n\nIn this ancillary substudy, 204 patients will be recruited from the WARRIOR trial with 102 patients from each of the treatment groups (IMT vs UC). From this cohort, 102 patients per treatment group, most compliant with WARRIOR protocol will undergo a CTA from any time from 2 years post-baseline up to the end of the main WARRIOR study; with changes in plaque and PCAT characteristics quantified.\n\nThe main aims are as follows:\n\n1. To compare changes in coronary plaque characteristics and their hemodynamic significance using CTA in WARRIOR women treated with IMT vs UC;\n2. To compare changes in plaque inflammation-related characteristics in PCAT in WARRIOR women treated with IMT with statin in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications vs UC;\n3. To relate plaque burden and plaque composition, CT flow reserve, and PCAT density changes to angina score (Seattle Angina Questionnaire \\[SAQ\\]) changes in IMT and UC-randomized WARRIOR women.\n\nData to be analyzed include CT angiography scans at baseline and Year 3 follow-up and corresponding study data and laboratory tests (e.g. hsCRP); plus, selected data from the main WARRIOR study that are relevant to the present ancillary study.\n\nUPDATE; In this ancillary study, 204 patients will be recruited from the WARRIOR Trial with 102 patients from each of the treatment groups (IMT vs UC). From this cohort, 102 patients per treatment group, most compliant with WARRIOR protocol will undergo a CTA as early as 2 years after their WARRIOR baseline scan up to study completion; with changes in plaque and CAT characteristics quantified."
