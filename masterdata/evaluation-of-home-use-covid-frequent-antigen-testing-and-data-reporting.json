            "briefSummary": "The current standard of care for diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection involves sample collection which is then prepared and measured via real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This process is time consuming and dependent on expensive instrumentation and trained technicians to perform both the sample preparation and assay. In many cases, sample turn-around times can take hours to several days. There are no established monitoring nationwide protocols for COVID-19 prevention of infection. Due to the lack of such protocols, this study will provide the proper experience to design a safe monitoring schema of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.\n\nSelf-testing using currently available RDT has a high specificity and relatively high sensitivity to identify individuals with a high probability of contagiousness. Therefore, we intend to use these RDT (Rapid diagnostic tests) for other use.\n\nThere are several studies that point to the importance of the use of RDTs to monitor COVID-19 (3). The recent metadata indicate that the performance of the antigen test is crucial for obtaining good results to detect positive cases. We have already validated in the laboratory and using relevant clinical samples several different labels of antigen tests and we have compared them with already approved USA FDA antigen tests to confirm their performance prior to using them in this study.\n\nThis project aims to monitor once a week the presence of SARS CoV-2 antigens using anterior nares (AN) swab self-process, executing the test and recording of the result, immediately after.\n\nThe lack of affordable diagnostic tests which can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population which can give near real-time results is one critical missing control intervention in USA for the control of the pandemic and the spread of this disease. As public health restrictions begin to ease and people return to normal activities, while the COVID-19 pandemic is still a threat, a rapid diagnostic assay that does not require the sophisticated laboratory equipment and techniques could provide a significant advantage to screen asymptomatic individuals. The routine use of such rapid tests is a key element to show efficacy of protocol. We adjusted to once a week testing based on the medium to low risk of the elderly population of this study.\n\nThe list of rapid nucleoprotein tests utilized in the current study are: NETO Corona test, Novir INSTA-TM COVID-19 Rapid Antigen test, COVICHEK COVID-19 Ag Test, SpectraBiotech COVID-19 track antigen test, Blandford Biotech AS-15\u2122 Rapid Antigen Detection Kit SARS-CoV-2 Test (Colloidal Gold Method), Abbott BinaxNow tests.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Direct Antigen Rapid Test (\"Lateral flow\") is an immunoassay developed for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles/secreted protein in anterior nasal swabs and/or saliva samples from both asymptomatic and suspected participants with COVID-19 infection. Lateral flow strips are printed with a monoclonal antibody that binds the signature SARS-CoV-2 viral particles/protein (Test line) and a control antibody (Control line) for quality control. A second monoclonal antibody is attached to gold nanoparticles (conjugate) and quencher buffer, and mixed with the nasal sample. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein attach to both antibodies resulting in a visual line on the test strip within 15 minutes. Prior experience in the detection of virus and viral proteins via antibody binding using lateral flow have been done through IDx20, Inc. The Housing Authority and the Public Health Department of the City of Chelsea will be overseeing this study.",
            "detailedDescription": "The protocol will be deployed at three sites in the same geographical location. The design encompasses weekly monitoring of asymptomatic, non- disease populations, confirmed by RT-PCR for presumed positive cases. Each positive case will be followed with daily antigen testing and matched RT-PCR testing for 8 consecutive days in accordance with the CDC's stay-at-home protocol, the positive case will quarantine according to public policy. In addition to asymptomatic participants, participants presenting with a positive The antigen tests that will be utilized are all commercial final products with a CE mark.\n\nAll antigen tests utilized are close to identical procedure. Appendix 1 shows the instructions for use of each of the tests. All tests determined nucleoprotein of SARS CoV-2 in a qualitative manner.\n\nParticipants are not expected to participate beyond sample collection and processing of rapid antigen test as part of the study. The collection of one anterior nares sample is done once a week. A second nasal swab will be done once a sample indicates presumptive positive for COVID-19. At the end of 4 months of the study we will provide a rate of positive cases over time, and a positive agreement value over 8 days of testing of a positive case. The data will include a Positive Percent Value (PPV) and potentially expand to provide a NPV when negative samples are sent to the CLIA lab to determine the specificity of the tests.\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1. Individuals 12 year of age or older\n2. Provision of paper-consent form and acceptance of participating on a volunteer basis.\n\nEligible affiliates are individuals who are associated to the member communities of each site and who are identified and consented into the study. These may be individuals who are in close contact with the member community and thus seen as peripheral community members.\n\n* Subjects will be approached by research staff to determine if they would be interested in participating in this study. If willing, a qualified study team member will consent the subject. The electronic system will keep the information about approval of the informed consent by participant. We will also keep a record of the paper and a digital photo of the same document.\n* Study staff will provide instructions to participants in the sample collection procedures on site to ensure proper self-sample collection and to minimize the risk of sample contamination. At the time of initial training. The participant will be using a self-swabbing process to obtain the NA sample. If we encounter an impediment for self-swabbing, the process will be done by assisting the participant.\n* There will be 3 sites in the same geographical location. The design encompasses weekly monitoring of asymptomatic, non- disease populations by antigen test.The positive case will be followed with daily PCR / antigen test testing for 8 consecutive days in accordance with the CDC's stay-at-home protocol, each quarantine period will be completed. This screening will be used for assessing positive cases and confirming using a CLIA lab authorized molecular test.\n* All materials part of the COVID-19 antigen test kit will be provided by the sponsor (Manufacturers provide the test to the sponsors). The test cassettes will be kept at Room Temperature.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN\n\nThe testing of asymptomatic cases to mitigate COVID-19 Pandemic requires frequent use in the population. Lateral flow bioassays are relatively inexpensive to manufacture, easy to store, and easy for front line use in public setting.\n\nEND OF STUDY DEFINITION\n\nParticipants are not expected to participate beyond frequent sample collection and processing of rapid antigen test as part of the study. The collection of anterior nares sample will be done once a week, as well as daily testing for up to 8 days in case of positive PCR result.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n1.
