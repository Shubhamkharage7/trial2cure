In this study, the aim is to compare azelaic acid vs placebo since azelaic acid may increase anti-inflammatory effects that affect the hair growth cycle.",
            "detailedDescription": "The management of Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia (CCCA) is challenging due to limited current treatments and a lack of randomized controlled trials. Management focuses on behavioral and styling modifications, in addition to symptomatic relief. Any potentially damaging hair care practices such as chemical relaxers, heat application to the scalp, and the use of hardening gels and sprays are discouraged. Many commonly used therapies are anti-inflammatory in nature, including intralesional steroids, topical steroids, oral antibiotics and increased frequency of hair washing with antidandruff shampoos. These treatments not only lead to improvement in pruritus and tenderness, but in some cases result in increased hair density. Currently, comparison studies of different treatments for CCCA subjects is limited. The aim is to determine if there is an advantage in using one particular anti-inflammatory therapy over another for relieving symptoms and promoting hair follicle regrowth."
