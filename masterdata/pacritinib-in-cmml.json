            "briefSummary": "This is a phase 1/2 trial of pacritinib in combination with azacitidine in patients with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML). Patients will be newly diagnosed or previously treated but could not have received a prior JAK inhibitor. Patients who have previously been treated with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) must have received \u2264 1 cycle. Pacritinib will be initially tested at a dose of 200mg twice daily (dose level 0) in combination with azacitidine 75mg/m2, which can be administered subcutaneously or intravenously, for 7 days in a 28-day cycle. If there are 2 DLTs in the first 6 patients, there will be a dose escalation to pacritinib 100mg twice daily (dose level -1) and an additional 6 patients will be enrolled. Based on the phase 1, 3+3 dose de-escalation design, 6-12 patients will be enrolled in the phase 1 portion. After the completion of phase 1 and identification of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), the trial will then proceed to phase 2 which will employ a Simon two stage design. This portion will include the 6 patients enrolled during the phase 1 portion at the MTD. An interim analysis for futility will occur. If 3 or fewer patients have had a clinical benefit (CB) or better, as defined by 2015 MDS/MPN IWG criteria, the PI and DSMC will meet to discuss the totality of the evidence and determine if the trial shall proceed. In the second stage, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled."

Phase I will require 6-12 patients to select the MTD.\n\nPhase II, if MTD selected in Phase I, will follow a Simon's two stage design. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 55% will be tested against a one-sided alternative that the response rate is 80%. In the first stage, 6 patients treated at the MTD from Phase I will be included. If there are 3 or fewer responses in these 6 patients, the study may be stopped. Otherwise, 12 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 18. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 13 or more responses are observed in 18 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 9% and power of 82% when the true response rate is 80%.",
