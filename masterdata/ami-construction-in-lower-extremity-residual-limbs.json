The specific aims of the project are as follows:\n\n1. To develop a standardized operative technique for both above knee (AK) and below knee (BK) amputation revision procedures that includes AMIs to restore musculotendinous proprioceptive capabilities\n2. To assess the capacity for these actuators to provide enhanced motor control and sensory feedback, as well as ablate phantom limb symptomatology and augment residual limb muscle mass\n3. To determine the reinnervation time course and longevity of these biological constructs\n4. To validate the functional and somatosensory superiority of the proposed revision technique over standard approaches to BKA and AKA\n5. To develop a modified acute postoperative rehabilitation strategy suited to this new surgical approach"
