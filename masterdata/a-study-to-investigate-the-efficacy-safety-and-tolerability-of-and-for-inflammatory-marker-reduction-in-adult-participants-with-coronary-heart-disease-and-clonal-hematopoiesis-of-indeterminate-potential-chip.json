The overall study duration is approximately 21 weeks.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to one of five treatment sequences. Based on the treatment sequence assignments, participants will start on either a combination of MAS825 and placebo, DFV890 and placebo, or placebo and placebo on Day 1, and then, within each DFV890 treatment sequence, participants will receive up-titrating doses of DFV890 or placebo at the corresponding study visits."
