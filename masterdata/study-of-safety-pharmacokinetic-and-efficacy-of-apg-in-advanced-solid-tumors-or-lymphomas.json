            "detailedDescription": "The dose escalation part is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) when APG-5918 is given orally once daily in subjects with histologically- and/or cytologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that have progressed or are intolerant after treatment with approved therapies or for which there are no standard therapies available. The starting dose of APG-5918 is 50 mg; the doses can be modified depending on toxicity and pharmacokinetic (PK) results based on discussions with the Investigators and Sponsor. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or less than two drug related Grade 2 toxicities are observed by the end of Cycle 1, the dose of APG-5918 will be increased in subsequent cohorts.\n\nThe dose expansion part will be initiated once the MTD or RP2D is established. Approximately 9-12 subjects will be enrolled into two cohorts treating with the appropriate two dose levels at (MTD-1 and MTD) or below MTD (MTD-2 and MTD-1), depending on the comprehensive analysis of the PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), safety and efficacy data of APG-5918. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to each dose cohort."
