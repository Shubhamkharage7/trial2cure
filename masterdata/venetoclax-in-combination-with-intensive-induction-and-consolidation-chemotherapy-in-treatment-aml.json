The investigators are looking to determine the highest dose of venetoclax that can be given safely in combination with these chemotherapy drugs.\n\nDepending on when the participant join the study, the participant may participate in part 1 (induction with venetoclax escalation), part 2 (consolidation with venetoclax escalation), or part 3 (an expansion cohort utilizing the maximum tolerated doses identified in parts 1 and 2). The study doctor will tell the participant which part of the study they will join."
