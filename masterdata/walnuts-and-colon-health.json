After being informed about the study and potential risks, participants giving written informed consent will first start a 7-day wash-out period where they will be asked to avoid foods high in ellagitannins for the duration of the study. In addition, participants will be asked to complete food and activity questionnaires, a walnut consumption log, and two sets of 3-day dietary records during their participation in the study. Participants will also be asked to provide three urine samples, two blood samples, and two stool samples at multiple time points, and 8-10 colon tissue specimens (biopsies) will be collected during their colonoscopy procedure for the purposes of this study."
