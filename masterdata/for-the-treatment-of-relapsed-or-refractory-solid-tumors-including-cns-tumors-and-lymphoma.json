            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial evaluates the best dose, side effects and possible benefit of CBL0137 in treating patients with solid tumors, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors or lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs, such as CBL0137, block signals passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals can affect many functions of the cell, including cell division and cell death, and may kill cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FACT complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137 (CBL0137) administered via infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors and lymphoma. (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) II. To preliminarily determine the antitumor effects as measured by objective response rate of CBL0137 in children with progressive/recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and other H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline gliomas. (Phase 2) III. To preliminarily determine the antitumor effects as measured by objective response rate or stable disease for at least 4 months of CBL0137 in children, adolescents and young adults with osteosarcoma. (Phase 2)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To preliminarily determine the antitumor effects of CBL0137 in children with refractory solid tumors and other CNS tumors, to the extent possible in the context of a Phase 1 study.\n\nII. To define and describe the toxicities of CBL0137 in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors.\n\nIII. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of CBL0137 in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To measure biologic marker FACT in tumor specimens with potential for correlation with disease response.\n\nII. To evaluate the effect of CBL0137 on immune response by measuring the effects on the interferon response pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\n\nIII. To preliminarily determine the effect of treatment with CBL0137 on overall survival of children with DIPG or other diffuse midline gliomas, H3 K27M-mutant, in comparison with historical controls.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive CBL0137 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy at baseline, echocardiograph (ECHO) prior to cycle 1, and as clinically indicated undergo collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months."
