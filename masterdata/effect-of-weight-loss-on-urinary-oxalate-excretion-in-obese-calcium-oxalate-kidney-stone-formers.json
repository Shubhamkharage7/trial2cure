            "detailedDescription": "Obese adults (\u226519 and \u2264 65 years) with a history of calcium oxalate kidney stone disease will be recruited at both University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and University of Texas South Western (UTSW). Following consent, subjects will complete a screening phase, which includes (1) a meeting with a dietitian to ensure willingness to consume controlled ultra-low oxalate diets and determine anthropometric measurements and blood pressure, (2) collection of fasted blood and 2 x 24-hour urine specimens on self-choice diets to determine general health status and urinary chemistries, respectively, (3) completion of a 7-day run-in diet that includes the use of one serving of an Optifast meal daily to assess tolerance to Optifast VLCD\u00ae products. Participants will then consume an eucaloric, ultra-low oxalate controlled diet for 6 days. The controlled dietary phase involves 2 days of dietary equilibration, followed by 2 x 24-hour urine collections, and on the 5th day a dietary oxalate/sucralose oral load. Following the dietary oxalate/sucralose oral load, subjects will have blood collected every 30 minutes and collect 1-hour urines. Participants will then go on an intensive 14-week Optifast VLCD\u00ae Program to induce weight loss. At the end of this Optifast VLCD\u00ae Program participants will again perform the low oxalate controlled diet and dietary/sucralose oral load study. A total of 40 adult obese calcium oxalate kidney stone formers (20 male and 20 female) will be enrolled (20 at UAB and 20 at UTSW)."
