            "briefSummary": "Consumption of unsafe drinking water is associated with a substantial burden of disease globally. In the USA, the burden of disease associated with consumption of contaminated drinking water from non-regulated private wells and springs in rural areas is relatively understudied and unclear. For some lower-income households in rural areas of the USA without access to reliably safe drinking water, point-of-use treatment with relatively low-cost pitcher filters could help to reduce exposures to contaminated water and associated adverse health outcomes. This pilot randomized controlled intervention trial will provide information and data on water quality and contamination exposures, associated health outcomes, and the adoption potential of point-of-use water filters in rural areas of Virginia and Tennessee."
