Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.\n13. Subjects having \\> 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment indicates that the urine protein is \\<1 g/24 hours.\n14.

Replacement steroids for adrenal insufficiency or daily dose equivalent of 10 mg prednisone are allowed\n18. History of severe (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n19. Active uncontrolled infection.\n20. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years. NOTE: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded. Subjects with other solid tumors treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 2 years prior to enrollment may be eligible for study after discussion with the sponsor-investigator.\n21. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). NOTE: HIV testing is not required unless mandated by a local health authority.\n22. Known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection. NOTE: Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C testing is not required unless clinical history indicates that this is likely.\n23. Known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).",
