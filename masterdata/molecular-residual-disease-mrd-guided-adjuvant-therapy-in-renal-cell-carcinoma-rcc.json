Participants will continue on with standard of care pembrolizumab if they do appear to have molecular residual disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter open label biomarker integral treatment de-escalation study, where patients with localized renal cell carcinoma who are otherwise eligible to receive standard of care pembrolizumab will be offered observation only, if they do not demonstrate presence of molecular residual disease.\n\nPrimary Objective(s):\n\nProvide an estimate for the 1 year -Disease-Free Survival (DFS) Provide an estimate for overall Survival (OS) for patients treated based on MRD information.\n\nEstimate the safety of an MRD based strategy of adjuvant therapy in RCC\n\nPrimary Endpoint(s) :\n\ni. Disease Free Survival (DFS) by Investigator's assessment as defined by RECIST 1.1\n\nSecondary Endpoint:\n\ni. Overall Survival at 1 year from surgery ii. Safety as defined by incidence of adverse events per NCI CTCAE v5.0\n\n100 patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma who undergo surgery to remove tumor will be enrolled, patients will be adults (\u226518 years), there are no gender, age, demographic group related constraints, the trial will be conducted at centers based in the United States."
