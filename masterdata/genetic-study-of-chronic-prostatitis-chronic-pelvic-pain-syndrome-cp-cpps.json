It is believed that some types of CP may be genetic or passed down (inherited) from one generation to the next.\n\nIn this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information to try to determine if genetic factors play a role in CP/CPPS. We will be collecting DNA (from Blood/Saliva sample) and urine from each participant. Bladder tissue from affected individuals will also be collected. Individuals and families with CP/CPPS will be enrolled. Family members of an individual with CP/CPPS are eligible whether or not they also experience CP/CPPS symptoms.",

We will be attempting to further describe the symptoms of CP/CPPS and to correlate them with changes in your genes. We will use several types of genetic testing; linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing and candidate gene studies. Each individual participant will be required to give a DNA sample (via Blood/Saliva), a urine sample and answer questionnaires. Affected participants will also be asked to provide a bladder sample from a clinical biopsy. All samples will be stored. Travel to Boston NOT required."
