            "briefSummary": "FOREST is a positive emotion skills program designed to target mental health and coping needs for frontline violence prevention workers at READI Chicago. Ten skills are taught over a period of nine months during existing meetings and wellness activities, as well as in online modules in READI's Learning Management System (LMS). Through infusing the FOREST skills throughout READI, we hope to inspire organizational culture change that will emphasize the importance of wellbeing and enhance resilience, therefore reducing burnout and turnover.",
            "detailedDescription": "All READI personnel will receive the FOREST program, including coaches, crew chiefs, outreach workers, managers, and supervisors at all sites and partner organizations delivering the READI program. Each month for 9 months there will be a focus on one to two positive emotion skills. The skill(s) of the month will be taught to the staff at each of the three READI sties (Austin, Englewood, and North Lawndale) separately on the first three Fridays of the month. These sessions will take place during existing one-hour wellness meetings/activities, and will be co-facilitated by Positive Emotion Ambassadors (PEAs; READI Staff members nominated to infuse the skills into READI culture) and Northwestern University.\n\nThe skill sessions will include didactic content defining the skill and explaining the rationale for inclusion, as well as examples of existing research demonstrating the skills benefits. During the session the group will practice the skill together and discuss ways to use the skill in both work and personal situations. Throughout the month, PEAs will implement the FOREST skill of the month in other existing meetings, check-ins, and team outings\n\nEach of the 3 monthly site sessions will be observed by a member of the Implementation Resource Team (IRT) who will use a checklist to track that all core pieces of the skill training were delivered. Additionally, a PEA from a different site will observe each skill session to assess content alignment, engagement, and practice. The fourth Friday of the month the IRT will meet with the PEAs for additional training and support. These sessions will be audio recorded for qualitative data on facilitators and barriers to the skill.\n\nEach month a module in READI's learning management system (LMS) that covers that month's skill(s) will also become available. The LMS modules will contain skill-related content similar to what is taught in the skill sessions, including a thorough definition of the skill, examples of ways to utilize the skill, a review or summary of the skill, and several knowledge questions to check for comprehension. The LMS content may include text, audio, images, and video components. All READI staff will be required to complete the LMS FOREST skill module of the month, like any other required training rolled out at READI. Percentage of staff completing each LMS training will be tracked.\n\nAnnual assessments to assess primary and secondary outcomes will be administered via REDCap. Annual interviews and focus groups will ask for feedback on implementation and content."
