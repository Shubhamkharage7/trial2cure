This study enrolls participants with non-muscle invasive or muscle invasive bladder cancer with activating fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutations or fusions. Erdafitinib is a pan-FGFR inhibitor with demonstrated clinical activity when administered orally in patients with solid tumors, including bladder cancer, with FGFR genetic alterations. The Erdafitinib intravesical delivery system is designed to provide release of Erdafitinib in the bladder to treat localized bladder cancer, while reducing systemic toxicities. The study consists of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. Total duration of the study is 5 years 3 months."
