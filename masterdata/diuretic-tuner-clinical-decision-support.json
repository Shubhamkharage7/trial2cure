            "briefSummary": "This purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a mobile phone application in helping to control body swelling in patients with kidney problems. The application will help in the day to day adjustments in diuretic medication dosing.\n\nParticipants in this study will have an application loaded on to their mobile phone by the study team and be taught how to use it over a 2 hour visit. Participants will need to check their blood pressure and weight daily and enter this information into the mobile phone application every day. Participants will need to follow daily instructions in their medication dosing provided by the application. There will be periodic blood testing. This will happen at 2 weeks, 90 days, and up to 4 other times if necessary. At the end of the study there is a 2 hour study visit during which participants will answer a survey. The total length of the study is 90 days.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Population: 30 subjects with signs of hypervolemia and either nephrotic syndrome or chronic kidney disease 4 to 5.\n\nStudy Intervention: This is a nonrandomized, uncontrolled trial. The Diuretic Tuner mobile device application will be deployed in the care of hypervolemic subjects as defined in the study population. The Diuretic Tuner will integrate each subject's estimated dry weight and starting diuretic dose (both defined by healthcare provider) with daily weights and blood pressures to provide individualized guidance to the subject in day-to-day adjustments to his or her diuretic regimen. In addition, the application will generate a diary of daily weights, blood pressures, fluid intake, and medication compliance. There will be no control arm as this first phase is to test feasibility/safety.\n\nStudy Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes of interest will focus on the achievement of the provider-defined estimated dry weight (both the time to achieving this target as well as the subsequent stability in weights around this target). Secondary outcomes of interest include safety metrics (3-month hospitalization rates, rates of hypokalemia, and rates of acute kidney injury) and tool usability (assessed through surveys evaluating ease of comprehension and satisfaction)."
