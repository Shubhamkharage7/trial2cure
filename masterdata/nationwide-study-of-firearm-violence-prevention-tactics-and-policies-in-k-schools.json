            "detailedDescription": "Firearm violence in K-12 schools is a persistent public health threat in the US. The negative impact of these tragedies on children and school staff is significant. School-wide efforts (e.g. metal detectors, active shooter drills, armed school personnel, and two dozen others) to improve safety and assuage fears are being widely implemented in public K-12 schools across the US. Yet, the effectiveness of most of these strategies at deterring school shootings has never been scientifically tested. Moreover, school districts may differentially use these strategies based on factors unrelated to school safety, including as a means to discipline students. These gaps in evidence are particularly significant, as the U.S. K-12 public school system currently serves an estimated 51 million children. The proposed research team has conducted pilot and preliminary research demonstrating the feasibility of the larger study proposed here.\n\nThis will be accomplished through a nationally representative, population-based, case-control study comparing hundreds of case schools that have experienced a school shooting and randomly selected control schools that have not experienced such an event using epidemiological incidence density sampling. Case data will be ascertained primarily via the FEMA-funded Naval Postgraduate School K-12 School Shooting database. Additional databases that record and publicly report school shooting incidents will be linked and harmonized. One control school will be randomly selected from a national database of public K-12 schools at the National Center for Education Statistics and matched to each case school based on state, urban/nonurban, and elementary/middle/high school status. Both case and control schools will have a list of school safety tactics and policies that were in place, or not in the case school at the time of shooting and the control schools during same time period.\n\nPublicly accessible school safety plans and multiple publicly available secondary sources of data will be used to determine the safety strategies in place at both case and control schools during the school year before each case school's shooting event. These data will be linked to data on school suspensions and expulsions, obtained from the national Civil Rights Data Collection effort. Results will newly inform school policies and practices to reduce gun violence and promote healthy experiences for children across disparate school communities."
