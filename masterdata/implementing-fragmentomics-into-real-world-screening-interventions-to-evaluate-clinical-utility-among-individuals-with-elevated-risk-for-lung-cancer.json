            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether availability of DNA Evaluation of Fragments for Early Interception (DELFI) Lung Cancer Screening Test, FirstLook\u2122 to practicing physicians affects overall lung cancer screening rates among their patients who are recommended and eligible for screening based on 2021 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) but are not up to date with it. DELFI hypothesized that patients in the care of physicians or practice groups who have FirstLook\u2122 will have increased lung screening rates compared to patients in the care of physicians or practice groups who do not have access to FirstLook\u2122.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite compelling evidence of the benefits of lung cancer screening, rates among eligible individuals in the United States remain stubbornly low. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial, DELFI plans to evaluate whether lung screening rates can be increased if physicians and practice groups have the ability to order a validated, commercially available FirstLook\u2122 as an initial test for eligible individuals who are not up to date with lung screening recommendations."
