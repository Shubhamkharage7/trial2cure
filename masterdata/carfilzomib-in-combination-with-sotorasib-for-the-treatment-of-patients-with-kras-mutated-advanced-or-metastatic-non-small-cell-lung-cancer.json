            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of carfilzomib in combination with sotorasib in treating patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Carfilzomib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the protein complex that is responsible for degrading other damaged or unneeded proteins. The inhibition of this protein by carfilzomib can then cause tumor growth inhibition and cell death. Sotorasib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the KRAS G12C mutant. This may inhibit growth in KRAS G12C-expressing tumor cells. Combining carfilzomib and sotorasib may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of carfilzomib and sotorasib in KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC following progression on KRAS inhibitor.\n\nII. Describe the safety of the combination of carfilzomib and sotorasib in KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC following progression on KRAS inhibitor.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Describe clinical responses at all dose levels, including the recommended dose level using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.\n\nII. Describe other efficacy endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) at the recommended dose level.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the combination of carfilzomib and sotorasib.\n\nII. Explore biomarkers of response and resistance through tumor biopsies and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carfilzomib in combination with (fixed-dose) sotorasib.\n\nPatients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each cycle and sotorasib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo echocardiography (ECHO) at screening and undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and collection of blood samples at screening and on study. Patients may undergo optional biopsies on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."
