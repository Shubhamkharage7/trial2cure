Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive medications, or systemic corticosteroids (topical steroids are permitted); systemic corticosteroids must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to dosing.\n\n   Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) may be continued if the participant is on a stable dose. Non-absorbed intra-articular steroid injections will be permitted. Use of steroids as prophylactic treatment for participants with contrast allergies to diagnostic imaging contrast dyes will be permitted.\n7. Participants who require uninterrupted anticoagulants of any type or is on daily aspirin therapy or NSAIDS.\n8. Known significant chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis or active hepatitis (potential participants who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies are allowed provided they do not have active disease requiring antiviral therapy).\n9.

Participants actively receiving therapy with medications that have the potential to prolong the QT interval and the treatment cannot be either discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study intervention.\n\n    Prior/Concomitant Therapy\n14. Prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy (tumor vaccine, cytokine or growth factor given to control the cancer: systemic or IT) must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to dosing (with the exception of kinase inhibitors or other short half-life drugs, a 2-week washout is acceptable prior to treatment) and all AEs have either returned to baseline or stabilized. Note: participants who have received prior platinum therapy are eligible irrespective of their response. If participant had received one of the 3 US SOC study regimens prior to enrollment, that previous US SOC cannot be assigned in this study.\n15. Prior systemic radiation therapy (IV, intrahepatic or oral) completed at least 4 weeks prior to study intervention administration. Prior focal radiotherapy completed at least 2 weeks prior to study intervention administration.\n\n    a.
