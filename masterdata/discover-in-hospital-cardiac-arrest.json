This study aims to increase the evidence base of these components, particularly temperature control, and prognostication in post-in-hospital cardiac arrest patients. In addition to providing insights regarding immediate and long-term post-arrest care, data collected will also be useful in studying variations in cardiopulmonary resuscitation practices.\n\nThis project is endorsed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine's (SCCM) Discovery, the Critical Care Research Network."
