To establish the trial as feasible and to assess the impact upon acute gastrointestinal toxicity in the third week of pelvic radiotherapy following a hypo-fractionated schedule.\n\nSECODARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate impact upon acute urinary toxicity. II. To estimate impact upon patient reported gastrointestional toxicity. III. To assess acute quality of life following treatment. IV. To quantify acute financial toxicity following treatment. V. To assess satisfaction with decision-making following treatment. VI. To assess the overall survival throughout 3 years of post-treatment follow-up.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo hypo-fractionated radiotherapy over 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months and then at 1, 2, and 3 years."
