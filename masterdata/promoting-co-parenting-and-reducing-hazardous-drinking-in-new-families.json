Programs will be delivered prenatally and postnatally and will include both group classes and individualized sessions. A comprehensive assessment is administered during pregnancy and then at 6 and 12 months of child age. It is hypothesized that targeting intervention during the naturally motivating transition to parenthood may not only provide opportunities for long lasting behavioral change for parents, but also initiate a cascade of protective processes that ultimately reduce risk for negative emotional and behavioral outcomes for children."

The Surgency/Extraversion dimension includes approach, vocal reactivity, high intensity pleasure, smiling and laughter, activity level, and perceptual sensitivity. The Negative Affectivity dimension includes sadness, distress to limitations, fear, and low falling reactivity. The Orienting/Regulation dimension includes low intensity pleasure, cuddliness, duration of orienting, and soothability. Scores range from 1-7 and higher scores on each dimension reflect higher surgency, negative affect, and regulation. Average of maternal and paternal scores on these three broad dimensions will be included as the final outcome measures.",
