Participants with recurrent or persistent clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) will be treated with the investigational combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nThe names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Lenvatinib\n* Pembrolizumab\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Participants will be followed for 36 months thereafter. It is expected that about 31 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drugs work in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved lenvatinib or pembrolizumab for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses."

Participants must be able to swallow oral medications. Participants with an enteric tube (e.g. gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube), receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or dependent on IV fluid support are ineligible.\n* Participants with significant cardiovascular impairment, including uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Grade II or above, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, or serious cardiac arrhythmia within the past 6 months.\n* Resting corrected QT interval (QTc) interval using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) \\>450 ms for males or \\>470 ms for females.\"\n* Clinically significant bleeding within 4 weeks of beginning study treatment.\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment (e.g. use of steroids, immunosuppressive medications, or disease modifying agents) within the past 2 years.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency.\n* Is known to be positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Subjects with HIV, including those on antiretroviral therapy, are excluded due to risk of immunodeficiency and risk of overlapping hepatotoxicity between antiretroviral agents and lenvatinib.\n* Is known to be positive for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Participants are eligible if they have a history of HCV infection that has been treated and cured, with an undetectable viral load.\n* History of allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* History of non-infectious pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids, or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to active infection and serious non-healing wounds or ulcers.\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, or any of the study drug excipients.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab and/or lenvatinib are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab and/or lenvatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with either agent.",
