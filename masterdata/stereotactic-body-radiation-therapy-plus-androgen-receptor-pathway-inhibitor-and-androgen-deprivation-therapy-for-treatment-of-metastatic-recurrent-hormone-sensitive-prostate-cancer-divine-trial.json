            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effects of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and the timing of treatment with androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in treating patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer that has spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic), and that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body (except the brain). The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses given over several days. This type of radiation therapy helps spare normal tissue. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate cells. ADT lowers the amount of androgen made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need androgen to grow. Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors work by blocking the effects of androgen to stop the growth and spread of tumor cells. Giving SBRT alone with watchful waiting may be as effective in treating prostate cancer as giving SBRT together with ARPI and ADT.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate and compare modified radiographic progression-free survival (mrPFS) in patients with metachronous recurrent oligometastatic prostate cancer treated with SBRT and 6 months ADT/ARPI followed by watchful wait (Group A) versus SBRT followed by watchful wait (Group B).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate and compare overall survival (OS) between two treatment groups. II. To evaluate and compare biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) between two treatment groups.\n\nIII. To evaluate and compare time to local progression between two treatment groups.\n\nIV. To evaluate and compare time to distant progression between two treatment groups.\n\nV. To evaluate the toxicity profile of 6 months of ADT/ARPI as assessed per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate and compare castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival between two treatment groups NOTE: CRPC-free survival: radiographic progression-free survival with castrate-level testosterone (\\< 50ng/mL).\n\nII. Determine the efficacy of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a minimal residual disease (MRD) marker.\n\nIII. Determine the efficacy of EVs as an early indicator of disease relapse. IV. Characterize duration of response. V. Determine whether early ADT and ARPI hasten CRPC. VI. Determine how circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) compares as a biomarker to EVs.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP A: Patients undergo SBRT and receive ARPI (abiraterone and prednisone, apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide) and ADT (leuprolide, triptorelin, histrelin, goserelin, degarelix, or relugolix). Cycles repeat every 4 months (16 weeks) for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo watchful waiting thereafter until disease progression.\n\nGROUP B: Patients undergo SBRT with watchful waiting. Cycles repeat every 4 months (16 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAdditionally, patients undergo blood sample collection and positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or bone scan.\n\nUpon completion of study interventions patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years."
