In Part 1, patients are enrolled into different cohort doses in order to identify the appropriate recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Part 2, participants with metastatic / unresectable Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) will receive the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) established in Part 1 of the study.
