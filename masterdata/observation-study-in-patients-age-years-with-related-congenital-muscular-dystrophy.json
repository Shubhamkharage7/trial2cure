            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to understand how young children with LAMA2-related dystrophy move and change over time. We will also learn about how this condition impacts other body systems.\n\nParticipants will undergo:\n\n* Neuromuscular assessments\n* Blood collections\n* Swallowing and breathing assessments\n* Questionnaires",
            "detailedDescription": "READY CMD LAMA2 is a Pre-Phase 1, single-arm, multicenter, prospective natural history clinical study to evaluate the natural history and potential early outcome measures in subjects with laminin \u03b12-related dystrophy (LAMA2-RD) aged 0-5 years. The study seeks to enroll 44 subjects across 14 sites. NCH will enroll 10 subjects.\n\nSubjects will complete in-clinic visits at Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24. Within two weeks of these visits, a remote visit will be performed to repeat and compare remote outcomes with in-person outcomes. A phone call will also be made by the coordinator to capture adverse events (AEs) at months 3, 9, 15, and 21. Remote visits via videoconference may be conducted at Months 3, 9, 15, 21.\n\nThe total duration for each subject is up to 24 months.\n\nAll subjects will have functional assessments including the evaluation of motor milestones at each visit. Evaluation of milestones lost or gained will be according to the Motor Milestone Checklist, unless otherwise specified. Assessment of all functional testing will be captured by video.\n\nPhysical assessments to be performed will depend on the subject's age and may include the following:\n\n* Assessment of motor milestones (maintained, lost or acquired)\n* Neuromuscular Gross Motor Outcome (GRO)\n* Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND)\n* Motor Function Measure (MFM-20)\n* Bayley-4\n* Respiratory assessments: transcutaneous capnography and collection of data on use of non- invasive ventilation and other respiratory support\n* Swallow/oromotor assessment (To be performed by Speech therapist at bedside)\n\nOther assessments:\n\n* Growth parameters \\[head circumference, height, weight, body mass index (BMI)\\]\n* Mode of feeding\n* Peds Quality of Life (PedsQL) Neuromuscular Module\n* Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), physician and parent/caregiver assessed\n* Blood samples will be collected from subjects and stored for biomarker and other research purposes\n\nAEs will be collected and assessed for a potential relationship to participation in this study.\n\nThe total duration of the study for each subject is up to approximately 24 months. A subject will be considered to have competed the study if he/she has completed all assessments up to and including Month 24 assessments. The end of the study is defined as the date of completion of the last scheduled assessment shown in the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures for the last subject in the study.\n\nSubjects who prematurely discontinue study participation will be encouraged to complete an End-of- Study Visit to include assessment of motor milestones and recording of AEs."
