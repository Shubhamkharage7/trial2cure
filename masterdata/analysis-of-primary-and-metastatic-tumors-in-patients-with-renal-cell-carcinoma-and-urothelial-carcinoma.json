The histology and genomic analysis of the pre-treatment and metastatic samples from the same patient would be used to find out the changes that may have lead to metastasis. Also, metastatic samples from ICB naive patients would be collected and compared with those from ICB treated patients to find out if the metastasis in treated patients was due to development of reistance."
