Furthermore, the long-term goal of this research proposal is to understand the natural history of meniscal root tears and their subsequent repair, in order to better determine risk factors for inferior outcomes and progression to osteoarthritis (OA).",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a pragmatic design, parallel group, randomized clinical trial in which 140 subjects with a diagnosed medial meniscus root tear based on MRI and confirmed intra-operatively will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. The first group (ARM 1) will be treated non-operatively with analgesics, physical therapy, and will be kept non-weight bearing for 6 weeks (to match the postoperative protocol). If no subjective improvement is seen at 3 months, crossover will be allowed to a transtibial medial meniscal root repair (acute operative pathway (ARM 2) (CONSORT Flow Diagram)) as determined by 3 month patient reported outcomes (PROs and operating study physician approval.\n\nThe second group (ARM 2) will be treated acutely with a transtibial medial meniscus root repair and will be non-weight bearing for 6 weeks as well. A previously published protocol will be used to standardize the rehabilitation. (14) Subjects will be followed with patient reported outcomes, serial radiographs (3 views), and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at 12 months to determine repair status, meniscal extrusion, and presence of degenerative changes. Subjects who crossover at 3 months will be evaluated using additional MRI imaging prior to assignment to the acute operative meniscal root repair pathway (ARM 2). These subjects will crossover from ARM 1 to ARM 2 without first performing the ARM 1, 3 month radiograph (x-rays-3 views). The 3-month radiograph (x-rays-3 views) will be performed 3 months post-operative."
