            "detailedDescription": "This will be a single-dose study, in normal participants and in those with current retinal pathology, investigating feasibility of the investigational dye, MB-102, for use in fluorescent angiography compared to fluorescein sodium. Safety and tolerability of MB-102 will also be evaluated. Control dye fluorescein sodium will be administered intravenously a minimum of 3 days prior to MB-102 dosing. After IV administration of dyes, images will be acquired of both eyes with a Zeiss fundus camera (and for some participants additional fundus photography will be performed with clinically-approved ocular angiography imaging systems) by a trained ophthalmic photographer. Participants will return for a follow-up visit after MB-102 dosing for further physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and reporting of any adverse events. Photographs will be examined for quality as well as the utility of the angiography in evaluating disease diagnosis and progression."
