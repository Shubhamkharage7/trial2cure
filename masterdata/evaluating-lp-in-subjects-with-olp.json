A total of approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled at approximately eight (8) study sites in the United States. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of LP-10 at 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg of tacrolimus.The study consists of screening, treatment and follow-up phases. The treatment phase includes 10 mL LP-10 oral rinse for 3 minutes twice a day for 4 weeks. The follow-up phase includes one post-treatment visit 2 weeks after the last oral LP-10 dose."
