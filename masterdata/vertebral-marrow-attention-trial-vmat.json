A CT simulation scan is obtained with the patient in the treatment position allowing the radiation oncologist to delineate intended tumor targets and organs at risk (OAR). Using specialized treatment planning software, a radiation plan is generated with the goal of maximizing tumor coverage with intended prescription dose and minimizing unintended radiation dose to OARs below established thresholds. The primary intervention of this trial will be sparing the thoracic bone marrow. This will be done by delineating the thoracic bone marrow on the CT simulation scan and applying vertebral marrow-specific OAR constraints during treatment planning to optimally spare radiation dose to this structure during treatment",
