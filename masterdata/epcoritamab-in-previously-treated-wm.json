Patients with history of CNS malignancy from separate malignancy must have completed CNS-directed therapy and must currently have no evidence of disease\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women or participants unwilling to adhere to institutional guidelines for highly effective contraception for the duration of the therapy are excluded. This is because of the unknown but potential risk of teratogenic or abortifacient effects, as well as potential for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, as epcoritamab has not yet been studied in this patient population. A female can be determined to not be of childbearing potential if she meets any of the following criteria:\n\n  * Premenarchal\n  * Postmenopausal (\\>45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 12 months or any age with amenorrhea for at least 6 months and a serum follicle stimulating hormone \\[FSH\\] level \\>40 IU/L or mIU/mL)\n  * Permanently sterilized (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion \\[which includes tubal ligation procedures as consistent with local regulations\\], hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the trial (e.g., woman who is not heterosexually active becomes active, premenarchal woman experiences menarche) a woman must begin a highly effective method of birth control, as described under 3.1.13.\n* Known current alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric illness, or unstable social situation that is likely to limit compliance with study requirements\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to epcoritamab\n* Exposure to a live or a live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks",
