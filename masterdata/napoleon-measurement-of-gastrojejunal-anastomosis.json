The study population is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients with weight regain undergoing an endoscopy at Bellevue Hospital Center or Brigham and Women's Hospital. investigators aim for a sample size of up to 100 cases. For each case, endoscopists will first visually estimate the diameter of the GJA by comparing its size to the upper endoscope. Then, they will measure the GJA with Napoleon. Investigators will compare the GJA measurements performed using visual estimation and Napoleon. A survey will be given to all endoscopists to assess the level of ease using Napoleon."
