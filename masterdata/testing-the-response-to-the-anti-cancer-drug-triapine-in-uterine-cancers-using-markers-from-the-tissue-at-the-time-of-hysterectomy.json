            "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial investigates the response to the anti-cancer drug, triapine, in uterine cancers by using markers from tissue samples at the time of removal of the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes (hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Triapine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Adding triapine to the usual approach of surgery followed by chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiation therapy may help to slow the growth of uterine cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine whether intravenous (IV) triapine 25 mg/m\\^2 will induce cell cycle arrest as measured by phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) in uterine serous adenocarcinoma cells removed at the time of hysterectomy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine whether a preoperative dose of intravenous triapine 25 mg/m\\^2 can be safely given prior to hysterectomy and staging for uterine serous adenocarcinoma.\n\nII. Determine whether changes in cyclin D/E and Ki-67 protein expression are detectable using immunohistochemistry pre- and post-triapine treatment in uterine serous adenocarcinomas.\n\nIII. Evaluate plasma and tissue triapine concentrations.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of using single-cell transcriptome analysis to quantify changes in gene expression following triapine treatment and to evaluate their concordance with immunohistochemistry (IHC) endpoints of cell cycle arrest.\n\nII. Identify genomic variants of uterine serous adenocarcinoma (including but not limited to p53) with treatment response to ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors such as triapine using whole exome sequencing (WES).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive triapine IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients then undergo surgical resection and tissue collection 6-8 hours after the initiation of the triapine infusion. Patients also undergo biopsy and collection of blood samples on study."
