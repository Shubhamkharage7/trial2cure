These results will be compared to existing laboratory-based methods for determining red blood cell damage to predict CPB assist device safety. Further, results from the studies described in this proposal will help develop therapeutic strategies to benefit patients by early detection of pfH and clearance protein levels that occur during CPB.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cost estimates for brain, lung, cardiac, and kidney complications following complex cardiac surgeries that require a medical assist device to by-pass the heart and lungs (cardiopulmonary bypass, CPB) is estimated to cost $80 million per individual states in the US over a ten-year period. These extra costs represent a significant burden on the healthcare system but could be reduced by understanding how medical assist devices lead to organ injury associated with complex cardiac surgeries. The primary goals of this research are to (1) understand how hemoglobin released into plasma (pfH) from damaged red blood cells that passage through CPB contributes to organ injury. (2) Determine the amount of pfH necessary to cause organ injury. (3) Determine the concentration changes in protective proteins (called haptoglobin, hemopexin and transferrin) that remove pfH and its degradation products from the circulation. (4) Design a computer-based model that will determine the levels of pfH and protective proteins to predict the potential for organ injury. By studying the dynamics of red blood cell lysis, pfH, protective proteins and organ injury limits will be set for safe levels of pfH following the use of CPB. These results will be compared to existing laboratory-based methods for determining red blood cell damage to predict CPB assist device safety.
