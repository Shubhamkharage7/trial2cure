This program (ARAMIS Hep) will combine minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approaches (robotic OR laparoscopic), enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, and Telehealth to liberalize discharge criteria in a safe manner.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nIn addition to demonstrating a reduction in LOS, our study will also provide preliminary data to aid in the broader implementation of this approach. Specifically, we will gain insight into the patient experience, measure patient-reported outcomes on recovery trajectories, and understand barriers to integrating a novel pathway into existing institutional frameworks."
