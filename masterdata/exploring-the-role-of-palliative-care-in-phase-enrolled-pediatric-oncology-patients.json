PRPs can opt to complete interviews immediately or at a scheduled date that is convenient to the PRP."

Broad thematic domains will be identified through a rigorous review of transcript data, with the development of codes to delineate conceptual categories. Domains will be further sub-stratified as text analysis progresses in order to identify new themes and formulate new concepts and theories. To enhance construct validity and reliability of identified domains, data will be audited by an expert panel of PPC investigators with proficiency in communication-based research, including both clinicians and researchers. Coding schemata will remain flexible to accommodate expansion of the list as the PI and expert panel agree on new code additions. Following the well-described processes of disassembling and reassembling coding categories, emerging themes will be categorized and refined, with the ultimate goal of theory-building.",
