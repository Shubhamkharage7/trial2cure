This study was developed to help patients cope after a brain tumor diagnosis. The main question this study aims to answer is whether this intervention (which includes access to an information guide and one-on-one coaching sessions) is feasible (i.e., possible to carry out) and acceptable (i.e., considered helpful) to patients. Participants will be asked to take part in the coaching sessions, use the guide as desired, and complete a small group of short surveys at three different points in time; some participants will be asked to share feedback via exit interviews.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be a prospective pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, population-specific intervention designed to help patients with recently-diagnosed malignant brain tumors process and cope with their illness.\n\nThe specific aims are to 1) refine the NeuroPathways intervention based on feedback from an open pilot study (n=up to 10) with exit interviews, 2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of NeuroPathways in a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=40), and 3) explore preliminary effects of the intervention on psychological, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes."
