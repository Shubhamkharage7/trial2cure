            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of the study drugs ribociclib and everolimus to treat pediatric and young adult patients newly diagnosed with a high-grade glioma (HGG), including DIPG, that have genetic changes in pathways (cell cycle, PI3K/mTOR) that these drugs target.\n\nThe main question the study aims to answer is whether the combination of ribociclib and everolimus can prolong the life of patients diagnosed with HGG, including DIPG.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, international, phase II study of post-radiotherapy (RT) combination of ribociclib and everolimus to treat pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients newly diagnosed with HGG and DIPG that harbor alterations of the cell cycle and/or PI3K/mTOR pathways to assess treatment efficacy (Part 2). The study will include a feasibility cohort (Part 1) to identify the dose of ribociclib PfOS (Powder for Oral Suspension) that is safe and tolerable in combination with everolimus. Efficacy for Part 2 study will be defined by progression-free survival (PFS; HGG \\[stratum A\\]) and Overall Survival (OS; DIPG \\[stratum B\\]), with key longitudinal biomarker correlatives. Outcomes among patients with primary thalamic, spinal cord, and/or secondary (radiation related) HGG (strata C) will be descriptively analyzed. Objective radiographic response rates and agent-specific toxicities will also be assessed, with a feasibility cohort to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus in patients with metastatic disease who received upfront craniospinal irradiation (stratum D).\n\nProtocol therapy with the maintenance combination of ribociclib and everolimus must begin no later than 35 calendar days post-completion of RT. The earliest patients can begin protocol treatment is 28 calendar days post-completion of RT. Each cycle will be 28 days in duration and treatment can continue up to a total of 26 cycles. Ribociclib will be given orally once daily for 3 weeks (days 1-21), with one week off. Everolimus will be given orally daily continuously (days 1-28)."

The earliest patients can begin protocol treatment is 28 calendar days post-completion of RT.\n\n2.4) Organ Function Requirements\n\n2.4.1) Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined as:\n\n* Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1000/mm3\n* Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Hemoglobin \\>8 g/dL (may be transfused)\n\n2.4.2) Adequate Renal Function Defined as:\n\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR \u2265 70ml/min/1.73 m2 OR\n* Maximum serum creatinine based on (Schwartz et al. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) age/gender as follows: 1 to \\< 2 years=0.6 mg/dL for males and females; 2 to \\< 6 years=0.8 mg/dL for males and females; 6 to \\< 10 years= 1.0 mg/dL for males and females; 10 to \\< 13 years=1.2 mg/dL for males and females. 13 to \\< 16 years=1.5 mg/dL for males and 1.4 mg/dL for females.\n\n2.4.3) Adequate Liver Function Defined as:\n\n* Total bilirubin must be \u2264 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal for age\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u2264 3 times institutional upper limit of normal\n* Serum albumin \u2265 2g/dL\n\n2.4.4) Adequate Cardiac Function Defined as:\n\n* Ejection fraction of \u2265 50% by echocardiogram\n* QTc \u2264 450 msec (by Bazett formula)\n\n2.4.5) Adequate Neurologic Function Defined as: Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if well-controlled on anticonvulsants that are not strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5.\n\n2.4.6) Adequate Pulmonary Function Defined as: No evidence of dyspnea at rest, and a pulse oximetry \\>94% on room air if there is clinical indication for determination.\n\n2.5) Informed Consent: All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign a written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines\n\n2.6) Contraception: Male and female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective contraception method.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Pregnant or Breast-Feeding Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to known potential risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must agree to use at least one highly effective method of contraception while being treated on this study and for 3 months after completing therapy. A woman is considered of childbearing potential if she is fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy. Male participants should refrain from sperm donation throughout the duration of treatment and for 3 months after completion of therapy\n\n   A highly effective contraception method is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (\\<1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The following are considered highly effective contraception methods:\n   * Combined estrogen and progesterone containing hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.\n   * Progesterone-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.\n   * Intra Uterine Device (IUD)\n   * Intra Uterine hormone releasing system\n   * Bilateral tubal occlusion\n   * Vasectomized partner\n   * Sexual abstinence (avoiding having heterosexual intercourse) The following contraceptive measures are NOT considered effective\n   * Progesterone-only hormonal contraception (birth control pill) that that does NOT stop ovulation\n   * Male or female condom with or without spermicide\n   * Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide\n2. Concomitant Medications\n\n   * Patients receiving corticosteroids are eligible. The use of corticosteroids must be reported.\n   * Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible.\n   * Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible, with the exception of temozolomide given concurrently with RT only.\n   * Patients who are receiving enzyme inducing anticonvulsants that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 are not eligible.\n   * Patients who are receiving strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 are not eligible and should be avoided from 14 days prior to enrollment to the end of the study.\n   * Patients who are receiving medications known to prolong QTc interval are not eligible.\n   * Patients who are receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin or other coumadin-derived anticoagulants are not eligible. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux is allowed as long as the patient has adequate coagulation defined as aPTT \\< 1.5Xs ULN and INR \\< 1.5.\n3. Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.\n4. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.\n5. Patients with known clinically significant active malabsorption syndrome or other condition that could affect absorption are not eligible.\n6. Patients with prior or ongoing clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could affect the safety of the subject, or could impair the assessment of study results are not eligible.",
