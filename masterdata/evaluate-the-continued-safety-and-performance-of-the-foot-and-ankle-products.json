To evaluate performance, physical exam and imaging of the target area of the body will be evaluated at three months postoperative. Additionally, patient reported outcomes will be evaluated at three months postoperative, six months postoperative and one year postoperative using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) and Foot and Ankle Ability Measures (FAAM)."
