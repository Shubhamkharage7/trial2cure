Inhibition of the IL-17A pathway can slow or reverse the inflammation causing airway narrowing in patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis. This would have a significant impact on quality of life for patients living with this diagnosis as it may help them to avoid frequent surgical procedures, recoveries and associated costs.\n\nThis is a single arm, open-label study where all participants will receive drug. The study population is patients with a documented diagnosis of idiopathic subglottic stenosis who are followed at Yale New Haven Hospital."

First, all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.
