            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of an interactive counselor -led online family skills training as part of a behavioral weight loss program for Black Adults.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nearly half (49.9%) of Black adults in the United States live with obesity. Black adults are underrepresented in standard behavioral weight loss (BWL) interventions and experience sub-optimal weight loss outcomes when included in such programs. Cultural adaptations to BWL interventions that recognize the family behavioral context and address the cultural value of family among Black populations are needed to improve weight loss outcomes. Prior research, including our randomized controlled pilot, Together, Eating and Activity, Matter Plus (TEAM+), have incorporated family skills training to enhance family involvement, targeting cohesion and communication, in addition to core weight loss curriculum. However, family inclusion in weight loss interventions can result in additional barriers to retention and adherence.\n\nTechnology has become an attractive delivery format to increase reach to at-risk populations, as a well-designed online program can address issues of timely access and geographical location (or distance from program sites), which are linked to low retention of Black participants. However, technology uptake among Blacks populations still lags due to mistrust, skepticism, concerns about confidentiality, privacy, and remote interaction with staff. Increases in acceptance and utilization of telemedicine and mobile-health were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the time and location burden already associated with behavioral weight loss sessions, it is important to identify strategies to increase access that are both feasible and acceptable in the target population. Currently the feasibility and acceptability of an online family dyadic skills training is unknown among Black adults.\n\nTEAM+ is an in-person 3-month family enhanced BWL intervention designed for Black adults consisting of a family dyadic skills training and core behavioral weight loss sessions. For this proposed pilot study, 20 black adults interested in weight loss will be recruited with a family member committed to attending both the skills training and core sessions. Participants must 1) be \u226518 years of age, 2) self-identify as Black/African American, 3) reside in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill area, and 4) have internet access. The core sessions will be delivered in person. To test the feasibility and acceptability of an interactive counselor-led online training, the family dyadic skills training will be delivered online using a web-conferencing platform (e.g., Zoom)."
