A total of 40 participants aged 50+ with high-impact chronic pain will be randomized to intervention or control groups. The STEP-UP intervention will feature an educational podcast series teaching core pain self-management skills. Podcasts will be supplemented by sessions with a Community Health Worker taking place at designated times over a 7-week period. The Community Health Worker will guide participants in a modified Patient Priorities of Care approach to help them identify their values and priorities and develop goals that reflect these."
