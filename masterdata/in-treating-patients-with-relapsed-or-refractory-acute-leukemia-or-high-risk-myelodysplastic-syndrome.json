ONC201 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine recommended phase II dose for oral ONC201 (\\[Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201) alone in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). (Phase I) II. To identify toxicities associated with oral ONC201 alone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, MDS or ALL. (Phase I) III. To determine the objective response rate to ONC201 alone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, MDS or ALL. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral ONC201 alone. (Phase I) II. To observe the anti-tumor effects of oral ONC201 alone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, MDS or ALL. (Phase I) III. Confirm tolerability of recommended phase II dose. (Phase II) IV. Assess clinical outcomes associated with ONC201 alone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, MDS or ALL. (Phase II) V. Correlate clinical outcome with tumor and serum biomarkers. (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 5 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 orally (PO) once every 3 weeks. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 PO once every week. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM C: Patients receive Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 PO on the first two consecutive days of every week. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM D: Patients receive Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 PO once daily (QD). Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM E: Patients receive Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 PO twice weekly. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days."
