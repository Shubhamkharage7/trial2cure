History of other malignancies, with the exception of: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, adequately treated superficial bladder cancer, stage 1 or 2 malignancies who are without evidence of disease, or other cancers curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \\> 5 years from enrollment.\n5. Blood pressure that is not controlled despite \\> 2 oral agents (SBP \\>160 and DBP \\>90 documented during the screening period with no subsequent blood pressure readings \\>160/100).\n6. History of seizure disorder or active use of anticonvulsants. Medications used to treat neuropathic pain such as gabapentin or pregabalin are allowed.\n7. Documented history of or current brain metastases due to seizure risk\n8. Serious intercurrent infections or non-malignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled.\n9. Active psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with protocol requirements.\n10. NYHA class II, NYHA class III, or IV congestive heart failure (any symptomatic heart failure).\n11. Concurrent therapy with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 (See Section 9.12below for list of strong inhibitor or inducers) due to concerning possible drug-drug interactions\n12.
