Assess the safety and feasibility of administering virus specific-CTLs from haploidentical donors in transplant patients both solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with CMV/AdV infection despite standard therapy.\n\nOUTLINE:Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 Cohorts.\n\nCOHORT A: Patients receive allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes intravenously (IV). Patients undergo blood, urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and bronchoalveolar fluid sample collection on the trial.\n\nCOHORT B: Patients receive allogeneic adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T Lymphocytes IV. Patients undergo blood, urine, saliva, CSF, and bronchoalveolar fluid sample collection on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 year."
