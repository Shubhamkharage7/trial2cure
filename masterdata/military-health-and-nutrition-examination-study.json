This cross-sectional study will assess, in a large, diverse sample of Army Service Members (n=600), food and supplement intake, cardiovascular health, body composition, biomarkers of nutritional status, measures of health status, injury prevalence, mental wellbeing, gut microbiome composition, and physical performance outcomes. The proposed study is modeled after the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and customized for the Army population.",

Collecting such data will allow for assessment of disease prevalence and health status, provide novel descriptive information, and examine relationships between health and nutrition variables that are currently unavailable on the Army active-duty population.\n\nStudy Aim: To assess, in a large, diverse sample of Army Service Members, dietary intake, nutritional status, cardiovascular health, body composition, metabolic biomarkers of nutritional state, and other measures of health status."
