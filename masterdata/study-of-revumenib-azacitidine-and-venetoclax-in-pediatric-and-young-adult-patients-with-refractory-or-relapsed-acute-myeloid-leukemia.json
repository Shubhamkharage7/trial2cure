            "detailedDescription": "Patients will receive revumenib + azacitidine + venetoclax in a dose-escalation fashion. The doses of revumenib and azacitidine will remain constant, while the duration of exposure to venetoclax will be escalated or de-escalated. Patients may continue to receive therapy if there is clinical benefit and no unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients who achieve complete response (CR) or Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) and subsequently undergo hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) may remain on study. Revumenib, with or without azacitidine and venetoclax, may be resumed after transplant if the patient is at least 60 days post-transplant, remains in CR or CRi, has engrafted, and does not have Grade \u22652 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). In the absence of toxicity, revumenib may be continued for a maximum of 12 months.\n\nPatients are followed for 30 days after completion of study treatment."

In addition, all toxicities must have resolved to grade 1 or less.\n* Patients must have a leukocyte count \\<25,000 cells/uL. Low-dose therapy, such as hydroxyurea or cytarabine as described above, to achieve this limit is acceptable.\n* For patients who have received prior HCT, there can be no evidence of GVHD and greater than 60 days must have elapsed since the HCT, and patients should be off calcineurin inhibitors for at least 28 days prior to the start of protocol therapy. Physiologic prednisone for the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is acceptable..\n* Patients must be taking posaconazole or voriconazole, which must be started at least 24 hours prior to the start of therapy.\n* Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception for the duration of study participation.\n* Patients must be able to swallow tablets.\n\nPatients who meet the criteria listed above are eligible for enrollment and treatment on the trial. However, patients in first relapse who are suitable for and willing to receive intensive remission induction therapy should be offered such therapy if deemed appropriate by the treating physician.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible.\n* Patients with Down syndrome, acute promyelocytic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or bone marrow failure syndromes are not eligible.\n* Patients with uncontrolled infection are not eligible.
