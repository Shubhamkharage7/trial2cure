            "briefSummary": "This is an open-label Phase II trial that will investigate the use of neoadjuvant CAPEOX chemotherapy with Atezolizumab followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with localized resectable pMMR adenocarcinoma of the colon with a target accrual of 30 patients.\n\nThe investigators will explore if appropriately timed neoadjuvant CAPEOX with anti-PD-L1 mAb (Atezolizumab) can be administered safely and feasibly for 12 weeks, and that this combination will lead to improved clinical response associated with enhanced numbers of immune cells in surgically resected colon tumors.\n\nParticipants will receive 4 cycles of atezolizumab in combination with 4 cycles of CAPEOX (atezolizumab will be administered prior to chemotherapy) before standard of care surgical resection. Each cycle of neoadjuvant therapy is 3 weeks. Following surgery, participants still considered to be at high-risk of recurrence (per NCCN guidelines) will receive further adjuvant chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or CAPEOX),for 6 and 4 cycles respectively (for a total of 12 weeks), based on the discretion of the treating oncologist/investigator.\n\nParticipants will be followed up for an EFFICACY follow-up phase every 2 months during the first 6 months after surgery (months 1, 3, 6) and thereafter participants will enter a SURVIVAL follow-up phase and will be seen every 6 months starting at month 12 until month 36. During this the efficacy and survival follow up visits blood samples will be obtained for purposes of obtaining circulating DNA and stool and optional blood samples for storage for future exploratory analysis. Additionally, during these follow up visits, participants will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires",
            "detailedDescription": "Once participants' eligibility has been confirmed, and participants have been registered in the study, the participants will receive immunotherapy treatment with Atezolizumab, followed by administration of CAPEOX chemotherapy for a total of four cycles. Each cycle is 3 weeks; a total of four cycles will be administered and must be completed within 15 weeks. Participants will receive growth factor support at the treating physician's discretion.\n\nParticipants will receive 4 cycles (one cycle every 3 weeks) of Atezolizumab along with 4 cycles (one cycle every3 weeks) of CAPEOX before surgery. Atezolizumab will be initiated starting with Cycle 1 Day 1 (during first chemotherapy session). Trial intervention(s) should begin on the day of enrollment (the process of registering or entering a patient into a clinical trial) or as close as possible to the date on which intervention is allocated/assigned.\n\nFollowing surgery, the treating investigator will monitor and determine the risk of disease recurrence (the risk of the cancer coming back) after surgery. In addition, investigators will collect a series of blood sample collections called ctDNA monitoring assay. This blood test will be specific to each participant, and it may indicate if more chemotherapy is needed after surgery. In case participants' ctDNA test comes back as positive (+) at any point, the investigators will discuss with participant about the possibility of receiving further chemotherapy for an additional 12 weeks. This chemotherapy regimen will be either mFOLFOX6 (every 2 weeks for a total of 6 cycles= 12 weeks) or CAPEOX chemotherapy (every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles= 12 weeks). Toxicities (undesirable effects of medications) for Atezolizumab and CAPEOX will be continuously monitored to make sure their side effects are in line with prior experience of their use, individually or combined.\n\nRe-Staging Staging is a way to describe a cancer. The cancer's stage tells the investigators where a cancer is located and its size, how far it has grown into nearby tissues, and if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes (a small bean-shaped structure that is part of the body's immune system) or other parts of the body.\n\nFor this study, the investigators will order for participants to have a Computerized Tomography (CT), a series of X-ray images taken from different angles, or a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues in the body, done before any intervention, with the purpose of staging the cancer, determining if it is removable by surgery.\n\nRestaging with the same method of imaging used to meet initial eligibility requirements, including either contrast-enhanced CT or MRI (for patients with an intravenous contrast allergy) must be performed 2-4 weeks following completion of chemotherapy. All re-staging imaging will be centrally reviewed for assessment of resectability (to determine if the cancer can be removed).\n\nSURGERY After participants have recovered sufficiently from any adverse effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and still have removable cancer on re-staging, the investigator should proceed to surgery at the participating site within 8 weeks following completion of chemotherapy.\n\nADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY Following surgery, the treating investigator will monitor and determine the risk of disease recurrence (the risk of the cancer coming back) after surgery. In addition, the investigators will collect a series of blood sample collections called ctDNA monitoring assay. This blood test will be specific to each participant, and it may indicate if more chemotherapy is needed after surgery. In case participants' ctDNA test comes back as positive (+) at any point, the investigator will discuss with participants about the possibility of receiving further chemotherapy for an additional 12 weeks. This chemotherapy regimen will be either mFOLFOX6 (every 2 weeks for a total of 6 cycles= 12 weeks) or CAPEOX chemotherapy (every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles= 12 weeks).\n\nFOLLOW UP VISITS Participants will be followed up for an efficacy follow-up phase every 2 months during the first 6 months after surgery (months 1, 3, 6), and thereafter they will enter a survival follow-up phase and will be seen every 6 months starting at month 12 until month 36. During these visits the investigators are going to monitor participants blood for ctDNA analysis and whole blood samples (for future research analysis), vital status updates, quality of life questionnaires, routine laboratory assessments, and standard of care imaging.\n\nAll screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria."

underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high-potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n\n  * Active tuberculosis\n  * Significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class II or greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident) within 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment, unstable arrhythmia, or unstable angina\n  * Major surgical procedure, other than for diagnosis, within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the study\n  * History of malignancy other than colon adenocarcinoma within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS rate \\> 90%), such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non melanoma skin carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, Stage I uterine cancer or colonic polyps\n  * Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia, or any active infection that could impact patient safety\n  * Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., to prevent a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) are eligible for the study.\n  * Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n  * Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n  * Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab\n  * Current treatment with anti-viral therapy for HBV\n  * Synchronous primary rectal and/ or colon cancers or history of prior invasive colon malignancy, regardless of disease-free interval.\n  * Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n  * Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies\n  * Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 \\[IL-2\\]) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment\n  * Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF- agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\nPatients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study.\n\nPatients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n\n* History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab formulation\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the CAPEOX or mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy formulations\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment or within 5 months for Atezolizumab and 6 months for any chemotherapy regimen after the final dose of study
