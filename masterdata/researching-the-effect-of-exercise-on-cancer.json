The purpose of this study is to explore how aerobic exercise (exercise that stimulates and strengthens the heart and lungs and improves the body's use of oxygen) can reduce the level of ctDNA found in the blood. During the study, the highest level of exercise that is practical, is safe, and has positive effects on the body that may prevent the return of cancer (including a decrease in ctDNA levels) will be found. Each level of exercise tested will be a certain number of minutes each week. Once the best level of exercise is found, it will be tested further in a new group of participants. All participants in this study will have been previously treated for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer."
