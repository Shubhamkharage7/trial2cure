            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational patient registry is to learn how expert centers treat patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). CTEPH is a condition in which blood clots block the blood vessels in the lungs. There are currently three treatment options for patients with CTEPH:\n\n* surgery to remove blood clots from large vessels in the lungs (pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA))\n* the use of a small balloon to unblock smaller blood vessels (balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA))\n* drugs\n\nPatients can also receive a combination of these treatments.\n\nThe main question this registry aims to answer are:\n\n* How many patients receive a given kind of treatment?\n* How do expert centers combine the different treatments?\n* Are patients doing better after they receive a given kind of treatment?\n* How many patients are alive 1, 3 and 5 years after they receive a given kind of treatment?\n\nParticipants will receive the same treatments that they would receive if they did not participate in the study. During the study, patients will visit their doctors as they would do normally. The doctors will collect information on the patients' health and enter it into the study database. The follow-up time will be at least 3 years for all patients."
