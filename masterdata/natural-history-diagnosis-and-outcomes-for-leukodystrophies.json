Affected patients face additional serious medical complications including epilepsy, developmental regression, and intellectual disabilities. Diagnosis is difficult and requires the assistance of a specialist. Finally, identifying treatments and improving outcomes is complex.\n\nThe Western Leukodystrophy Project, which is part of the University of Utah and of Primary Children's Hospital, and which is a certified Leukodystrophy Care Network Center, provides a specialized resource for patients with leukodystrophies.\n\nThis clinical study assists with diagnosis of leukodystrophies; suggesting treatment options and implementing care guidelines, and improving outcomes for all patients by understanding the clinical histories and outcomes of affected patients.."
