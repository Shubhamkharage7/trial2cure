These rare subtypes do not respond to aPD1 blockade at the same rate or degree as cutaneous melanomas and behave more like adjuvant failure patients in response to aPD1. These patients must have disease amenable to sampling and in the opinion of the treating physician have appropriate bridging therapy available to reach vaccination series, have no other approved therapeutic options/or decline their use.\n* Must have received either PD1 or combination aPD1/CTLA-4 inhibition as adjuvant treatment for stage IIB-IV melanoma following surgical resection\n* Must be BRAF wildtype\n* ECOG performance \u2264 1\n* Lab values within the specified ranges:\n\n  * Serum direct bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)\n  * AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 x ULN (If confirmed liver metastases: AST and ALT\u2264 5 x ULN)\n  * Creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u2265 15 ml/min (based on modified Cockcroft and Gault formula)\n* Must have disease that is amendable to surgical sampling for RNA-NP vaccine development\n* Subjects must not have more than one active malignancy at the time of enrollment (subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen \\[as determined by the treating physician and approved by the PI\\] may be included)\n* Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Subject agrees to comply with all the study-related procedures.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least four months after the last dose of study treatment to minimize the risk of pregnancy. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.\n\nWOCBP includes any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post-menopausal Post-menopause is defined as:\n\n* Amenorrhea that has lasted for \u2265 12 consecutive months without another cause, or\n* For women with irregular menstrual periods who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level of greater than 35 mIU/mL.\n\n  * Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use physician-approved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence, condoms, vasectomy) throughout the study and should avoid conceiving children for four months following the last dose of study treatment and must agree to not donate sperm during the study treatment period\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects that have an active second malignancy, however, previously treated early stage malignancies (non-melanoma skin cancers, ductal carcinoma in situ, or prostate confined prostate cancer) with no evidence of disease recurrence after 5 years of follow-up will be allowed\n* Subjects with a history of immune-mediated treatment-related adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of prior aPD1 therapy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody or any other baseline risk in the opinion of the investigator that precludes continued use of aPD1 therapy\n* Subjects who received an investigational drug in another clinical trial must wait 28 days or at least 5 half-lives of the study drug, whichever is shorter, prior to enrollment in this study\n* Subjects with uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within seven days prior to tissue collection for vaccine creation or within even days prior to vaccine administration (subjects on prophylactic agents are acceptable)\n* Subjects with any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction, which in the investigator's opinion, could compromise subject safety\n* Subjects with known active hepatitis B virus or untreated hepatitis C virus\n* Clinically relevant active autoimmune disease\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA 3 or 4)\n* Subjects with unstable angina pectoris\n* Subjects who are post-splenectomy\n* Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients\n* Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus with CD4+T cells \u2264 350 cells/ul, a positive viral load as determined by institutional standard testing, or a history of AIDS defining opportunistic infection within the last 12 months\n* Females or males of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study treatment\n* Females who are confirmed to be pregnant or breastfeeding\n* History of any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of protocol therapy or that might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or that puts the subject at high risk for treatment complications, in the opinion of the treating physician\n* Administration of a vaccine containing live virus within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Note: Most flu vaccines are killed viruses, with the exception of the intra-nasal vainer (Flu-Mist) which is an attenuated live virus and therefore prohibited for 30 days prior to first dose.
