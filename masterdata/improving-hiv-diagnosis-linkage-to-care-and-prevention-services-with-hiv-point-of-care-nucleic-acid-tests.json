Study aims #1 and #2 will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a qualitative POC NAT in persons not known to be HIV-positive and will determine the impact of its use on PrEP uptake and persistence among persons testing HIV-negative and on time to HIV continuum of care outcomes among persons testing HIV-positive. Aim #3 will implement a POC NAT-tailored behavioral intervention to evaluate impact on time to virologic suppression among PLWH receiving ART. Aim #4 will quantify the acceptability and feasibility of implementation of POC NAT in community and clinical settings and collect cost and related data for cost-effectiveness analyses. Finally, in Aim #5, a distinct but related study will compare the sensitivity, specificity, and agreement of multiple POC NATs over a range of HIV RNA levels."

Study staff will perform venipuncture, ensure that individual laboratory NAT is performed, and administer a brief CASI. PCPs will deliver the POC NAT result and adherence counseling intervention to patients during their visit.
