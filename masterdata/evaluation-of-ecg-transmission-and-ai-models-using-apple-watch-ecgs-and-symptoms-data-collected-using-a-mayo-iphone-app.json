            "detailedDescription": "1. Patients who have the Mayo Clinic patient app and iOS 14 or higher who are 18 years of age or older will be invited to enroll.\n2. Patient will undergo email survey to assess ownership of Apple Watch v4 or later, and subsequent willingness to participate in the study. Those who agree will undergo digital consent and enrollment.\n3. A customized Mayo Clinic Study App will be available to download to their iOS device and will be used to test whether it is feasible to access ECGs and symptoms data patients have collected using their personal Apple watch that are saved on the patient's phone. The study app will facilitate transmission of past and future patient-recorded watch ECGs.\n4. The patient ECGs and self-reported symptoms data will be uploaded to the AI Dashboard in the patient's medical record (ECG rhythm classification facilitated by Apple ECG program).\n5. We will perform a retrospective review of electronic medical record data from enrolled subjects to assess the quality of the Apple Watch obtained ECGs, assess the results from the AI-ECG dashboard using obtained watch ECGs, and compare these results to prior or subsequently obtained 12 lead ECGs.\n6. Data analysis will be performed with steps to ensure patient confidentiality. Data will be transmitted using similar protocols as with current app data, and all data will be saved in the secure Mayo Clinic electronic environment (called the UDP).\n7. All patients' watch data will be compared to AI dashboard data. Additionally, clinical data in the EMR (such as blood tests, echocardiograms, and other data recorded for routine medical care) will be used to assess the utility of the watch ECG quality for AI algorithms (such as determining whether a weak heart pump is present, for example)."
