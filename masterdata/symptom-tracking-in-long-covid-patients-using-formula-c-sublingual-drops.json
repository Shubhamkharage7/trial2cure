            "briefSummary": "This is a digital symptom tracking study of Formula C\u2122, a full cannabis flower formulation, rich in cannabinoids and terpenes, that has been shown to improve symptoms in people with Long COVID. Participants 21 and older will take Formula C\u2122 for 90 days. During that time, participants will answer weekly surveys to track symptoms and wellbeing.",
            "detailedDescription": "Long COVID is a global health crisis with no current treatments. There's a growing interest within the medical community to explore the potential benefits of full hemp flower extracts in treating and alleviating Long COVID symptoms. Full hemp flower extracts are a remarkable advancement in the field of natural wellness and healing. Full hemp flower extracts harness the full spectrum of beneficial compounds present in the hemp plant, including not just cannabidiol (CBD), but a host of other cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids. This process, known as 'whole plant' or 'full spectrum' extraction, produces a more potent and therapeutic product, as the various compounds work synergistically in what is referred to as the 'entourage effect'. These extracts have been associated with a broad range of potential health benefits, such as pain relief, reduction of inflammation, anxiety management, and sleep improvement. A recently published single-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial demonstrated that Long COVID patients benefitted from sublingual use of Formula C without any safety events. This remote, observational study of Endourage Targeted Wellness Formula C\u2122 sublingual drops will seek to empower participants to track symptoms and wellbeing while taking Formula C to determine if Long COVID symptoms are attenuated and time to healing is shortened."
