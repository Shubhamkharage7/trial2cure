Participants will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatment sequence permutations (i.e., DASH eating plan with eggs and DASH eating plan without eggs), with an 8-week washout period between treatment assignments. After randomization, participants will undergo a 4-week run-in period of a DASH eating plan without egg products before initiating the first of 2 treatment phases in their randomly-assigned sequence permutation.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\n1. To assess the effects of the inclusion of 2 whole eggs/day for 8 weeks in a DASH eating plan, as compared with their exclusion, on endothelial function measured as flow-mediated dilatation and on LDL cholesterol in hyperlipidemic adults.\n2. To determine the effects of the inclusion of 2 whole eggs/day in the context of a DASH eating plan, as compared with their exclusion, on cardio-metabolic risk factors and diet quality in adults with hyperlipidemia over a period of 8 weeks."

The PAR is a valid and reliable tool to estimate the total amount of kilocalories expended on physical activity in adults during the past week. It asks participants to report the amount of time spent in the past week on household and yard-work activities, occupational activity, transport, leisure time physical activity and sedentary behavior. The type, duration in hours, and level of intensity of reported physical activities are then used to estimate the total amount of kilocalories expended on PA during the past week.",
