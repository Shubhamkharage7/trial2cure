Total bilirubin \\> 1.5 \u00d7 ULN for age; and in presence of Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin \\> 3 \u00d7 ULN or direct bilirubin \\> 1.5 \u00d7 ULN.\n   6. Serum creatinine \\> 1.5 \u00d7 ULN for age.\n   7. International normalized ratio or prothrombin time (PT) \\> ULN (\\> 1.5 \u00d7 ULN if on prophylactic reversible anticoagulants).\n2. Participant has a QTcF \\> 470 msec. Participant has a familial or personal history of prolonged QT syndrome or Torsades de pointes.\n3. Participant has clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure Grade III or IV according to the New York Heart Association classification; myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the previous 6 months, uncontrolled hypertension (\\> 95th percentile for age), or clinically significant, uncontrolled arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias that may cause QT prolongation (eg, Type II second-degree heart block or third-degree heart block).\n4. Participant received the following systemic antineoplastic therapies:\n\n   1. Temozolomide within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug\n   2. Nitrosurea within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug\n   3. Any other systemic antineoplastic therapy (including experimental therapy) within 5 half-lives or 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug, whichever is shorter.\n   4. Focal external beam radiotherapy, including stereotactic radiosurgery, within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of avapritinib to either target or nontarget lesions. Systemic radiopharmaceuticals, including nonstereotactic radiosurgery, within 2 weeks of the first dose of avapritinib (within 6 weeks for Participants with CNS tumors).
