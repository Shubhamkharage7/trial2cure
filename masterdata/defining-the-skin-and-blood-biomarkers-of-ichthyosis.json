            "briefSummary": "Ichthyosis is a group of genetic skin disorders that present with dry, thickened, scaly, or flaky skin. As of today, there is no cure or treatment. Doctors can only treat the dry skin with different types of emollients to soften the scale. A deeper understanding of this disease is required to develop better treatments. There are different types of cells and cell-produced signals (biomarkers) that are being studied in order to help find these new treatments. Looking at biomarkers has been successful in helping us to understand other skin disorders better. The purpose of this study is to determine which blood and skin biomarkers characterize ichthyosis.\n\nHypothesis: We predict that the biomarkers correlating with disease activity in Netherton syndrome will be different than the biomarkers found to correlate with the lamellar and other ichthyosis phenotype.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objectives:\n\n1. To define a panel of skin and blood biomarkers associated with disease activity and pruritus in Netherton syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and other ichthyosis subtypes.\n2. To determine if blood samples can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and will correlate with disease severity.\n3. To determine FLG, SPINK5, TGM1, or other mutation via buccal/saliva samples in ichthyosis subjects\n4. To determine differences in alterations of epidermal lipids and proteins in the outer stratum corneum of epidermis collected from tape strips in patients with ichthyosis compared to the general population. There will also be a difference detected in epidermal lipids from blood samples."
