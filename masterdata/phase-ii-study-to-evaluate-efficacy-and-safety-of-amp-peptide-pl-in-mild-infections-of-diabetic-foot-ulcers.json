Approximately 90 patients (30 per treatment group) will be randomized in this study. Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive twice a day, 14 days treatment of Antimicrobial Peptide PL-5 Topical Spray (1\u2030), Antimicrobial Peptide PL-5 Topical Spray (2\u2030) and placebo of Antimicrobial Peptide PL-5 Topical Spray (vehicle). In this study, the cut-off date for final analysis is defined as the time when all subjects have completed the last visit or discontinued the study. The duration of the whole study is planned for 24 months; the duration of each participant is about 4-5 weeks, including Screening period/Baseline (about 7 days), treatment period (about 14 days), Follow-up period (about 7-14 days). No interim analysis will be performed in this study. This study is a phase II study, and no statistical hypothesis is proposed."

Voluntary written consent, given before performance of any clinical investigation-related procedure not part of standard medical care, and with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n6. Female subjects must meet at least one of the following additional criteria:\n\n   * Surgically sterile with bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy.\n   * Postmenopausal for at least one year.\n   * If of childbearing potential, practicing an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the clinical investigation as judged by the Investigator, such as condoms, foams, jellies, diaphragm, intrauterine device or abstinence\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Another cause of the inflammatory response of the skin around the ulcer (such as a trauma, gout, acute Charcot neuro-arthropathy, fracture, thrombosis, or venous stasis).\n2.
