            "detailedDescription": "The study is a sequential cohort ascending dose (3+3 methodology after a sentinel at the 0,25 mg/kg level) study to confirm safety and identify DLTs in the study population and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the RP2D.\n\nThe range of proposed doses includes optimal doses identified in parallel safety studies of STI-6129 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory systemic amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis that are currently ongoing (a three-stage, multicenter, open-label, dose -finding, Phase 1 trial to identify the RP2D). STI-6129 will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion.\n\nEach patient enrolled will received repeated 4-week cycles of STI-6129 (Q4W) Total duration will vary according to patient response. After the treatment period, patients will be monitored for up to 2 years."
