Cedazuridine is believed to work by slowing down how fast decitabine is broken down by the body. Decitabine is believed to work by blocking abnormal cells or cancer cells from growing."

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or surgically treated prostate cancer.\n* Participants with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of ASTX727.\n* Participants with a history of myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to screening.\n* Participants with a known history of severe and/or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias.\n* Participants with QTc interval \u2265450 msec or with other factors that significantly increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g., family history of long QT interval syndrome).\n* Participants with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C.\n* Participants with any other medical or psychological condition, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a participant's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate, or participate in the study.\n* Participants with known dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs administered orally.\n* Participants with evidence of intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage either by MRI or CT scan.
