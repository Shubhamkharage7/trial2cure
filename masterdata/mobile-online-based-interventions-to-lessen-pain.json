            "briefSummary": "The investigators will implement an international 2-arm online pragmatic feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a digital pain relief skills intervention \"Empowered Relief: On-Demand\" to reduce pain metrics, opioid craving, and opioid misuse. They will compare Empowered Relief to a no-skills digital health education (\"Living Better\") intervention in community-based individuals with comorbid chronic pain and prescription opioid misuse (N=220). Completion of the brief post-treatment survey is a binary measure of treatment engagement; treatment feasibility and appraisal are assessed with three items (satisfaction, perceived utility, and likelihood to use skills learned). Electronic surveys will measure opioid misuse behaviors, craving, and use; and pain intensity and psychological status at: baseline, immediately post-treatment; at post-treatment weeks 1 and 2; and months 1, 2, and 3.",
            "detailedDescription": "Most people who misuse prescription opioids report doing so for pain relief. This study will investigate a digital intervention for people with comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse.\n\nThe intervention, Empowered Relief On-Demand, will include roughly 80 minutes of interactive digital pain education and pain management skills content with multimedia features and an App. The investigators will conduct a fully online 2-arm RCT of digital Empowered Relief in a national sample of people with comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse compared to a digital health education control (HE).\n\nThe investigators will implement The MOBILE Relief Study, an international (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia) 2-arm online feasibility RCT of Empowered Relief to reduce pain intensity, pain interference, pain-related distress (pain outcomes) and opioid outcomes (opioid craving and misuse) in people with prescription opioid misuse and chronic pain. They will compare Empowered Relief On Demand to an interactive digital health education (HE) intervention that is devoid of pain management skills (\"Living Better\") in community-based individuals with comorbid chronic pain and prescription opioid misuse (N=220). Completion of the brief post-treatment survey (received immediately following treatment completion) is a binary measure of treatment engagement; treatment feasibility and appraisal are assessed with five items (overall satisfaction with treatment, ease of understanding, relevance, perceived utility, and likelihood to use skills learned). Electronic surveys will measure opioid misuse behaviors, craving, and use; and pain intensity and psychological status at: baseline, and months 1, 2, and 3. At post-treatment weeks 1 and 2, electronic surveys will measure opioid craving, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing (distress), and pain interference."
