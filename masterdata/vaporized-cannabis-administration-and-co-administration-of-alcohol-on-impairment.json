            "briefSummary": "This human laboratory study will use cognitive, behavioral, and subjective measures to characterize impairment associated with co-use of alcohol and vaporized cannabis. Participants (n=32) will complete 7 double-blind, double-dummy outpatient sessions in randomized order. In each session, participants will self-administer placebo (0 mg THC) or active vaporized cannabis (5 or 25 mg THC, via a handheld vaporizer called the Mighty Medic) and a placebo drink (BAC 0.0%) or alcohol drink calculated to produce a breath alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05%. Participants will also complete a positive control session in which the participant administers placebo cannabis and alcohol at a target BAC of 0.08% (the legal threshold for driving impairment in most U.S. states).",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be conducted at the Johns Hopkins Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU). Participants will complete a screening visit, and, if eligible, will then complete 7 experimental drug administration sessions in randomized order where the participant will vaporize cannabis-containing capsules (or \"pods\") (containing 0, 5, or 25mg THC) with a drink that contains no alcohol or alcohol (alcohol-containing drinks will be calculated to produce a breath alcohol concentration, BAC, of 0.05%). There is also a positive control session where participants will vaporize placebo cannabis with an alcohol drink calculated to produce a BAC of 0.08%. Each session will last approximately 8 hours and will be separated by at least 48 hours to allow for sufficient drug washout. Participants may complete up to 2 sessions per week. Drugs will be administered in a double-blind and double-dummy fashion (i.e., participants will always receive both active or placebo cannabis and active or placebo alcohol). During each session, a battery of assessments including blood collection, subjective questionnaire administration, cognitive performance testing, and simulated driving will be conducted."
