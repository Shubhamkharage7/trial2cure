            "briefSummary": "The objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate continuous temperature monitoring, oxygen (O2) concentration and ventilation with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to keep lungs cooled at 4-8 degrees Celsius, with continuous O2 concentration of 100% and inflated with a PEEP of 8-10 during the entire cold ischemic period.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Angel Lung Cooler is a lung preservation method for transplantation. The device has temperature and airway pressure sensors that assess the oxygen temperature in the airways to confirm during the entire preservation time that desired airway temperatures (between 8 and 10 oC) and mean airway pressure to keep the lungs inflated during transportation is optimized.\n\nFor the purposes of the trial, the Angel Cooler will be in the operating room at time of transplant when both of the lungs are explanted. The explanted lungs (those removed and not the donor lungs) will be connected to the cooler to determine inflation and temperature changes of the lungs. This procedure will take approximately 5 - 20 minutes. The lungs will then be disconnected from the cooler and then returned to the back table for transport to the Pathology department. As part of standard procedures, the lungs remain in the Operating room for a few hours before they are transported to the Pathology department."

During this time, investigators will monitor the airway temperature, pressure and oxygen concentration continuously during the entire preservation time.
