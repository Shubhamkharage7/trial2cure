The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the safe dose of Kindolor in healthy volunteers?\n* How is Kindolor metabolized by the human body?\n\nParticipants will undergo medical tests before and after receiving Kindolor or a placebo to see if there is any difference between the groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eligible participants will undergo intake procedures and baseline evaluations at the clinic the day before dosing. The next day, participants will be randomized to, and receive, either Kindolor tablets or placebo tablets (4 cohorts of escalating doses of Kindolor with 6 Kindolor participants and 2 placebo participants in each cohort). Participants will remain in the clinic for at least an additional 48-hours for safety assessments and blood collections to determine plasma levels of Kindolor, then will be discharged from the clinic and return for follow-up safety tests 7 days later."
