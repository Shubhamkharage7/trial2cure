This study will enroll 10 pregnant women who meet study criteria.",

The fetal tracheal balloon will be removed between 34 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 days of gestation or earlier as indicated.\n\nAfter balloon insertion, participants will be followed weekly and must reside within 30 minutes of Lurie Children's until balloon removal. Additionally, participants will have restrictions from return to work, exercise, or intercourse. The children's health status will be followed until two years of age."
