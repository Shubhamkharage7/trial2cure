Following determination of the combination recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), the Phase II (randomized treatment) part of this trial will be initiated as an open-label 2-arm evaluation of mFOLFIRINOX \u00b1 BNT321 (24 weeks) followed by BNT321 monotherapy (24 weeks) in the combination arm only to complete the adjuvant therapy course. Treatment cycles are every 2 weeks (14 days).",
            "detailedDescription": "The Phase I part of the trial will be a limited dose finding evaluation, whereby a minimal number of BNT321 dose levels will be tested for safety and tolerability in combination with mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. Dose escalation will be conducted using a 3+3 design, with up to six additional patients treated at the Phase I defined combination maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Two BNT321 dose levels are initially planned, Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2. Following evaluation of safety profile for Dose Level 2, additional BNT321 dose levels may be evaluated following safety data review, discussion, and approval by the safety review committee (SRC), and health authority review and approval. Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled into the Phase I part.\n\nFollowing completion of the dose escalation Phase I and identification of the RP2D, the trial will proceed to a randomized Phase II part. For this part, an independent data monitoring committee will be established prior to the inclusion of the first patient in this phase.\n\nThe Phase II part will be a 2-arm, randomization of mFOLFIRINOX \u00b1 BNT321, with up to 300 patients enrolled to enable a robust statistical evaluation of the trial's Phase II primary endpoint, i.e., median disease-free survival (mDFS).\n\nAdditional evaluations for Phase II will include determination of combination regimen safety and tolerability, determination of overall survival (OS), pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses including anti-drug antibody (ADA), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assessments, cytokine and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assessments."
