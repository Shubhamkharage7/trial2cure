The key research divisions are cancer, cardiovascular, immunity and pathogenesis, neuroscience, and molecular microbiology.",

The human tissue can be fresh or paraffinized. The human tissue will be picked up by the clinical research team and transferred to research scientists of the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine (COM) or Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences (BSBS) for storage and testing according to their separate IRB-approved or IRB-exempted protocols. These separate protocols cannot be for genetic testing. The Project does not receive human tissue resulting from termination of pregnancy."
