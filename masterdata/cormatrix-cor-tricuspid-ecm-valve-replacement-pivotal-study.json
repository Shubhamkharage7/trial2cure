            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pivotal study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of the Cor TRICUSPID ECM (extracellular matrix) Valve (or Cor PEDIATRIC Tricuspid ECM Valve) for the surgical management of tricuspid valve disease and dysfunction in adult and pediatric patients. The main question(s) it aims to answer are:\n\n* whether the device may be implanted successfully and safely, and\n* whether the device effectively treats tricuspid valve disease and dysfunction through 12 months\n\nParticipants will undergo:\n\n* preoperative evaluation\n* tricuspid valve replacement with the Cor TRICUSPID ECM Valve\n* postoperative evaluation, including at hospital discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months, and then annually thereafter through 5 years",
            "detailedDescription": "CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. has developed a device for heart valve replacement, the Cor TRICUSPID ECM Valve for adults and the Cor PEDIATRIC Tricuspid ECM Valve for pediatrics (collectively these devices will be referred to as the Cor TRICUSPID ECM Valve(s)), which can be implanted to replace dysfunctional tricuspid heart valves. The objective of this Pivotal Study is to collect safety and effectiveness data on surgical tricuspid valve replacement procedures using the Cor TRICUSPID ECM valve to support a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) marketing application.\n\nBecause the majority of tricuspid valve replacements (TVRs) (approximately 80%) are performed concomitantly with other cardiac operations, including replacements of mitral or aortic valves, it is anticipated that a portion of study subjects will require concomitant replacement or repair of a dysfunctional mitral or aortic valve, based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.\n\nTherefore, safety with the Cor TRICUSPID ECM Valve will be established by Procedural, Technical and Device Success."
