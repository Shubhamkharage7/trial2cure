The study aims to confirm:\n\n* That ICR is associated with better outcomes than TCR, defined as lower readmission costs, lower incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and improvement in biomarkers, epigenetic markers, and inflammatory markers.\n* The addition of food to the ICR program will further improve these outcomes.\n\nICR-eligible participants\n\n* Will be randomized into one of three groups: (1) ICR 72 session program with home-delivered C2life\u00ae supplied food, (2) ICR 72 session without C2life\u00ae supplied food, or (3) TCR 36 session program without C2life supplied food\n* Biometric measurements and laboratory measurements will be performed at entry into the rehab intervention, discharge from rehab intervention, and at 6 months after discharge.\n* Epigenetic measurements will be performed at admission and discharge from the rehab intervention"
