            "briefSummary": "Foralumab is a human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe goal of this Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, multicenter dose-ranging study is to evaluate the use of nasal foralumab in patients with non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).\n\nThe primary objectives that this study aims to answer are:\n\n1. To determine the safety and tolerability of 50 \u03bcg/dose and 100 \u03bcg/dose of foralumab nasal compared to placebo\n2. To investigate the effect of foralumab relative to placebo on the change from baseline \\[18F\\]PBR06-positron emission tomography (PET) scans for microglial activation, after 12 weeks (3) months of study treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disorder affecting young adults, driven by an aberrant T cell response against central nervous system (CNS) antigens. Epidemiologic studies show that approximately 50% of patients are classified as having relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), while about 35% have SPMS and the remaining 15% have primary progressive MS (PPMS).\n\nForalumab is a human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It is hypothsized that nasal foralumab will slow disability accumulation and microglial activation measured by PET imaging in non-active SPMS.\n\nThis study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study of 2 doses of nasal foralumab (50 \u03bcg/dose or 100 \u03bcg/dose of foralumab nasal) compared to placebo in the treatment of non-active SPMS for 3 months (4 three-week cycles of treatment).\n\nFifty-four subjects with non-active SPMS will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment cohorts:\n\n1. Group A: Nasal foralumab 50 \u03bcg 3 days a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) for two weeks, followed by a one-week rest, comprising a 3-week cycle, for a total of four cycles.\n2. Group B: Nasal foralumab 100 \u03bcg 3 days a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) for two weeks, followed by a one-week rest, comprising a 3-week cycle, for a total of four cycles.\n3. Group C: Nasal placebo (acetate buffer) 3 days a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) for two weeks, followed by a one-week rest, comprising a 3-week cycle, for a total of four cycles."
