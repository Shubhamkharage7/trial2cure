            "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lutathera (177Lu-DOTATATE) in patients with progressive or recurrent High-Grade Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors and meningiomas that demonstrate uptake on DOTATATE PET. The drug will be given intravenously once every 8 weeks for a total of up to 4 doses over 8 months in patients aged 4-12 years (Phase I) or older than 12 yrs (Phase II) to test its safety and efficacy, respectively.\n\nFunding Source - FDA OOPD (grant number FD-R-0532-01)",
            "detailedDescription": "Somatostatin receptors regulate cell growth through downstream modulation of both proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathways, and thus represent a potential therapeutic target. Lutathera (Lutetium \\[Lu\\]177 Dotatate) is a radionuclide therapy which binds type-2A somatostatin receptors (SST2A) and has recently gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors expressing SST2A.\n\nHigh SST2A expression has been consistently observed in medulloblastoma and other embryonal tumors (75-100% of cases) as well as in some HGGs and anaplastic ependymomas (13-80%), with corresponding uptake on radiolabeled somatostatin receptor nuclear imaging (e.g. DOTATATE PET).\n\nEmerging data has demonstrated treatment response (disease stabilization or regression) to somatostatin receptor-targeted therapy in children and young adults with relapsed medulloblastoma, HGG, meningioma, and brain metastases of neuroendocrine tumors, suggesting sufficient CNS penetration to achieve therapeutic benefit.\n\nThe proposed Phase I-II study will investigate the safety and efficacy of Lutathera treatment in patients whose tumors demonstrate uptake on DOTATATE PET (functional evidence of SST2A expression). In both Phase cohorts, Lutathera will be administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 8-week cycle for up to 4 cycles.\n\nPhase I: (4-12 years) To determine the safety, define the dose-limiting toxicities, and establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of Lutathera in this patient population. The first cycle (first 8 weeks) will be used as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period. The starting dose will be dose level 1, 200 mCi\\*(body surface area \\[BSA\\]/1.73m2), which corresponds to the BSA-adjusted FDA approved adult dosing of Lutathera (200 mCi every 8 weeks). Once the MTD/RP2D is established, an efficacy expansion cohort of up to 10 patients will be opened to determine the preliminary efficacy of the MTD/RP2D of Lutathera in this cohort.\n\nPhase II: (\\>12 years) Enroll patients at the recommended adult dose of 200 mCi every 8 weeks to determine the anti-tumor activity of Lutathera at this dosing in this population. Response will be assessed on imaging (brain and/or spine MRI and DOTATATE PET) following every cycle."

Peds, 106:522, 1985) age/gender as follows:\n\n       1 to \\< 2 years: maximum serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL for males and females. 2 to \\< 6 years: maximum serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dL for males and females. 6 to \\< 10 years: maximum serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL for males and females. 10 to \\< 13 years: maximum serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL for males and females. 13 to \\< 16 years: maximum serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL for males and 1.4 mg/dL for females.\n\n       \u2265 16 years: maximum serum creatinine 1.7 mg/dL for males and 1.4 mg/dL for females.\n   * Adequate Liver Function as defined as:\n\n     * Total bilirubin \u2264 3 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n     * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u2264 3 times institutional ULN\n     * Serum albumin \u2265 2g/dL\n     * Coagulation parameters: INR \\<1.5 times ULN and aPTT \\<1.5 times ULN unless patients are receiving therapeutic anticoagulation which affects these parameters\n   * Adequate Cardiac Function as defined as:\n\n     * Ejection fraction of \u2265 55% by echocardiogram\n     * Serum electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride) within institutional limits of normal (patients can be on enteral supplementation)\n\n   3.12 Corticosteroids Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to enrollment, with a maximum dexamethasone dose of 2.5mg/m2/day.\n\n   3.13 Pregnancy Status Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\n   3.14 Pregnancy Prevention Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while being treated on this study and for at least 7 months after drug cessation in females of childbearing potential and for at least 4 months after drug cessation in males of child fathering potential.\n\n   3.15 Informed Consent The patient or parent/guardian is able to understand the consent and is willing to sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines.\n4. Exclusion Criteria\n\n   4.1 Confirmed bone marrow metastatic disease Patients with confirmed metastatic disease to bone marrow are ineligible.\n\n   4.2 Presence of bulky disease Patients with bulky disease on imaging as described below are ineligible. Treating physicians are encouraged to request a rapid central imaging review to confirm fulfillment of these criteria if there are questions or concerns.\n\n   Bulky disease is defined as:\n   * Tumor with evidence of clinically significant uncal herniation or midline shift.\n   * Tumor with diameter of \\>5cm in one dimension on T2/FLAIR.\n   * Tumor that in the opinion of the site investigator shows significant mass effect in either the brain or spine.\n\n   Note that patients with metastatic or multi-focal disease (with exception of bone marrow) are eligible as long as no sites of disease meet above criteria for bulky disease.\n\n   4.3 Breast-feeding Nursing mothers are excluded from this study. There is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Lutathera.\n\n   4.4 Concurrent Illness\n   * Patients with a history of any other malignancy, except patients with a secondary brain tumor if the patient's prior malignancy has been in remission for at least 5 years from the end of treatment.\n   * Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results.\n   * Patients with type I diabetes.\n\n   4.5 Concomitant Medications\n   * Patients who are receiving any other anti-cancer or investigational drug therapy are ineligible.\n   * Prior or current treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE/TOC or 90Y-DOTATATE/TOC.\n\n   4.6 Prisoners will be excluded from this study.\n\n   4.7 Inability to participate: Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for required follow-up visits, obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to therapy, or adhere to drug administration plan, other study procedures, and study restrictions.\n5. Inclusion of Women and Minorities Both males and females of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study.\n6. Criteria to Start Treatment\n\n   * Subjects must start therapy within seven (7) days of enrollment.\n   * Laboratory values must be no older than 7 days prior to the start of therapy. If a test that is repeated post enrollment and prior to the start of therapy is outside the limits for eligibility, it must be rechecked within 48 hours prior to the start of therapy. If rechecks are still outside the limits for eligibility, the patient may not receive protocol therapy and will be considered off study.",
