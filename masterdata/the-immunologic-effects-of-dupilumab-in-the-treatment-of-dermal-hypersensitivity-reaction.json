Not a lot is known about why the rash occurs and what happens to the immune system to cause this rash. Dupilumab, a biologic drug that is given as an injection under the skin, may treat dermal hypersensitivity reaction. This study tries to better understand dermal hypersensitivity reaction and how the immune system responds to dupilumab."
