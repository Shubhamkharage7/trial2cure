            "detailedDescription": "Pediatric patients with refractory or multiply relapsed leukemia and lymphoma do very poorly with traditional chemotherapy and have overall survival rates of well under 20%. There has been much excitement over the development of Car T cell therapy for these types of leukemia/lymphoma, but many patients may not fit the standard criteria to receive them or they cannot tolerate the extended wait and ongoing therapy that is needed for manufacture of these cells at the commercial level. With this study, the investigators will investigate a new CD19 directed CAR-T therapy that will be manufactured locally with a goal of wider patient inclusion and less delay to CAR-T infusion. The investigators hypothesize that CD19 directed CAR-T cells manufactured using the Prodigy ClinicMACS system developed by Miltenyi (UCD19 CAR-T) will be safe and tolerable and show preliminary efficacy in pediatric patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-ALL or B- NHL."
