Positive serological testing for HIV.\n6. Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n7. Hypersensitivity to any of the excipients present in LAVA-1207.\n8. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n9. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n10. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n11. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n12. Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD 1), anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti-programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2) agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137), and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher immune related AE (irAE).\n13. A significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely affect participation in this trial.\n14. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n15. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks (could consider shorter interval for kinase inhibitors or other short half-life drugs) prior to treatment. Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to \u2264Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with \u2264Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. Participants with endocrine-related AEs \u2264Grade 2 requiring treatment or hormone replacement may be eligible. Note: If the participant had major surgery, the participant must have recovered adequately from the procedure and/or any complications from the surgery prior to starting study intervention.\n16. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment or have had a history of radiation pneumonitis. Note: Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities and not require corticosteroids. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u2264 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n17. Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention. Note: Administration of killed vaccines are allowed.\n18. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n19. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to initial IMP administration.\n20. Previous treatment with an aminobisphosphonate IV (e.g., ibandronate, pamidronate, zoledronate etc.) within 12 months prior to initial IMP.\n21. Known ongoing drug and alcohol abuse in the opinion of the investigator.\n22. Patients will be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from other available therapy.\n23. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality, or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study or interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, such that it is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n24. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.",
