            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSmith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is a genetic disorder. It can cause birth defects and developmental delays. There is no cure for SLOS or other inherited diseases related to cholesterol production or storage. The data gained in this study may help researchers find ways to measure how well future treatments work.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about SLOS and related disorders and how these diseases affect participants and relatives.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople of any age who have or are suspected to have SLOS or another inherited disease related to cholesterol production or storage. Relatives are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical record review.\n\nParticipants will have visits every 6 to 12 months. They will have a physical exam. They will fill out a survey about their medical and behavioral history. They may have an eye exam. They may have a neurodevelopmental assessment. They may have a hearing test. Their outer and middle ears may be examined. Their ability to speak, understand speech, eat, and swallow may be assessed. They may get X-rays while they chew and swallow. Their functional ability and needs for adaptive devices or braces may be assessed. They may have a lumbar puncture. Photographs may be taken of their face and body.\n\nParticipants who cannot visit the NIH and relatives will have a virtual visit once a year. They will talk about their medical history and symptoms. They give blood, urine, and skin samples at a lab near their home. They will fill out a survey about their medical and behavioral history.\n\nParticipation will last for several years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description: The objective of this study is to characterize the natural history of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) and related disorders (such as lathosterolosis, desmosterolosis, X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX2), CHILD syndrome, HEM dysplasia, and Antley-Bixler syndrome) by collecting both crosssectional and longitudinal data on individuals with these conditions.\n\nOur goal is to investigate genetic, biochemical, and clinical aspects of SLOS and related disorders in order to facilitate development and implementation of future therapeutic trials. This protocol consists of a main study and two substudies. The main study involves in-person evaluation of patients and carriers of SLOS and related disorders. The first substudy includes collecting biorepository samples from patients and carriers of SLOS and related disorders. The second substudy involves obtaining a telemedicine history and full review of systems for patients with SLOS and related disorders. This protocol will also maintain a database of information collected over the past two decades at the NIH on SLOS trial participants. All individuals with SLOS, related disorders and carriers will be eligible for enrollment.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine laboratory or clinical outcome measures that could be used in future therapeutic trials.\n\nThe secondary objectives of these studies are to define comorbidities and mortality of the disease, to identify potential participants for future therapeutic trials and to evaluate possible laboratory outcome measures in carriers and suspected carriers.\n\nEndpoints: Primary endpoints\n\n1. Phenotypic characterization of individuals with SLOS and related inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis. Define and characterize disease related morbidity and mortality.\n2. Establishing a biomaterial collection (Blood, urine, CSF, DNA/RNA and cell lines) corresponding to well-phenotyped individuals for biomarker discovery and characterization.\n\nSecondary endpoints: Phenotypic history as well as blood and urine biomarkers in individuals heterozygous for pathogenic DHCR7 variants or pathogenic variants in cholesterol synthetic genes."
