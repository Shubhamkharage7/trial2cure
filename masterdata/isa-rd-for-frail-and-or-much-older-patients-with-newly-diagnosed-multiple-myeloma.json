            "briefSummary": "This research study is investigating the safety and effectiveness of using combination of isatuximab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). The study team will use lower doses than is currently standard for these drugs. Lower doses will be used to avoid or possibly reduce any unwanted side effects commonly associated with these drugs. Using lower doses of the combination isatuximab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone, has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of newly diagnosed MM.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to determine the optimal treatment regimen for older and/or otherwise toxicity-vulnerable patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who cannot receive approved standard therapy. As a result, this Phase II trial of isatuximab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Isa-Rd) selectively enroll much older and/or otherwise highly toxicity-vulnerable participants. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of isatuximab when used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at lower doses will be evaluated. It is expected that using this combination at lower doses, may help patients achieve a better response while causing fewer or less severe side effects.\n\nAll participants on the trial will also be evaluated by Cancer and Aging Research Group Geriatric Assessments (CARG-GA) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of quality of life (QOL). \"Geriatric assessment\" will be referred to as \"global assessment\" for study purposes, to reflect the fact that younger participants will likely participate in the study. Optional correlative blood samples will be collected to study biomarkers of aging and frailty with a focus on both the relation to isatuximab specifically, as well as treatment response and risk for intolerability.\n\nDuration of Therapy:\n\nThe length of study participation will depend on the response to the treatment, and it may last approximately 2 years. Participants will receive isatuximab for two years, and then isatuximab will be discontinued. Dexamethasone administration will occur weekly for the first eight cycles. Lenalidomide will be continued as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nIn the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment should continue until:\n\n* Disease progression\n* Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment\n* Treatment delay of more than 12 weeks.\n* Unacceptable adverse event(s)\n* Pregnancy\n* Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or\n* General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.\n* Subject is lost to follow up\n\nDuration of Follow Up:\n\nAll participants (including those withdrawn for AE (Adverse Event) will be followed after removal from study treatment until death or full subject withdrawal from the study for other reasons. Participants removed from study treatment for unacceptable AEs will be followed for resolution or stabilization of the adverse event(s)."

If low ANC is felt to be due to non-MM causes, such as myelodysplasia or other bone marrow disorders unrelated to MM, then subject should not be enrolled on the study.\n   * Platelets \u2265 50 \u00d7 109/L if \\< 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells, and\n   * \u2265 30 \u00d7 109/L if \u2265 50% of BM (Bone Marrow) nucleated cells are plasma cells.\n   * Platelet transfusions are permitted to reach entry criteria. If low platelets are felt to be due to non-MM causes, such as myelodysplasia or other bone marrow disorders unrelated to MM, then subject should not be enrolled on the study.\n\n   Renal\n\n   \u2022 Calculated or measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR):Any GFR as long as not currently dialysis-dependent\n8. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)\\* must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin two acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method at the same time, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide through 30 days after the last dose of lenalidomide and 5 months after the last dose of isatuximab. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the entire duration of treatment and monthly for 5 months after the last dose of isatuximab. Men must agree to use a latex or synthetic condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy from the time of signing the informed consent form through 30 days after the last dose of lenalidomide and 5 months after the last dose of isatuximab. These same subjects must not donate sperm. All subjects must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure. All subjects enrolled into this trial, must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.\n\n   * A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Active infection requiring systemic antibiotics or other serious infection within 14 days prior to study treatment.\n2. Subjects felt to not be candidates by treating physician for any systemic therapy due to excessive comorbidities, frailty, impaired performance status, or other severe limitations. Such limitations can be conceptualized generally as making subjects exceedingly high-risk for any systemic treatment for their MM. These limitations often stem from medical comorbidities unrelated to MM and they are hence unlikely to improve with MM therapy. The reasons for exclusion will be documented.\n3. Any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, would expose excessive risk to the subject or may interfere with compliance or interpretation of the study results.\n4. Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Subjects with secondary amyloidosis due to MM are eligible, if the amyloidosis is not felt to be a clinically significant issue (e.g., amyloid found incidentally on bone marrow core biopsy without evidence of amyloid-mediated organ compromise).\n5. Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to study treatment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.\n6. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the various formulations of any agent.\n7. Hypersensitivity or history of intolerance to steroids, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, sodium stearyl fumarate, histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt), arginine hydrochloride, poloxamer 188, sucrose or any of the other components of study therapy that are not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers or would prohibit further treatment with these agents.\n8. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of dexamethasone or lenalidomide including difficulty swallowing.\n9. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study.\n10. Patients with a history of prior or concurrent second primary malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational treatment should generally be eligible.\n11. Receiving other investigational agents less than 14 days or 5 half-lives of first dose of therapy on this protocol, whichever is longer.\n12. Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments with possible exception of agents with low likelihood of affecting outcome of this study, such as adjuvant hormonal therapy for remote history of breast cancer.\n13. Known to be HIV+ or have active infection with hepatitis A, B, or C; or tuberculosis.\n14. Chronic daily corticosteroids for other, non-MM-related medical conditions exceeding low-dose (e.g., prednisone \u2265 10 mg daily or equivalent).\n15. Subject is receiving prohibited medications or treatments as listed in the protocol that cannot be discontinued/replaced by an alternative therapy.",
