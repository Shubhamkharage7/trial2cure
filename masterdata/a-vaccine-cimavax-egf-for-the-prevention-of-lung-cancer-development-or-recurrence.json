            "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial studies the side effects of a vaccine called CIMAvax-EGF and to see how well it works in preventing lung cancer from developing in patients at high risk for lung cancer or coming back (recurrence) in stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer survivors. In many cancers such as lung cancer, there is a protein receptor called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) that is overexpressed within these cancers. Activation of EGFR has shown to lead to tumor growth and development. Previous studies have indicated that EGFR activation is present in the airways of cancer-free subjects as well. CIMAvax-EGF vaccine works by causing the body to make antibodies against EGF that is being produced that could be possibly driving the risk for developing cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the efficacy of the vaccine based on circulating EGF and anti-EGF antibodies.\n\nII. To access the molecular profile of blood, bronchial and nasal brushes, and bronchial biopsies to identify molecular markers associated with treatment and response.\n\nIII. To establish the safety of recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine (CIMAvax-EGF) treatment in cancer-free individuals using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate quality of life score changes using European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core 30 (C30) in patients who are at high risk for development of lung cancer or recurrence during CIMAvax-EGF treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nLOADING PHASE: Patients receive recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine IM once every 4 weeks (Q4W) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 60 days."
