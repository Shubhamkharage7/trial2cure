            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nIn the U.S., about 53 million informal, unpaid caregivers provide care to a person who is ill, is disabled, or has age-related loss of function. These caregivers may be adult children, spouses, parents, or others. The stress of providing long-term care affects caregivers health and well-being. Researchers want to learn more about this stress and its effects.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn how the caregiving process affects the health and well-being of caregivers over time.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 years and older who are caregivers for a person with a chronic medical condition and who have already given consent to take part in other study activities.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be put in different groups. They will complete some or all of the following tasks over 1 year. They may repeat these tasks once a year for up to 5 years.\n\nParticipants will fill out 2 online surveys. One will ask about their health and their caregiving experience. The other will ask them to list people in their social network and their care recipient s social network who give them support.\n\nParticipants will have a 2-part phone interview. It will be audio recorded. In part 1, they will be asked about the people they listed in the survey. In part 2, they will be asked about their caregiving experience and events in the care recipient s life.\n\nParticipants may fill out a weeklong diary every 3 months. It will ask about their daily social activities, well-being, and stress levels. It will also ask about their thoughts and feelings about caregiving.\n\nParticipants may give a blood sample each year they are in the study.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description: Caregivers will be invited to participate in surveys and interviews to assess their cognitions and emotions about caregiving, caregiving burden, and caregiving or support network systems during the life of the Care Recipient. The study will also include a bereavement component, in which families who have experienced the death of a Care Recipient may choose to participate. In addition, biomarkers may be evaluated in consenting individuals to assess genetic susceptibility to stress and stress-related dysregulations in the endocrine and immune systems.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the natural history of family caregiver stress over time, providing opportunity to understand the social, psychological, behavioral, and biological factors that characterize caregivers response to long-term caregiving during the life and after death of a Care Recipient with a chronic medical condition.\n\nEndpoints: To assess the change over time in terms of social, psychological, behavioral, and biological factors associated with caregiving."

As per OHSRP SOP 404, NIH staff may be a vulnerable class of study subjects. Excluding staff of the Institute conducting the study assures there will not be any perceived or actual conflict of interest, pressure/coercion to participate among co-workers, subordinates, work unit-members, etc. As further noted in OHSRP SOP 404, exclusion further protects this class of subjects privacy and confidentiality; and protects the study s scientific integrity.\n\nPersons with impaired neuro-sensory or decision-making ability (adults unable to provide consent) will not be enrolled in the study. Persons with impaired neuro-sensory or decision making ability would not be able to participate with independent responses to the various social behavioral measures we use in the study interview and survey. Learning information about these individuals through other people instead of themselves would introduce bias to this study.",
