The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n1. To determine if daily calf muscle stretching at home improves calf muscle and vascular health.\n2. To determine if daily calf muscle stretching at home improves walking performance.\n\nParticipants will use inflatable ankle splints for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 4-weeks on both days and 4-weeks of no stretching.",

Blood vessel health and size, length and function of the calf muscles and tendons and walking performance will be measured. Joint and foot movements as well as calf muscle oxygen levels will be measured during walking performance tests."
