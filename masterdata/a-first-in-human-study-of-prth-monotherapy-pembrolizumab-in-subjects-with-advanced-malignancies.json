These \"immune cell-excluded\" solid tumors are resistant to attack by the immune system (as well as other existing therapies). By disabling DDR1, the collagen fibers lose alignment and loosen, creating gaps in the tumor barrier, thus allowing T-cells to enter and naturally attack the tumor.\n\nThe main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRTH-101 as mono therapy and in combination with pembrolizumab,\n* to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose as mono therapy and in combination with pembrolizumab,\n* to evaluate anti-tumor activity of PRTH-101 as mono therapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in selected indications"

Subject has leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, regardless of treatment history.\n12. Subject has current second malignancy at other sites (exceptions: nonmelanomatous skin cancer, adequately treated in situ carcinoma \\[e.g., cervical\\], or indolent prostate cancer under observation).
