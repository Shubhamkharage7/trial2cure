            "briefSummary": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with severe neuropathic pain that is often refractory to pharmacological intervention. Preliminary data suggest brivaracetam is a mechanism-based pharmacological intervention for neuropathic pain in SCI. Based on this and other reports in the literature, SCI-related neuropathic pain is hypothesized to occur largely because of upregulation of synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) within the substantia gelatinosa of the injured spinal cord. Furthermore, compared to placebo, brivaracetam treatment is hypothesized to reduce severe below-level SCI neuropathic pain and increases parietal operculum (partsOP1/OP4) connectivity strength measured by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI). Circulating miRNA-485 levels may be associated with change in pain intensity due to brivaracetam treatment. The study aims to determine the efficacy of brivaracetam treatment for SCI-related neuropathic pain."
