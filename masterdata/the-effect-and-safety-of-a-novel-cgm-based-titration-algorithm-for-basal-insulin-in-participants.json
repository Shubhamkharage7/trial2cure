The comparison aims to study the difference in glycemic control between the two therapies. Participants will be followed for 18 weeks and will be provided with Degludec insulin, insulin pen, and a CGM (Dexcom G6).",

After 2 weeks of blinded CGM baseline observation, participants are randomized 2:1 to CGM-based titration or standard titration by SMBG for 16 weeks. In the SMBG group, all titrated doses will be reviewed by a study physician prior to use and participants will wear a blinded CGM during the whole study. After completion of the 16-week titration, participants are followed up for 2 days. Participants will be divided related to use of sulfonylureas or glinides with a maximum cap of nine participants being treated with sulfonylureas and glinides to complete the study."
