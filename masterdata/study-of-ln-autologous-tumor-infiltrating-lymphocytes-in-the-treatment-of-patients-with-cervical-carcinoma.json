Patients who have active systemic infections, coagulation disorders, or other active major medical illness(es) of the cardiovascular, respiratory, or immune system, including evidence in the medical history of urinary tract obstruction, a positive cardiac stress test, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, or other conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would increase the risk of participation.\n6. Patients with symptomatic and/or untreated brain metastases (of any size and any number)\n\n   \u2022 Patients with definitively treated brain metastases may be considered for Enrollment, and must be stable for \u2265 14 days prior to beginning the NMA-LD preparative regimen\n7.

Patients who have Grade \u2265 2 hemorrhage within 14 days prior to Enrollment (tumor resection)\n17. Cohort 3: Patients may not have active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including pneumonitis, inflammatory bowel disease \\[eg, colitis or Crohn's disease\\], diverticulitis \\[with the exception of diverticulosis\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome \\[granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.\\]).",
