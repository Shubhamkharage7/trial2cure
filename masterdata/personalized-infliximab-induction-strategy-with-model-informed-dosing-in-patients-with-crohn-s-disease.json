Physicians need better ways to inform decisions on treatment.\n\nThe main reason for this research study is to determine if a computer program that formulates a dose based on a patient's blood testing results can better achieve the optimal drug level as compared to standard dosing.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Pilot study to evaluate safety, feasibility and efficacy of utilizing pharmacokinetic modeling to provide an individualized infliximab induction regimen in children and young adults with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. This clinical study is designed with the hypothesis that treatment regimens that account for individual (patient) drug clearance (pharmacokinetic modeling) will not only be safe and cost-effective, but also more effective in reducing intestinal inflammation than as-labeled dosing (ALD) regimens."

During induction, three infusions will occur at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, respectively. The RoadMABTM dashboard will utilize PK modeling software to provide an infliximab starting dose recommendation (range of 5-12 mg/kg) based on the patients biochemical profile. As noted, dosing frequency (weeks) during induction will not be altered during this study. Following the first three doses, the clinician will be informed of their patients PK profile within the RoadMABTM program and with a shared document (paper). RoadMABTM will provide additional dosing recommendations after each infusion (based on the latest drug concentration measures and blood biomarkers) with the final dose and interval selected by the treating physician.",
