            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about treatment for a type of brain tumor called a meningioma. This study will enroll two groups of people. One group will be for people who will receive surgery to remove their brain tumor. The other group will be for people who have previously received treatment for their brain tumor but do not have any other available options for treatment.\n\nThe primary goals of this study are:\n\n1. To measure how much of the study drug is present in tumor tissue taken from patients during surgery to remove their brain tumor\n2. To measure the length of time between a study participant's first dose of study treatment until the time when their brain tumor gets worse or their death",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients will be enrolled in one of two arms, either the presurgical arm or the treatment arm. Patients who will be undergoing surgery to remove their meningioma will be enrolled to Arm I. Patients who have previously received treatment for their meningioma but have exhausted all reasonable treatment options will be enrolled to Arm II.\n\nAll patients will take the study medication, ONC201, by mouth once per week at a dose of 625 mg.\n\n* Arm I patients will receive two doses of ONC201 prior to surgery, with the second dose occurring approximately 24 hours before surgery.\n* Arm II patients will receive one 625 mg dose of ONC201 per week until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.\n\nPrimary Objectives\n\n1. To evaluate the concentration of ONC201 in resected meningioma tissue (Arm I)\n2. To measure progression-free survival in patients receiving ONC201 who have exhausted all other reasonable treatment options (Arm II)\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n1. To evaluate tumor response via radiographic imaging following treatment with ONC201\n2. To correlate dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) expression with tumor response to treatment via molecular studies performed on archival and fresh tissue\n3. To determine overall survival\n4. To determine the efficacy of adding bevacizumab to ONC201 in patients who have progressed on ONC201 alone"

Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness.\n7. Any of the following in the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident. Subjects planning to continue on study after progression with the addition of bevacizumab cannot have uncontrolled hypertension, nephrotic syndrome, or had a history of intracranial bleeding or GI hemorrhage in the last 6 months.\n8. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into the study.\n9. Concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers. Subject must discontinue the drug for 14 days prior to registration.\n10. Prolongation of QT/QTcF interval (QTc interval \\>480 milliseconds) using Frederica's QT correction formula on two ECGs separated by at least 48 hours.\n11.
