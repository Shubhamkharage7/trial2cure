The investigator plans to evaluate how well TPST-1495 works against these cancers by checking blood samples and tumor tissues taken before and after the treatment to see if it is an effective treatment option to help the immune system fight against cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "TPST-1495, a dual antagonist targeting human prostaglandin E2 receptor subtypes EP2 and EP4, has shown promising safety and possesses potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic properties in preclinical research. Based on previous clinical research, the investigator proposes that TPST-1495 treatment could offer anti-cancer benefits to endometrial cancer (EC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.\n\nThis pilot window-of-opportunity study aims to assess the safety and biological effectiveness of administering 50mg TPST-1495 orally once daily for seven days, with discontinuation three days prior to surgical therapy, involving 10 evaluable patients, with five each from the EC and CRC groups, for a maximum total of 20 participants enrolled to ensure 10 evaluable patients."
