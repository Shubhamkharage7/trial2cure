            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial test whether combination chemotherapy works to improve blood test results in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carfilzomib, daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial may help determine if patients who have a small amount of cancer left after the initial treatment, called minimal residual disease, will benefit from the drug combination.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To estimate the rate of sustained minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (MRD negative status at any point, with a repeated MRD negative status one year later) in subjects with high-risk multiple myeloma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe the toxicities associated with this treatment approach in subjects with high-risk multiple myeloma (MM).\n\nII. To estimate the overall response rate, very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate and complete response (CR) rate at the end of induction, end of consolidation, end of maintenance and at two years after the completion of treatment.\n\nIII. To estimate the progression-free survival and overall survival rate.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe the clonal architecture through a combination of genomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic studies before and after treatment, in subjects with high-risk MM.\n\nII. To describe the bone marrow microenvironment through various stages of treatment and the time of MRD negative state and at time of relapse.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION: Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 2-12, lenalidomide orally (PO) days 1-21 of each cycle, daratumumab subcutaneously (SC) days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1 and 2, days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and day 1 of subsequent cycles, and dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCONSOLIDATION: Patients receive carfilzomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15, lenalidomide PO days 1-21, daratumumab SC day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE: Patients receive carfilzomib IV on day 1, lenalidomide PO days 1-21, daratumumab day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography/positron emission tomography(CT/PET) during screening. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, blood sample collection, and echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to10 years."
