            "detailedDescription": "This first-in-human study was initially designed as a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label study, with 2 sequential parts in which TH1902 was administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W):\n\nPart 1 (dose escalation): was comprised of 18 patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors (all comers) that had relapsed or were refractory to standard chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and for which no known effective therapies existed.\n\nPart 2 (dose expansion): was comprised of 18 patients from selected populations with recurrent advanced TNBC, HR+ breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, cutaneous melanoma, thyroid cancer, SCLC, prostate cancer, and other cancers known to express SORT1 that are refractory to standard therapy.\n\nFollowing emerging data from Parts 1 and 2, the Sponsor has made the decision to pause the enrollment of patients in Part 2 of the study and revisit the study design to improve the risk-benefit ratio. Patients who were enrolled in Part 2 of the study that are still benefiting from TH1902 administration will continue following the protocol for Part 2. The study will resume with enrollment in Part 3 and TH1902 will be administered on 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest (3/1), i.e., on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, and in the following population:\n\nPart 3 (dose optimization): will comprise approximately 16 patients diagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed high grade serous ovarian cancer, including high grade peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, or high grade endometrioid cancer, that is refractory or resistant to standard therapies, should not be considered platinum sensitive, and where current therapy is not considered to be providing benefit.\n\nUpon completion of Part 3, an ad hoc interim analysis will be conducted to select at least 2 dosing arms that will offer an acceptable risk-benefit ratio for dose expansion in Part 4 with the following population:\n\nPart 4 (basket expansion): will comprise approximately 20 patients per dose level, per selected cancer type diagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed cancers, where TH1902 has been studied and/or showed activity (in Parts 1 to 3), that is refractory or resistant to standard therapies, and where current therapy is not considered to be providing benefit."

Patients with \\> grade 1 peripheral neuropathy and/or any identified or patient reported muscular weakness (assessed by neuropathy score) regardless of grade at baseline will be excluded from the study.\n18. Patients with leptomeningeal disease or spinal cord compression or active brain metastases are ineligible for enrolment. Patients with treated spinal cord compression that is stable and is not active at time of screening, nor is likely to interfere with the patient survival for at least 3 months, or ability to stay on treatment for at least 2 cycles, are eligible for treatment. Patients with treated brain metastasis that are stable for 4 weeks or longer, and not requiring steroids, are eligible for treatment. Patients with history of brain metastasis should have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 4 weeks of initiating treatment. For patients where MRI is contraindicated (e.g., due to tissue expanders), brain computerized tomography (CT) may be obtained after discussion with Sponsor (replaces exclusion criterion #4).\n19. Have evidence of persistent \u2265 grade 2 ocular toxicity (in addition to exclusion criterion #14).",
