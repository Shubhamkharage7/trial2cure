            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a non-contact Rock Steady Boxing class delivered to participants with Parkinson's Disease via an in-person community-based program. The study will also assess the overall feasibility of integrating an in-person community program within a neuromuscular course in a Doctor of Physical Therapy program.\n\nSpecific Aim: To examine the effects of an in-person community-based Rock Steady Boxing class on the functional mobility, functional endurance, cardiovascular capacity, visual-motor reaction times, quality of life, mood/affect and overall physical activity completion and fear of falling on individuals with Parkinson's Disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be recruited directly from the the Brain Center (non-for-profit neurology clinic). Participants will be educated on the study but advised that their participation is voluntary and researchers will not coerce boxers to participate in the study. Once a participant agrees to participate, the Informed consent will be completed. During this time, participants will be told their participation is voluntary and they can quit at any time. he primary interventions being assessed in this study include the in-person Rock Steady Boxing Class offered at USAHS once per week. Prior to attending the Rock Steady Boxing classes, all participants must be provided with medical clearance from a referring medical doctor. The Rock Steady Boxing classes are 60-90 minutes in duration and include the following 4 components: (1) active warm up (2) functional mobility exercises (3) whole body strengthening exercises and (4) non-contact boxing exercises. During the classes, boxers' vitals are assessed using health rate monitors."
