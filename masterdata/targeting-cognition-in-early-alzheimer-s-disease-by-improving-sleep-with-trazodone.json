The investigators will randomize 100 subjects and administer trazodone and placebo for 4 weeks each with a 4-week washout period in between. A 4-week washout period is more than sufficient due to trazodone's elimination half-life of 10-12 hours. The crossover design will facilitate recruitment and enable the use of the subjects as a control without requiring a parallel placebo arm."
