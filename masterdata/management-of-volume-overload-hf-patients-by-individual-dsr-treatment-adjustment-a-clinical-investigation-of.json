            "detailedDescription": "The study will start with a non-randomized cohort in which 3 eligible subjects will be treated with Infusate 2.0 on top of their usual care while all loop diuretic treatment is stopped. A Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) catheter will be implanted to administer the infusate 14 days post-PD catheter implantation. The infusate will be drained via the same route after up to 24 hr dwell time. This DSR process will be repeated up to daily over a treatment period of 4 weeks (D1-D28). The quantity of infusate and the duration of dwell time will be adjusted based on treatment effect and tolerability.\n\nAfter the treatment period, the PD catheter is removed and a 3 month safety follow-up period starts to the end of study (D29-D120).\n\nAfter Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of 30 days follow-up data (D58) of the non-randomized cohort and DSMB approval to proceed, the 2:1 randomized enrollment of up to 30 additional subjects will be opened.\n\n* DSR Group (N = 20) Treatment: DSR Infusate 2.0 DSR is to be started 14 days post-PD catheter implantation (= D1) for a period of 4 weeks (D28) on top of optimized usual care for HF, while loop diuretic treatment is suspended.\n* Control Group (N = 10) Treatment: Optimized usual care for HF IV loop diuretic treatment is to be started (or continued) after a 14 days observation period (= D1) and can be continued for up to 4 weeks (D28).\n\nAll subjects should then enter the 3 month safety follow-up period (D29-D120) until the end of study (D120)."
