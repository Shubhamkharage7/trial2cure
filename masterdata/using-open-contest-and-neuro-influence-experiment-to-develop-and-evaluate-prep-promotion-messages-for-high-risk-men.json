The investigators hypothesize that participants viewing top messages developed via open contests will show higher brain activation in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) regions than those viewing messages developed by a social marketing approach. The investigators further hypothesize brain activation in the MPFC regions is significantly more correlated with PrEP behavioral intention, initiation, and action than self-reported message effectiveness."
