            "detailedDescription": "The PRE-I-SPY/I-SPY-P1 study is a platform trial with multiple ongoing drug regimen arms. In most cases, the treatment arm will have a dose-finding group (Part 1) and a dose-expansion group (Part 2). Eligibility criteria will vary according to the experimental regimen. Participant eligibility may vary according to the arm or the part within the study arm, including with respect to diagnosis. Arms could include participants diagnosed with certain solid tumors or specifically with breast cancer. Arms may restrict enrollment to a certain molecular pathway abnormality or histologic diagnosis. The trial allows for various study arm designs, with the goal to complete analysis of a study arm in 12 to 18 months."

It also inhibits growth factor-dependent and -independent tumor cell proliferation as well as potently activating ADCC, ADCP, and CDC.\n\nTucatinib is a highly selective, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of HER2 compared to other TKI's (i.e., EGFR). It is well tolerated, crosses the blood brain barrier and can treat CNS disease. It is FDA approved for HER2+ breast cancer.\n\nGiven the promising clinical data for each of these drugs which have different mechanisms, the effect of zanidatamab after T-DXd (Enhertu\u00ae) in breast cancer patients, and the favorable toxicity profile of both drugs, we hypothesize that the combination of tucatinib and zanidatamab will be well tolerated and more efficacious than either drug alone for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive breast cancer.",

Adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective form (i.e., abstinence, (fe)male sterilization) OR two effective forms (e.g., non-hormonal IUD and condom / occlusive cap with spermicidal foam / gel / film / cream / suppository).\n* GIC9: Prior therapy effects: Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior therapy, including radiotherapy, to grade \u22641 and neuropathy to grade \u22642 (except toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient) and recovery from surgical procedures.\n* GIC10: Participant compliance: Patients who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\n* Additional arm specific inclusion criteria as needed by drug arm regimen\n\nGeneral Exclusion Criteria (GEC):\n\n* GEC1: Wash out periods: No other anticancer therapy within the following periods:\n\n  * chemotherapy or investigational agents, 3 weeks\n  * mitomycin C and nitrosoureas, 6 weeks\n  * radiotherapy, 3 weeks\n  * targeted therapy, 2 weeks\n  * MAbs, ADCs, and immunotherapy, 3 weeks\n  * endocrine therapy, no washout needed\n* GEC2: Concurrent therapy with other Investigational Products.\n* GEC3: Prior history of drug/regimen hypersensitivity: History of infusion-related reactions and/or hypersensitivity to IMP or excipients of the study drug/drugs which led to permanent discontinuation of the treatment.\n* GEC4: Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including (active infection, diabetes, pulmonary embolism in the past 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements).\n* GEC5: Cardiovascular disease: History (within 6 months prior to start IMP) of clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as unstable angina, congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, or baseline corrected QT by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) length \\> 470 msec for men and women. The QTcF cut-off value may be modified with supporting data for specific drug regimens.\n* GEC6: CNS tumoral spread: Active uncontrolled/symptomatic central nervous system cancer/spinal cord compression. Previously treated and clinically stable lesions, as per Investigator's judgment, are permitted.\n* GEC7: Liver disease: Patients with clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other known hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.\n* GEC8: Recent major surgery within 4 weeks prior to start IMP treatment\n* GEC9: Pregnancy or breastfeeding\n* GEC10: Individuals accommodated in an institution because of regulatory or legal order; prisoners or participants who are legally institutionalized.\n* GEC11: Other conditions, which in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or the patient's ability to complete the study.\n* Additional arm specific exclusion criteria as needed by drug arm regimen",
