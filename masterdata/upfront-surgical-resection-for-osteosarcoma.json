In order to learn about the patient's experience, the study team will administer questionnaires to the patient and surgeon at various timepoints to assess recovery and the function of the extremity.",

Following biopsy, all patients will undergo wide excision of the tumor followed by systemic multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy consisting of a regimen at least equivalent to the standard of care of high dose Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin (MAP). Patients and/or their parent/guardian will be administered PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) questionnaires, while surgeons will be administered the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) questionnaire at various timepoints through the first year post-surgery."

Scores for each domain range from 1-5 (pain intensity 0-10). Responses to individual items are coded to values and summed to generate a total raw score. Total raw scores are converted/rescaled into a standardized T-score for each participant with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher PROMIS T-scores represent more of the concept being measured\n\nPROMIS 29+2 is similar to PROMIS 25 with the exception of a social roles/activities domain in place of peer relationships, and also includes sleep disturbance and cognitive function domains.
