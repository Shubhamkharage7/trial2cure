            "briefSummary": "The current study is designed to examine underlying mechanisms of action of lingual muscles in the maintenance of airway patency during sleep. The investigators' major hypothesis is that specific tongue muscles are responsible for relieving upper airway obstruction during sleep.",
            "detailedDescription": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction due to inadequate muscle tone during sleep leading to nocturnal hypercapnia, repeated oxyhemoglobin desaturations and arousals. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the therapeutic mainstay for OSA, but adherence remains poor. The loss of motor input to the tongue during sleep has been implicated as a cause for upper airway collapse. Activation of tongue muscles with implanted hypoglossal nerve stimulators is an effective therapy for some OSA patients. Nevertheless, approximately 1/3 of OSA patients did not respond to hypoglossal nerve stimulation despite rigorous selection criteria, leaving large segments of CPAP intolerant patients at risk for OSA-related morbidity. Thus, there is a critical knowledge gap in the role of lingual muscle activity in the maintenance of airway patency.\n\nThe current study is designed to examine underlying mechanisms of action of lingual muscles in the maintenance of airway patency during sleep. The investigators' major hypothesis is that specific tongue muscles are responsible for relieving upper airway obstruction during sleep. To address this hypothesis, the investigators will (1) selectively stimulate specific lingual muscle groups (viz., protrudors and retractors) and measure effects on airway patency during Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE). The investigators will (2) correlate responses in patency to alterations in tongue morphology (as assessed with ultrasound imaging). The investigators will (3) examine the impact of anatomic factors (e.g., the size of the maxillo-mandibular enclosure) on airway responses to stimulation. Patients will (4) undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) determine the extent to which maxillo-mandibular size and tongue size and fat content compress pharyngeal structures. The investigators will (5) assess apnea severity and hypoglossal nerve stimulation with Inspire to measure response to therapy via split-night PSGs. The investigators will (6) examine digital morphometrics to quantify pharyngeal anatomy. A final goal is to (7) measure tongue force, as tongue force measurements may elucidate mechanisms of therapy response as related to neuromuscular control.\n\nThe study will contain two distinct pathways, Study A and Study B, in order to efficiently execute the protocol. Study A will focus primarily on measurements obtained as part of routine clinical care. Study B will focus on enhanced imaging and physiology techniques in patients using lingual muscle stimulation (Inspire).\n\n\\*As of 6/11/2021, the target recruitment for Study A was completed\\*\n\nStudy A:\n\n* To determine the contribution of defects in upper airway function to the pathogenesis of airway obstruction at specific sites of pharyngeal collapse by characterizing upper airway pressure-flow/area relationships during DISE.\n* To determine the impact of jaw thrust and mouth closure maneuvers to functional determinants of upper airway obstruction at specific sites of pharyngeal collapse.\n* To examine effects of maxillo-mandibular restriction and tongue size on upper airway functional properties during DISE.\n\nStudy B (In addition to the objectives for Study A):\n\n* To assess effects of stimulating specific lingual muscles on upper airway patency during natural sleep and drug-induced sleep.\n* To assess whether craniofacial morphology predicts improvements in pharyngeal patency during sleep with stimulation."
