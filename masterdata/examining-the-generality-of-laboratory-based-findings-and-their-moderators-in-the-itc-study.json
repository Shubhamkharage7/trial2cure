Therefore, a priori knowledge of substitutability across novel and widely used tobacco products may forecast the impact of policies on product switching. This study will use a novel method, the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM), to characterize the relative substitutability and appeal (abuse liability) of tobacco products (e.g., conventional cigarettes, nicotine vaping products \\[NVP\\], heated tobacco products \\[HTP\\], and nicotine pouch products \\[NPP\\]), and how the appeal is modulated by relative price, user type, and regulatory environment. Exclusive cigarette smokers and dual cigarette/NVP users, stratified by age, will complete multiple scenarios in the ETM."
