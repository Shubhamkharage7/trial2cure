Assessing the effect of biomarker guided supplementation on pain specific biomarkers through changes in urinary biomarker scores may solidify the necessity for identifying deficiencies to create an individualized treatment plan for pain patients. This study aims to evaluate the effect of biomarker-guided supplementation on the three categories of urinary biomarkers using targeted ingredients specifically designed for oxidative stress, inflammation, and nerve health. This study provides subjects with one of three nutritional supplement formulas based on their specific urinary biomarker test results and assesses changes in their urinary biomarker levels and their quality of life as it relates to their pain over a 3-month period."
