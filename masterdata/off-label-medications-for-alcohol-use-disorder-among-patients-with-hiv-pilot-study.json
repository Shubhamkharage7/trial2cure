            "detailedDescription": "This is a series of three open-label pilot studies that consist of a 12-week intervention including off-label use of medication with MM and a clinical pharmacist-delivered behavioral intervention to treat AUD. Participants will receive counseling that incorporates brief feedback and advice with motivational enhancement techniques to assist the participant in changing their behaviors with respect to alcohol consumption and/or polypharmacy defined as taking five or more medications, particularly if those medications interact with alcohol. In addition, participants will be offered varenicline in the first pilot study. The rationale for utilizing an open-label pilot study design is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of this intervention for the management of AUD. Participants will be interviewed with regards to their perspectives on feasibility and acceptability. They will be instructed to have medication bottles at study visits to assess medication adherence and will be assessed with readiness to change metrics and questions regarding quantity and frequency of alcohol use. Patients will also be asked to complete an AUDIT-C screen and if score \\>/=7, the Alcohol Symptom Checklist at the start of the study period. Several assessments including interviews and laboratory testing will be done at study visits."
