            "briefSummary": "The goal of this research is to test the accuracy of PET/MRI imaging with 18F-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone (FFNP) for measuring progesterone receptor (PR) expression in patients with invasive breast cancer. The hypothesis is that FFNP SUVmax from PET/MRI will correlate well against the semi-quantitative PR immunohistochemistry score.",
            "detailedDescription": "Integrated whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have recently been introduced for clinical use. This technology combines the anatomic and perfusion data obtained with dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI with functional imaging data obtained from PET. For breast imaging, the combination of MRI and PET has important potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide molecular characterization of breast cancer. The overall purpose of this research is to test the accuracy of PET/MRI imaging with 18F-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone (FFNP) for measuring progesterone receptor (PR) expression in patients with invasive breast cancer.\n\nThis is a prospective, one-arm, study which will enroll patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer scheduled for diagnostic breast MRI for preoperative staging/extent of disease evaluation as part of standard of care. Participation in this research study includes a directed breast PET/MRI with the investigational radiopharmaceutical, FFNP. FFNP uptake of the known, biopsy-proven malignancy will be measured on the PET/MRI examinations using standardized uptake values (SUV) and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios."
