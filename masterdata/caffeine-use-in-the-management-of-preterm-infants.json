Infants will be randomized to receive either caffeine or placebo for up to maximum of four additional weeks after meeting clinical criteria to discontinue caffeine.

Oral feedings will be advanced by a standardized 5 step oral feeding protocol. The time it takes to achieve full oral feeds between the treatment and control groups will be compared."
