Participant is willing and able to provide written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participant has a history of chronic pulmonary disease (e.g. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis).\n2. Participant has a history of severe cardiovascular disease (e.g. symptomatic coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure) or cerebrovascular disease (e.g. prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, symptomatic carotid artery disease, prior carotid endarterectomy or other vascular neck surgery).\n3. Participant has a history of intracranial hyper/hypo-tension.\n4. Participant has a history of cerebral aneurysm.\n5. Participant has had previous brain surgery, including stenting.\n6.

Participant has 15 or more headache days per month\n9. Participant has medication-overuse headache (ICHD3 classification 8.2).\n10. Participant has a known history or suspicion of recurring secondary headache which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the study.\n11. Hemiplegic migraine\n12. Participant has other significant and relevant pain problem (e.g. cancer pain, fibromyalgia or other head or facial pain disorders)\n13. Participant has a known history or suspicion of substance abuse or addiction (within the last 5 years) that in the opinion of the investigator may confound the study assessments.\n14. Participant has a history of psychiatric or cognitive disorder and/or behavioural problems which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the study.\n15. Participant belongs to a vulnerable population or has any condition such that his or her ability to provide informed consent, comply with the follow-up requirements, or provide self-assessments is compromised (e.g. homeless, developmentally disabled, prisoner).\n16. For female participants: is pregnant or actively trying to become pregnant.\n17. Participant is participating in any other clinical investigation or has participated in an interventional clinical trial in the preceding 30 days.\n18.
