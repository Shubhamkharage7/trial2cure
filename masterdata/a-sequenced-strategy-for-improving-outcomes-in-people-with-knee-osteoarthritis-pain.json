            "briefSummary": "There is an urgent public health need to reduce reliance on opioids for effective long-term pain management, particularly in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). This effectiveness trial will compare commonly recommended treatments to reduce pain and functional limitations in KOA.These results will lead to improved patient selection for treatment and inform evidence based guidelines by offering well-tested, effective, non-surgical alternatives.",
            "detailedDescription": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disability worldwide, affecting over 30% of older adults. It represents a major global health and economic burden to individuals and society. The rates of KOA have more than doubled in the past 70 years and continue to grow sharply, given increases in life expectancy and population body mass index (BMI). Surgery is often employed to treat KOA, but it is associated with a high rate of persistent pain, and is not a permanent solution. Numerous nonsurgical therapies have been advocated to treat pain in patients with KOA yet are not often used in clinical care. The limited pain relief and functional improvement seen in a subset of knee OA sufferers has led to a high rate of opioid use and disability in this population. The overarching goal of this study is to conduct a sequential parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of conservative behavioral and non-opioid pharmacological treatments (Phase 1) and, among those that indicate interest in obtaining further treatment and those not eligible for conservative treatment, the benefits of procedural interventions (Phase 2). This study will also evaluate whether clinical and psychosocial phenotypes predict short- and longer-term treatment response. The results of this study will examine the effectiveness of each tested intervention and provide meaningful information regarding effectiveness across key subgroups of participants."

This dataset will undergo statistical analyses and form the basis for publishing both primary and secondary trial results. The SKOAP dataset, recognized as valuable for pain management and opioid use research communities, will be formatted for accessibility to non-ERN investigators. Additionally, a data dictionary will accompany the dataset, offering concise definitions for each included data element. Any peculiarities impacting interpretation or analysis will be outlined within the dictionary. Unreliable data elements will be removed, with documentation provided accordingly.",
