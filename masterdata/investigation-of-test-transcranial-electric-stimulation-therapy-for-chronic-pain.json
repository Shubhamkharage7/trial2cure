It requires an inpatient stay on our research unit of about a month. The study is designed to address the cognitive and emotional aspects of chronic pain and other conditions that often accompany this disorder, such as major depression or drug use.",

This will be an open-label study where subjects (n=12) are administered 8-10 sessions of TEST over 4 weeks. Measurements of pain, mood, and memory will be obtained before and after the sessions. The hypothesis is that TEST will be feasible and tolerable in this population."
