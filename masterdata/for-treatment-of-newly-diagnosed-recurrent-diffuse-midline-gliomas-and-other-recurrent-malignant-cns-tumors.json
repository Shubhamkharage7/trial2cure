            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the effects and best dose of ONC206 alone or in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with diffuse midline gliomas that is newly diagnosed or has come back (recurrent) or other recurrent primary malignant CNS tumors. ONC206 is a recently discovered compound that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been shown in laboratory experiments to kill brain tumor cells by causing a so called \"stress response\" in tumor cells. This stress response causes cancer cells to die, but without affecting normal cells. ONC206 alone or in combination with radiation therapy may be effective in treating newly diagnosed or recurrent diffuse midline gliomas and other recurrent primary malignant CNS tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of DRD2 antagonist/ClpP agonist ONC206 (ONC206).\n\nII.

To determine the MTD of ONC206 in combination with focal radiation therapy in newly diagnosed children and young adults with DMG, H3K27 altered (Arm B).\n\nIV. To determine the MTD of ONC206 in combination with reirradiation in children and young adults with progression of DMG, H3K27 altered (Arm C).\n\nV. To determine the MTD of ONC206 in children and young adults with recurrent primary malignant CNS tumors including participants with recurrent DMGs if not eligible for other arms. (Arm D).\n\nVI.

To assess feasibility to obtain Proton (1H) MR spectroscopy (MRS) with standard MRI.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ONC206. Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 arms.\n\nARM A (Children and young adults with DMG H3K27 altered who completed at least one line of prior therapy) and ARM D (Participants with recurrent primary malignant CNS tumors including participants with recurrent DMGs who failed at least one prior therapy including radiation therapy): Patients receive ONC206 orally (PO) up to six times per week. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In case the participant receives clinical benefit from the treatment, treatment could possibly proceed up to 24 months.\n\nARM B (Newly diagnosed children and young adults with DMG H3K27 altered) and ARM C:(Children and young adults with DMG H3K27 altered who have evidence of progression but have not been treated for this progression and are candidates for re-irradiation): Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy daily 5 days a week and receive ONC206 as in Arm A.\n\nAll participants will be permitted to have an optional MRS scans. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for up to 5 years."

For any biologic or small molecule agent with known adverse events that can occur beyond 7 days after administration, the period prior to enrollment must be beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur (these should be discussed with the study team)\n* ARM B: Newly diagnosed children and young adults (Dose escalation: 2-21 years of age; Dose expansion: 2 years of age and above) with a diagnosis of DMG, H3K27 altered are eligible, including spinal cord DMGs.\n* ARM B: Tumor tissue confirmation of DMG is mandatory and pathology must be consistent with a DMG, H3K27 altered.\n* ARM C: Children and young adults with DMGs (Dose escalation: 2-21 years of age; Dose expansion: 2 years of age and above) who have evidence of progression but have not been treated for this progression and are recommended to get re-irradiation.\n* ARM C: Patients must have undergone prior focal radiation therapy as part of their initial therapy and should be at least 6 months from prior radiation therapy. If timing is less than 6 months from prior focal radiation, these patients need to be discussed with the study chair(s).\n* ARM C: Tumor tissue confirmation is mandatory and pathology must be consistent with a DMG, H3K27 altered.\n* ARM C: Participants must have recovered from all acute side effects of prior therapy\n* ARM C: From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have elapsed: 5 half-lives from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 4 weeks from antibodies and must be at least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a biologic or small molecule agent. For any biologic or small molecule agent with known adverse events that can occur beyond 7 days after administration, the period prior to enrollment must be beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur (these should be discussed with the study team)\n* ARM D: Children and young adults with recurrent primary malignant CNS tumors (Dose escalation: 2-21 years of age; Dose expansion: 2 years of age and above ) who have evidence of progression but have not been treated for this progression . Participants who received a surgical resection for that progression are eligible if surgery has no curative intent. These patients need to be discussed with the study team.\n* ARM D: Prior tumor tissue confirmation is mandatory and pathology from the primary tumor must be consistent with malignant CNS tumor (diagnosis of ependymoma is allowed).Tissue at the time of progression is not required.\n* ARM D: Participants must have recovered from all acute side effects of prior therapy\n* ARM D: From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have elapsed: 5 half-lives from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 4 weeks from antibodies and must be at least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a biologic or small molecule agent.

For this reason, females of child-bearing potential and males must agree to use adequate contraception. Adequate methods include: hormonal or barrier method of birth control; or abstinence prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Males treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study and for the duration of study participation\n* Karnofsky \\>= 50 for participants \\> 16 years of age and Lansky \\>= 50 for participants =\\< 16 years of age. Participants who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score\n* Participants must be willing to provide adequate tissue. A minimum of 10-20 paraffin embedded unstained slides OR 1 block with tumor content of 40% or greater is required. Fronzen tissue is also acceptable. Participants who previously enrolled on PNOC022 and provided adequate tissue, may not need to submit additional tissue - confirm with Study Chairs. Participants who do not meet this criteria may be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the Study Chairs.\n* A legal parent/guardian or participant must be able to understand, and willing to sign, a written informed consent and assent document, as appropriate\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Arm A \\& B: For tumors that do not have a pontine or spinal cord epicenter the following specific exclusion criteria apply: Thalamic DMG and cerebellar, H3K27 altered that has undergone standard radiation without concurrent therapy (other than temozolomide).\n* Arm C \\& D: Patients who participated in trials investigating ONC201 in the upfront setting will not be eligible.

Note: Participants that are currently using inhaled, intranasal, ocular, topical or other non-oral or non-intravenous (IV) steroids are not necessarily excluded from the study but need to be discussed with the study chair.\n* Participants with uncontrolled infection.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to the start of therapy.\n* Active illicit drug use or diagnosis of alcoholism.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ONC206.\n* Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems, psychological disorders, dementia, etc. of the participant or family.\n* Any participants with illnesses that may affect absorption of ONC206.\n* Any participants on strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, 2D6, 1A2, 2C9 and 2C19 at least 14 days prior and throughout the study.",
