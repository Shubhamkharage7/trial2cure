This will be a prospective, multicenter, observational study of children 0-21 years of age presenting to the participating pediatric emergency departments for suspected traumatic thoracic injury. Results of POCUS will be compared to that of chest X-ray, final clinical diagnosis, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study hypotheses are that POCUS is highly accurate (90-95%) when compared to chest X-ray, and moderately accurate (\\~80%) when compared to CT or MRI in diagnosing these conditions."
