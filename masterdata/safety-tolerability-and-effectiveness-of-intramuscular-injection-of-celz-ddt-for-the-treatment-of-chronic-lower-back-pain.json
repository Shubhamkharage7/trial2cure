The objective is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CELZ-201-DDT administered as an intramuscular injection for the treatment of lower back pain in patients with Degenerative Disc Disease. Subjects who meet all criteria for inclusion will be enrolled and randomized into either low, medium or high dose of CELZ-201-DDT versus Placebo, with a total of 30 subjects enrolled. Each dosing cohort will contain ten subjects (n=10), with eight subjects (n=8) receiving the investigational product and two subjects (n=2) randomized to receive placebo. Each subject will receive six paraspinal intramuscular injections (three injections per side) of either CELZ-201-DDT or placebo into the lumbar musculature under direct ultrasound guidance."
