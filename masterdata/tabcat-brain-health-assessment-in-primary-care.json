            "briefSummary": "Efficient and user-friendly paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia are needed in primary care. The TabCAT Brain Health Assessment accurately detects cognitive impairment via an appealing tablet interface with automated scoring and EMR integration. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the paradigm on detection rates and other brain health outcomes via a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in 26 Kaiser Southern California primary care clinics.",
            "detailedDescription": "Twenty-six Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) primary care clinics will be randomized in two waves to receive either the TabCAT-BHA paradigm or usual care. Clinics have been matched in pairs by number of providers, median panel size, the racial/ethnic makeup of the patient panel, baseline rates of cognitive impairment diagnosis, rates of telehealth encounters, and percentage of members who are 65+ in the practice. The trial will be conducted over two 18-month waves, with six intervention practices in the first wave and seven intervention practices starting in the second wave. All patients seen at least once across these 26 practices will be included in the trial and the primary analyses will use data extracted from the EMR. Patients in the intervention practices will receive care in accordance with the TabCAT-BHA paradigm whereas patients in the control practices will continue with usual care workflows. The intervention will include a 6-month startup period during which the research team will partner with the physician leads to adapt the paradigm workflows to each practice and onboard the PCPs, and then a 12-month steady state period when effectiveness on the primary and secondary outcomes will be measured. During the TabCAT-BHA paradigm intervention, pragmatically, primary care providers concerned that their patients are exhibiting signs of cognitive decline will refer them to clinical research associates located in the primary care clinics who will then perform the TabCAT-BHA tablet-based test either on the spot or as a scheduled procedure visit. The tablet-based test provides an automated scoring report that includes guidance for providers to identify reversible causes of cognitive impairment, involving a care partner, diagnostic disclosure, community and educational resources, and specialty referral including the option to refer the patient for a \"Brain Health Consultation\" telephone call with a study nurse or social worker."
