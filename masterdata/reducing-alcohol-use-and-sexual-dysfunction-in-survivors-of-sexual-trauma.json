The main questions it aims to answer are: 1) what is the feasibility of the recruitment method, research design, interventionist training methods, and delivery of the intervention; 2) does the intervention, relatively to control, the 2- and 6-month follow-up produces reductions in the quantity/frequency of alcohol use and heavy drinking, sexual distress, and sex-related drinking motives, and sexual revictimization. Participants will engage in both individual and group based intervention for alcohol use, sexual distress, and sexual assault risk. Follow-up assessments are completed at 2- and 6-months following program completion. The intervention will be compared to a general health promotion control group."
