Is willing to consent to non-invasive adhesive tape sampling and DNA mutation burden analysis;\n3. Has a history of 10 or more basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and at least a 10:1 ratio of BCC to other skin cancer types; or\n4. Has a history of 5 or more squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and at least a 5:1 ratio of SCC to other skin cancer types; or\n5. Has a history of 3 or more melanomas; or\n\n   For the immunocompetent controls:\n6. Has no history of skin cancer but is an age, birth sex, and Fitzpatrick phototype match (control) for an enrolled participant.\n\n   For the SOTR groups, a subject will be eligible if he or she:\n7. Is age 50-70;\n8. Received a heart, lung, kidney, or liver transplant at least 5 years prior to study enrollment; or\n9. Has a history of 5 or more keratinocyte carcinomas (BCC or SCC), or a history of 3 or more melanomas following organ transplantation.\n\n   For the SOTR controls:\n10. Is a transplant recipient age 50-70 with no more than 2 keratinocyte carcinomas.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Has applied certain topical medications (corticosteroids, alpha-hydroxy acids, retinoids, antibiotics, etc.) to the skin to be sampled within 30 days of beginning the study;\n2. Has undergone field therapy for actinic keratoses (e.g. 5-fluorouracil) involving the skin to be sampled within the past 12 months;\n3. Has a generalized skin disorder not related to skin cancer such as psoriasis, photosensitivity disorder, or eczematous dermatitis affecting the skin to be sampled;\n4. Has a known allergy to latex rubber or tape adhesives;\n5. Is currently participating in another investigational study, or has participated in another study within 30 days of initiating the current study;\n6. Has applied a sunscreen, moisturizer, or other topical to the skin to be sampled that cannot be adequately removed and may therefore compromise sample collection;\n7. Has clinical findings which the Investigator determines may put the subject at undue risk or may interfere with the study;\n8. Has undergone phototherapy or used a tanning bed within 3 months of beginning the study;\n9. Has used systemic retinoids, chemotherapeutics, or immunotherapy within 3 months of beginning the study;\n10. Has used an immunosuppressive medication within 3 months of study initiation, such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or any of the immunosuppressive biological therapies (TNF-inhibitors, etc.);\n11. Is known or suspected to have a cancer predisposition syndrome (CPS), such as Gorlin syndrome / basal cell nevus syndrome, Xeroderma pigmentosum, Ferguson-Smith syndrome, Oculocutaneous albinism, Epidermolysis bullosa, Epidermodysplasia verruciformis, Fanconi anemia, Rombo syndrome, Bazex-Dupre-Christol syndrome, Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, Dyskeratosis congenita, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome, Lynch syndrome, etc.;\n12. Is known or suspected to harbor a pathogenic germline mutation within one or more cancer predisposition genes, such as TP53, CDKN2A, NF1, BAP1, DICER1, FH, SDHD, VHL, etc.; and\n13.
