            "briefSummary": "This study is a double-blind, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled single-center clinical research study in which 600 mg of gabapentin or placebo will be administered 2 hours preoperatively to 49 patients each undergoing wisdom teeth extraction. We will measure intraoperative opioid use, severity of pain, the number of analgesics taken, and side effect profiles (e.g. nausea/vomiting, dizziness) at the following intervals, 4 hour, 8 hour, 12 hour, 24, and 72 hour post-procedure.",
            "detailedDescription": "Since the 1990s, the amount of prescribed opioids has begun growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, more than 130 people die every day due to opioid overdose. Many medical and surgical specialities have devised various methods to decrease opioid use with adequate pain control. One notable method is preoperative administration of gabapentin. Gabapentin, a prescribed medication, is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat partial seizures, neuropathic pain (e.g.\n\ndiabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain), hot flashes, and restless legs syndrome . Various surgical specialties such as otolaryngology, plastics, general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology have tested the efficacy of gabapentin in reducing postoperative opioid usage without compromising pain control and the result is promising. However, this study has not been done in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The objectives of the study is to determine if preoperative administration of gabapentin can decrease intraoperative and postoperative use of opioid and provide adequate pain control when used with non-opioid pain regimen.\n\nOn the day of consultation visit, subjects will be screened and evaluated by oral and maxillofacial surgery residents. Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. They will then be randomly divided into following groups:\n\n* Group 1a: 49 subjects undergoing wisdom teeth extraction will be receiving 600mg gabapentin PO preoperatively\n* Group 1b: 49 subjects undergoing wisdom teeth extraction will be receiving placebo PO preoperatively.\n\nA subject then will be given a small bag that contains either a gabapentin pill or a placebo pill depending on which group that he or she is assigned to. The subject will be asked to take 600mg of gabapentin or a placebo pill 2 hours prior to their procedure (vs. current standard of care is no pre-medication). On the day of the procedure, they will be accompanied by a guardian or a family member to the clinic. The Procedure will be done by a senior or a chief level resident with supervision of an attending surgeon. Intraoperative opioid use will be recorded on a standardized anesthesia sheet. All cases will include IV sedation that involves a concoction of fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, and dexamethasone. The medications will be given in boluses depending on their weight but not necessarily strictly kg-based. For example, fentanyl will be given between 25 -50mcg, midazolam 2.5-5mg, propofol 10-40mg and ketamine 10-50mg. Local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine will also be given after sedation. Additional doses of local anesthetic can be given if the patient experiences sharp pain. Additional doses of propofol and/or fentanyl can be given if the patient's systolic blood pressure increases by 10 mmHg or heart rate increases by 20 bpm acutely. All used anesthetics will be recorded. After the procedure, standard postoperative pain regimen will be prescribed including 28 tablets of ibuprofen 600mg PO q6h prn pain and 12 tablets of Norco 5/325mg PO q6h prn pain with an instruction to take Norco only when a subject is in severe pain (pain level greater than 7 out of 10). To assess the severity of pain and its impact on functioning, scientists developed Brief Pain Inventory from which Modified Brief pain inventory (MBPI) was created to better fit the need for our research; MBPI will not only ask the severity of pain but also the number of analgesics taken and side effect profiles (e.g. nausea/vomiting, dizziness) at the following intervals, 4 hour, 8 hour, 12 hour, 24, and 72 hour post-procedure. The patient is to turn in the MBPI form during their 1 week postoperative follow up visit. If for any reason, the patient misses the follow up appointment, we will try to reschedule their visit within 5 days. If the patient does not show up at all, our members will find out the reason for the no show and record it for the publication purpose."
