To define the differences in the gut and breast microbiomes between participants undergoing mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction who develop post-operative implant infection and those who do not.\n\nII. To determine the effects of post-operative antibiotics on the gut and breast microbiomes after mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT A: Participants receive postoperative antibiotics to take for at least 7 days post-operatively.\n\nCOHORT B: Participants receive no antibiotics post-operatively in the absence of clinical evidence of infection.\n\nParticipants are followed up for 90 days."

The resulting product is summed across species, and multiplied by -1. Shannon's equitability (EH) can be calculated by dividing H by Hmax (here Hmax = lnS).
