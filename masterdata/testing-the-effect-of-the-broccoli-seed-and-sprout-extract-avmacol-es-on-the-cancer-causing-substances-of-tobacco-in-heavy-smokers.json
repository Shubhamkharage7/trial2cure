            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether broccoli seed and sprout extract works to break down cancer causing substances of tobacco in heavy smokers. Smokers are at increased risk for developing lung, head and neck, and other cancers. Broccoli seed and sprout extract may help break down and remove toxic substances caused by tobacco use and possibly produce substances that may protect cells from tobacco smoke-induced damage in current smokers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine whether broccoli sprout/broccoli seed extract supplement (broccoli seed and sprout extract \\[BSSE\\]) sustainably increases the urinary excretion of the mercapturic acids of the tobacco carcinogens benzene and/or acrolein over a 12-week exposure period in otherwise healthy, current smokers.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BSSE over a 12-week exposure period.\n\nII. To evaluate whether BSSE sustainably increases the urinary excretion of the mercapturic acid of the tobacco carcinogen crotonaldehyde.\n\nIII. To evaluate the bioavailability of BSSE measured as sulforaphane (SF) metabolites and assess for a dose-response relationship between the effective SF dose delivered by BSSE and the detoxification of benzene and acrolein.\n\nIV. To determine whether the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes are important genetic modulators of detoxification of tobacco carcinogens in the setting of prolonged exposure to BSSE.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate modulation of mucosal signatures of nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation, inflammation, and innate immunity.\n\nII. To evaluate modulation of nasal epithelial gene signatures including smoking, lung cancer, and squamous dysplasia.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive broccoli seed and sprout extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo the collection of blood and nasal epithelial cell samples at visits 2 and 6 and the collection of buccal cell samples at visits 2, 3, and 6.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo the collection of blood and nasal epithelial cell samples at visits 2 and 6 and the collection of buccal cell samples at visits 2, 3, and 6.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks."

For this reason,, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Participants with known chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are not eligible for this trial due to potential interaction between sulforaphane and suppressive anti-viral therapy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of invasive cancer within the past 2 years, except for excised and cured non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Participants who continue adjuvant treatment for an index cancer occurring \\> 2 years ago, such as adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer, are excluded. Participants who are on anti-neoplastic treatment for a chronic malignancy, such as multiple myeloma or chronic myelogenous leukemia, are excluded\n* Ongoing use of a nutraceutical or dietary supplement containing glucoraphanin or sulforaphane\n\n  * Note, participants will be eligible if they agree to stop the glucoraphanin or sulforaphane product at least 7 days prior to the baseline visit (7-day washout)\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Avmacol ES (BSSE)\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia\n* Any other condition or lifestyle factor, that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, may adversely affect the participant's ability to complete the study or its measures or pose significant risk to the participant\n* Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of BSSE on the developing human fetus are unknown.
