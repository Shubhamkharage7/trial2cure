The dose escalation phase of the trial is designed to enroll a set number of patients per cohort at protocol defined dose levels. After the initial patients are treated at a given dose level and monitored for at least 28 days, available data will be reviewed, and initiation of the next dosing group will proceed with consideration given to the overall safety profile.\n\nThe expansion phase of the trial is designed to further evaluate safety and activity and to confirm the RP2D(s)."
