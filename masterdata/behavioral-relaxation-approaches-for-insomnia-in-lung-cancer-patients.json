The investigators will be enrolling a total of 20 patients who have insomnia symptoms. Patients will use a behavioral intervention to help with their sleep.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective is to implement and examine the outcomes of a simplified relaxation intervention, Assisted Relaxation Therapy (ART), for lung cancer patients who experience insomnia symptoms and other sleep difficulties. This intervention includes using a smartphone application. A variety of surveys will be used to track the interventions' efficacy throughout the study. To test these interventions, the investigators will recruit participants (n=20) from a weekly oncology patient list located within the University of Pennsylvania. Participants with a history of lung cancer who are recruited into the study must have a smartphone. Participants will use the ART intervention over the course of 2 weeks and will receive surveys at enrollment (D0), end of intervention (D14) and 2 weeks post-intervention (D30). Missing data will be handled using imputation methods. The investigators will analyze the data using statistical programs to determine progress throughout the study."

Randomization and survey baseline measurements from eligible participants will occur on day -1 and the intervention period will last until day fourteen. On day thirty, two weeks post intervention(s), surveys will be emailed to participants to track any change in sleep quality, respiratory quality, and perception of sleep.",
