We will be testing the effects of each of these regimens on cells in the immune system. We hypothesize that the combination of focused ultrasound ablation and gemcitabine will decrease myeloid-derived suppressor cells and will increase T cell activity. We also hypothesize that focused ultrasound ablation and low-dose gemcitabine will be safe and will result in non-inferior surgical completion rates and tumor margin assessments."
