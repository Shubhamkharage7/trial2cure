            "detailedDescription": "* This is a non-interventional single center, two-arm comparative study of the outcomes for patients following successful, uncomplicated cataract surgery.\n* There will be 155 subjects enrolled in each arm (310 subjects total).\n* Consecutive screening will be used for enrollment beginning from the first bilateral IOL implanted.\n* All testing will be at a single site with subjects coming from 4 surgeons (all use similar surgical technique) at that site.\n* Each surgeon will contribute a minimum of ten subjects per arm.\n* Subjects will be assessed post-operatively during a minimum of five months after their second-eye surgery.\n* Binocular defocus curves will be performed from +1.00 to -4.00 in 0.50 diopter steps and with +0.25 and -0.25 added.\n* Self-reporting of visual complaints will be assessed.\n* IOLSAT (IOL Satisfaction) and QUVID (Quality of Vision After Surgery) questionnaire will be administered at the study visit.\n* Halo and Glare simulator VS Halo \\& Glare (visu-med.com) will be administered at the study visit.\n* All visual acuity testing will be measured in LogMar and all study technicians and evaluators will be masked.\n* PanOptix subjects will have been implanted with the toric and non-toric models.\n* Synergy subjects will have been implanted with the toric and non-toric models.\n* Demographic data will be collected to match the groups as closely as possible."
