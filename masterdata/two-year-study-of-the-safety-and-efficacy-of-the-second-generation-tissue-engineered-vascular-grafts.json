Patients will be monitored for adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). Special attention will be paid to the incidence of stenosis. We will determine graft-related morbidity and mortality for the second generation TEVGs which will include any post-operative complication such as any aneurismal dilation, stenosis, thromboembolic or infectious event that requires treatment and is thought to be caused by the graft as determined by the investigators and confirmed by the data safety monitoring board. The graft related complication rates will be compared between the first and second generation TEVGs. An interim analysis will be performed to assess the incidence of early (\\<6 month) graft-related complications in the first 6 enrolled patients. Safety and tolerability will be assessed through serial imaging, to determine the effect of growth and remodeling on graft performance through echocardiography and 4-dimensional MRI. All appropriate patients requiring EC TCPC who meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated for enrollment in the clinical trial. All enrolled subjects will be required to have follow-up visits at Nationwide Children's Hospital for a minimum of 2 years following implant. After obtaining informed consent for the patient's parents, patients with single ventricle cardiac anomalies will undergo EC TCPC using a tissue engineered conduit. Post-operative care and monitoring will follow an established, standardized, clinical algorithm in which the patient's clinical status including complications and measurements of graft function will be serially evaluated and recorded over a two year period using physical examination, echocardiography, and MRI."

Specifically, for each TEVG manufactured, 1 ml of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and a 5mm x 5mm section of the seeded scaffold will be sampled, packed, and transported to the RM Innovation Catalyst per their instructions. In addition, copies of the batch record and completed certificate of analysis will be forwarded to the NIH-designated laboratory.",

Every 6 months throughout the study, data will be shared with RM Innovation Catalyst, with a final locked data set no later than six months prior to the end of the award. Data from our long-term follow up policy will be made available on an annual basis if requested by the RM Innovation Catalyst or the NIH.",

A Clinical Study Report will be submitted to the US FDA following the International Conference on Harmonization E3 Guideline for Industry: Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports. Summary results of the trial will be submitted to ClinicalTrial.gov within one year of the primary completion date (per regulation and NIH policy). Results of screening tests and subjects participation in the study and ongoing test results will be shared with their primary care physician and/or primary cardiologist if cardiac care is being provided outside of Nationwide Children's Hospital."
