The study will also assess the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and sustainability of the ACCELERATE model of care. The ACCELERATE model combines a standardized method for outreach, the use of telehealth for rapid access to an HIV care provider, a simplified pre-approved HIV regimen, a free 30-day medication starter supply, and re-linkage to medical care.",

Subjects may experience embarrassment and social stigmatization if private details about their health conditions, behaviors, or personal history become known to others in their community or social circles. The loss of privacy may lead to psychological distress, anxiety, or emotional harm, can expose individuals to discrimination or prejudice. Fear of privacy breaches may result in reduced willingness of individuals to participate in future research studies, impacting the scientific community's ability to conduct meaningful research.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, we incorporated robust privacy protection measures, including secure data storage and de-identification of data."
