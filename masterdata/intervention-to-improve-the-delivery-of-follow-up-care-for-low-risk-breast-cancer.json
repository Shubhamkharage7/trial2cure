This study examines whether the intervention, titled REASSURE, improves survivors' preparedness for survivorship. Up to 110 participants will be on study for up to 18 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators plan a single site prospective, randomized, trial that will compare the effect of REASSURE on survivor preparedness against usual care. Survivors will be identified from breast oncology clinics within UW Health.\n\nREASSURE is comprised of three components: 1) the REASSURE PRO assessment, which assesses survivors' symptoms and/or concerns, 2) a recommendation for or against a follow-up visit based on survivors reported symptoms /concerns using pre-established thresholds, and 3) REASSURE survivorship messaging.\n\n* Primary Objective\n\n  * Compare survivors' preparedness for survivorship with REASSURE versus usual care.\n* Secondary Objectives\n\n  * Determine the acceptability of REASSURE for survivors living in rural and non-rural areas.\n  * Assess changes in survivor reported symptoms and number of follow-up visits with REASSURE versus usual care."
