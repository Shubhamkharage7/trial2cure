            "detailedDescription": "The objective of the proposed study is to longitudinally collect biomarkers from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and control participants in order to further elucidate both potential causes and treatments for ALS. The investigators will collect blood or any of the following biofluids: blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and process, analyze and store plasma, serum, whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and/or ribonucleic acid (RNA). Blood collected in this study may also potentially be used to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Excess samples will be stored in a repository at Massachusetts General Hospital ALS Sample Repository for future research on ALS and related motor neuron diseases. Planned analyses may include but will not be limited to: exploring immune cell populations, gene expression profiling, and analysis or metabolites, proteins, RNA, DNA obtained from blood and/or exploring associated clinical parameters. Analyses will explore the differences of these factors between ALS and control subjects.\n\nSamples and clinical information will be collected from patients with ALS and controls. Samples will be collected from ALS subjects a maximum of 7 times over a period of up to 30 months, with approximately 3 months (and no less than 2 months) between visits. Controls will consist of participants who do not have chronic neurodegenerative diseases or diseases that mimic ALS. Up to 60 ALS subjects and 30 control subjects will be enrolled in the study."
