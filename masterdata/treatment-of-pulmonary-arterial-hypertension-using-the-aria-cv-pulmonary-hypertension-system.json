The purpose of this study is to validate that the clinical use of the Aria CV PH System is safe for the patient and to evaluate its performance in treating patients with PH and right heart dysfunction.\n\nThe study will be conducted in a maximum of 20 centers in the United States and up to 30 patients will receive implants.\n\nPatients will be evaluated at each of the following time intervals: pre-operative, implant procedure, 7-day (or discharge if earlier), and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, 18-, 21-, and 24-months post index procedure. The Aria CV PH System will be assessed at each follow-up visit. The duration of the study is anticipated to last about 2 years for each patient."
