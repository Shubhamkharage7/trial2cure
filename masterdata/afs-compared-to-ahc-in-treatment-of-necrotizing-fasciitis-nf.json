This study is comparing acellular fish skin graft (AFS) to standard of care allograft (AHC) in the treatment of NF. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes and time until autograft take in patients that were treated with AHC or AFS prior to permanent autografting to treat NF.",

Subjects eligible to receive study treatment will be any adult patient (18 years of age or older) admitted to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center or Advanced Wound Clinic at Doctors Hospital Augusta with a diagnosis of NF that has been treated and is stable. Prior wound excisions will be allowed until the surgeon has deemed the wound stable and free from necrotizing processes.\n\nExclusion criteria will be positive pregnancy test on admission, subject has active diagnosis of any autoimmune process, or cancer that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the subject from successfully participating in the study."
