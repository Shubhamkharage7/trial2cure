            "briefSummary": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) impose a significant global health burden. Yet, no effective therapies currently exist for AKI, and only a few are available for CKD.\n\nDespite significant effort from industry and academia, development of pharmacologic therapies for AKI and CKD has been hampered by:\n\nNon-predictive animal models The inability to identify and prioritize human targets The limited availability of human kidney biopsy tissue A poor understanding of AKI and CKD heterogeneity Historically, AKI and CKD have been described as single, uniform diseases. However, growing consensus suggests that different disease pathways lead to different subgroups of AKI and CKD (AKIs and CKDs).\n\nAccess to human kidney biopsy tissue is a critical first step to define disease heterogeneity and determine the precise molecular pathways that will facilitate identification of specific drug targets and ultimately enable individualized care for people with AKI and CKD.\n\nA number of research centers across the United States are collaborating to bring state-of-the-art technologies together to:\n\n* Ethically obtain and evaluate kidney biopsies from participants with AKI or CKD\n* Define disease subgroups\n* Create a kidney tissue atlas\n* Identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies\n\nThe KPMP is made up of three distinct, but highly interactive, activity groups:\n\n* Recruitment Sites: The recruitment sites (RS) are responsible for recruiting participants with AKI or CKD into the longitudinal study and performing the kidney biopsy.\n* Tissue Interrogation Sites: The tissue interrogation sites (TIS) are responsible for developing and using innovative technologies to analyze the biopsy tissue.\n* Central Hub: The central hub is responsible for aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing the generated data and providing scientific, infrastructure, and administrative support for the KPMP consortium.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is a prospective cohort study, whose goal is to use deep molecular phenotypes of kidney biopsies, along with longitudinally collected clinical phenotypic data, in order to develop new disease ontologies, classification systems, and treatments for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since its inception, the KPMP has sought out and included substantive patient-representative feedback regarding disease experience, lack of innovation in new kidney disease therapies and patient tolerance for risk levels in balance with potential benefits both to the individual and society.\n\nThe KPMP Has publicly and operationally committed itself to always put participants and their best interests first and this foundational principle informs and undergirds every facet of the study. Both AKI and CKD are conditions that impose a significant global health burden. Yet, no effective therapies currently exist for AKI, and only a few are available for CKD. The network will utilize state-of-the-art methods to perform molecular interrogation of the tissue and to link the molecular data to kidney structure and clinical information in the form of a kidney tissue atlas.\n\nMolecular and imaging data derived from kidney tissue will be integrated with clinico-pathologic and genetic information, as well as other data derived from analyses of fluid biospecimens, including peripheral blood, urine, and stool. Using advanced analytics to integrate the data, KPMP will aim to define kidney disease subgroups in molecular terms by identifying critical cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies.\n\nPatients with AKI or CKD will be recruited from clinical care encounters (e.g., clinic visits for CKD patients, hospitalization or emergency room visits for AKI patients) and from electronic resources (e.g., existing registries, electronic health records). All study procedures are designed to optimize participant safety and will be ethically conducted, ensuring subjects fully understand the scope of the study and any possible risks.\n\nFor each participant, kidney tissue will be obtained for molecular phenotyping and clinical diagnosis. The diagnostic interpretation will be returned to the participant's primary caregiver to inform clinical care, but no treatment interventions will be prescribed by the KPMP. In addition to kidney biopsy, the study will involve collection of baseline (time of biopsy) and longitudinal biospecimens (including urine, plasma, serum, DNA and stool) and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Participants will be followed through scheduled in-person and remote (telephone) study visits, as well as through periodic review of electronic health records."

A special population of people with long-standing type 1 diabetes (more than 25 years) who remain free of clinically-evident DKD will also be included.\n\nFor AKI, the focus will be on acute intrinsic non-glomerular disease, primarily on acute tubular necrosis (ATN). KPMP will also include a special population of patients at risk for AKI or with early AKI captured by an open (surgical) kidney biopsy performed at the time of clinically indicated laparotomy. The rationale for including this special AKI population is that AKI often occurs early in the clinical course of conditions like sepsis, major surgery and trauma.",
