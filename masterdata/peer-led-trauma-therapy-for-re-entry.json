This research will help identify if a PTSD treatment group that is used in community settings, and led by individuals with lived experience, is helpful in reducing PTSD symptoms among people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.\n\nParticipants will complete an interview to determine whether they are experiencing PTSD, and if so, will participate in a 6-week therapy group treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Two community Certified Peer Specialists (CPSs) who have experienced incarceration and re-entry from prison, and who have experienced trauma will be trained on delivering group Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).\n\nWorking with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) and community organizations serving formerly incarcerated individuals, researchers will screen individuals for PTSD treatment need, and invite 24 eligible individuals to participate in group CPT co-led by one of the trained CPSs and a trained community therapist or provider.\n\nEligible participants who are enrolled in the study will be invited to complete a 6-week (12 sessions total) group CPT therapy treatment for PTSD. Participants will also complete pre-, mid-, and post-treatment mental health surveys. Participants will also complete a post-treatment focus group where they are asked about their experience in the therapy and to provide feedback on the study as a whole."
