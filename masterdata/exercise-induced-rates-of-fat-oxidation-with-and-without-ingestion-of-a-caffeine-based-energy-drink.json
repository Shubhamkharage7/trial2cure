The research will employ a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design involving 15 participants. Initial screening includes health assessments and completion of a health history questionnaire, as well as a VO2peak assessment. Participants will replicate their diet before every study visit. Subsequent visits involve baseline assessments, ingestion of either a placebo or a caffeinated energy drink, followed by cognitive tests and a cycling exercise bout at moderate intensity, followed by a exercise performance cycling time trial. Measurements, including heart rate, perceived exertion, blood samples, and expired gases, will be collected during and after exercise. The study will have two identical testing visits, separated by at least a week, with participants consuming different beverages to assess their impact on cognitive function and exercise performance."
