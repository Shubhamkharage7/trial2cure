            "detailedDescription": "A current research debate is whether glenosphere size has a significant clinical impact on a patient's range of motion (ROM) following RSA. Some researchers have shown an association between increased glenosphere size and improved ROM, but no study has determined the absolute minimal motion differences that would be recognizable or beneficial by patients. This is mostly attributable to limitations such as small sample sizes as well as the fact that shoulder dynamics are multifactorial in nature. Most studies have shown an increased ROM with larger glenosphere sizes.1 Because smaller patients are often times female and receive smaller implants, female patients may be more susceptible to limited ROM. The purpose of this study is to determine if a larger glenosphere allows for greater ROM in female patients undergoing RSA."
