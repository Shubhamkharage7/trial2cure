The study will compare the periodontal outcomes in patients who use these toothbrushes during the post-surgical period.",

Three Investigational device include Dual Light Therapy Sonic Toothbrush (BristlTM Toothbrush), Sonic Toothbrush(BRistlTM) and manual toothbrush to target disease gingivitis in 189 patients. Categorical variables scored from Plaque Index and Gingival Index will be analyzed using Fisher exact test and McNemar test. Parametric methods will be used to analyze data from Bleeding on Probing and Periodontal Probing Depth. To determine differences between groups and within each test at all time points, Student t-test will be used."
