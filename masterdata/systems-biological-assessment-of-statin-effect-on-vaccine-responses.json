            "briefSummary": "This study is being done to answer the question: Does the use of statin lipid-lowering medication change the effect of influenza vaccine? The research team will use the knowledge gained from answering this question to understand how this medication affects long-lasting immune responses to vaccines. The researchers will study the immune response to the influenza vaccine in the blood (where antibodies are). The team will also look at how statin therapy affects the bacteria that live in the gut by collecting stool samples. To be in this research, participants must be adults willing to receive vaccines.",
            "detailedDescription": "Statins are widely used for their lipid-lowering and cardiovascular protective effects. Additional research has shown that statins can be anti-inflammatory and play a part in modulating the immune system. These effects are called into action in events such as pneumonia, influenza infection, and sepsis. This study will include a screening visit, a statin therapy initiation visit (if the participant is in the statin therapy group), a vaccination visit, and a series of follow-up visits. The statin medication will be dispensed by the study staff with clear instructions on how to take the medication for two months (one month prior to vaccination, and one month after vaccination). Other study procedures include a collection of medical history and medications taken, a urine pregnancy test for participants who are biologically able to become pregnant, a recording of vital signs, and a collection of any adverse events that the participant experiences during their participation in the study. The stool will be collected in one screening visit, at the vaccination visit, and one follow-up visit. Safety tests to evaluate muscle health and liver function will be obtained as well at screening and for participants selected to receive the statin therapy, at two follow-up visits. Memory Aid will be completed by the participant after vaccination.\n\nThe blood and stool samples collected during this study will be stored and tested to evaluate how the immune system responds to statin therapy and vaccination over time. The remaining unused samples will be stored for use in future research.\n\nThis research will help advance the knowledge that researchers have on how the immune system reacts to a vaccine if previously exposed to a statin therapy regimen. This will, in turn, enable us to identify the factors that help predict the extent of durability of protection gained from a specific vaccine. This may impact the way future vaccines are developed to provide long-lasting immunity against infections."
