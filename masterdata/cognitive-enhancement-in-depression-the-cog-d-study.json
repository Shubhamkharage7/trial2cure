The investigators will randomize 20 elderly depressed outpatients to either double-blinded active or sham bifrontal tDCS plus daily nCCR over 4-weeks. Multimodal MRI (focused on the cognitive control network; CCN) and psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluations will be obtained at baseline and following intervention completion. Long-term CCN cognitive effects will be explored 3-months post-intervention via cognitive assessments."
