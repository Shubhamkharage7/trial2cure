            "briefSummary": "The researchers are doing this study to test the safety of combining bexarotene with TSEB radiotherapy in people who have a common form of CTCL called mycosis fungoides (MF).\n\nBexarotene is a form of vitamin A that activates proteins called retinoid X receptors, which may stop the growth of cancer cells and kill them. TSEB radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that treats the entire surface of the skin with very low doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. This type of radiation does not pass through the outer layers of the skin into the tissues and organs below the skin.\n\nThe study researchers think that giving bexarotene treatment at the same time as treatment with TSEB radiotherapy may be more effective against MF than either treatment given alone or in sequence (one after the other)."
