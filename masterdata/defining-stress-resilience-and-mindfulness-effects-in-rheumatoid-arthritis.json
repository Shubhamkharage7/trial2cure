The main goals of this pilot study are to:\n\n* Assess patient satisfaction with a mindfulness course\n* Identify barriers to participation in, or completion of, a mindfulness course\n* Gather initial information to understand how a mindfulness course impacts RA symptoms\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Complete online questionnaires\n* Attend two in-person study visits, involving a brief joint exam and blood draw\n* Roughly half the participants will have the chance to participate in an 8-week online mindfulness course\n* Roughly half the participants will be invited to participate in an online focus group following completion of the mindfulness course\n\nResearchers will compare those in the mindfulness course with those receiving standard care in preparation for a larger future study to see how mindfulness impacts stress and inflammation in individuals with RA.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will complete an initial eligibility screening, and if they are eligible, they will meet with a study staff member to review study procedures and answer any questions they might have about participating. If they would like to participate following this meeting, they will provide written consent and be enrolled in the study. Following enrollment, participants will complete an in-person study visit that will last up to one hour and include a brief joint exam, blood draw, and questionnaires. After this study visit, they will be randomly assigned to \"treatment-as-usual\" (TAU) or the mindfulness group. If assigned to the mindfulness group, they will participate in an 8-week online mindfulness course and online focus group following the course. All participants will complete a final in-person study visit at the end of the study, which will mimic the procedures of the first study visit."
