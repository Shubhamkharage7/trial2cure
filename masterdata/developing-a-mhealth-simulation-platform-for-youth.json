            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will purposively select N=20 youth with at least 6 youth from each of 3 age ranges (10-12, 13-15, and 16-18) from eligible participants. Youth will use the software in their home environment for 12-weeks. Youth's diabetes device data will be used to select simulation content, targeted to meet each participant's educational needs. Youth will meet with research staff via video chat at the onset of testing where a URL link to the platform will be shared. Youth will be assigned 3 scenarios/week. At the end of each scenario youth are guided to additional resources in the platform that they may choose to access. Youth will meet with a member of the research team via video chat or phone call weekly to discuss platform issues or confusion as well as any questions regarding self-management content. Platform performance will be monitored by researchers and performance data will be collected and stored within the application database.\n\nFeasibility measures will include recruitment, weekly research sessions attendance, and global attrition data. Sustained engagement measures will be collected from the application database and will include the frequency platform was accessed, number of assigned simulations completed (3 per week), and additional, optional, content accessed. Glycemic control measures including A1C will be obtained from the youth's EHR. Youth's diabetes devices will be downloaded at baseline and at 4, 6 and 12 weeks. Glucose values from device downloads will be aggregated into derived measures of glucose control consistent with American Diabetes Association guidelines on glucose targets. Self-management patterns and responsiveness will be assessed using pre- and post- diabetes device downloads at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks."
