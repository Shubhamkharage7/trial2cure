This study aims to develop a program to help increase physical activity and reduce stress in cancer survivors who live in rural areas.",

Needs related to psychosocial distress and health behaviors in rural patients with cancer.\n\nIb. Needs related to implementing interventions within the treatment setting. Ic. Barriers to intervention delivery/participate. Id. Preferred means/methods for referring participants and receiving information related to the intervention.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess time spent sitting in prolonged bouts of 20 consecutive minutes or more (minutes/day).\n\nII. To assess daily number of steps (collected using the activPAL over 7 days at week 8, data will be averaging over 7 days to get minutes per day).\n\nIII. To assess psychosocial distress measured using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer scores.\n\nIV. To assess health-related quality of life measured using the SF-36 short form.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPART I: Patients and providers complete a questionnaire and attend an interview over 1 hour.\n\nPART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients attend face-to-face mind-body sessions focused on stretching, breathing, and relaxation twice a week and receive targeted text messages daily on their smartphone for 8 weeks.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive usual care."
