            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the side effects and best dose of TGFbi natural killer (NK) cells (TiNK) when given together with isatuximab for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that has not responded to treatment (refractory). NK cells are a type of white blood cell that are known to spontaneously attack cancer cells. TiNK are NK cells made in a laboratory to have a higher response to tumor cells. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as isatuximab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Patients also receive standard treatment (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone) on this trial. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Dexamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving TiNK and isatuximab with standard treatment may be a safe and effective treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of transforming growth factor beta imprinted natural killer cells (TiNK) and isatuximab in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) relapsed or refractory (R/R) to BCMA-targeting therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria of TiNK and isatuximab in patients with MM R/R to BCMA-targeting therapy.\n\nII. To determine the time to response (TTR), time to next therapy (TTNT), the duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) at 1 year.\n\nIII. To determine correlatives of outcomes. IV. To assess quality of life (QOL) with therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TiNK followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on day 1, dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4, TiNK IV on day 8, and isatuximab IV on days 8 and 15 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy during screening and on study, as well as optionally during follow up. Patients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) during screening and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 60 days. Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease follow up every 12 weeks for up to 2 years."
