            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized pilot study is to assess feasibility of the trial and to collect information to inform the design of a definitive trial. Adult patients ages 60 years or older with a low-energy minimally displaced femoral neck fracture (FNF) treated with surgery will be eligible to participate in the study. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups, hip arthroplasty or internal fixation. Participants will be followed for 1 year.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nearly half of all elderly hip fractures are femoral neck fractures (FNFs) and approximately 20% are minimally displaced. Internal fixation has remained the treatment of choice for these injuries because these fractures can be fixed in situ and the surgical implants can be inserted with little surgical dissection. Patients treated with internal fixation experience high complication rates, with the pooled risk of reoperation and mortality each above 14%. Preliminary data have suggested arthroplasty for minimally displaced fractures may lead to better patient outcomes, including improved ambulation, fewer reoperations, and a lower risk of death compared to internal fixation. While the preliminary data supporting the use of arthroplasty for minimally displaced fractures is promising, the necessary evidence to make this significant practice change remains lacking.\n\nThe eventual definitive trial has significant potential to change clinical practice and optimize patient outcomes for individuals that experience a minimally displaced FNF. Treating minimally displaced FNFs with arthroplasty, instead of internal fixation, would be a paradigm shift in clinical care. This pilot study will demonstrate feasibility of the definitive trial and be used to refine aspects of the study protocol as necessary. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated, the pilot activities will be considered a vanguard phase for the definitive clinical trial.\n\nAdult patients ages 60 years or older with a low-energy minimally displaced femoral neck fracture treated with surgery will be eligible to participate in the study. Patients will be randomized to receive either hip arthroplasty or internal fixation. Patients will be followed for 1 year, with visits occurring at 6 weeks, 4 months, 8 months, and 1 year after fracture. At each follow-up, mortality, ambulation, days at home, and health status will be collected.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess feasibility of the trial and to collect information to inform the design of the definitive trial. The feasibility outcomes will include participant enrollment, adherence to treatment allocation, data collection methods, and compliance with key aspects of the protocol."
