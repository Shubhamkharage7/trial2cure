            "detailedDescription": "Heat waves are the leading cause of death among natural disasters in the United States.\n\nElderly individuals are disproportionately more likely to become ill or die during heat waves. While the elderly have a reduced ability to regulate their body temperature,8-10 hospitalizations and deaths in this population during heat waves are primarily due to cardiovascular and/or respiratory complications, not solely hyperthermia. While previous research has primarily focused on the thermal and cardiovascular consequences of healthy aging, very little research has focused on the physiological responses to heat exposure in older individuals with chronic disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Notably, epidemiological data suggests that pulmonary complications are a leading cause of heat wave-related hospitalizations in older adults with a diagnosis of COPD, yet nothing is known regarding the physiological mechanisms by which those with COPD are most susceptible to heat waves. To fill this important gap, the investigators will identify the physiological responses that occur in this population, relative to healthy age-matched individuals, during two unique heat wave simulations."
