            "briefSummary": "The \"Testicular Tissue Cryopreservation\" study is open to a subset of patients facing disease or treatment regimens that could lead to infertility (gonadotoxic therapies). For some of these patients, experimental testicular tissue cryopreservation is the only fertility preservation option available. The overall objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of testicular tissue cryopreservation in male patients of all ages who have a condition or will undergo a treatment that can cause infertility.",
            "detailedDescription": "For male patients who currently have no options for fertility preservation, this research proposal will enable optimization of testicular tissue procurement and processing, cryopreservation, and diagnosis/elimination of malignant cell contamination to ensure safety for future fertility-restoring treatments. While results from animal models and human organ donor experiments support the efficacy of testicular tissue/cell cryopreservation for fertility preservation and subsequent restoration, rigorous safety and efficacy data in human patients who will undergo infertility-causing therapies is lacking. However, the patients being recruited for this study currently have no options for future therapies aimed at fertility preservation without the preservation of their testicular tissue/cells prior to treatment. Thus, the current study will provide a potential resource for future fertility restoration."
