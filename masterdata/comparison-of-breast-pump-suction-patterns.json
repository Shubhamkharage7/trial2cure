            "briefSummary": "Compare effectiveness of breast pump patterns on lactation outcomes of pump dependent mothers of critically ill infants",
            "detailedDescription": "Insufficient Mothers Own Milk (MOM) has its origins during the first 14 days postpartum, a critical window that includes secretory activation (SA; milk coming in; lactogenesis II) and the achievement of coming to volume (CTV; providing 500 mLs/day of MOM by day 14 postpartum). For all lactating mothers, SA must be achieved for lactation to continue, and CTV predicts provision of MOM through to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW; \\<1500 g birth weight) infants. For this study, we posit that alternate breast pump suction patterns (BPSP; suction rate, intensity, and rhythm) may facilitate achievement of CTV in mothers who have achieved SA, but whose daily pumped MOM volumes indicate a high risk of not achieving CTV. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of three different breast pump suction patterns on lactation outcomes, including achievement of SA, among pump dependent mothers of critically ill infants who demonstrate faltering lactation after achievement of SA. At 6-8 days postpartum, 90 pump dependent mothers of critically ill infants who have achieved SA but demonstrate faltering lactation (\\<350 mLs/day pumped MOM volume), will be randomized to use one of three different BPSPs with two groups having alternative BPSPs and one group using the current practice standard for 7 days."
