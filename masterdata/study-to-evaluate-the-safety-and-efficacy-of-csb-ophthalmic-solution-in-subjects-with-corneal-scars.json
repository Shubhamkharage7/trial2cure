Subjects with a resolved scar at Day 7 will discontinue dosing and return to the clinic on Day 14. Subjects will return on Days 21, 28, 56, and Month 3 for safety and efficacy assessments."

Subjects with an active bacterial infection at the Screening or Day 1 Visit in the opinion of the investigator may be rescheduled to reassess the status of the infection and continue in the study if infection is deemed not active.\n* Ocular surgery planned during the study treatment period.\n* Presence or history of any ocular or systemic disorder, condition or procedure that might hinder the efficacy of the study treatment or its evaluation, could possibly interfere with the interpretation of study results, or could be judged by the investigator to be incompatible with the study visit schedule or conduct.\n\nNote: Other inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.",
