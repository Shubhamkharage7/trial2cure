            "briefSummary": "Depression in youth is a serious public health concern for which more personalized treatments are needed. This randomized controlled trial will test the effect of an intervention aimed at enhancing social cognitive capacities (e.g., ability to take another's perspective), thereby making treatment of depression in youth more efficient and effective. Participants in the R33 (N=82) will be youth between ages 13- through 17-years-old currently experiencing depression. Youth will be randomized to either an enhanced CBT intervention that teaches social cognitive skills, particularly social perspective taking and theory of mind (CBTSCT) as compared to CBT only. The primary target is improvement in both social cognitive skills and depressive symptoms at post-treatment and at a 6-month follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "Depression in adolescents is a recurrent and impairing disorder. Although some treatments have shown modest effects in children and adolescents (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy - CBT), there remains a critical need to build upon these therapies to reach even more youths with depression. One variable hypothesized to affect children's interpersonal relationships is their level of social cognitive development on abilities particularly relevant to social functioning and CBT (e.g., social perspective taking; theory of mind). This RCT will test the efficacy of an intervention aimed at increasing children's social cognitive (SC) abilities. Adolescents (ages 13-17; N=82) with depression diagnoses or clinical levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ9 \\>15) will be randomized to either the social cognitive training enhanced CBT (CBTSCT) or CBT only. In the R33 RCT, investigators will conduct a trial aimed at replicating the results of the R61 with a new sample of 82 youth (ages 13-17) randomized to CBTSCT or CBT only. Youth will be evaluated regarding their social cognitive abilities (i.e., theory of mind), level of depressive symptoms, and social functioning at baseline, post-treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up. Finally, investigators will test if increases in social cognitive abilities partially accounted for the relation between treatment condition and decreases in depression. If the CBTSCT intervention significantly improves participants' social cognitive abilities and decreases depressive symptoms, then this will provide therapists with a more efficient and personalized treatment of depression in youth."
