            "briefSummary": "With advancing age, adults experience increasing speech understanding difficulties in challenging situations. Currently, speech-in-noise difficulties are rehabilitated by providing hearing aids. For older normal-hearing adults, however, hearing devices do not provide much benefit since these adults do not have decreased hearing sensitivity. The goal of the \"Speech Perception and High Cognitive Demand\" project is to evaluate the benefit of a new auditory-cognitive training paradigm. In the present study neural (as measured by pupillometry and magnetoencephalography) and behavioral changes of speech-in-noise perception from pretest to posttest will be examined in older adults (age 65 - 85 years) assigned to one of three training groups: 1) Active Control Group: sessions of watching informational videos, 2) Auditory Training Group: sessions of auditory training listening to one of two speakers in everyday scenarios (e.g., driving directions) and needing to recall what one speaker said in the previous sentence, and 3) Auditory-cognitive training group: identical to the auditory training group, except participants will be asked to remember information from two previous sentences. Changes in speech-in-noise perception will be examined for the three groups of older adults and gains will be compared to a control group of young, normal hearing adults (18-30 years) that is not part of the clinical trial and will not undergo any training.",
            "detailedDescription": "With advancing age, adults experience increasing difficulties in understanding speech in challenging situations, such as difficulty with understanding others in a noisy restaurant. Speech-in-noise difficulties are typically rehabilitated by providing hearing aids. For older normal-hearing adults, however, hearing devices do not provide much benefit since these adults do not have decreased hearing sensitivity. For these adults, communication difficulties persist in everyday life situations and can even lead to social withdrawal, isolation, and depression. A growing body of studies demonstrates that combined auditory-cognitive training paradigms can offer speech-in-noise benefits to adults with hearing loss that could prevent the consequences listed above.\n\nThe goal of the \"Speech Perception with High Cognitive Demand\" project is to evaluate the benefit of a new auditory-cognitive training paradigm for older normal-hearing adults. The investigators developed an American English version of the Nottingham (UK) PLUS training paradigm in which listeners are asked to focus and listen to one speaker while ignoring another speaker. Although it cannot ensure that every participant will experience direct significant benefit from the training, the paradigm is being designed to optimally enhance the possibility of benefit: an adaptive procedure is employed to train each individual at their own level and to make the task challenging. In a separate training condition, a short-term memory component is added to the original training paradigm to also enhance the cognitive skills of the participants. In addition, the training is implemented on touch-screen laptops, making at-home training possible. This way, training is provided in a realistic setting which will ensure a better transfer of the trained skills to daily communication situations. The trial consists of three conditions: 1) Auditory only training, 2) Auditory-cognitive training, and 3) Active control of informational videos."
