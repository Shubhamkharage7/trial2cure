            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of administration of a single dose of E7 TCR-T cells as induction therapy prior to definitive treatment (chemoradiation or surgery) of locoregionally advanced HPV-associated cancers. The intent of E7 TCR-T cell treatment is to shrink or eliminate tumors and thereby facilitate definitive therapy and increase overall survival.\n\nThis study seeks to determine 1) if E7 TCR-T cells can be administered without undue delay in definitive treatment, 2) the tumor response rate to E7 TCR-T cell treatment, and 3) the disease-free survival rate at 2 and 5 years.\n\nParticipants will undergo an apheresis procedure to obtain T cells that will be genetically engineered to generate E7 TCR-T cells. They will receive a conditioning regimen, a single infusion of their own E7 TCR-T cells, and adjuvant aldesleukin. Participants will follow up to assess safety and determine tumor response and will return to their primary oncology team for definitive therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, single-cohort, single-center, feasibility study to determine the feasibility of E7 TCR-T cell induction therapy for locoregionally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers (LAHPVC). Participants must have LAHPVC with HPV-16-positive cancer (tumor test) and the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-A\\*02:01 allele (blood test). Participants will undergo apheresis for generation of autologous, gene-engineered, E7 TCR-T cells. One week after apheresis, they will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Conditioning will be followed by a single infusion of E7 TCR T cells and adjuvant high-dose aldesleukin. Participants will follow up 3 weeks and 6 weeks after treatment. Tumor response will be assessed by imaging studies at the 6-week time point. Participants will be referred back to their primary oncology team for definitive therapy after the 6-week assessment (or earlier if tumors do not appear to be responding). Participants will be followed to determine 2- and 5-year disease free survival."

Age \\> 50 years old\n7. Participants with baseline screening pulse oxygen level of \\<92% on room air will not be eligible. If the underlying cause of hypoxia improves, they may be reevaluated.\n8. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR T cells, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with E7 TCR T cells. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n9. Participants with a systemic immunodeficiency including acquired deficiency such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the treatment.\n10. Participants on immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids unless meeting criteria outlined in Section 6.1 (Prohibited Medications).\n11. Participants with potentially severe autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or systemic lupus erythematosus are not eligible. Patients with less severe autoimmune diseases such as hypothyroidism, vitiligo, and other minor autoimmune disorders are eligible.\n12. Participants with prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessments of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n    1. Carcinoma in situ\n    2. Cutaneous skin cancers requiring only local excision\n    3. Low grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer\n    4. Low grade prostate cancer\n13. Subjects who received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment are not eligible.\n14.
