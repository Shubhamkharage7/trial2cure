            "briefSummary": "Nearly nine-in-ten Americans overconsume salt. Black individuals are more prone to salt-sensitive hypertension. The central goal of the study is to determine if dietary sodium influences blood vessel function and nervous system regulation of blood pressure differentially in black, compared to white individuals. These findings may help to explain why high dietary salt causes increases in blood pressure more frequently in black, compared to white individuals. A secondary goal of this project is to also determine the role of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, and nutrition) on potential baseline racial differences in cardiovascular function.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators aim to study racial differences in cardiovascular responses to high dietary sodium. An overwhelming majority of Americans consume more dietary sodium than what is recommended by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The investigators recently published data demonstrating that compared to white individuals, 1) black individuals have augmented increases in serum sodium concentration to a hypertonic saline infusion; and 2) exhibit higher blood pressure for a given serum sodium. In this proposal, the investigators will translate these findings by comprehensively assessing neurovascular responses to acute (single meal) high dietary sodium. The central hypothesis is that high dietary sodium influences sympathetic nerve activity similarly in black and white individuals; however, diminished vasodilator capacity and augmented sympathetic transduction (vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve bursts) contribute to exaggerated blood pressure dysregulation in black individuals. The investigators will also determine the role of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, and nutrition) on potential baseline racial differences in cardiovascular function."

MSNA will be expressed as bursts per minute and per 100 cardiac cycles. Further, the investigators will measure common femoral artery blood flow using ultrasound and mean arterial pressure using photoplethysmography.
