To determine the efficacy (progression free survival \\[PFS\\] rate at first scan) of olaparib monotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) with mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib.\n\nII. To determine the progression free survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib.\n\nIII. To determine the objective response of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib.\n\nIV. To assess the duration of response for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib who experience an objective response.\n\nV. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events in advanced biliary tract cancer patients treated with olaparib.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the prevalence of mutations including those targeting DNA repair pathways.\n\nII. Identify mutational signatures associated with pathogenic process in advanced biliary tract cancer samples.\n\nIII. Correlate the presence of mutations and mutational signatures linked to mutations in DNA repair genes and homologous recombinant repair with clinical responses to olaparib.\n\nIV. To evaluate putative biomarkers related to:\n\nIva. De novo sensitivity. IVb. Tumor evolution and resistance, to PARP inhibition from olaparib in BTC.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial, and collection of blood and tissue samples on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for up to 3 years."
