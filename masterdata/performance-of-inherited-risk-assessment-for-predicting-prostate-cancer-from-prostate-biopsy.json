Furthermore, results from retrospective analyses of two clinical trials (PCPT and REDUCE) and biopsy cohorts revealed Caucasian men with higher GRS are 1) more likely to have positive biopsy and 2) have higher number of positive biopsy cores. These findings suggest inherited risk assessment may have clinical utility in identifying men who have a higher likelihood of positive results from diagnostic prostate biopsy. The objective of this observational trial is to confirm the clinical utility of both RPMs and GRS in a prospective study of multi-racial patients. Results from this trial will provide a critical piece of evidence for guideline committees to consider the adoption of inherited risk assessment in decision making for prostate biopsy."
