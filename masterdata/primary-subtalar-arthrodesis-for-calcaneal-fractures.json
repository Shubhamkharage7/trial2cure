Previous studies have demonstrated poor outcomes, and results show that patients experience long-term pain and decreased quality of life postoperatively. Poor outcomes are driven by pain, in particular, which is linked to post-traumatic subtalar arthritis.",

Participants will begin the jump behind zero-inch line, which marks the starting point. Participants will perform three consecutive jumps off one leg while crossing over the tape with each jump so that the first jump is lateral, the second jump is medial, and the final jump is lateral. Participants will be asked to hold their place at the end of the third jump until their distance is recorded. Three test trials will be assessed for each leg and averaged together for analysis.",
