            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to examine whether a well-formulated ketogenic diet (KD) can be implemented into a university counseling treatment program for major depression and to test whether such a program has any benefit on mental and metabolic health.",
            "detailedDescription": "Major depression is a burgeoning problem that affects over five percent of adults worldwide and is rapidly increasing in the United States. From the second quarter of 2019 to June of 2020, the prevalence of symptoms of depression spiked from 6.5 to 24.3% , which was largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Major depression and suicidal ideation have increased markedly in young adults, particularly within college campuses. In 2020, counselors at the Ohio State University (OSU) experienced a surge in the number of students with various mental health issues with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most common. The escalating prevalence of depression bubbling under the surface of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique challenge that requires new and creative solutions.\n\nRecently, a KD was administered to adults who had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and were suffering from various mental disorders. The dietary intervention lasted between 16 and 248 days and showed significant improvements in depression and psychotic symptoms. Ketogenic diet interventions (and ingestion of ketone esters) have also been associated with more stable brain networks, assess with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Additionally, a novel but as yet under-appreciated effect of nutritional ketosis is to induce a broad-spectrum reduction in inflammation in metabolically-impaired individuals. Elevations in a range of inflammation biomarkers has been associated with severity of depression.\n\nAlthough KDs have been proposed as a treatment option for mental health disorders, including schizophrenia and depression, few human clinical trials have tested the efficacy of this eating pattern specifically in a population of adults with major depression. In patients with type 2 diabetes (n=262) prescribed a KD using a novel virtual care model (Virta Health), we observed significant improvements in depressive symptoms after 10-weeks, which were directly correlated with the degree of carbohydrate restriction and nutritional ketosis as assessed by blood concentrations of ketones."

These assessments are designed to evaluate both fine and gross motor skills and detect any motor impairments or changes over time.\n\nSensation: auditory, visual, and somatosensory abilities. These measures help evaluate sensory perception, discrimination, and thresholds.",
