The study aims to determine if modulating the energy density of the diet reduces:\n\n1. Insulin resistance and\n2. Body weight.\n\nResearchers will compare the groups:\n\n1. Following time-restricted eating and given a diet reduced in energy density or\n2. Following time-restricted eating and given a diet typically consumed in this population",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is an eight-week randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial. Participants will follow time-restricted eating (14-hour fast, 10-hour eating window), and will be randomized to a diet low in energy density or the usual diet. Meals will be prepared in a metabolic kitchen and dispensed to participants. Dietitians will monitor dietary compliance. A blood sample will be drawn and body weight will be measured before starting the intervention and after completing it."
