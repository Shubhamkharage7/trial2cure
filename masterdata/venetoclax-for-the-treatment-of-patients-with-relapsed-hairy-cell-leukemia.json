            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well venetoclax works in treating patients with hairy cell leukemia that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed). Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of venetoclax.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the complete remission (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR rates of venetoclax in relapsed hairy cell leukemia/hairy cell leukemia variant (HCL/HCLv).\n\nII. To determine the rates of MRD-negative by blood flow cytometry with venetoclax.\n\nIII. To determine the safety of venetoclax in relapsed HCL/HCLv. IV. To determine the response and CR duration and MRD-negative survival in relapsed HCL/HCLv receiving venetoclax.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To correlate response to TP53 mutations and other mutations, particularly for BRAF wild-type (WT) relapsed HCL/HCLv.\n\nII. To perform whole exome sequencing (WES) of relapsed HCL/HCLv samples to look for mutations, to correlate with response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 19 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sample collection throughout the study. Patients may undergo bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."

To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Patients must have had no HCL/HCLv treatment for \u2265 4 weeks prior to enrollment, and those with treatment \\> 4 weeks prior to enrollment must not be responding to their last treatment with decreasing tumor burden or improving drug-related cytopenias\n* Patients must have a need for treatment due to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\< 1/nL, hemoglobin (Hgb) \\< 10g/dL, platelets (Plt) \\< 100/nL, symptomatic splenomegaly, enlarging HCL mass \\> 2cm in short axis, enlarging HCL mass \\> 0.5 cm in the central nervous system (CNS) in short axis, or leukemic count \\> 5/nL\n* The effects of venetoclax on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) during treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception during treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants\n* Ability and willingness to swallow pills\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have received prior venetoclax\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to venetoclax\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because venetoclax is a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with venetoclax, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with venetoclax\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that would interfere with intestinal absorption\n* Live attenuated vaccines should not be administered within 4 weeks prior to, during, or 30 days after study treatment and recovery has occurred",
