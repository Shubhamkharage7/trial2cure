            "briefSummary": "The VetASSIST study is a randomized clinical trial testing whether receiving virtual health coaching from Veteran peers improves the physical and mental health-related quality of life of Veterans with multiple chronic health conditions and complex healthcare needs. VetASSIST will test the efficacy of an intervention that matches Veteran patients with multimorbidty with Veteran health coaches who will provide education, resources, guidance and support to help them manage their physical and mental health over the course of a year.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual, Veteran peer-led self-management support program (VetASSIST) to improve health related quality of life (HRQoL) for Veterans with multimorbidity compared to usual care. The investigators will conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial of the intervention among VA Puget Sound patients with multimorbidity. Trained peer health coaches will virtually meet one-on-one with patients to assist in daily self-management by providing information; identifying patients' values and preferences; helping them set goals in alignment with their values and preferences and problem-solve barriers to those goals; modeling skills for effective management; providing social support; linking them to clinical care and community resources; and addressing self-management barriers. Veterans with multimorbidity will be randomized to receive the peer health coaching intervention or usual care. Outcomes will be assessed remotely at baseline and 12 months.\n\nSpecific aims are: 1) Test the effect of VetASSIST, compared to usual care, on the primary outcome of baseline to 12-month change in physical HRQoL, and secondary outcomes of mental HRQoL and health care utilization; 2a) Describe differences between VetASSIST and usual care on baseline to 12-month changes in intermediate outcomes reflecting the functions of peer support and intervention targets (self-efficacy, patient activation, health behaviors, social support, perceived access to care, patient-provider communication, and shared decision-making); 2b) Examine whether intermediate outcomes mediate intervention-associated differences in HRQoL; 3) Evaluate feasibility of translating VetASSIST into practice, including evaluation of per patient intervention costs and barriers and facilitators to implementation."
