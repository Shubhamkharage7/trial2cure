            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to compare the clinical outcomes of two commonly used, FDA-approved biologic meshes in hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction (Strattice and XenMatrix). The two meshes are derived from pig skin from which cells have been removed and which have been sterilized. The two meshes are made by two different companies using different processes.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, randomized-controlled trial comparing two porcine acellular matrices in abdominal wall reconstruction. It is single-blind (patients are blinded to the type of mesh used while surgeons are not).\n\nOur goals in this study are:\n\n1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: To compare the overall complication rates between two non-cross-linked porcine dermal matrices (XenMatrix and Strattice) at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively\n2. SECONDARY OUTCOMES\n\ni. To compare the rate of Surgical Site Occurrences (SSOs) between XenMatrix and Strattice in abdominal wall reconstruction at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively\n\n1. Infection\n2. Seroma\n3. Hematoma\n4. Wound dehiscence\n5. Skin necrosis\n6. Formation of enterocutaneous fistula\n7. Mesh infection ii. To compare the hernia recurrence rate between XenMatrix and Strattice at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively iii. To compare the bulge rate between XenMatrix and Strattice at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively iv. To compare to changes in patient pain, physical functioning and quality of life after hernia repair between XenMatrix and Strattice, preoperatively, and at 1 year postoperatively A. Pain assessment: Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Intensity survey, PROMIS Pain Interference survey B. Physical functioning assessment: PROMIS Physical Function C. Quality of life assessment: Hernia-Related Quality-of-Life (HerQLes) survey"
