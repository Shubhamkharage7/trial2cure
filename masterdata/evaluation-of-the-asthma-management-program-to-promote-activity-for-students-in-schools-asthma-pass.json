Studies show that PA is associated with decreased severity of asthma symptoms, as well as improved disease control and quality of life. However, urban minority children with asthma face barriers to PA on multiple levels.The goal of this research project is to evaluate whether a multifaceted school-based intervention that addresses key barriers to physical activity reduces asthma morbidity among urban schoolchildren with asthma.",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial with 416 children ages 5-11 years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from 26 Bronx schools. Schools will be randomly assigned to either (1) the Asthma-PASS intervention or an asthma management (AM) comparison group. Both groups will participate in an existing classroom-based daily activity program. Enrollment will occur over 4 consecutive school years with 6-8 schools joining the study each year. The investigators will assess the effectiveness of Asthma-PASS in reducing asthma morbidity, and improving PA as well as additional clinical and functional outcomes. The investigators will also identify potential mediators and moderators of the intervention effect. They will evaluate the process of intervention implementation by applying the RE-AIM framework."
