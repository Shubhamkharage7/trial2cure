PrEP is the use of a daily anti-HIV medications by HIV-negative people to help prevent HIV infection.",

All study participants will receive PrEP per standard of care at each of the study sites.\n\nParticipants randomized to PrEPmate will receive an interactive bidirectional text-messaging intervention that supports PrEP use through personalized communication between patients and providers. Key components include (1) weekly short message service (SMS) check-ins and a bidirectional SMS messaging platform; (2) customized daily SMS pill-taking reminders; (3) link to online PrEP Basics and videos and testimonials.\n\nParticipants randomized to Dot Diary will receive a mobile app that promotes self-management of PrEP use and sexual health. Key components include (1) a digital pill-taking and sexual diary, with pill-taking reminders; (2) sex-positive badges earned via app use; and (3) real-time feedback on protection levels afforded by PrEP. Each participant will be followed for approximately 12 months. Staff at the participating clinics will also participate in in-depth interviews to give feedback on implementation challenges and experiences in the clinic-setting, and experience working with patients using the mobile technologies."

Trained PrEP navigators reach out to participants who indicate they need assistance via text or phone call and provide tailored support. Additionally, the platform supports 2-way communication between patients and PrEP navigators, including reminders for upcoming clinic visits. Participants are provided links to key information about PrEP (PrEP Basics), and video testimonials of peers taking PrEP. Messages are available in English and Spanish. PrEPmate is aimed at both patients and PrEP navigators.",

Participants can also view a weekly and monthly calendar, including visualizations of the proportion of sex acts covered by PrEP.
