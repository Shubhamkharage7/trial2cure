            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of Eko AI plus EMAS (Eko Murmur Analysis Software) on a clinician's referral decision in a real-world primary care setting. There is an additional objective of understanding patient outcomes when patients are referred for cardiology follow-up and/or echocardiogram.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eko has developed a platform to aid in screening for cardiac conditions using a digital stethoscope and machine-learning algorithms to detect the presence or absence of heart conditions such as heart murmurs and atrial fibrillation. In June 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Eko a 510(k) clearance for the marketing of \"Eko Murmur Analysis Software\" (EMAS), a set of machine learning algorithms that are able to screen signal quality and identify fundamental heart sounds, distinguish structural murmurs from absent or innocent murmurs, and provide a structural murmur's timing in the cardiac cycle.\n\nThis study sets out to evaluate the impact of EMAS on a clinician's referral decision in a real-world primary care setting, with the additional objective of understanding patient outcomes when patients are referred for cardiology follow-up and/or echocardiogram. Providers will receive access to the EMAS screening tool, called the SENSORA\u2122 Disease Detection Platform, which features the FDA cleared 3M\u2122 Littmann\u00ae CORE stethoscope paired with the FDA cleared SENSORA\u2122 enterprise application and EMAS AI running on an iPad, which is mounted on a Tryten stand. SENSORA\u2122 will be used by medical assistants or equivalent as part of the initial patient intake process (e.g., during vitals acquisition).\n\nEMAS influence on individual providers will be assessed by reviewing each provider's number of referrals to cardiology and number of echocardiogram orders for the 6 months preceding study start. These values will be compared to cardiac referral and order rates at the end of the study. Patient outcomes data (e.g., cardiology appointment notes, echocardiogram findings, follow up visits scheduled) will be pulled 6 months after the patient is seen by their primary care provider. Secondary objectives include the continued assessment of algorithm performance on a point-of-care population."
