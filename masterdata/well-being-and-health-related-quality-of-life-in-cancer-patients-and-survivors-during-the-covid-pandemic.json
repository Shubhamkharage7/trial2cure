            "briefSummary": "This study investigates the well-being and health-related quality of life in cancer patients and survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using questionnaires may help researchers gain an understanding of how experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., exposure, risk factors, testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family or friends, loss of income), may impact multiple domains of health-related quality of life (physical, emotional and social well-being), and other areas such as COVID-19-specific psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms), and disruptions to health care, finances, and social interactions.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (e.g., exposure, risk factors, testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family or friends); COVID-19-specific psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms); health, financial and social disruptions; perceived benefits and social support; and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a convenience sample of cancer patients and survivors.\n\nII. Evaluate the extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19-specific psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and social support, and HRQoL.\n\nIII. Evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support and perceived benefits moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific psychological distress and HRQoL.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete an online questionnaire over 10 minutes regarding the COVID-19 pandemic including testing, risks of exposure, whether people they know have acquired COVID-19, as well as questions on how the pandemic has impacted their quality of life."
