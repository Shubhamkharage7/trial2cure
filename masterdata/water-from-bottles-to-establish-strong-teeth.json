Children will be allocated at random to receive either fluoridated or non-fluoridated sourced from two local public water systems. The water will be packaged into 5-gallon bottles and delivered to households during a 3\u00bd year intervention period. During the intervention period, parents/guardians/caregivers will be interviewed quarterly to monitor children's general health and a dental screening will be conducted annually. Children's fingernail and toenail clippings will be collected annually and analyzed to determine the fluoride content as a biomarker of total fluoride intake. Dental caries experience, the primary endpoint, will be determined once in a dental examination conducted by a study dentist close to the time of the child's 4th birthday. For the primary aim, a least-squares, generalized linear model will estimate efficacy and its one-tailed, upper 80% confidence limit using the number of decayed, missing and filled primary tooth surfaces as the dependent variable."

For children who live at more than one dwelling, the primary dwelling is defined as the one at which they usually sleep at least four nights per week.\n* Child has serious illness/es requiring frequent inpatient hospitalization, as reported by the parent/ guardian/caregiver at the screening visit.\n* Child's birth weight was less than 1,500 g (3 pounds 5 ounces).\n* Child's gestational age was less than 34 weeks.\n* Child uses fluoride supplements, as reported by the parent/ guardian/caregiver at the screening visit.\n* Parent/guardian/caregiver states at the screening visit the child will initiate fluoride supplementation before the child's 4th birthday\n* The parent/ guardian/caregiver anticipates that the child will move to an address more than 30 miles from Kinston, NC before the child's 4th birthday.\n* The investigators determine that a child living at the same primary dwelling has already been enrolled in the study. (This means that if two or more children fulfilling the inclusion criteria live at the primary dwelling, the parent will be asked to select one such child to be the study participant.)\n* Anything that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would place the participant at increased risk or preclude the participant's full compliance with or completion of the study.",
