            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether subcutaneous atezolizumab can be effectively given at home with medical care provided primarily using telemedicine in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This study may help determine if a telemedicine based approach that gives atezolizumab at home using a version of the drug designed for subcutaneous injection under the skin is safe and feasible.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety of home administration by a healthcare provider (HCP) of atezolizumab and recombinant human hyaluronidase (subcutaneous atezolizumab) at a dose of 1875 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W).\n\nII. To determine the feasibility of home administration, by mobile nursing, of subcutaneous atezolizumab at a dose of 1875 mg Q3W.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine patient satisfaction with home administration of atezolizumab. II. To determine healthcare provider and mobile nurse satisfaction with home administration of atezolizumab.\n\nIII. To determine the feasibility of a cancer clinical trial conducted under a decentralized model with telehealth assessments.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the patient enrollment and retention rate for a decentralized clinical trial.\n\nII. To determine the relationship between patient physical activity and toxicity.\n\nIII. To compare patient, infusion nurse, and pharmacist time spent in care during in office and home administration cycles.\n\nIV. To compare efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) atezolizumab with known efficacy of intravenous (IV) atezolizumab.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive atezolizumab and recombinant human hyaluronidase SC over 3-8 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for 1 year (early-stage lung cancer) or up to 2 years (late-stage lung cancer) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
