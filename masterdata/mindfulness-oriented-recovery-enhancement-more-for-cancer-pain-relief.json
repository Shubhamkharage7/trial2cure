MBIs are therapeutic programs that use mindfulness meditation practices to help people focus on the present moment, as well as encourage acceptance of thoughts, emotions, and body sensations. The researchers think that an MBI treatment called Mindfulness-oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) may help people who are experiencing cancer-related chronic pain."
