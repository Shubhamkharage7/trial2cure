The safety of this protocol will be closely monitored and data will be used to determine whether any significant safety issues exist when using focused ultrasound. Adverse events will be noted whenever they occur but will be recorded at the time of the procedure and throughout routine follow-ups, which will persist weekly throughout the duration of the active study protocol. Patients deemed potentially appropriate candidates for focused ultrasound therapy will be treated with 8 sessions of transcranial ultrasound, each of which consists of 10 to 30 minutes of active administration. Clinical and safety outcome measures will be obtained throughout and after completion of the study protocol."
