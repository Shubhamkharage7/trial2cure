In this study, we hypothesize that provision of a video educational intervention to teach patients about cancer, care coordination and self-advocacy will improve patients' perception of care coordination. Cancer patients with early stage disease scheduled to receive adjuvant therapy, and who reside in a rural area, will be enrolled onto the study. Patients will be randomized to receive a table-based educational intervention tool initially (arm1) or after 4 months of therapy (arm2). Assessment of cancer knowledge, self-advocacy and care coordination will be obtained at baseline and after 4-6 months."
