            "briefSummary": "Several previous studies have shown that repeatedly ingesting carbohydrate supplements during exercise training sessions, over a period of days and weeks, can gradually increase carbohydrate oxidation and reduce gut discomfort during exercise. However, repeatedly ingesting large amounts of carbohydrate during training sessions can be burdensome and can cause gut distress. Thus, it would be advantageous if the same long-term benefits could be realized from consuming these carbohydrate supplements at rest instead of specifically during training sessions. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine whether repeatedly ingesting a carbohydrate-rich beverage at rest over a 5-day period alters metabolism and gut symptoms while ingesting carbohydrate during exercise."
