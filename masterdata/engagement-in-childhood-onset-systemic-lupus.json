The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Whether anhedonia (a core symptom of depression) predicts disengagement in care\n2. Whether a patient-tailored mobile health application built to improve both engagement in care and depression symptoms will be feasible and acceptable to adolescents and young adults with lupus.\n\nParticipants with systemic lupus, ages 15-24 from the Bronx, New York will be asked to complete questionnaires; some will be asked to participate in focus groups to help adapt the mobile health app; patients will also be invited to join a pilot study to try the mobile health app for 6 months and answer questionnaires to document the experience."
