Our hypotheses are that 1) the Combined arm is associated with improved vaping abstinence to the Media literacy and Financial incentive arms; and 2) the financial incentive-related arms (either Combined or Financial incentive) enhance engagement compared to the non-incentive related arms.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and compare the potential effect of different vaping cessation intervention components in addition to evidence-based text-messaging support, including 1) media literacy interactive e-learning lessons, 2) financial incentives, and 3) combined (media literacy + financial incentive) on vaping abstinence among current young adult vapers over a three-month timeframe with the following three specific aims: Aim 1. To assess the feasibility of a multi-component vaping cessation program; Aim 2 To evaluate the preliminary effect of a multicomponent vaping cessation program; and exploratory Aim 3. To Examine the cost-consequence of a multicomponent vaping cessation program. Eligible participants are young adults aged 19-29 and are current vapers (i.e., has vaped in the previous 30 days).We will employ a 4-arm, feasibility randomized trial design to determine the preliminary effect of different vaping intervention components on vaping abstinence over a 3-month timeframe, consisting of a 1-month quitting preparation phase and 2-month abstinence phase. Eligible participants (n=80) will be randomized (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio), using a computer-generated algorithm, to to one of four vaping cessation interventions: 1) Active control: text-messaging support, 2) Media literacy: media literacy + text-messaging support, 3) Financial incentive: financial incentive + text-messaging support, and 4) Combined: media literacy e-learning lessons + financial incentive + text-messaging support, at the baseline visit. Regardless of intervention arms, all enrolled participants will receive receive an evidence-base text-messaging support program for quitting vaping (This is Quitting). Participants will be followed through a 3-month study period including a 1-month quitting preparation phase and a 2-month abstinence phase. All participants will be asked to provide the 5 saliva cotinine samples- at baseline and end-of-study visits and 3 at video calls (remote submissions). Participants who assigned to the financial incentive Combined groups will be provided monetary rewards for submitting saliva cotinine samples during the abstinence period. To examine the feasibility of biomarker testing for toxic exposures, for a subsample of 20 participants, a panel of biomarkers of toxic exposures will be measured at baseline and at the end of study."
