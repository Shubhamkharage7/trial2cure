            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study will be to assess the effects of a compressive tissue flossing (CTF) program on the symptoms of lateral elbow tendinopathy in United States service members. Dependent variables will be the Defense and Veteran's Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), decrease their Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) score, increase their maximal grip strength in the affected upper extremity (UE). Measurements will be taken at baseline, immediately after the first CTF intervention, and at the 1-week follow-up, for a total of 3 measurements.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research study will be to assess the effects of a compressive tissue flossing (CTF) program on the symptoms of lateral elbow tendinopathy in United States service members. I hypothesize that tissue flossing with a band for a 2-minute session daily will decrease patient's report of pain on the Defense and Veteran's Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), decrease their Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) score, increase their maximal grip strength in the affected upper extremity (UE). Measurements will be taken at baseline, immediately after the first CTF intervention, and at the 1-week follow-up, for a total of 3 measurements. If this method is shown to acutely decrease the symptoms of LET, it would give occupational therapists a potential home exercise program that is easy to initiate and only takes 2 minutes per day for patients to perform. This could prove to be an effective and low-cost method for service members to treat elbow pain symptoms. This technique could be used in austere environments where traditional musculoskeletal rehabilitation may not be available.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Assess the acute effects of compressive tissue flossing on the symptoms of lateral elbow tendinopathy in United States service members.\n\nI will accomplish this by recording the patient's report of pain on the Defense and Veteran's Pain Rating Scale, their Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation outcome measure score, and their maximal grip strength in the affected UE before CTF, immediately after CTF, and at the 1-week follow-up after completing tissue flossing daily for 2 minutes. I will compare the outcomes from each measurement to evaluate the effects of CTF on lateral elbow pain symptoms."

CTF acts on the mechanoreceptors in the underlying fascial layers, causing blood reperfusion of the compressed tissue, and/or causing fascial shearing and the sliding potential of the fascia to be restored (Starrett \\& Cordoza, 2015). Proposed benefits from references include improving joint mobility in the joints of the limbs (Starrett \\& Cordoza, 2015), improving muscular power, and decreasing pain with motion (Angelopoulos et al., 2021) (Cage et al., 2022) (Jianhong et al., 2021)."
