All study assessments will take place on the app and other than baseline screening all assessments will take place after surgery until the patient stops taking opioids. Patients will be approached in the orthopedic clinic up to the day of surgery and asked if they are willing to be screened for inclusion. If they accept the screening request a link will be emailed to them or a QR code supplied that permits them to download the study app on their phone. Screening, consent, and all study data collection will occur from the app launch. All data will be collected after enrollment and consent through the Medable Research Application.",
