            "briefSummary": "Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors help the immune system fight cancer. When the effectiveness of these drugs wears off, it may be possible to renew their effectiveness by combining it with a special type of radiation therapy called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT is a commonly used type of radiation therapy that gives high dose radiation with high precision to tumors in 1-5 treatments. Radiation therapy, such as SBRT can also treat sites of metastases. The use of checkpoint inhibitors in combination with SBRT has been suggested to improve the immune response against cancer but has not been tested in a formal clinical trial. Up to three lesions can be treated with SBRT. This study only allows checkpoint inhibitors that are already approved by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) for the treatment of your disease. All radiation therapy will be done on machines which are FDA approved."

If other prior malignancy was active within prior 3 years, enrollment requires approval of a principal investigator.\n  * Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger\n  * Subjects requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents for greater than 5 days) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration should be excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses \\>10mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n  * Treatment with any other chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologics for cancer, or investigational therapy concurrently or within 14 days of enrollment\n  * History of allergy to checkpoint inhibitors\n  * History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.\n  * Women must not be breastfeeding.",
