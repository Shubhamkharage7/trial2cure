This can include one hospitalization or outpatient medical encounter with documented International Classification of Diseases (ICD9/ICD10) codes as identified within the Surveillance Case Definition.\n* Subjects must also have been on a stable medication regimen for the past 3 months and must be na\u00efve to BoNT-A treatment for orofacial conditions.\n* English as primary language (by self-report).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Individuals with ocular diseases that may confound photophobia, such as glaucoma, corneal and conjunctival scarring, corneal edema, uveitis, iris transillumination defects, retinal degeneration, etc.\n* Patients who are participating in another study with an investigational drug within one month prior to screening.\n* Pregnant individuals. Pregnant subjects will not be scanned in the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Although there are no known risks associated with MRI during pregnancy, according to facility policy, University of Miami will not scan someone that is pregnant. Therefore, all women of childbearing potential (menstruating or \\>12 years old) must complete a for stating that are not pregnant within 24 hours of each MRI scan.\n* Individuals with contraindications to fMRI scanning (e.g. metal implants, pacemaker) will not be offered inclusion.",
