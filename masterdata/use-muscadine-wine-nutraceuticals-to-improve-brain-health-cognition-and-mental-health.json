            "briefSummary": "Previous studies have shown that polyphenol-rich foods can positively affect cognitive functions, memory, and mood in humans. We hypothesize that both acute and chronic intake of muscadine wine polyphenols will improve cognitive performance and mood through regulating the HPA axis, alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress, and/or inhibiting monoamine oxidase activities",
            "detailedDescription": "Although the exact biological mechanisms for depression and Alzheimer's Disease are not fully understood, it's believed that they are caused by a combination of factors. An increasing amount of scientific research has proposed several possible pathophysiologies linking depression and AD. For example, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the nervous system, oxidative stress induced by chronic inflammation leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and disturbance in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signal pathway. Polyphenol has been well recognized for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Previous studies have shown that polyphenol-rich food such as concord grape juice, blueberries, blackcurrants, and green oats positively affect cognition, memory, and mood in humans. However, no one has examined the effects of muscadine wine polyphenol on cognitive and mental health. In addition, if they do have effects, through what mechanism? This clinical trial will allow us to investigate the questions raised. We hypothesize that intake of muscadine wine polyphenols enhances cognition and memory and improve depression and anxiety in healthy adults over 50 year-old via regulating the HPA axis, alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress, and/or inhibiting monoamine oxidase activities. The research will provide the first clinical evidence of how muscadine wine polyphenols affect the brain and mental health."

A 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, where each of these vectors ranges in value between 0 and 5, and the computed score, combining each vector score, ranges in value 0-10.
