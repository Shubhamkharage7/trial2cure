Limitless Solutions has developed technology to create personalized bionics for people with disabilities at an affordable cost. This will be a prospective study over a 14-month duration with clinical evaluations throughout. Limitless Solutions will provide prosthetics and training system for study subjects free of charge. During each visit, the study team will include an occupational therapist, a prosthetist, a study coordinator, and a research volunteer along with Limitless support staff and a supervising physician. Subject will complete quality of life questionnaires throughout their participation."
