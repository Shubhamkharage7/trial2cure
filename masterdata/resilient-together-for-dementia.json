            "detailedDescription": "Both persons living with dementia (PWDs) and their spousal care-partners experience high levels of clinically elevated emotional distress, which can become chronic without treatment and negatively impact the health, quality of life, communication, and care-planning of both partners. A tailored dyadic intervention, such as the proposed Resilient Together for Dementia, delivered over live video to this at risk population during the window of opportunity when PWDs can participate has the potential to prevent chronic emotional distress and preserve quality of life for PWDs and their loved ones.\n\nIn the Intervention Phase (Aims 2 and 3), an open pilot (N=5 dyads) of the newly developed RT-D followed by exit interviews will be conducted to explore the initial feasibility and acceptability of the adapted protocol and to further refine the intervention content, materials, and procedures (Aim 2; NIA Stage 1A). Next, a pilot feasibility randomized control trial (RCT; Aim 3; NIA Stage 1B; N=50 dyads) will be conducted of the refined RT-D versus a minimally enhanced educational control (MEUC). Primary outcomes will be feasibility, credibility, and acceptability markers to inform a hybrid efficacy effectiveness R01 (year 4) of RT-D vs. MEUC (NIA Stage III). In this subsequent R01, the researcher will examine RT-D's impact on emotional distress and quality of life outcomes and test mechanisms of change (individual and interpersonal resiliency skills) through mediation and moderation. The researcher will revise the approach if feasibility benchmarks are not met."
