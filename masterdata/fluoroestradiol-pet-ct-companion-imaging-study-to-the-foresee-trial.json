This study will establish the feasibility of using FES-PET/CT imaging to guide therapeutic decision making for functional precision oncology trials. The unique ability of FES-PET/CT to show absence of functional estrogen receptors throughout the entire body may improve confidence among research oncologists that an ER+ metastatic breast cancer patient is truly refractory to hormonal therapies which is a critical determination in the study design of the FORESEE trial."
