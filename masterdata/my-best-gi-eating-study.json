            "briefSummary": "The MyBestGI study evaluates three different approaches that could help people eat in healthier ways. The study seeks to enroll 240 overweight and obese persons who have risk factors for colorectal cancers such as a family or personal history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps. The study website is www.MyBestGI.org .\n\nParticipants in the study will be asked to follow one of three eating plans, as best they can, for 12 months. Study participants can choose the foods they prefer within healthy food groups. Two of the eating plans involve ten brief telephone support calls and use of a web-based app (MyBestGI App). The study primarily evaluates improvements in eating and any weight change that may result. Secondary goals for the research are to evaluate how changes in eating affect metabolic pathways.\n\nAll study participants will receive written materials that encourage making room for preventive foods in your daily eating. All participants also receive the results of their own diet analyses, and results of their own measures at study visits. The measures are the Veggie Meter skin reflectance test, Ketoscan breath test, and body composition measures. Study visits also involve providing a small blood sample from the arm. Study visits are in Ann Arbor at the start of the study, and at 6 and 12 months.\n\nThe long-term goal of this research is to provide better options for supporting individuals who seek to achieve and maintain a preventive style of eating.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite the large body of research that has identified the impact of diet on cancer risk, little has been done to improve how care is provided to persons who have risk factors for cancer. The MyBestGI study addresses prevention of colorectal cancer, the third most prevalent cancer in the U.S. Colorectal cancer is among the cancers that are most strongly affected by diet and excess adiposity, and incidence is increasing in young people below the age of 40. More efforts need to be directed at providing individuals with the tools needed for achieving and maintaining a preventive style of eating.\n\nRecommendations for cancer prevention from the American Cancer Society and American Institute for Cancer Research include advice to maintain a healthy weight, to consume more plant-based foods, and to limit red meats, processed meats, and foods with added sugar. This study addresses the development of methods that in the future could feasibly be implemented in medical and community settings to assist individuals with risk factors in attaining both the weight management and diet quality goals for prevention of colorectal cancer.\n\nThe MyBestGI study seeks to test three dietary interventions in overweight and obese persons who have risk factors for colorectal cancer. Study participants in all groups receive the results of the Veggie Meter, breath ketones using Ketoscan and body composition testing (InBody270) at study visits. A small blood sample from the arm is taken at each visit for research on how eating affects metabolism.\n\nThe MyBestGI study will recruit 240 participants who will be randomized to receive to 12 months of: 1) Eating Plan 1, a group that receives written information on cancer preventive diets; 2) Eating Plan 2 that encourages limiting and logging four food groups associated with increased risks, namely foods containing refined flour, added sugars, processed meats, and red meats; or 3) Eating Plan 3 that combines logging of both food groups to limit and preventive food groups to encourage. Eating Plans 2 and 3 will be supported by written educational materials, brief telephone support calls, and the MyBestGI app. The main outcome is to evaluate to what extent these methods improve eating and possibly achieve weight loss over the year of study."
