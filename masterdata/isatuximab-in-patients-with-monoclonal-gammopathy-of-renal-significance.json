Isatuximab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma, but it is not approved by the FDA to treat MGRS. This means that the use of isatuximab in this study is considered 'investigational'.",

The proposed research will be conducted as a part of clinical trial which intends to prospectively evaluate the effect of anti-plasma cell therapy on renal outcomes in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). The study specifically intends to sequence the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes to determine any abnormalities that could lead to production of a misfolded immunoglobulin thus leading to deposition in renal parenchyma."
