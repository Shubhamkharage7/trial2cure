Participants HBsAg negative, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) positive and HBcAb negative due to vaccination are eligible for the study. Participants HBsAg negative and HBsAb positive for which the cause cannot be determined as vaccination will be considered ineligible for the study.\n* Positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody at screening or within the last 12 months.

One additional measurement can be taken if blood pressure and pulse rate are outside the specified limits.\n* The participant has clinically significant 12-lead ECG abnormalities at screening and check-in or in the opinion of the investigator has a second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, or has any of the following: QRS \\> 120 msec; QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \\> 450 msec (males) or \\> 470 msec (females); PR interval \\> 220 msec.\n* Use of any steroid (IV, oral, steroid eye drops) within 3 weeks prior to screening.
