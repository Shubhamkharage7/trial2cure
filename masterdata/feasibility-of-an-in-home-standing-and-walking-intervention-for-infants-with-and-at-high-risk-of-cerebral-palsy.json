            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and begin to evaluate the effect of an intensive in-home standing and walking intervention for infants with or at high risk of cerebral palsy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Seventy percent of children with cerebral palsy (CP) will walk, yet walking occurs much later than typically-developing children and may require use of a walker or crutches. The walking impairment is caused by an early lesion to the motor areas of the brain which disrupts the formation of appropriate neural connections, specifically projections of the corticospinal tract from the motor cortex to spinal cord motor circuits. The critical period of lower extremity neuromotor development, when intervention is expected to be most effective, begins before 12 months of age with the establishment of appropriate spinal connections and extends to 2 years of age with the presence of mature myelin in the corticospinal tract at the lumbar level. Based on this research, we propose that to optimize future walking outcomes of individuals with CP, it is critical to promote standing and walking practice during infancy before the age of 12 months.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and begin to evaluate the effect of an intensive in-home standing and walking intervention for infants with or at high risk of CP. Eight infants with or at high risk of CP will enter the study at 5 to 12-months of age. All infants will participate in 3 conditions: 8-weeks no intervention baseline, 16-weeks intervention, and 8-weeks no intervention follow-up. During the intervention weeks, parents will implement the in-home intensive standing and walking intervention with body-weight support 5 days/week for 30-60 min/day, with weekly telehealth calls and monthly home visits to progress the program. The body-weight support system allows infants to independently explore a 9 by 9-foot space in standing without physical assist from their parents or other adults.\n\nOutcomes will be measured at baseline, monthly throughout the 8 month study, and at 2 years of age. Feasibility of implementing the interventions will be assessed. Secondary outcomes will include standardized assessments of motor, cognitive, and language development of the infants."
