Cases with definite evidence of pocket infection (defined as localized erythema, swelling, pain, tenderness, warmth, erosion, or drainage), if treated with antibiotics before culture, even with negative culture, will be considered device infection\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are inappropriate for device extraction, for example those who are DNAR and not using therapy to prolong survival because any procedure is considered inappropriate and/or it is unlikely that extraction would change overall prognosis\n* Death within one week of definitive CIED systemic infection diagnosis or positive blood culture.
