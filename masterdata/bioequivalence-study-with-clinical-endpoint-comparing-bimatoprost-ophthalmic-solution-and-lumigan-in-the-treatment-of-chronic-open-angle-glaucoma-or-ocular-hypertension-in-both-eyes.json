At baseline (Day 0), subjects qualifying Intra Ocular Pressure (IOPs) following wash-out, with difference between the IOP in left and right eyes not being more than 5 mm Hg, will be randomized.\n\nSubjects will instill 1 drop of study drug (either T or R) in both eyes every evening at approximately 10:00 pm for 42 days.\n\nThe study subjects will undergo clinical evaluations throughout the study in order to assess safety and efficacy. Primary endpoint evaluation will be assessed after 2 weeks (Day 14) and 6 weeks (Day 42) of treatment for each study subject deemed eligible for evaluation.\n\nThe primary bioequivalence comparison is between the test and reference products for the mean difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) of both eyes between the two treatment groups."
