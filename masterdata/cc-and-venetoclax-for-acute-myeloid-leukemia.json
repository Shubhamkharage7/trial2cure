At the completion of dose escalation and after establishment of the MTD or recommended dose of CC-486 with venetoclax, an expansion phase will commence, using venetoclax with the MTD of CC-486 in relapsed/refractory patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects confirmed eligible will be admitted to the hospital for cycle 1, day 1. Venetoclax will be administered days 1-3, with the following schema:\n\n100 mg on day 1, 200 mg on day 2, 400 mg on day 3, and it will be continued at 400mg thereafter.\n\nSubjects taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors will be given the appropriate reduced doses of venetoclax.\n\nSubjects will be monitored inpatient for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) for at least 24 hours after administration of the venetoclax target dose. Venetoclax will continue at 400 mg daily until day 28, the completion of cycle 1.\n\nDuring dose escalation, subjects will be accrued into two cohorts using two different doses of CC-486 (cohort 1=200 mg, cohort 2=300 mg, both to be administered orally on days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle).\n\nTwo bone marrow biopsies will be performed during the first cycle: day 4 or 5 (+2 days), and day 28. The day 28 bone marrow will be used for efficacy purposes. Subsequent cycles will have response assessment bone marrow biopsies day 28 of every cycle for subjects who have not responded (CR/CRi/MLFS); after a response occurs (CR/CRi/MLFS), subjects will have bone marrow biopsies on day 28 of every 3rd cycle until they have been on the study for one year, at which point they will have a bone marrow biopsy every 6 months until study discontinuation.\n\nOnce the MTD is established, or in the absence of an MTD, a recommendation for a CC-486 dose with venetoclax is made, the study will progress to the expansion phase. For the expansion phase, 10 subjects will be recruited. These will be patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease who have never received venetoclax. On day 1 of cycle 1, subjects will receive CC-486 at the MTD or recommended CC-486 dose as determined from Phase I, and this will continue daily through day 14. Venetoclax will be dose escalated, as above, from 100 to 200 to 400 mg on days 1, 2 and 3, respectively, with inpatient monitoring for TLS, and with appropriate dose reduction if administered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Bone marrow biopsies will occur on day 4 or 5 (+2) and on day 28 of cycle 1. Subsequent response assessment bone marrow biopsies will occur on day 28 of every 3rd cycle for subjects who have achieved a response for 1 year from study entry and then every 6 months until study discontinuation, or on day 28 of every treatment cycle for subjects who do not achieve a response."

This includes history of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), celiac disease (e.g. sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug and/or predispose the subject to an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.\n6. Subject exhibits evidence of uncontrolled systemic infection requiring therapy (viral, bacterial or fungal). Uncontrolled is defined as ongoing signs/symptoms related the infection without improvement despite appropriate antibiotics, antiviral therapy and/or other treatment.\n7.
