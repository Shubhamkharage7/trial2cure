The main questions it aims to answer:\n\n* Is citicoline safe in this patient population?\n* Does citicoline have a benefit in terms of improving oxygenation?\n* Does citicoline reduce overall severity of illness as reflected by standardized scales.\n\nPatients will be assigned to i.v. treatment with citicoline or saline twice daily for 5 consecutive days. SpO2/FiO2 ratios will be recorded daily as per standard clinical practice to compare citicoline treatments at three different doses to placebo.",
            "detailedDescription": "SCARLET is a single center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and randomized Phase 1 trial of i.v. citicoline in adult patients of any sex, gender, age, or ethnicity who are present with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS CoV-2 infection. The goals are safety over a range of doses based on the number of treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v.5, and demonstration of efficacy as reflected by SpO2/FiO2 measured at day 3 in hospitalized COVID infected patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, as defined by requiring at least 4 liters nasal cannula oxygen supplementation to maintain the SpO2 above 90%. The trial will enroll 20 patients per dose for 3 citicoline doses (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day) along with 20 placebo-treated controls."
