This project will use a longitudinal design, following children from Kindergarten through 1st grade, to understand how the brain networks associated with reading, math, and EF interact to predict academic outcomes and, in those who struggle academically, intervention response.",
            "detailedDescription": "This longitudinal study will be conducted with 260 Kindergartners, staggered across multiple cohorts, who are followed through 1st grade. There will be three time points of testing for each cohort: fall of Kindergarten, spring of Kindergarten, and in the fall of 1st grade.\n\nAfter the third testing time point, in the fall of 1st grade, the bottom 1/3 of readers in the sample will be selected to participate in the intervention arm of the study. These students will be randomly placed in one of two arms: business-as-usual, in which children receive no additional instruction; or the reading intervention condition, in which they receive 20 hours of 1:1 reading intervention over 6 weeks. Children in both sub-sample arms are assessed again after tutoring is complete, in the spring of 1st grade.\n\nNeuroimaging through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will occur as part of study participation in conjunction with testing at fall of Kindergarten, fall of 1st grade, and spring of 1st grade time points."
