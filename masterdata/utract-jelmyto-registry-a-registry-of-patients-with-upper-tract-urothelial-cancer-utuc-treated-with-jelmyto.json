Patients will be followed until 3 years after the first dose of Jelmyto or death.\n\nData will be captured to address specific clinical questions and data gaps related to real world use of Jelmyto.\n\nExample clinical questions:\n\n1. How is Jelmyto used in the real world setting?\n2. What adverse events (AEs) and at what rates and time points are they observed in the real world setting?\n3. What is the disease volume before and after resection/ablation prior to treating with Jelmyto?\n4. Did the use of Jelmyto impact clinical decision making and management?\n5. What is the complete response (CR) rate, duration of response, and rate of progression, including subgroups of interest?\n6. What are the rates of, time to, and pathology at radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) by response to treatment and number of Jelmyto doses received?\n7. What are outcomes for non-responders or partial responders? What are the rates of surgical and therapeutic treatment options received following response assessment, including additional Jelmyto?\n8. What was the outcome of patients with solitary kidney and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD)? Did Jelmyto prevent dialysis by avoiding nephrectomy in solitary kidney or in patients with baseline CKD?\n9. What is the rate and timing of bladder cancer occurrence and/or recurrences?"
