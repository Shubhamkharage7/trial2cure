Patients will be screened and evaluated to determine whether or not they meet stated inclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable the ex vivo generation of CRX100. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), malignant melanoma (excluding uveal melanoma), gastric cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and osteosarcoma.\n\nThe study will start with monotherapy dose escalation followed by combination cohorts."

Subjects must not have history of active or symptomatic autoimmune disease or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, other symptomatic autoimmune disease, documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome requiring systemic treatment in the past two years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, steroids or immunosuppressive agents) Exceptions are permitted for vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition requiring only hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger or other conditions approved by the medical monitor.\n7. Have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\>10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to apheresis, and within 14 days prior to infusion. Inhaled, intramuscular injection, or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses (\u226410 mg daily prednisone equivalents) are permitted. Stable doses of steroids are permitted for subjects with pre-treated brain metastases. Short-term (\\<48 hr) steroid pretreatment for contrast allergy for imaging is permitted.\n8. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active chronic hepatitis B or C, life-threatening illnesses unrelated to cancer, or any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the Investigator's opinion, interfere with participation in this study.\n9. Pregnant or nursing an infant (subject or household contacts).\n10. Clinically significant immunodeficiency (e.g., due to underlying illness and/or medication) in a subject or household contacts.\n11. Have any underlying medical condition (including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring treatment, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia), psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise study administration as per protocol or compromise the assessment of AEs.\n12. Have a history of another invasive malignancy, except for the following circumstance: individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are eligible if they have been disease free and off treatment for at least two years or are deemed by the Investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated: carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix, localized prostate cancer, or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. When enrolling a subject with another malignancy, the Investigator must discuss the subject with the Medical Monitor.",
