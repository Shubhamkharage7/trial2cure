            "briefSummary": "The University of California Davis, Comprehensive Cancer Center's (UCDCCC) Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (OCOE) serves the 19 catchment counties which approximately consists of 5 million residents. Currently, the overall catchment population cancer screening rates fall below 80%. The aim of OCOE is to increase cancer education (prevention, screening, and vaccination) and training. Through education, and encouraging participation in routine screening for early detection, this can help increase cancer knowledge. In addition to cancer education, OCOE wants to educate community members regarding modifiable risk factors which include tobacco usage, being overweight/obese (physical inactivity/poor nutrition), and lack of immunizations. By increasing knowledge of cancer prevention, screening, and vaccination this will help community members become more aware of their cancer risk.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objective: To determine the effects of health education, outreach, and training activities on cancer control and prevention knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors among the University of California Davis, Comprehensive Cancer Center's (UCDCCC) catchment area residents. There are 3 Specific Aims for EDUCATE.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To educate catchment area residents on modifiable risk factors for cancer (e.g., screening, behavior, vaccination) and the importance of participation in cancer research.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Provide participants with educational materials on cancer prevention, screening, and vaccination.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the health education, outreach, and training through the analyses of quantitative and qualitative data collected from the health education activities."
