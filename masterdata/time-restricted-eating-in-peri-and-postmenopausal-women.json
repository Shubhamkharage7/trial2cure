Following a 1-week baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to either a TRE or unrestricted control diet schedule (1-to-1 ratio) for 8 weeks. At baseline and weeks 4 and 8 of the intervention, daily eating and sleep patterns will be assessed for one week, followed by collection of fasting lipids and metabolic labs, body weight and vital signs; questionnaires assessing sleep and mood health, actigraphy and body composition via whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry will be assessed at baseline and week 8."
