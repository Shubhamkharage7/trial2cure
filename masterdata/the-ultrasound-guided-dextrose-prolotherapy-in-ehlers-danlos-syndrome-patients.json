Specific Aim: To show the safety and efficacy of prolotherapy injection for chronic sacroiliac and myofascial lumbar pain while standardizing an ultrasound guided injection technique\n2. Specific Aim: To demonstrate that dextrose prolotherapy subjectively decreases lumbar back pain (LBP) associated with chronic sacroiliac (SI) and myofascial lumbar back pain/injury in patients with Hypermobile-Type Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS).\n3. Specific Aim: To use ultrasound (US) guidance to identify SI and myofascial lumbar back pain/injury for targeted dextrose prolotherapy treatment and to provide objective measures of decreasing inflammation via Power Doppler and ligament repair.\n4. Specific Aim: To determine if US-guided dextrose prolotherapy decreases the direct costs of care for chronic LBP in contrast to conventional therapies by reducing return visits, specialty referrals, physical therapy, medications, and unnecessary procedures.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this research project is to prove that ultrasound-guided prolotherapy is a cost effective and curative treatment option for chronic low back pain in Hypermobile-Type Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS). Ultrasound (US) will be used to assist in proper evaluation of the thoracolumbar fascial complex (TLFC), long posterior sacroiliac ligament (LPSL), multifidi and gluteus maximus along with precise administration of medication into identified regions of interest. By comparing targeted lidocaine and concentrated dextrose (prolotherapy) injections, placebo effect or therapeutic local trauma created by the needle, like dry needling can be ruled out. The combination of subjective data collection with Owestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Number Rating Scale (NRS) assessments and objective findings on ultrasound imaging such as Pixel Ratio and ligament integrity will provide sufficient information to determine if prolotherapy is effective at reducing inflammation, providing prolonged pain relief, and return to function in patients with hEDS."
