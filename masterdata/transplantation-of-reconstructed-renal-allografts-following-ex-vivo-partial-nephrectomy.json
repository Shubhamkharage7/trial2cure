This can be estimated as (global GFR)(SRFipsilateral) x 0.75(estimate that at least 75% of the function will be saved during ex vivo tumor excision and reconstruction). Of note most such kidneys will experience some positive functional compensation but this might be mitigated by a small amount of functional loss related to ischemia. Most studies suggest that this will really be an underestimate of the final GFR in the recipient.\n\nFor Recipients:\n\n* Age \\>60\n* Able to understand and willing to sign informed consent\n* Presence of ESRD or CKD5 with likely progression to ESRD\n* Does not have potential living donor\n* Not likely to receive a more \"ideal\" donor kidney due to significant comorbidities and/or age\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nFor Donors:\n\n* Known familial RCC syndrome\n* Functional considerations:\n\n  o \\< 50 years of age\n  * Preoperative GFR \\< 80 ml/min/1.73 m2\n  * Proteinuria on urine dipstick or urinalysis (\u22651+ considered positive)\n  * Predicted new baseline GFR (NBGFR) following radical nephrectomy would be \\< 45\n  * NBGFR would be calculated using previously described equation based on split renal function (SFR) and renal functional compensation (RFC)\n  * NBGFR = global GFR x (SRFcontralateral from PVA) x 1.25 (average amount of RFC)2\n* Comorbidities with risk of deteriorating renal function:\n\n  * Hypertension requiring three or more anti-hypertensives\n  * Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin or with end organ damage\n  * Morbid obesity\n  * History of nephrolithiasis or other\n* Tumor characteristics on pre-operative cross-sectional imaging:\n\n  o Tumor has infiltrative features\n  * Tumor is \\> 4cm (does not meet criteria for cT1a stage)\n  * Regional lymphadenopathy, branch or main renal vein invasion, or other imaging findings suggestive of locally advanced disease\n* Kidney characteristics on pre-operative cross-sectional imaging:\n\n  * More than one renal artery unless can be readily and safely reconstructed\n  * More than one renal vein unless can be readily and safely reconstructed\n  * Duplicated collecting system unless can be readily and safely reconstructed\n* High-risk features on renal mass biopsy (if obtained) or intraoperative pathology\n\n  o Malignant non-RCC pathology\n\n  o Rhabdoid or sarcomatoid differentiation\n\n  o Grade 4\n\n  o Positive or concerning margins during tumor excision\n* Must be deemed appropriate living donor candidate per the standard living donor selection process at the Cleveland Clinic o All altruistic living donors undergo a complete evaluation by medical providers and social workers ensuring that they are appropriate candidates to undergo this procedure. This evaluation includes direct query into any history of psychiatric comorbidities and/or substance abuse. If present, this prompts a formal evaluation by psychiatry prior to confirmation of donor candidacy.\n\nFor Recipients:\n\n\u2022 Traditional contraindications to kidney transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic would apply, including the following directly from the Transplant Care Pathway:\n\n* Active, untreated bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Once treated, patients may be reconsidered. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)14 or chronic hepatitis15 infections will be evaluated on an individual basis.\n* Active malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer and other selected low-grade, low-stage cancers (e.g., bladder, kidney, prostate). The American Society of Transplant (AST) clinical practice guidelines published in 2001 are dated. Improved methods of cancer prognostication are available on a cancer-specific basis.16 An acceptable disease-free waiting period may be needed prior to transplantation depending on the cancer type (stage/grade) and treatment modality. Expert opinion from an oncological specialist may be needed to facilitate decisions about wait-listing or performance of a transplant.\n* Medical non-adherence, substance abuse or behaviors leading to a failure to achieve a therapeutic physician/transplant team-patient alliance.\n* Life expectancy of less than five years independent of renal disease.\n* Advanced circulatory disease (cardiac, cerebral, peripheral), pulmonary disease or other non-renal conditions such that transplantation would pose a significant risk for morbidity/mortality.\n* Obesity with body mass index (BMI) \\> 38, or an abdominal wall configuration that in the judgment of the evaluating surgeon poses undue complication risk.\n* Active nicotine abuse (in any form).\n* Poor functional status independent of renal disease.\n* Considering the average waiting times for a deceased donor kidney is more than 3 years, only transplant candidates 72 years or younger will be accepted for evaluation. Suitable candidates may remain on the waiting list up to the age of 75-year-old. They will be delisted if no transplantation has occurred.\n* Cumulative burden of disease defined as multiple medical conditions that on their own may not preclude listing but that in combination are deemed not suitable by the transplant selection committee.",
