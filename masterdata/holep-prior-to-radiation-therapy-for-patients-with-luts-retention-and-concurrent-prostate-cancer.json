            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose a prospective trial to investigate pre-radiation holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP) in men with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and prostate cancer who have elected for radiation therapy as the primary treatment modality for their prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that pre-radiation HoLEP may decrease their overall LUTS and may decrease their need for subsequent radiation therapy. The goal with this study is to better understand the overlap between prostate cancer and LUTS, as well as determine if primary surgical treatment for the LUTS with HoLEP can also serve as a possible treatment modality for concurrent prostate cancer. This information may provide further information to inform future standard of care practices for patients with prostate cancer."
