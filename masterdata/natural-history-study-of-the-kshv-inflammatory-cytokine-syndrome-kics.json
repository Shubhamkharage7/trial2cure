            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\n- KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) is a newly recognized disease caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus can cause cancer. People with KICS can have severe symptoms. They include fever, weight loss, and fluid in the legs or abdomen. People with KICS may also be at risk of getting other cancers associated with KSHV. These cancers include Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma. Because KICS is a newly identified disease, more information is needed on how the disease works and what can be done to treat it.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To collect genetic and medical information from people with KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus and symptoms that resemble those caused by KICS.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will have regular study visits. The schedule will be determined by the study researchers.\n* Participants will provide a complete medical history and have a full physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be collected as well.\n* People with KICS that requires treatment may get new experimental treatments. These treatments may include antiviral drugs and chemotherapy drugs, depending on the nature of the disease.\n* Participants will have imaging studies, such as chest x-rays and computed tomography scans, to study the tumors.\n* Bone marrow and lymph node biopsies may be done to collect tissue samples for study.\n* Participants who have Kaposi sarcoma will have photographs taken of their lesions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background\n\n-Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) is a newly recognized syndrome caused by KSHV. It is characterized by severe inflammatory symptoms including fevers, wasting, cytopenias, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia, associated in some cases with lymphadenopathy or effusions, without pathological evidence of MCD. Patients with KICS exhibit elevated KSHV viral loads and cytokine dysregulation, with elevations of IL-6, IL-10, and a KSHV-encoded IL-6 homolog, viral IL-6.\n\nObjective\n\n-Assessment of the natural history of KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), including the spectrum of clinical, laboratory and radiographic abnormalities seen in affected participants.\n\nEligibility\n\n* Adults of any HIV status with:\n\n  * At least two symptoms, laboratory or radiographic abnormalities which are at least possibly attributable to KICS (including fever, fatigue, cachexia, edema, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, hematologic cytopenias, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, effusions)\n  * C-reactive protein \\>3mg/L\n  * Evidence of KSHV infection or a risk exposure for KSHV infection\n  * No evidence of KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease\n* Participants with these characteristics will be further evaluated to identify those whose clinical and laboratory features are consistent with the KICS working case definition to be followed in the natural history phase of the study.\n\nDesign\n\n-This is a single center natural history study with a cohort of up to 120 evaluable participants. Participants who meet the criteria for KICS will go onto a natural history arm, which permits observation for KICS with or without other concurrent KSHV-associated disorders. Participants who require KS and/or primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) treatment along with a KICS diagnosis will receive rational therapies for these conditions or be treated for their KS and/or PEL on a separate protocol while still followed on this study."
