Eligible participants will have been diagnosed with Lyme disease (LD), post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), and/or chronic Lyme (CL) either during or before a prior pregnancy. Participants will complete quantitative surveys on topics such as their medical history, their child(ren)'s development, and demographic information. They will then participate in a qualitative interview where they will be asked about their experiences with pregnancy and with parenting their child(ren) in the context of their condition.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients with chronic conditions may experience the perinatal period and the experience of parenting differently than their healthy peers. The purpose of this study is to understand the lived experiences of pregnancy and parenting among gestational parents with Lyme disease.\n\nParticipants may be included in this study if they report having received a diagnosis of Lyme disease (LD), post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), or chronic Lyme (CL) and they have given birth to at least one liveborn child. The investigators hypothesize that patients with LD/PTLDS/CL will experience unique challenges related to pregnancy, experiences in medical care settings, and their child's development.\n\nEnrolled participants will complete a brief set of online quantitative questionnaires on topics such as their demographic characteristics, family information, Lyme disease histories, and mental health. The investigators will report on these data to illustrate similarities and differences between participants in the study for potentially relevant factors (e.g., timing of Lyme diagnosis relative to pregnancy, symptoms, mental health concerns). The questionnaires will be followed by an in-depth qualitative interview in English with each participant to learn about their experiences related to pregnancy and parenting with LD/PTLDS/CL, including specific questions about navigating the health care system, information seeking behaviors, and their child's development."
