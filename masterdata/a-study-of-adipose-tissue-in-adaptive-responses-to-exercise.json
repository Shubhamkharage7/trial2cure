            "detailedDescription": "Adipose tissue has important endocrine functions that influence metabolic health. Early evidence shows that adipose adapts to physiological stress, including exercise. The objective here is to determine how exercise-induced alterations in adipose tissue cellular composition and endocrine signaling may contribute to the beneficial adaptations to exercise in aging and obesity.\n\nImmune cell populations and inflammatory signatures will be assessed in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies collected from obese and normal weight young and older adults before, immediately after, and 3 hours after a 30-min bout of cycling exercise at 70% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). Mass spectrometry, Olink targeted inflammation assays, and RNA sequencing will be used for full proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of the adipose tissue secretome (the proteins and molecules secreted from the adipose tissue) and the cargo of extracellular vesicles isolated from plasma and media collected from cultured human adipose tissue explants generated from each time point.\n\nOverall, the primary hypothesis of the proposed work is that a single bout of exercise triggers transient changes in adipose tissue paracrine/endocrine signals and immune cellular composition. The investigators propose that these responses contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise locally and in distal tissues and that the cumulative effects of acute changes in adipose tissue likely contribute to the positive alterations in adipose tissue associated with exercise training."
