            "detailedDescription": "Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) shows promise in adults with migraine, but research is limited in adolescents. The current study aims to advance behavioral treatments for adolescents with frequent migraine by adapting an existing empirically-supported MBI for adolescents (Learning to BREATHE) to meet the unique needs of adolescents with chronic migraine. In Phase I of the study, we will use feedback solicited from interviews with teens with chronic migraine, their parents, and healthcare providers documenting the experience of living with chronic migraine and on the content and delivery of the MBI to create an adapted telehealth group intervention specifically tailored for adolescents with frequent migraine. In Phase II of the study, the adapted MBI will be piloted in a single-arm trial with adolescents with frequent migraine to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical signals."
