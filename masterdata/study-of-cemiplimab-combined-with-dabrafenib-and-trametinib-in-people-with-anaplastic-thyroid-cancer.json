Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) before study entry and for the duration of study participation. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception before the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 months after completion of trametinib administration\n* Must agree to allow 2-4 separate biopsies of any malignant lesion. For patients whose biopsies (initial) are deemed as unsafe or contraindicated, they will not be eligible.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Note: Use of Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) is permitted\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous documentation or current evidence of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib.\n\n  \u00b0 Exception: (1) Patients who started dabrafenib and tranetinib for ATC at an institution outside of MSK are eligible or (2) with the consent of the PI (Sherman). However, this exception is limited to 8 subjects.\n* Active brain metastases, unless an exception is granted by the Principal Investigator.\n* Current interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis\n* Prior history of idelalisib therapy. Exceptions allowed with the consent of the principal investigator (Dr. Sherman)\n* History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR):\n\n  \u00b0 History of RVO or CSR or predisposing factors to RVO or CSR (e.g. uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension)\n* History or current evidence of cardiovascular risk, including any of the following:\n\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\<LLN\n  * A QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett's formula of QTcB\\>/=480msec\n  * Current evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias (exception: patients with controlled atrial fibrillation for \\>30 days before enrollment are eligible)\n  * History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months before treatment\n* Known hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection, which will be allowed)\n\nHIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with trametinib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirement.\n* Inability to receive immunotherapy for the following reasons:\n\n  * Any prior grade \\>/=3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving any previous immunotherapy agent or any unresolved irAE grade \\>1\n  * Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years. NOTE: Subjects with vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years) are not excluded. Exceptions allowed with the consent of the principal investigator (Dr. Sherman)\n  * Active inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis)\n  * History of primary immunodeficiency\n  * History of allogeneic organ transplant\n  * Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of active tuberculosis (this does not include a history of being PPD positive)",
