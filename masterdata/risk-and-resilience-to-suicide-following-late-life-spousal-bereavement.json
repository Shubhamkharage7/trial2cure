            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the RISE study is to examine how the 24-hour rhythm of sleep and social activity relate to mood and suicidal ideation among older adults that recently lost a spouse or life partner.",
            "detailedDescription": "Experiencing the death of a spouse or life partner is a profoundly distressing event that may cause abrupt changes in one's daily routine, including decreased self-care and withdrawal from social activities. While most individuals adapt over time, a substantial number of older bereaved spouses (20-35%) experience depression, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and early mortality, including death by suicide.\n\nThe objective of this study is to examine the risk for and resilience to late life suicide during the early spousal bereavement period by investigating the extent to which (1) social connectedness influences suicide risk and (2) whether circadian rhythm instability (inconsistent patterns of sleep, activity, meals, and socialization) helps explain this association.\n\nThe investigators will enroll 169 adults aged 65+ years who experienced the death of a spouse or life partner within the previous 12 months. All participants will complete repeated assessments of social connectedness, clinical assessments of depression and suicide ideation, and accelerometry recordings of the 24-hour pattern of sleep and activity. Participants will also complete a 3-month behavioral probe, designed to promote self-care behaviors in older bereaved spouses using technology and motivational health coaching. The behavioral probe targets circadian rhythm stability by focusing on regular routine of sleep, meals, and social activities. The behavioral probe will determine whether modifying social connectedness reduces suicide risk and whether circadian rhythm stability explains part of this association."
