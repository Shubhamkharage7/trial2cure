            "detailedDescription": "Time-Restricted Eating (TRE) is a form of caloric restriction through daily prolonged fasting that has been shown to lead to weight loss, improved glucose regulation, and suppression of inflammation. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic condition that in certain patients can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The only current treatment for NAFLD is weight loss. In the proposed study, the investigators aim to test the hypothesis that TRE will add additional benefit in the treatment of NAFLD on top of standard of care diet and lifestyle modifications."

The investigators plan to enroll 40 participants to two arms between the years of 18 and 65 with NAFLD as defined by MRI-PDFF score of greater or equal to 10%. Participants on the experimental arm (TRE plus SOC) will be required to fast for 16 hours each day for 12 weeks. Counseling will involve instructing the participant to choose an 8-hour eating window. During the fasting window, the participant is able to drink water and black coffee or tea. Participants in both arms will be given lifestyle recommendations with respect to diet and exercise. The RD will instruct participants regarding standard of care lifestyle recommendations, which includes education of a low-calorie diet and moderate-intensity exercise.",
