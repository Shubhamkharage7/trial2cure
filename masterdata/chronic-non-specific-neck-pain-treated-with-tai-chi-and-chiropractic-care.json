Individuals will be followed for 8 weeks after the end of their intervention period to assess longer-term outcomes. Our primary outcomes will be focused on the feasibility of recruiting, retaining and monitoring the safety of adults with CNNP into our trial. Secondary clinical outcomes include following patients centered-outcomes: pain, disability, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, cognitive and affective outcomes (postural awareness, pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, interoceptive awareness)."
