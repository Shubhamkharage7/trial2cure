EXE-346 is a live biotherapeutic product containing a fixed proportion mixture of 8 individual bacterial strains.\n\nThe Phase 1b part of the study is an open label (OL), single-arm study to assess the safety of EXE-346 administered orally for up to 4 weeks.\n\nThe Phase 2 part of the study is a randomized, double-blinded study to assess the safety and efficacy of the same dose of EXE-346 administered orally for up to 8 weeks, compared with placebo. Subjects who complete the Phase 2 double-blinded part of the study will be eligible to participate in an optional open label extension phase to receive EXE-346 for up to 8 weeks."
