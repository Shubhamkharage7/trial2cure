            "briefSummary": "Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death from asthma. Despite well established guidelines, under-treatment for asthma is common, particularly for poor urban teens. This study aims to test a novel, developmentally appropriate and scalable model of care to ensure optimal guideline-based treatment for urban teens with difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers for Teens (TEAM-UP for Teens) program includes 3 core components: 1- An individualized asthma management plan developed at the start of the school year via a real-time, synchronous school-based telemedicine visit that directly connects the teen to an asthma specialist, 2- School-based or video supported directly observed therapy (DOT) to implement the medication plan and allow for teens to experience the benefits of consistent therapy, 3- Follow-up telehealth visits with a nurse asthma educator to facilitate ongoing care and provide developmentally appropriate self-management support. This study is a randomized trial of TEAM-UP for Teens vs an enhanced care (EC) control group (n=360, 12-16 years). We will assess the effectiveness of the program in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based asthma care. Our main hypothesis is that Teens receiving the TEAM-UP for Teens intervention will have more symptom-free days at 3, 5, 7, and 12-months compared to EC. We will assess a number of secondary outcomes, including additional clinical outcomes, functional outcomes, airway inflammation, and receipt of specific care measures including medication adjustments and treatment of and other comorbidities. We will also identify potential mediators and moderators of the intervention effect, and will evaluate the process of intervention implementation. At the completion of the study, the program will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care and reduce morbidity for high risk teens with difficult to control asthma."
