In addition, 4 and 5-year UNOS registry data of the 126 subjects who received an EVLP transplant under the NOVEL and NOVEL Extension studies are provided as part of the long-term safety and quality of life data.

            "detailedDescription": "The XVIVO registry is an ongoing, observational, multicenter, retrospective review of patients exposed to XPS\u2122 EVLP-treated lungs. The Registry study is aligned and managed by the UNOS and OPTN data collection process. This registry uses quarterly STAR file data requests for the OPTN data managed by UNOS.\n\nThe EVLP procedure and transplantation will be performed per XPS\u2122 Instructions for Use and the treating physician's discretion. Post-transplant clinical care will follow the institution's standard-of-care policies.\n\nOPTN updated the data collected since the submission of the protocol therefore the data collection has changed. The following data has updated collection:\n\n* Collects if hospitalized since last follow-up (yes, no), not the number of hospitalizations\n* Collects acute rejection episodes (yes treated, yes not treated, no), not the number of episodes\n* Collects Karnofsky Score as replacement for Physical and functional capacity\n* Employment limitations has been updated to working for income (yes or no)\n* No longer collects BOS, XVIVO to request BOS evaluations on subjects with visits prior to June 30, 2020 and any other omissions of end points not available in the data requested via STAR request.\n* Collects FEV1 (L) effective June 30, 2020 to calculate CLAD and diagnosis of CLAD, if applicable.\n* No longer provides Other, Specify text in STAR request."
