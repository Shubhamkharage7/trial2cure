            "briefSummary": "A randomized trial will compare 6-months of low-dose (65mg elemental iron daily) among prospective blood donors who are deferred for low haemoglobin but have passed all of the other pre-screening requirements for blood donation to a group of donors who were deferred from donating and receive the current standard of care (nutrition counseling only). An automated full blood count (FBC) will also be done to identify any safety concerns. The randomized trial will evaluate effectiveness with the primary outcome of at least one successful donation during a 12-month follow-up period. Safety will be evaluated by tracking iron supplementation related adverse events (e.g., lower gastrointestinal) and acceptability (e.g., compliance to study prescribed regimen) with monthly phone calls. Participants will be followed for a total of 12 months from screening with follow up phone calls at 4 weekly intervals. All participants will receive nutrition counselling and haemoglobin will be evaluated at screening. Individuals with very low haemoglobin (\\<10g/dl in females and \\<11g/dl in males) will be identified by an automated FBC at screening and referred for proper medical care.\n\nSample size will be 264 per group: this gives 80% power for detecting an odds ratio of 2.6. With 2 donors recruited at each donation event, this will require 264 donation events. This corresponds to 2.5 donation events per week for 2 years or 2 donation events per week for 2.5 years."
