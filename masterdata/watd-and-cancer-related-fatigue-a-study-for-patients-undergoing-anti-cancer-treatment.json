Over the course of the four-week study, participants will be asked to provide experiential diaries detailing adherence to and acceptability of the WATD (Wearable Activity Tracker Device) and conduct PRO (Patient Reported Outcome) measures at week two and week four (end of study). During the final research visit at week four, subjects will return the WATD and will complete the acceptability survey. Each week of the four-week study, the WATD data and experiential diaries will be downloaded for analysis."
