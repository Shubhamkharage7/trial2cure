This 4-month single group pilot trial evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effects of a novel, remotely-delivered resistance training (RT) intervention. All participants will engage in RT during this trial and the web-based platform is the primary modality through which the remote RT intervention is delivered. Assessments are conducted at baseline and follow-up (month 4). Aim 1 will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the remotely delivered RT program. Aim 2 will examine the potential effects on RT behaviors. Aim 3 will examine the potential effects on clinical and patient-reported outcomes."
