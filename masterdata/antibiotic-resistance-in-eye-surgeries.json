            "briefSummary": "In this study, the investigators seek to determine the effect of antibiotic use post-surgery on antimicrobial resistance. The investigators will be studying adults (aged 18 or older) who will undergo eye surgery at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). We seek to gain a better understanding of how antibiotic use during the perioperative period influences local and systemic antibiotic resistance at the individual level.",
            "detailedDescription": "Antibiotic use has saved millions of lives globally. However, this comes at the cost of selecting for antibiotic-resistant organisms at the individual and the community level. It is estimated that every year, approximately 700,000 deaths are associated with drug resistance globally. This places a significant burden on the public health system and the judicious use of antibiotics is more important than ever before.\n\nThe proposed masked, randomized controlled trial evaluates the effects of topical antibiotic use on the selection of antibiotic resistance determinants at the local and systemic levels. The results will provide guidance for antibiotic usage in ophthalmology and may have the potential to inform public health policies."
