Those participants who can participate will be admitted to the clinical pharmacology center (CPC) and complete pretreatment tests. Those participants will stay at the CPC for the duration of the study. On Days 1 and 8, each participant will receive a single oral dose of dazucorilant 300 mg, after eating. On Days 5-11, all participants will receive once daily, oral doses of itraconazole 200 mg, after eating. Blood and safety assessments will continue for 96-hours after dosing on Day 1 and Day 8. Participants will leave the CPC following completion of all procedures on Day 12.\n\nParticipants will return to the CPC for a final visit 7 (\u00b11) days after their final dose of study medication."
