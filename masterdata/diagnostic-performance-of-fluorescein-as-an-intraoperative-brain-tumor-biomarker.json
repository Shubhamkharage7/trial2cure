            "briefSummary": "This clinical research will evaluate the diagnostic potential of fluorescein as visualized through an operating microscope relative to 1) contrast enhancement on co-registered preoperative MR scans, 2) intraoperative ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence and 3) gold-standard histology obtained from biopsy sampling during the procedure.\n\nSubjects will include those people with operable brain tumor with first-time presumed pre-surgical diagnosis of high-grade glioma or low-grade glioma.",
            "detailedDescription": "Consenting subjects who have met inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive either fluorescein+ALA or fluorescein alone. HGG patients will be randomized on a 2 to 1 basis to receive either both fluorescein and ALA or fluorescein alone, and LGG patients will be randomized on a 1 to 1 basis.\n\nThis study is a diagnostic trial of fluorescein fluorescence as an intraoperative imaging biomarker during open cranial surgery for tumor resection of first-time (preoperatively) presumed high or low grade glioma. Subjects participate in a \"one-time\" event/visit (i.e, surgery) as part of this protocol. Images and data from the patient's pre- and post-operative MR scans are used for analysis in the study, but these acquisitions are part of the patient's standard-of-care, would occur independently of whether the participant is enrolled; and thus, are not considered to be research study visits. No post-surgical follow-up visit is part of the protocol data collection or analysis. Patients are monitored for possible adverse events through the routine follow-up under the care of the operating surgeon involved in the study procedures, post-operatively and subsequently through the medical record. Hence, this information is already being collected as part of standard-of-care and is available for adverse event surveillance. Patients receiving ALA who present with abnormally elevated LFTs beyond the peri-operative observation period are monitored on a regular basis until resolution and this blood testing is considered to be part of the study.\n\nAdministration of study drug:\n\nPatients enrolled in the fluorescein+ALA arm will be administered orally 5-ALA (DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY) at 20 mg/kg body weight, dissolved in 100 ml of water, approximately 3 hours prior to the induction of anesthesia.\n\nFor patients receiving only fluorescein, the operating surgeon will request bolus injection (at a dose of 5 mg/kg) approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of tumor resection. For especially long cases (e.g., \\> 4 h) or if fluorescein fluorescence dissipates substantially during the course of the procedure, a second bolus injection may occur later in the case."
