During the nightshifts, the following outcome measures: psychomotor vigilance test, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Task Load Index, and Noordsy-Dahle Subjective Experience Scale will be assessed during the window of circadian low (2 to 6 am) and at a time that is most convenient time for each participant. A final online survey will assess satisfaction levels with lifestyle strategies, Sleep-related Impairment, Task Load, and satisfaction and feedback about the program at the end of the study.",
