            "briefSummary": "The PRISM (Promoting Resilience in Stress Management) intervention is an evidence-based program that builds resilience. This program was developed in adolescent and young adult oncology and utilizes centrally administered skills-based coaching to bolster positive psychological tools known as resilience resources. These resources include stress management, goal-setting, and positive reframing. Previous studies using this intervention have found PRISM to be successfully administered remotely and it has improved resilience, psychological distress, hope, and quality of life. Among adult caregivers, PRISM has shown to improve resilience, self-efficacy, and engagement with medical care. While PRISM successfully targets distress and associated downstream consequences known to be experienced by breast cancer survivors, it has not been utilized in adults with cancer or in marginalized communities. Adapting this intervention to this context will require the testing of the intervention and, importantly, tailoring to meet the needs of women with breast cancer, particularly those of marginalized populations who may uniquely benefit from this intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "This single-arm pilot study will (1) test feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the PRISM intervention in individuals with breast cancer, (2) elicit patient perspectives on elements for future adaptation or expansion to meet the unique needs of women with breast cancer, (3) assess trajectory of patient-reported outcomes and biological measures of stress for patients with breast cancer receiving the PRISM intervention."
