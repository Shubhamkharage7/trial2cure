In order to combat this issue, this study assesses the feasibility of the culturally tailored intervention T1DES and evaluates the effect of the T1DES intervention on diabetes outcomes in a pilot randomized clinical trial among Black young adults with T1D.",
            "detailedDescription": "This research focuses on the unique needs of Black young adults aged 18-30 years to address a critical gap in the research and clinical care. The goal is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a culturally adapted and tailored intervention to enhance diabetes management strategies among Black young adults with T1D, addressing the pervasive racial disparity in health outcomes for this population.\n\nThe specific aims for this study are to:\n\nAim 1: Assess feasibility of the culturally tailored intervention T1DES by measuring intervention acceptability, demand (retention, completed \\> 80% of sessions), practicality, and implementation fidelity through participant surveys and key informant interviews with participants and the health care delivery team.\n\nAim 2: Evaluate the effect of the T1DES intervention on diabetes outcomes in a pilot randomized clinical trial among N=40 Black young adults age 18-30 years with T1D and elevated HbA1c (\\>7.5%) by comparing changes in HbA1c, diabetes distress, and self-management from baseline to 6-months postbaseline among participants randomized to T1DES compared to the diabetes education-only control condition.\n\nThe goal of this study is to provide diabetes education and emotion regulation support tailored for Black young adults' experiences that will result in sustained glycemic control and can be incorporated into adult endocrinology practices."
