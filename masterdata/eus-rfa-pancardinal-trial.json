Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) will be performed before tumor resection surgery, with the goal of shrinking a tumor or stopping the spread of cancer so that surgery might be less invasive and more effective."

The alternating current causes the vibratory movement of ionic particles in the abutting and adjoining tissue and results in the generation of heat. However, RFA induces not only local disruption of the tumor by heat, but it also produces localized coagulation necrosis of the tumor; which induces the release of large amounts of cellular debris. This cellular debris represents a source of tumor antigens that can trigger a host adaptive immune response against the tumor.",
