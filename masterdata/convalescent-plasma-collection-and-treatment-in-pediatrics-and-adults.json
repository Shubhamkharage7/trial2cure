            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective study, involving contacting potential plasma donors and the use of their plasma to help fight off infections of those suffering from COVID19 in accordance to collection guidelines for plasma and FDA IND requirement. This study will include up to 240 participants potentially receiving convalescent plasma and up to 1000 potential donors.\n\nThere are 3 basic arms to the study: mild, moderate and severe/critical severity. All 3 severity groups are eligible for enrollment, but mild severity will not be given plasma unless there is progression. Moderate severity will given up to 1 unit of plasma and severe/critical severity up to 2 units. There is no placebo group, however given the excepted issues of shortages of plasma, intention to treat will be used for analysis.",
            "detailedDescription": "Convalescent plasma (here on referred to as plasma) has been used in emergency life-threatening situations to treat infections for over 100 years. The plasma is donated by an individual that has recovered from the very same infection that another person is infected with. This plasma is enriched in the antibodies that recognize and helped the body's immune system fight off the infection. When transfused from donor to recipient those antibodies will aid the recipient in fighting off the infection. In recent history this has been used to fight Ebola. Recently, the Federal Food and Drug Agency (FDA) made possible expedited Investigational New Drug (IND) process for plasma use in the fight against COVID19 for emergency and lifesaving uses.\n\nThere are several other investigational drugs for treatment of COVID19 such as: Remdesivir, an antiviral. The off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/ritonavir, or Tocilizumab have been authorized. Convalescent plasma mechanism of action helps to promote health by working with one's own immune system and will not interfere with the other proposed medications. It also will not weaken the immune system as the investigational and off label medications have the potential to do. Convalescent plasma is time honored and although investigational for each use against novel or rare infections, it is the basis for IgG infusions in the immunodeficient populations. Currently the use of IgG infusions such as Intravenous IgG (IVIG) is assumed to not have the right antibodies from donors in the general public. This is secondary to the novel nature of the COVID19 and the fact that the IVIG available today was collected 6 to 12 months ago from plasma donors; prior to the COVID19's outbreak discovery in China.\n\nIt is for that reason that IVIG is not recommended at this time and the FDA has made special fast-tracking announcements for plasma use for COVID19. Currently, plasma is the only treatment that has a previous history of success in these novel or rare viral outbreak situations. It has already been reported to have been associated with survival of 5 out of 5 participants in a pilot study in China\n\nFor the purpose of this study advanced respiratory support will include any measure of respiratory support above low flow nasal cannula oxygen (2 Liters/minute flow rate).\n\nFor the purpose of this study dyspnea will be defined as any shortness of breath that is not completely relieved with the use of low flow nasal canula oxygen set to 2 Liters/minute flow rate and/or requiring breathing treatments such as but not limited to: bronchodilators more than every 4 hours to relieve symptoms.\n\nIn the event that more than one recipient is identified and plasma is available in less than the total number of approved recipients, priority will be given to those approved by the FDA for the IND use of plasma for severe or critical condition. If there still exists a deficit of plasma, the priority will be given to those on advanced respiratory support with the most critical settings (if unclear then will be considered a tie); active pressor treatments; age \\<1 years of age with days of life, age adjusted for prematurity as a tie breaker; age \\>60 with years as a tie breaker; and lastly lottery pull with potential remaining recipients as the final tie breaker."
