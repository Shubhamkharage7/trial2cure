            "briefSummary": "This study is researching an experimental drug called linvoseltamab when combined with another drug called dupilumab. The study is focused on patients who have IgE-mediated food allergy. If the patient has an allergy, the immune system overreacts to an allergen (eg, certain foods such as peanuts, milk, shellfish) by producing antibodies called IgE. IgE antibodies are released by cells such as plasma cells. These antibodies and allergen bind to other cells that release chemicals, causing an allergic reaction. The aim of the study is to see how safe and tolerable linvoseltamab is when combined with dupilumab.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs\n* Whether linvoseltamab when combined with dupilumab has an effect on other types of antibodies in the blood at different times\n* How much study drug(s) is in the blood at different times"
