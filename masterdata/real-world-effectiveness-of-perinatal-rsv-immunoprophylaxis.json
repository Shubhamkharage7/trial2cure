Some of the questions that the investigators hope to answer with this study are: 1) What is the overall effectiveness of these vaccines? 2) How long does immunity last? 3) How effective are the vaccines against new strains? 3) Does the vaccine's effectiveness vary by age?",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be a large-scale case-control study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of perinatal RSV immunoprophylaxis. Cases and controls will be identified using active surveillance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical sites of the Yale New Haven Health System. Investigators will enroll patients seeking health care for acute respiratory illness and confirm RSV infection using approved molecular assays. Data will be collected from multiple sources, including health records, interviews, immunization registries, and population-based surveys. Investigators will generate estimates of effectiveness for each type of immunization used, disaggregated by time from immunization, disease severity, and sociodemographic characteristics (Aim 1). Investigators will also perform genetic characterization of all RSV viruses in the study, monitor the genetic diversity of the virus over time, and quantify the relative effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis against various viral lineages (Aim 2). Finally, investigators will collect acute and convalescent blood from a subset of infants and employ a single-cell and multi-omics approach to study the dynamics of the innate and adaptive immune responses during RSV infection and explore the molecular mechanisms that contribute to immunoprophylaxis failure (Aim 3)."
