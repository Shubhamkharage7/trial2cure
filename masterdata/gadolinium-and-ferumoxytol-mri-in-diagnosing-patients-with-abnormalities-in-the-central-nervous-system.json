To test signal changes of T2\\*w multi-echo fast field echo (mFFE) scans before and after contrast agent injection.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To test if ferumoxytol affects gadolinium enhanced MRI. II. To test if steady state cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps are different at various magnetic field strengths.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore late ferumoxytol enhancement (optional MRI) hours to days after ferumoxytol administration in various brain pathologies.\n\nII. To evaluate the effects of ferumoxytol on malignant and non-malignant lesions in head \\& neck, and liver lesions\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) and then ferumoxytol IV and undergo MRI over 60 minutes on day 1.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive ferumoxytol IV and then gadolinium IV and undergo MRI over 60 minutes on day 1."
