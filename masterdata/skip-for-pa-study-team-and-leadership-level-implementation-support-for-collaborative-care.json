In the \"SKIP for PA Study\", the investigators propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of team- and practice leadership-level implementation strategies designed to enhance the use and uptake of DOCC in diverse pediatric primary care offices.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a randomized, hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial to support the adoption of a chronic care model (CCM)-based intervention in pediatric primary care settings by testing the impact of implementation strategies directed towards the provider care team (TEAM) or practice leadership (LEAD) level. The treatment investigators seek to deliver here is called Doctor Office Collaborative Care (DOCC), an evidence-based intervention for the management of child behavior problems and comorbid ADHD. The implementation strategies being tested to enhance DOCC uptake include TEAM coaching/consultation strategies, which will be delivered to care team providers and target provider competency to deliver DOCC, and LEAD facilitation strategies, which will be delivered to practice leaders and target organizational support of DOCC delivery. These multi-level implementation strategies have not been formally evaluated to learn about their separate and combined effects in any randomized clinical trial conducted in pediatric primary care. Such information is needed to optimize our approaches to promoting the implementation of a CCM-based intervention in pediatric practice.\n\nThe sample includes up to 24 primary care practices from a statewide network and other networks or states. After standard training in the DOCC EBP, all practices will be randomized to one of four implementation conditions: 1) No TEAM or LEAD (ongoing technical support only); 2) TEAM implementation; 3) LEAD implementation, or 4) TEAM+LEAD implementation. TEAM and LEAD implementation will be delivered via videoconference on a graded schedule. Care teams will deliver DOCC to up to 25 children who meet a clinical cutoff for modest behavior problems and their caregivers. Investigators will collect practice/provider measures from enrolled practice staff (0, 6, 12, 18, 24 months) and caregivers over several timepoints (0, 3, 6, 12 months) to support all analyses evaluating implementation and treatment outcomes, mediation, and moderation. By proposing one of the first large pragmatic pediatric trials of a CCM-based evidence-based intervention to address these aims in response to RFA-MH-18-701 and the NIMH's Strategic Plan (4.2), this research will advance the implementation science knowledge needed to optimize promising strategies for promoting the delivery and scale-up of DOCC in a pediatric medical home."

These analytic datasets may also include derived variables with documentation. Our form datasets will include original case data, a detailed codebook of variable names, value labels, and programming formats and all study documentation including the protocol and manual of procedures. Study investigators/study staff will upload descriptive/raw data to NIMH's National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Health Illness (NDCT) on a semi-annual basis.
