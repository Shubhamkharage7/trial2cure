            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nKohlmeier-Degos (K-D) is a rare disease that leads to the blockage of small blood vessels in many organs; these can include the skin, eyes, stomach, lungs, heart, and the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system, or CNS). There are no known effective treatments for K-D that affects the CNS.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a drug (ruxolitinib) in a person with K-D affecting the CNS.\n\nEligibility:\n\nThis study is designed to treat 1 subject, a 58-year-old male with K-D affecting the CNS.\n\nDesign:\n\nThe participant will be screened:\n\nHe will have a physical exam and blood tests.\n\nHe will have skin biopsies: Small samples of skin will be removed.\n\nHe will have a lumbar puncture: A needle will be inserted in his back to draw fluid from the space around the spinal cord.\n\nHe will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: He will lie on a table that slides into a tube to take pictures of his brain and spinal cord.\n\nHe will see a doctor who specializes in nerves.\n\nRuxolitinib is a tablet taken by mouth. The participant will take the drug twice a day for up to 26 weeks. The dosage may change over time.\n\nThe participant will have up to 7 clinic visits in 28 weeks. Each visit will be 1 to 3 days. MRI scans, biopsies, lumbar punctures, and other tests will be repeated on different visits. The participant may receive follow-up phone calls between visits. He will report any adverse effects. Unscheduled visits may be needed if new symptoms develop.\n\nThe last follow-up will be 4 weeks after the last dose of the study drug....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis single patient protocol will provide off-label treatment with a JAK/STAT ( Janus kinases/ Signal transducer and Activator of Transcription proteins) inhibitor to a patient with K(SqrRoot)(Delta)hlmeier Degos disease (K-D) with neurologic involvement. We hypothesize that ruxolitinib, which targets type I IFN (Interferons ) and IFN-y signaling, will attenuate various neurological manifestations of K-D that are observed clinically, radiologically or in abnormal laboratory findings in our K-D patient. This will help reduce IFN signaling in a manner that may slow or halt the disease progression as measured by the endpoints established below.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo test the hypothesis that JAK/STAT inhibition by ruxolitinib will delay progression of neuroradiological manifestations of our one patient with neurological involvement of K-D disease.\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\n1. Assess changes in immune cell proportion using single cell RNAseq (scRNA-seq) in biospecimens such as skin, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood after 13 weeks and up to 49 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment.\n2. Assess changes in plasma/serum cytokines levels and IFN scores as well as biomarker assays in CSF/ blood samples after 13 weeks and up to 49 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment..\n3. To test the hypothesis that ruxolitinib will stabilize or improve clinical neurologic exams in this patient.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nThe primary endpoint is stability or regression of existing enhancing lesions or no development of new enhancing lesions in the brain and spine observed in MRI evaluation after 13 weeks and up to 49 weeks of ruloxitinib (10 mg BID) compared to pre-treatment MRI images.\n\nExploratory endpoints of this study are clinical and potential surrogate biomarker efficacy data, including:\n\n1. Changes in transcriptome/RNA expression determined by scRNA-seq in skin, CSF and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between baseline measurements and after 13 weeks and up to 49 weeks of treatment.\n2. Attenuation of plasma/serum cytokine levels and IFN scores as well as biomarker assays in CSF and blood samples between the baseline visit and after 13 weeks and up to 49 weeks of treatment.\n3. Stability OR improvement of motor and/or sensory function on clinical neurologic exams between the baseline visit and after 13 weeks and up to 49 weeks of treatment."
