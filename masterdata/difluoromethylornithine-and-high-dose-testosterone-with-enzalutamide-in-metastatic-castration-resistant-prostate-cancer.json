One cycle of treatment will be 119 days and will involve:\n\n1. 7 days of DFMO at a dose of 1000 mg PO BID (D1-D7), followed by\n2. 56 days of combined testosterone and DFMO (testosterone cypionate 400 mg IM on D8 and D36 with continued DFMO 1000 mg PO BID) (D8-D63), followed by\n3. 56 days of enzalutamide (enzalutamide 160 mg PO daily) (D64-D119)\n\nPatients will receive repeat cycles of treatment until clinical or radiographic progression or toxicity requiring drug cessation."
