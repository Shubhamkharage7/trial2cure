            "briefSummary": "Functional constipation (FC) is a common healthcare problem in children of all ages, potentially due to genetic predisposition, inadequate fiber and fluid intake, and immobility. Currently, there are no pharmacological therapies approved for the treatment of FC. This study will assess adverse events and change in disease activity with linaclotide therapy in participants with FC.\n\nLinaclotide is an approved drug being developed for the treatment of FC in pediatric patients who meet modified Rome IV criteria for childhood FC. In Part 1 of this study, participants are placed in 3 groups, which occur consecutively. Each group receives a different dosage of linaclotide. In Part 2 of the study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either linaclotide or placebo. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Approximately 30 pediatric participants 6 months to less than 2 years of age with FC will be enrolled in the study at about 25 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants will receive oral solution of linaclotide prepared from capsule by parent/guardian once daily for 4 weeks.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care (due to study procedures). Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires."

(Note: Anal fissures that have resolved at least 2 weeks prior to screening would not be exclusionary). However, if in the investigator's opinion, an anal fissure(s) may be the primary cause of participant's modified Rome IV FC criteria, the subject would not be eligible to participate in the study.\n  * Anatomic malformations (e.g., imperforate anus, anal stenosis, anterior displaced anus)\n  * Intestinal nerve or muscle disorders (e.g., Hirschprung disease, visceral myopathies, visceral neuropathies)\n  * Neuropathic conditions (e.g., spinal cord abnormalities, neurofibromatosis, tethered cord, spinal cord trauma)\n  * Lead toxicity, hypercalcemia\n  * Neurodevelopmental disabilities of the LAR/Parent/Guardian/Caregiver who will be completing the eDiary (early-onset, chronic disorders that share the essential feature of a predominant disturbance in the acquisition of cognitive, motor, language, or social skills, which has a significant and continuing impact on the developmental progress of an individual) producing a cognitive delay that precludes comprehension and completion of the daily eDiary or other study-related questionnaires.\n  * Inflammatory bowel disease\n  * Lactose intolerance that is associated with symptoms which could confound the assessments in this study\n  * History of cancer. (Note: Participants with a history of cancer are allowed provided that the malignancy has been in a complete remission before enrollment/randomization (Visit 3).
