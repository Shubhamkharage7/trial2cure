Individuals in the TRF pattern will only consume food during a 6-hour eating period and fast for the remaining 18 hours. Individuals in the TRAD pattern will consume isocaloric and isonitrogenous (RDA or 2RDA) diet but consume an all-beef-breakfast. Participants will consume oral stable isotopes to measure muscle protein synthesis (MPS), whole-body muscle protein breakdown (MPB), and whole-body protein balance (WBPB). Appropriate muscle, blood samples, and urine will be collected throughout a 24-hour metabolic trial following a 2-day controlled diet."
