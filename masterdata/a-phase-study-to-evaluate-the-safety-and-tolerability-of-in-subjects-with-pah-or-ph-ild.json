The study will also evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of L606 as compared to Tyvaso, effects on exercise ability (6-minute walk distance \\[6MWD\\] and Borg Dyspnea Score), quality of life (QoL), and treatment satisfaction with L606.\n\nSubjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to one of the 2 cohorts:\n\nCohort A: Subjects with PAH or PH-ILD receiving prior stable doses of Tyvaso (4 times daily) and willing to switch to L606 (twice daily).\n\nCohort B: Subjects with PAH (not initially on prostacyclin therapy) who are likely to receive clinical benefit from inhaled treprostinil based on the opinion of the investigator.\n\nCohort A subjects will sequentially participate in the MSP for 2 weeks and the OEP for 46 weeks. A subset of up to 15 subjects from Cohort A will also participate in a PK substudy. Cohort B subjects will sequentially participate in the MSP for 12 weeks and the OEP for 36 weeks."
