Participants will receive Gleolan followed by blue light (BL) assessment and bulk tumor biopsy with imaging to establish TBR.\n* Part A2 is an open-label training phase of the study to optimize workflow and obtain data to optimize the sample size estimate for Part B. Participants in Part A2 receive Gleolan and undergo Standard of Care (SoC) ovarian cancer debulking, followed by BL assessment and biopsy collection.\n* Part B is the randomized pivotal portion of the study for the evaluation of safety, diagnostic performance, and clinical usefulness of Gleolan for the real-time detection and visualization of epithelial ovarian cancer tumors during debulking surgery."
