            "briefSummary": "The purposes of this study include:\n\n1. - To identify whether features of aberrant intermuscular coordination patterns can be used to predict motor impairment after stroke.\n2. - To test whether muscle synergies are malleable to a non-invasive EMG-guided exercise that induces changes in intermuscular coordination of upper extremity muscles after stroke.",
            "detailedDescription": "Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Of the more than 700,000 Americans who experience a stroke each year, two-thirds survive. 69% of patients who were admitted to a rehabilitation unit following stroke have mild to severe upper extremity dysfunction. Currently, there are more than seven million stroke survivors in the U.S., many of whom have long-term motor and sensory impairments, especially in the arm. The objective of this study involves both scientific and clinical aspects:\n\nFor the first purpose, intermuscular coordination patterns emerging under isometric reaching and dynamic conditions will be identified to predict impairment of both non-motion or motion-involved task performance and severity of motor impairment after stroke. This aim will enroll 15 age-matched (age of 40-75 yo) healthy adults and 25 adult (age of 40-75 yo) stroke survivors. Each stroke participant will have two visit sessions while age-matched will have a single measurement session.\n\nFor the second purpose, in total, 74 stroke survivors will perform an electromyographic signal-guided exercise through human-machine interaction to ameliorate motor impairment post-stroke by normalizing abnormal intermuscular coordination patterns in the arm after stroke, and improve motor impairment; also, assessment of the intermuscular coordination, UE Fugl-Meyer (FM), and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) will be performed. Participants will have three visits per week for six weeks for training sessions. Finally, to test retention of the intervention effect, they will perform two assessment sessions one and three months after finishing the training."
