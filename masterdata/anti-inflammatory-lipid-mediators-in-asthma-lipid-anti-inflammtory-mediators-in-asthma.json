            "briefSummary": "The main purpose of this Phase 2 double blind, placebo controlled crossover clinical study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of CXA-10 in obese adult asthmatics. Obesity induces a chronic systemic inflammatory state characterized by impaired adipokine signaling, pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, inflammatory cell activation and enhanced generation of oxidative inflammatory mediators. This impacts the lung, increasing the severity of asthma and its exacerbations. This research will evaluate how a synthetic nitro-fatty acid (CXA-10, 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid) suppresses the systemic and airway inflammation that contributes to the obese asthmatic phenotype. Current data support the pleiotropic signaling actions of CXA-10 to induce adaptive signaling actions that beneficially modulate adipokine and cytokine expression and inhibit systemic and pulmonary inflammation. The investigators hypothesize that CXA-10 induced signaling responses will alleviate obesity-related airway hyperreactivity in obese adult asthmatics."
