            "detailedDescription": "A phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-label, cross-over trial will be conducted in male or female individuals (N=36) diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at least 6 months prior to informed consent aged between 18 and 65 years, Body Mass Index (BMI) \u2265 21 kg/m2, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio \u2265 50 mg/g and \\< 3000 mg/g, eGFR \\> 30 and \\<90 ml/min/1.73m2 and HbA1c between 6.5 and 10.0%. Patients have to be on stable RAAS inhibition for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.\n\nThe study will consist of a screening visit, a 4-week run-in phase. After the run-in phase, the participant will be randomized to treatment of ambrisentan, sotagliflozin or their combination in random order. The duration of each treatment period is 4 weeks with study visits scheduled at 2 and 4 weeks in each treatment period. At the end of each treatment period patients proceed to a 4 weeks wash-out phase to study off drug effects. The total duration of the study for each participant after randomization is thus 24 weeks\n\nInterventions Ambrisentan 2.5 mg once daily; sotagliflozin 200mg once daily; combination of ambrisentan 2.5mg once daily and sotagliflozin 200mg once daily"
