            "briefSummary": "This study evaluates a mood management and health and wellness smoking cessation intervention for depressed pregnant smokers during and after birth. This study may help pregnant smokers who are experiencing depression quit smoking and stay smoke-free after their babies are born.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Conduct qualitative group interviews with depressed pregnant smokers and depressed smokers within the first 4 months of the postpartum period, to adapt and refine the delivery of behavioral activation therapy (BA) and health and wellness education (HW) via smartphone videoconferencing, a BA and HW smartphone application (app) including supportive smoking cessation messages in the prenatal and postpartum periods. (Stage IA) II. Adapt BA and smoking cessation counseling manuals, BA and HW app and content, and treatment integrity rating scales for the prenatal and postpartum period. (Stage IA) III. Pilot test the delivery, via smartphone videoconferencing, of a 10-week treatment course of BA and HW and conduct process evaluation of technical issues in the use of smartphones, barriers to participation and retention; completion of study assessments, and; adequacy of procedures for addressing psychiatric emergencies. (Stage IA)\n\nIII. Conduct a preliminary randomized trial with depressed pregnant smokers comparing BA to HW to evaluate:\n\nIIIa. Effect of BA on abstinence at 6 months postpartum. (Stage IB) IIIb. Effect of BA on depression at 6 months postpartum. (Stage IB) IIIc. Feasibility of acceptance of the smartphone delivery of BA and HW, and assessment components indicated by a) retention; b) completion of prenatal and postpartum sessions; c) completion of study assessments, d) strength of therapeutic alliance from both the participant and therapist perspective; e) participant and therapist ratings on satisfaction questionnaire. (Stage IB) IIId. Feasibility of study procedures as indicated by a) percentage of sessions interrupted by technical difficulties, and; b) percentage of breath carbon monoxide samples collected remotely for biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence at 6 months postpartum. (Stage IB)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate change in hypothesized treatment mechanisms including positive affect, negative affect, and cognitive function in relation to treatment effects on smoking and depression. (Stage IB) II. Conduct qualitative interviews with women who completed and did not complete postpartum treatment to assess a) barriers to completing treatment sessions; b) usefulness of postpartum treatment; c) suggestions for decreasing barriers and improving treatment acceptability, and; d) relevant experiences unexpected by participants and researchers. (Stage IB)\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nAIM 1 AND SECONDARY AIM 2: Participants participate in focus group over 60-90 minutes. Participants who completed and dropped out of postpartum treatment also participate in a focus group.\n\nAIM 3: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I (BA): Participants participate in smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes and BA counseling sessions over 45 minutes once a week for 10 weeks to pilot test delivery via smartphone videoconferencing and to conduct process evaluation of technical issues in use of smartphones.\n\nGROUP II (HW): Participants participate in smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes and health and wellness education counseling sessions over 45 minutes once a week for 10 weeks to pilot test delivery via smartphone videoconferencing and to conduct process evaluation of technical issues in use of smartphones.\n\nAIM 4: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP III (BA): Participants participate in 8-14 smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes and BA counseling sessions over 45 minutes every 2-3 weeks till the end of the pregnancy. Following birth, participants also participate in 4 additional sessions within the first 6 weeks, then that last 4 evenly distributed across 10 weeks.\n\nGROUP IV (HW): Participants participate in 8-14 smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes and health and wellness education counseling sessions over 45 minutes every 2-3 weeks till the end of the pregnancy. Following birth, participants also participate in 4 additional sessions within the first 6 weeks, then that last 4 evenly distributed across 10 weeks."
