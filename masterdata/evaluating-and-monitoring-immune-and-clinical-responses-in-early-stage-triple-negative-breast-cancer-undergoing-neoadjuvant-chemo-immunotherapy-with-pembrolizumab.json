To determine whether standard of care neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy leads to the induction of a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu (characterized by high IFN- \u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, IL-6 and low TGF-\u03b2) in the blood which is induced within 24 hours of treatment initiation, persists through the course of the therapy and is associated with pathologic complete response in the tissue.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nI. To determine whether the spatially resolved tissue TGF-\u03b2 induced transcriptomic signatures or lack of innate interferon inducible genes/effector CD8 modules are abundant in tumors from TNBC patients that do not show pathologic complete response in the tissue at the end of standard of care neoadjuvant chemo- immunotherapy."
