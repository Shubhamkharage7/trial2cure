Patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma should have received a BRAF inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with other targeted agents (mitogen-activated protein kinase \\[MAPK\\] kinase \\[MEK\\] inhibitors), unless deemed intolerable by the investigator.\n* Has disease other than the injected lesion that is measurable by RECIST 1.1.\n\nPhase 1 and 2 Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of autoimmune disease and/or requiring immunosuppression (except hypothyroidism).\n* History of solid organ transplant.\n* Cardiovascular exclusions: Medical history of an arterial thrombotic event, stroke, or transient ischemic attack within the past 12 months; medical history of symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association classes II-IV) or a cardiac arrhythmia that required treatment within the past 12 months; medical history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months before Cycle 1 Day 1; QTcF prolongation to \\> 470 ms in women and \\> 450 ms in men based on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in triplicate using the Fridericia formula: QTc = QT / RR1/3.\n* Evidence of active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics during screening requiring therapy within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Active uncontrolled bleeding, or a bleeding diathesis within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Serious or non-healing wound, fistula, skin ulcer, or non-healing bone fracture within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active hepatitis B infection, or hepatitis C infection.\n* Untreated central nervous system tumor, epidural tumor or metastasis, or brain metastasis.\n* Another primary malignancy that has not been treated with curative intent, except for non-metastatic cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, or non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.\n* Serious illness considered by the Investigator as incompatible with participating in this clinical study.\n* Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of the patient's safety or study results.\n* Prior IL-12 therapy.\n* Receipt of any vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Use of another anticancer therapy within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n* Previously enrolled in this study.\n* Actively enrolled in another clinical study unless it is an observational (noninterventional) clinical study or the follow-up component of an interventional study.\n* Known severe hypersensitivity (Grade \u2265 3) to study treatment or any of the excipients of the products.\n* Known psychiatric or substance use disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n* Currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test), breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant. For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG) result must be in place within 72 hours of first treatment dose.\n* Women of childbearing potential not willing to use a highly effective method of contraception.\n* Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.",
