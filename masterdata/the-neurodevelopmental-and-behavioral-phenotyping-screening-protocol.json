The evaluations may be used to determine if the participant meets criteria for participation in specific research protocols at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and other collaborative investigations.Since the entry criteria for these protocols vary, inclusion criteria and the screening evaluations will also vary. Behavioral evaluations will also be done through this protocol for individuals participating in IRB-approved protocols being conducted by collaborating scientists in NIH. The evaluations might include: a psychiatric interview; a diagnostic interview; developmental and/or cognitive testing; ratings of other psychiatric symptoms; neuropsychological testing; a medical history; a physical exam; blood; and a request for medical records. Parents of minors will be interviewed."
