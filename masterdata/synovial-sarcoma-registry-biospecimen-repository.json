The future research will involve various types of genetic testing.\n\nParticipants will be asked to allow access to medical records and leftover tumor tissue and may be asked to give a blood or saliva sample. Participants will also be asked to completed questionnaires about their medical history and may be contacted every 6 to 12 months for updates for up to 10 years.",

This will include a request for contact information for the subject's treating hospitals/physicians and a release of records request to obtain medical records.\n\nAt approximately 6-12 month intervals for up to 10 years after initial diagnosis and/or relapse, subjects and/or their treating hospitals may be contacted to provide updates on treatment and outcomes.\n\nTumor samples may be collected from residual material obtained during clinically indicated procedures occurring before or after consent to this study. No additional material will be collected or procedures performed solely for the purpose of this study.\n\nBlood may be collected at the participant's local institution at the time of a clinically indicated blood draw and/or saliva or a buccal swab may be collected as a germline sample and for analysis of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and/or circulating tumor cells (CTCs).\n\nGenetic testing may be performed on tumor and germline samples submitted by subjects. Results will only be returned if deemed clinically significant."
