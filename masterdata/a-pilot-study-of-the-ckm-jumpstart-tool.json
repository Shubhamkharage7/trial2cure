            "detailedDescription": "This study is a randomized pilot study to test the acceptability and feasibility of a novel communication tool, called the CKM Jumpstart Tool, to promote discussion of CKM between patients with advanced CKM and their healthcare providers, the investigators hypothesize that the Guide will be feasible and acceptable to patients and their healthcare providers as reflected in greater discussion of CKM between them following use of the Tool as compared with usual care. The investigators will enroll 76 patients aged 75 years and older with advanced CKD and their healthcare providers from University of Washington Medicine and Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System. Patients will be randomized together in a 1:1 fashion to receive the intervention or usual care. Data from participants will be collected at the time of enrollment (T1), within 2-weeks of their following clinic visit with their healthcare provider (T2), and approximately 3-month after this clinic visit (T3). The primary outcome measure and measure of feasibility is difference in patient-reported rates of discussion of CKM with a healthcare provider at T2 and T3. The investigators will also evaluate whether provider document in the medical chart of patients whether they had a discussion about CKM with the patient at T2 and T3. The investigators will also collect attrition rates at T2 and T3 as a measure of acceptability. The investigators will further assess user experience of the CKM JumpStart by performing a qualitative analysis of post-intervention interviews with patients and nephrologists, coding for themes elucidating pros, cons and other considerations with using the CKM JumpStart Tool and discussion about CKM."

Using the patient's answer to the values question, study staff will generate a CKM JumpStart Tool prior to their upcoming clinic visit with their nephrologist. Study staff will inform the patient that their response to the values question will be shared with their provider prior to their next clinic visit and that their providers might bring up their values and treatment options for kidney disease, if the situation permits.
