            "briefSummary": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown further reductions in heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular events, and mortality, especially for heart failure patients.\n\nThe SGLT2 gene, also known as SLC5A2 (solute carrier family 5 member 2), is located on chromosome 16 and is responsible for encoding SGLT2.\n\nSeveral SLC5A2 mutations alter SGLT2 expression, membrane location, or transporter function.\n\nSeveral common genetic variations were found in the SLC5A2 gene that may affect the response to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.",
            "detailedDescription": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), which were first investigated and licensed for the treatment of diabetes, are now emerging as a promising class of drugs for the treatment of heart failure (HF), even in people without diabetes.\n\nSignificant reductions in worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death were shown under treatment with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in the trials of patients with heart failure.\n\nSeveral common genetic variations were found in the SLC5A2 gene that may affect the response to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nThe most recent SLC5A2 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that reduce the risk of heart failure included two intronic SLC5A2 SNPs, s9934336, and rs3116150, both associated with the expression levels of the transporter.\n\nThis study aims to detect the association between SLC5A2 single nucleotide polymorphisms and variability in response to SGLT2 Inhibitors as well as the association between cardiac biomarkers and non-coding RNA in patients with Heart Failure."
