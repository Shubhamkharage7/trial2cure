Current treatments for DLD produce good outcomes under ideal, high intensity conditions or when parents have been trained to deliver therapy using intense coaching methods; however, current publicly funded service delivery systems and private-pay reimbursement models do not support treatment being delivered in this ideal fashion for children older than three. This project will examine alternative methods of delivering treatment that may be more feasible under typical conditions and will identify implementation barriers, with the goal of improving long-term outcomes for children with DLD. We hypothesize that feasibility and palatability will influence dose, which will in turn affect the overall language outcomes."
