Between 2 and 4 weeks after discharge, clinically stable patients will undergo an in-person comprehensive interview to identify the events proximal to the onset of TS symptoms, complete a battery of psychosocial questionnaires and undergo a validated laboratory stress protocol. Baseline and reactive changes in measures of autonomic nervous system activity (epinephrine and norepinephrine - primary outcome), and in the secondary outcomes of cardiac vagal control and left ventricular function (ejection fraction; regional and global longitudinal strain assessed with speckle tracking echocardiography) will be assessed. Echocardiographic evaluations will be repeated 12 months thereafter together with information on major adverse cerebrovascular events."

The participant is instructed to rest quietly.\n\nEmotion Recall (ER - 5-10 min). The participant is instructed to think about the incident associated with the onset of their cardiac event and bring to mind details of the incident. When the participants have the incident clearly in mind, they are instructed to relate the incident and their experience out loud; frequent questions to re-elicit the emotion are asked.\n\nRecovery Phase (RP - 20 min). Upon completion of RP, the catheter is removed and participants are de-instrumented. Blood samples for plasma catecholamines, assessments of heart rate variability, and echocardiograms are performed 10-min into BL, 10-min into ER, and 18 minutes into RP.",
