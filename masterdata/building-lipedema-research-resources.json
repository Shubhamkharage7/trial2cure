            "briefSummary": "Lipedema is a disease marked by subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulation in the lower extremities of females that is accompanied by somatic pain and edema. Importantly, lipedema is commonly misdiagnosed as obesity, although it's estimated to affect a high 11% of women. Clinical diagnosis of lipedema requires specialized training not widely available at most major medical centers, and there remains a substantial need for objective tools to distinguish lipedema from obesity. There is a critical need to define specific molecular markers of disease in circulation or at the tissue-level. The purpose of this study is to create, manage, and characterize an innovative lipedema biorepository. The goal of the biorepository will be to better understand disease mechanisms of lipedema and to define specific molecular markers of disease in circulation or at the tissue-level. The long-term purpose of our studies are to help with prevention and early management of lipedema."
