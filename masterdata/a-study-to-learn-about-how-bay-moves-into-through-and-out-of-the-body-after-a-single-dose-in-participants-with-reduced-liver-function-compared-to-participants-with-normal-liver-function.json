            "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nCKD is a condition in which the kidneys' ability to work properly gradually decreases over time. The kidneys help the body get rid of waste through urine and filter the blood before sending it back to the heart. When kidney function decreases, waste builds up in the body, which can cause various complications.\n\nThe study treatment, BAY 3283142, is under development to treat CKD. It works by activating a protein called soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) that generates cGMP - a molecule that relaxes blood vessels and is thought to have beneficial effects in CKD. BAY3283142 is broken down in the liver by a specific enzyme before it is removed from the body.\n\nIn this study, researchers want to understand how a mild or moderate reduction in liver function affects the blood levels of BAY3283142.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how BAY3283142 moves into, through, and out of the body, after a single dose of BAY3283142 in participants with reduced liver function.\n\nFor this, the researchers will analyze:\n\n* Area under the curve (AUC): a measure of the total amount of BAY3283142 in participants' blood over time\n* Maximum observed concentration (Cmax): the highest amount of BAY 3283142 in participants' blood The AUC and Cmax values for participants with reduced liver function will be compared with the values for participants with normal liver function.\n\nThe study participants will be assigned to one of the four treatment groups based on their liver function:\n\n* Group 1: participants with mild reduction in liver function\n* Group 2: participants with moderate reduction in liver function\n* Groups 3 and 4: participants with normal liver function who will be matched for age, weight, and gender with participants with reduced liver function All participants will take a single dose of BAY3283142 as a tablet by mouth without food.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for around 5 to 6 weeks, which includes:\n\n* a visit within 28 days of starting treatment to confirm if the participant can take part in this study\n* a hospital stay for 7 days during which the participant will be given a single dose of BAY3283142 and the study doctor will monitor the participant's health\n* a visit after 7 to 10 days of taking BAY3283142 during which the study doctor will perform a health check-up on the participant\n\nDuring the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* check participants' health by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, blood pressure measurements, and checking heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective of whether they think it is related or not to the study treatment.\n\nAccess to study treatment after the end of this study is not planned. Participants with liver problems can continue taking their other prescribed medicines as usual."
