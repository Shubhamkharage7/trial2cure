            "briefSummary": "The clinical benefits of the dual Sodium-Glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1 and 2-inhibition have recently been reported in two clinical trials. The SOLOIST reported the benefits of sotagliflozin in Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients hospitalized for worsening of Heart Failure (HF), while the SCORED involved T2DM patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). It is worth noting that not only did the event curves separate within the first week post-treatment, but the effects of sotagliflozin on HF-related outcomes were observed regardless of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) values and did not seem to attenuate with increasing LVEF as seen with empagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan. Despite the favorable outcomes, the mechanism(s) of action through which sotagliflozin exerts these benefits remains unclear.\n\nThe present study aims to investigate the potential (non-glucose dependent) \"cardio-renal\" pleiotropic effects of sotagliflozin in a mechanistic, randomized, double blind, placebo-control trial in HF patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Comparisons between treatment groups will be made using cardiac MRI, CPET, 6-MWT and KCCQ-12."
