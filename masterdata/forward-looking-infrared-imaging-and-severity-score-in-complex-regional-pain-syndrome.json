            "briefSummary": "The goal of this interventional study is to explore the use of InfraRed (FLIR) imaging in determining pain intensity and severity in newly diagnosed complex regional pain syndrome patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nQuestion 1: Can Infrared (FLIR) imaging be used to determine the severity of CRPS in newly diagnosed patients? Question 2: Is there any correlation with the quantification of 'the \u0394 thermal index value' measured by FLIR imaging with pain intensity (NRS) in newly diagnosed patients? Question 3: Is there any correlation between the quantification of 'the \u0394heat index value' measured by FLIR imaging between the two extremities with the severity (the severity score for CRPS) in newly diagnosed patients? Participants will have a picture of their foot taken using the forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera and answer questionnaires regarding their pain and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients with CRPS have a better chance of remission if they receive treatment early in the disease's progression. Similarly, determining the severity of the disease early on is critical for planning effective treatment to prevent progression. The lack of an objective method for determining the severity and potential progression of CRPS is a major reason for postponing CRPS treatment.\n\nThe purpose of this interventional study is to investigate whether or not near-infrared (FLIR) imaging can be used to evaluate the level of pain experienced by patients who have recently been diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome. Its primary goals are to provide responses to the following questions:\n\nQuestion 1: Can Infrared (FLIR) imaging be used to determine the severity of CRPS in newly diagnosed patients? Question 2: Is there any correlation with the quantification of 'the \u0394 thermal index value' measured by FLIR imaging with pain intensity (NRS) in newly diagnosed patients? Question 3: Is there any correlation between the quantification of 'the \u0394heat index value' measured by FLIR imaging between the two extremities with the severity (the severity score for CRPS) in newly diagnosed patients? The forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera will be used to take a picture of each participant's foot, and they will also be asked to fill out questionnaires regarding their level of pain and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).\n\nIf infrared (FLIR) imaging can be used to determine the severity of CRPS in newly diagnosed patients, and if there is a correlation between the quantification of the heat index value' measured by FLIR imaging and the severity score for CRPS in newly diagnosed patients, the findings of this study could be useful in daily clinical practice."
