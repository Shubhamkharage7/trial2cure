As utilization of this investigational drug may be required emergently in the event of qualifying safety events post CAR T cell infusion, subjects may be consented/enrolled at the time they receive an investigational CAR T cell product. If/when use of this investigational drug is deemed clinically necessary, rescue therapy may then be initiated.\n\nCohort 1: Will allow for the use of Tadekinig alfa, an interleukin-18 binding protein that binds and neutralizes IL-18. IL-18 is a key mediator in systemic inflammatory conditions such as MAS/HLH, which may contribute to the severity of CAR T cell-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and HLH-like syndrome (CRHLS) and impact response to standard therapy. In addition, subjects experiencing other IL-18 driven toxicity post CAR T cell therapy which is non-responsive to conventional treatment may also receive rescue therapy with Tadekinig alfa as per clinical discretion."
