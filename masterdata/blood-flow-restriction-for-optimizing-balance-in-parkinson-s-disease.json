            "detailedDescription": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of the nervous system that attacks the nerve cells in the brain responsible for controlling movement in the arms, legs and face. It is a progressive condition that gets worse with time. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of blood flow restriction (BFR) in combination with strengthening exercises that challenge balance (instability resistance training (IRT)) to improve the symptoms of the participant's condition. This research is being done to understand the effects of BFR with IRT on symptoms of PD such as balance, mobility, walking and endurance. There will be two groups 1 and 2; group 1 will perform IRT with BFR and group 2 will perform IRT only. Each session with either intervention will last approximately 45 minutes. Researchers will test the effects of the intervention on the participant's walking ability, balance function and endurance. The researchers hope to learn whether low resistance exercises using these tight cuffs around the thighs are well tolerated by individuals with PD and determine whether there is an improvement in muscle strength, balance, and physical function. In addition, researchers will also use peripheral nerve stimulation techniques which are non-invasive (does not go inside the body). These techniques will be used to measure spinal excitability (i.e., nerve stimulator for testing strength of the pathway between spinal cord and muscles) in individuals with PD."
