The effects of azeliragon on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who have had prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, or hormonal therapy\n2. Patients with Stage IV breast cancer\n3. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to azeliragon, or the standard of care chemotherapy assigned, including: docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, pembrolizumab.\n5. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong CYP2C8 inhibitors are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. Subjects who discontinue a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor must have discontinued the drug for at least 5 days or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer, before the first dose of study drug.\n6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, neurogenerative disease/impairment, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study as the risks of azeliragon to a fetus are unknown. There is unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with azeliragon; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with azeliragon. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n8. History of cancer within the last 5 years except adequately treated cervical carcinoma-in-situ, or cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell cancer.",
