            "briefSummary": "Lateral epicondylitis (LE), often referred to as \"tennis elbow\" is a common and debilitating overuse injury affecting 1-3% of adults annually. LE is most often defined as a syndrome of pain near the area of the lateral epicondyle of the elbow commonly effecting the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis with associated weakness; it most commonly effects the dominant arm. The best treatment for LE is unknown and research to support current treatment methods are insufficient. A common limitation in functional recovery experienced by this population is pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow. As such, innovative therapeutic interventions directed at quickly reducing pain may address this unmet need and allow for improved outcomes, as well as earlier return to function."
