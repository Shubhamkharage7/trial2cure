            "briefSummary": "Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive form of soft tissue sarcoma. Prior work demonstrates very poor outcomes, with most patients developing metastatic disease and less than 50% surviving greater than 5 years. In other soft tissue sarcomas, the use of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy have improved progression-free survival in patients undergoing limited, organ-sparing surgeries. Taxane chemotherapy has shown efficacy in patients with metastatic angiosarcoma, but this has not been tested in patients with localized disease. This study examines the efficacy of induction paclitaxel followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy with paclitaxel prior to curative surgical resection."
