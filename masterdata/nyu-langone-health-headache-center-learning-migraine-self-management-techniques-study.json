Changes in preventive and acute medication and the time initiated will be recorded to evaluate the potential for medication confounds)\n* 4-29 headache days a month (so the study includes those in whom the investigators typically offer preventive treatment \\[\\>4 headache days/month\\] and those with more frequent migraines including chronic migraine \\[15 days or more/month\\] but exclude those with continuous headaches)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of Medication Overuse Headache (MOH)\n* Patients who have had Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Biofeedback, or other Relaxation Therapy for migraine in the past year\n* Alcohol or other substance abuse as determined by self-report or prior documentation in the medical record\n* Current opioid or barbiturate use\n* PHQ-8 scores greater than 15, indicating a conservative score of moderately severe depressive symptoms based on the PHQ-9 (in this group, more intense psychological intervention targeted to the depression may be needed, as depression is a significant predictor of migraine chronification and people with migraine and comorbid depression are more likely to be refractory to migraine treatments and to develop medication overuse headache)\n* Unable or unwilling to follow a treatment program that relies on written and audio-taped materials\n* Coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, diabetes mellitus Type 1 or II\n* Pregnant (because hormonal fluctuations in pregnancy can affect migraine outcomes)\n* Other physical limitations which would prevent participating in the standard protocol of biofeedback being studied",
