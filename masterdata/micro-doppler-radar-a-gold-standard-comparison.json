            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see if the study team can use micro-Doppler signal (MDS) technology to determine if someone has had an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The investigators will do this by comparing the movement data from a group of people who have had the surgery with a group who has not had the surgery to see if the micro-Doppler radar technology can accurately and predictably tell the difference.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this research is to validate that radar MDS can accurately and predictably differentiate individuals at high-risk for MSKI from those who are low risk. The investigators hypothesize that MDS will identify individuals at a high-risk for MSKI more accurately than the gold-standard MC technologies. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose a case control study that will compare adults who have undergone ACL reconstruction to a control group of healthy adults that has not. Patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction have a 6-24% chance of either re-tearing their ACL or having a subsequent knee surgery on either side within two years of successful completion of surgery and post-surgical rehabilitation. Despite being released for full activities, little is known about what makes this group at high-risk for re-tear. As such, the investigators will use this patient population as a model for identifying an at-risk population for musculoskeletal injury (MSKI). The researchers will simultaneously collect radar micro-Doppler signals and biomechanical motion capture (MC) data in a state-of-the-art human movement lab. Participants will be asked to perform a series of functional activities that will be captured by both the MDS radar and MC systems. The data sets will then be analyzed independently."
