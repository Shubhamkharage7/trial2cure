            "detailedDescription": "Patients with HR+ HER2- node-negative breast cancers generally undergo surgical resection upfront, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, if needed, in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Because endocrine therapy is primarily delivered in the postoperative setting, the ability to assess the tumor response to this treatment modality is lost and very difficult to assess. This study offers the unique opportunity to assess the responsiveness of breast tumors to endocrine therapy while the tumors are still in vivo by treating patients with endocrine therapy before surgery and assessing molecular changes with treatment. By comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of molecular markers with advanced omic analysis in individual tumors, the investigators expect to identify predictors of responsiveness to existing agents and identify new candidate therapeutic targets."
