Important pharmacokinetic measurements focused on cisplatin and STS in children, with varying degrees of renal function, will be assessed. Such pharmacokinetic data will fill a current gap in our clinical knowledge base and enable safer use of such agents for all children with such cancers, regardless of kidney function, in the future."
