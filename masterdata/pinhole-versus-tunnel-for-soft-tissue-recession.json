Both types of surgeries are considered minimally invasive procedures to obtain root coverage for gingival recession. Both surgeries are clinically utilized in clinical practice and yield comparable results according to the literature, however, No prospective studies are published to compare between the outcomes of both techniques. patients will receive intra oral scan before the surgery and 6 months after the surgery to compare change in root coverage and gingival thickness outcomes between the two techniques. Post operative pain as well as patient satisfaction will be measured by visual analog scale and compared between the two techniques. Patients will be monitored at different time points to asses healing."
