The Recommended Phase II Dose of oral duvelisib will be determined and administered with intravenous nivolumab 480mg for up to 1 year or until the patient's disease does not progress or the patient experiences unacceptable side effects to treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial will study of PI3K\u03b3\u03b4 inhibitor duvelisib in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced unresectable melanoma who have progressed on anti-PD1 therapy. In the Phase I part of the study (18) patients will be administered nivolumab 480mg intravenously and duvelisib orally in doses from 15mg once a day to 25mg twice a day to determine the recommended dose for the Phase II part of the study. In the Phase II study patients will be administered nivolumab 480mg intravenously and duvelisib orally (dose not determined until the Phase 1 study is completed) up to 1 year as long as their disease doesn't progress or have unacceptable side effects to the study drugs. This trial will attempt to determine whether duvelisib acts as an immunomodulator, to shift the TME from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory setting, to overcome acquired resistance in anti-PD1 treated patients. The phase I portion of the study is uniquely designed to find the ideal dose of duvelisib as an immunomodulator, which is suspected to be lower than the previously determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of duvelisib in lymphoma studies."
