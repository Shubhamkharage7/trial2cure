A liver biopsy will be collected from enrolled patients for central laboratory analysis of macrophage and immune cell profiles to investigate possible mechanisms of the hepatotoxicity. Additionally, 4 blood samples will be collected to evaluate liver function, other relevant safety tests, peripheral immune cells, and for pharmacogenomic testing. Enrolled patients will be followed at least yearly for 10 years to assess long-term risk of hepatic failure."
