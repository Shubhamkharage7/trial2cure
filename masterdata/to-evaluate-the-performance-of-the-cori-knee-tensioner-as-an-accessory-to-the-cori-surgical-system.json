Ninety (90) patients eligible for a robotic-assisted TKA procedure with the CORI\u2122 Surgical System will be followed for approximately 12 months.\n\nThe CORI\u2122 KNEE TENSIONER is an accessory to REAL INTELLIGENCE\u2122 CORI\u2122 Surgical System. The TENSIONER may assist the surgeon in providing consistent varus and valgus stress during gap assessment before making any bony resections. The TENSIONER communicates directly with CORI software, providing automated data collection.\n\nThe primary objective is to evaluate the performance of the CORI\u2122 KNEE TENSIONER as an accessory to the CORI\u2122 Surgical System by assessing patient satisfaction with the EQ-5D-5L VAS."

Responses are coded as single-digit numbers expressing the severity level selected in each dimension. For instance, 'slight problems' (e.g. 'I have slight problems in walking about') is always coded as '2'. The digits for the 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit code.
