            "detailedDescription": "Since 2009, Watchman FLX\u2122 and its predecessor, Watchman\u2122 have provided a safe and effective alternative to oral anticoagulation for over 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe. Advancements in the design of the Watchman FLX\u2122 have made the device available to a wider range of patients. As more patients qualify for the device, more implant procedures are necessary to provide them with this life-changing treatment option.\n\nSome Watchman FLX\u2122 implanters perform high volumes of implant procedures on certain days. While performing a high-volume of implant procedures is desirable for many reasons, it must be determined that cases performed under such circumstances are comparable in safety and efficacy to implant procedures performed at lower volumes. While there has been no differentiation between high and low volume cases in previous studies, data obtained in this study will be compared to overall safety and efficacy data available from the PINNACLE FLX clinical trial and the SURPASS analysis to ensure that safety and efficacy outcomes are comparable.\n\nAdditionally, this study will collect data on the workflows of these high-volume implanters that will help determine which factors contribute to the successful performance of high volumes of Watchman FLX\u2122 implants in a single day. In the future this information may be used to help other implanters optimize workflows to increase their volume of daily implants and hence, provide more opportunities for patients to access this transformative device."
