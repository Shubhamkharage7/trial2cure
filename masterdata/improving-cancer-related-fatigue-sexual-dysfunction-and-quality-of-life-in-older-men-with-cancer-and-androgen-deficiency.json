There will be 5 study visits: 1) Screening, 2) Baseline, 3) 2-Week Dose Adjustment Visit, 4) Three-month visit (Week 12), and 5) Six-month visit. Testosterone or placebo gels will be applied by eligible trial participants at home; participants will be trained on gel application procedures by research personnel."

Patients who have no evidence of disease (NED) for 60 months or less, which means that they are \\<60 months from their last treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) will be included.\n* Age: 55 years and older\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n* Serum testosterone, measured by mass spectrometry (gold standard method), of \\<348 ng/dl and/or free testosterone \\<70 pg/ml. The lower limits of the normal range for total testosterone in healthy men is 348 ng/dL and the lower limits of free testosterone is \\<70 pg/ml in the Framingham Heart Study sample.

Thus, men with free testosterone \\<70 pg/mL will be included.\n* Fatigue. Fatigue was selected as it is a highly prevalent symptom in cancer patients. Fatigue will be defined as a score on FACIT-Fatigue subscale of \\<40, which best divides cancer patients from the general population with accuracy.\n* Ability and willingness to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men with current or prior history of prostate, breast, testicular, or adrenal cancers.\n* Use of anabolic agents (testosterone, DHEA, growth hormone) within the past 6 months\n* Hematocrit \\>48%, serum creatinine \\>2.5 mg/dL\n* PSA \\>4 ng/ml; nodule or induration on digital rectal exam\n* Severe untreated sleep apnea\n* Uncontrolled congestive heart failure\n* Myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization surgery, stroke or thromboembolism (of any etiology) within 6 months\n* Known history of thrombophilia due to a genetic mutation (e.g. Factor V Leiden)\n* Previous stroke with residual cognitive or functional deficits\n* Inability to provide informed consent; MMSE score \\<24\n* Poorly controlled diabetes as defined by hemoglobin A1c \\>10.0%\n* Body mass index (BMI) \\>40 kg/m2\n* Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia",
