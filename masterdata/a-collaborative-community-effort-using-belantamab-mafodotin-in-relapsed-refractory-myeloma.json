            "briefSummary": "This is a research study to find out if a drug called belantamab mafodotin in combination with dexamethasone, a steroid, can be safely and effectively given in the community setting. Belantamab mafodotin (BLENREP) was approved in the US in August 2020 under an FDA program called accelerated approval. In November 2022, belantamab mafodotin was removed from the market because a study to further confirm its activity in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma did not deliver a supporting result. However, this confirmatory study demonstrated that some patients may still benefit from treatment with belantamab mafodotin, and that this benefit can be long lasting. Belantamab mafodotin is often given at large academic medical centers every 3 weeks. This study will assess whether it is possible to administer belantamab in the community setting every 6 weeks. It is unknown if administering belantamab every 6 weeks versus every 3 weeks will result in improved safety and/or reduced efficacy."
