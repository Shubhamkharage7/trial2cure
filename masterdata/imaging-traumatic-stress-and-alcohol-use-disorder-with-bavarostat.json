            "briefSummary": "The overall objective of this study it to use Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain imaging and a radiotracer that measures the epigenetic marker Histone Deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) to examine HDAC6 expression in people with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), or concurrent PTSD and AUD with control groups. While there are a large number of studies conducted in preclinical stress and addiction models, these findings have not been translated to people living with these disorders. We will examine relationships between HDAC6 and clinical variables of interest. Findings could direct treatment development.",
            "detailedDescription": "We will image 150 subjects total, as outlined below. Subjects will be asked to participate in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET imaging procedures as well as behavioral and cognitive tasks to better understand stress and alcohol related behaviors. MRI is required to detect significant brain abnormalities and for use in the PET image analysis.\n\nIn Aim 1, Up to 30 PTSD and 30 TC will be imaged with \\[18F\\]Bavarostat to measure levels of HDAC6 throughout the brain to determine whether individuals with PTSD have altered levels of HDAC6 expression compared to trauma-exposed healthy controls.\n\nIn Aim 2, Up to 30 AUD and 30 HC will be imaged with \\[18F\\]Bavarostat to measure levels of HDAC6 throughout the brain to determine whether individuals with AUD have altered levels of HDAC6 expression compared to healthy controls.\n\nIn Aim 3, Up to 30 comorbid PTSD \\& AUD subjectswill be imaged with \\[18F\\]Bavarostat to measure levels of HDAC6 throughout the brain to determine whether individuals with comorbid PTSD \\& AUD have altered levels of HDAC6 expression compared to trauma-exposed healthy controls."
