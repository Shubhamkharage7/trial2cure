            "briefSummary": "The EMPoWER Study randomized clinical trial is a strengths-based behavioral intervention delivered to youth with type 1 diabetes (age 10 to 13) and their parents. The purpose of the intervention is to improve glycemic, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes in youth with diabetes using a multiple systems approach that engages youth, their parents, and diabetes care providers to identify and build youths' diabetes strengths. The primary aim of this study is to assess the intervention impact on glycemic control, adherence, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Secondary aims are to evaluate behavioral mediators of intervention impact and to examine intervention dose as a mediator of intervention impact.\n\nIn preparation for the randomized clinical trial of a new behavioral intervention for preteens with type 1 diabetes and their parents, the study is first enrolling adolescents with type 1 diabetes to create videos about living well with type 1 diabetes. The videos will be used in the intervention materials for the randomized clinical trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of the randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to learn if a brief behavioral intervention targeting multiple systems (\"Type 1 Doing Well\" Program) can improve glycemic, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes in youth with type 1 diabetes. Youth, age 10 to 13, will enroll with one parent or legal guardian to participate in the study with them. Researchers will compare the Type 1 Doing Well (T1DW) Program arm to the Enhanced Usual Care (EUC; \"Diabetes-Related Information and Resources\" Program) arm.\n\nParent-youth dyads in both study arms will provide data (e.g. questionnaires, A1c, medical chart and diabetes device data) at four timepoints throughout the duration of the study. Following baseline data collection, parent-youth dyads will complete an orientation session with study team members to be randomized to their study arm and review study activities. Parent and youth will also be invited to complete a feedback interview on their experience with the program they received.\n\nThe intervention will take place during the 6-month intervention period, and participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of two intervention conditions:\n\n1. Parents and youth in the T1DW Program condition (intervention) will use a web-based mobile application to do daily and weekly activities focused on recognizing and reinforcing youths' diabetes strengths. They will also have a conversation with the youth's diabetes provider about what is going well in diabetes care at a routine diabetes appointment.\n2. Parents and youth in the EUC Program condition will receive and review 6 monthly diabetes-related information and resources in the form of electronic handouts.\n\nDiabetes care providers at each of the sites will also be enrolled in the study. Provider participants will receive a brief training to deliver the strength-based conversation with parent-youth dyads in the T1DW Program arm, and they will complete study-related questionnaires about their experiences delivering the strengths-based conversation component of the intervention."

All parent and youth dyads are randomized to either the Type 1 Doing Well intervention condition or the enhanced usual care condition.
