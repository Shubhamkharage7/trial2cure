            "briefSummary": "Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis (CP) affects up to 90% of patients during the course of their disease, and response to currently available therapies is suboptimal and unpredictable. The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the predictive capability of Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P-QST) - a novel assessment of neurosensory phenotyping- for improvement in pain in patients with CP who are undergoing medically-indicated invasive treatment with endoscopic therapy or surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "P-QST has been shown to be able to phenotype patients with CP into nociceptive patterns according to degree of central sensitization. As a tool to identify baseline nociceptive pattern in patients with painful CP, P-QST will be performed at baseline prior to planned invasive treatment with endoscopic therapy or decompressive surgery. We will evaluate the ability of P-QST to predict response to invasive treatment for painful CP, and to develop a predictive model for individualized prediction of treatment response.\n\nPatients will undergo pre-procedure P-QST testing before undergoing scheduled invasive treatment as directed by their treating gastroenterologist. The date of first endoscopic therapy or surgery will be used to calculate follow-up timepoints, which will be scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months after the first endotherapy session or surgery. At each follow-up time point, patients will answer questions about their pain. In addition, patients will complete patient reported outcome tools (HADS, PCS instruments) and the Patient Global Impression of Change. Serum and urine samples will be obtained at baseline and at 6-month follow-up timepoints."
