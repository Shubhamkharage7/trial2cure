The new technologies should improve MRI capabilities in terms of how sensitive, specific, and efficient they are. The overall goal is to get better measurements of the brain tumor tissue(s).\n\nIn this research study, the investigators want to learn more about investigational software and about techniques to process MR images. The testing of investigational software will allow the investigators to improve the image quality. As part of the testing process, the investigators will collect more MR images of the brain, and improve current image reconstruction methods. This will allow a more precise analysis of MR images and potentially better assessment of the brain tumor tissue volume."
