This is particularly true in the case of rare diseases, such as bone and soft tissue tumors. It is therefore the purpose of this study to create a prospective EHR-based clinical registry for individuals with bone and soft-tissue tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To create a secure EHR-based registry to allow for the prospective collection of clinical and research data in a collection of rare diseases (bone and soft-tissue tumors).\n\nII. To facilitate the identification and validation of clinical and molecular features that may be associated with prognosis and/or response to therapy in (subtypes) of bone and soft-tissue tumors.\n\nIII. To pilot a mechanism that will facilitate future collaboration between institutions for research and analysis of bone and soft-tissue tumors.\n\nIV. To standardize biospecimen collection for correlative biomarker analysis for patients undergoing treatment and surveillance for bone and soft tissue tumors at Ohio State University.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients complete quality of life questionnaires and their medical records are reviewed. Patients may also undergo collection of blood samples for up to 2 years, unless otherwise specified in the protocol."
