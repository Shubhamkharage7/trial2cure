The hypothesis is that adding SLM to the Pembrolizumab and Axitinib combination will improve efficacy without added toxicity.\n\nThis is a two-part study:\n\n* Escalation Part 1: The study will begin with a dose-escalation study to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of study drug, SLM.\n* Expansion Part 2: Once the appropriate dose of SLM is determined, the second part of the study will begin."
