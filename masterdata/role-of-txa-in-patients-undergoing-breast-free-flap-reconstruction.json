            "briefSummary": "Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic, competitive lysine receptor inhibitor on plasminogen. It ultimately stabilizes the fibrin matrix, therefore used as a hemostatic agent for various indications. While there has been indications for orthopedic and trauma surgery, there is no clear data for its role in patients who are undergoing free tissue transfer. Studies have shown that patients undergoing free tissue transfer can have transfusion rates ranging from 7.2% to 34.9%, which data also showing association between transfusion requirement and higher free flap failure rate. There has been a few retrospective studies that evaluated the effect of TXA in free tissue transfer and the results showed no increased risk of microanastomosis failure but some showing decreased blood loss. This study aims to further analyze the role of TXA in patients undergoing breast free flap reconstruction with randomized, prospective trial. Control group will not receive TXA while experimental group will receive TXA. Both groups will receive standard of care breast free flap surgery as well as post-op care, which is streamlined with Early Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol. Their pre and post-op hemoglobin will be compared, as well as rates of transfusion, surgical outcome and surgical complications including hematoma, flap failure, and any other medical complications such as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/ Pulmonary Embolism (PE)."
