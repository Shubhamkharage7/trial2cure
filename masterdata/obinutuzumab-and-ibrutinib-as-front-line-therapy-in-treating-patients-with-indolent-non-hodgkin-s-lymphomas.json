            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab and ibrutinib work as front line therapy in treating patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving obinutuzumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab in chemotherapy naive patients with indolent lymphomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess progression free survival rates and overall survival rates in indolent lymphomas.\n\nII. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination. III. To evaluate response using positron emission tomography (PET) and correlate PET negativity with durability of response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 months after cycle 6, patients with stable disease will continue to receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for a total of 12 doses.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year, every 3-6 months for 4 years, and then 1 year later."
