We will test intervention effects on regular HIV testing and use of prevention strategies. The intervention was developed in partnership with community stakeholders at Bienestar Human Services, Inc., a Latinx-focused organization in Los Angeles County (LAC), CA. The intervention is flexible for use in community-based organizations, such as in ongoing support groups.\n\nThe Specific Aims are:\n\nAim 1. To conduct a randomized controlled trial of a culturally congruent cognitive behavior therapy group intervention for immigrant Latinx sexual minority men, to test intervention effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake.\n\nAim 2. To examine mechanisms of intervention effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake, including more effective coping (e.g., reduced internalized stigma).\n\nAim 3. To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention."

Intervention groups will be led by a trained facilitator (with expertise in group therapy with Latinx SMM) and a trained peer co-facilitator matched in identities with participants (Latinx SMM).",
