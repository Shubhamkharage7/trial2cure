            "briefSummary": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID, continues to rage throughout the world with 115,000,000 confirmed cases and over 2,500,000 deaths (as of Mar 3, 2021). This translates to millions of people surviving COVID19 infection. While the lungs are ground zero, COVID tears through organ systems from brain to blood vessels. We are now beginning to see people recover but complain of ongoing problems, including lingering cognitive problems, depression, and anxiety. We have brought together 2 laboratories with complementary techniques including psychological testing and neuroimaging methods togethers with markers in the blood that may signal damage in the brain. A close look at these problems is timely and imperative if we are to understand the pathophysiology of 'COVID brain' and prepare for downstream problems.",
            "detailedDescription": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been going on for over a year worldwide, with 115,000,000 confirmed cases and over 2,500,000 deaths (as of Mar 3, 2021). We are seeing people recover from the initial COVID infection with complaints of ongoing problems. An increasing number of people are complaining of cognitive deficits and depression/anxiety.\n\nMethodologically, we have brought together two laboratories studying neurocognitive impairment using an EEG, MRI, and behavioral approach as well as laboratory-based data. This study queries neuropsychological functions in individuals using a neuropsychological battery, EEG-based measures, functional MRI (connectivity) and structural MRI (gray and white matter volumes, myelin, micro-bleeds). In addition, we have preliminary data to show a continued increase in plasma cytokines in COVID survivors. Plasma isolated neuronal enriched extracellular vesicles (nEVs) showed an increase in amyloid beta, neurofilament light and pT181-Tau, all proteins associated with neurodegeneration.\n\nThe overall aim is to determine the extent of cognitive, clinical, and neurological damage in people recovered from COVID."
