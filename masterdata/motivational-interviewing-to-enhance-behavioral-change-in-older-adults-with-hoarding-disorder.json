            "briefSummary": "This study will compare two behavioral interventions for hoarding disorder in older adults.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hoarding disorder is a psychological condition with a unique constellation of consequences for older adults, including increased risk of fire and dying in a fire, insect infestation, and medical problems. Dangers related to cluttered living spaces are exacerbated by reduced executive functioning, attention, and concentration. Hoarding psychopathology results from maladaptive cognitions (e.g., desire to keep items others would discard) and maladaptive behavioral patterns (e.g., avoidance of sorting/discarding items).\n\nExtant treatments for hoarding have targeted fear reduction as the mechanism of change, either through cognitive-behavioral therapy focusing on cognitive restructuring or behavior therapy focusing on exposure therapy. Older adults have a lackluster response to cognitive restructuring for hoarding, and, although exposure therapy increases treatment response, both approaches require a lengthy six-month dose. Our preliminary work suggests that fear reduction may not be a universally relevant target mechanism for older adults, and that to be responsive to the specific needs of older adults, other mechanisms need to be identified.\n\nMotivational interviewing is a technique that is already typically incorporated into hoarding treatment and has been demonstrated to increase motivation for behavioral change across a range of health conditions for older adults, including physical activity, diet, and disease management. Because sorting/discarding is at its core a health behavior that hoarding patients lack the motivation to engage in, motivational interviewing is likely to decrease hoarding severity by eliciting increased levels of sorting/discarding.\n\nThe proposed project will use a mechanistic clinical trials approach to determine if a four-month intervention combining motivational interviewing with sorting practice can engage the proposed target, motivation for behavioral change, when compared to a four-month dose of sorting practice alone in a sample of rural-dwelling older adults with hoarding disorder."
