If they are placed in the \"Her Health Program\" group, they will receive their usual care + the addition of an extra healthcare team member(called a community health navigator) to to work with patients and care team for a year postpartum.\n\nResearchers will compare those who receive the Her Health Program and those who do not receive the program to see if the Her Health Program can help women get healthcare in the first year after having a baby."
