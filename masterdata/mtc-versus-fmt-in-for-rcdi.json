FMT is the transfer of bacteria from a healthy donor's colon to a recipient's colon. To do this, stool from a healthy donor is blended with salt water and made into a liquid solution rich in bacteria. This solution is sprayed into the recipient's colon during a colonoscopy. This treatment is now considered standard medical care for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections.\n\nOne FMT dose contains the entire collection of microbes in a healthy donor and is made up of billions of microbes. Each dose of FMT is different from the next and it is unknown exactly what microbes are present in each dose."
