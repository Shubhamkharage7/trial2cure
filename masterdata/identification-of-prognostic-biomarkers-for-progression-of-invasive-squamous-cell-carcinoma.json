The investigators plan to prospectively collect 5 bronchoscopic biopsies, 10ml blood and one tumor and adjacent normal samples from 200 qualified patients who meet the study criteria. If a patient has already had a bronchoscopy and has consented to have samples stored for research at the Mayo Clinic Rochester we will access them for the research study if available. Otherwise, if the patient has already had surgery and tissue has not been stored for research the investigators will consent patients to use their clinical specimens for the research study. The investigators will then extract DNA from tissue sections and blood and use a custom targeted sequencing panel of 23 cancer driver genes with significant mutations in squamous cell carcinoma that they have developed to find the prognostic biomarkers. The DNA will be used in a PCR reaction to generate amplicons for library preparation using Illumina Nextera XT library preparation protocol and targeted sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq sequencer. The reads will be aligned to the HG19 using BWA aligner and variant detection performed with Agilent SureCall and GATK analytic tools."
