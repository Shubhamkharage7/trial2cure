            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BT-600 when administered in single and multiple ascending doses to healthy participants. The study will enroll up to 48 participants, with participation lasting 2-3 weeks in addition to up to 28 days (about 4 weeks) for screening.\n\nThe purposes of this study are to learn about the safety and tolerability of single and multiple rising oral doses of BT-600, assess the blood and tissue levels of tofacitinib released from BT-600, and assess the body's effects to the study drug following oral doses of BT-600 in blood and tissue in healthy adult participants.\n\nBT-600 is a swallowable drug/device combination product designed to deliver a liquid formulation of tofacitinib to the colon and dispense the study drug throughout the colon. BT-600 consists of two components, the drug part containing a reservoir, which will be filled with liquid tofacitinib, and the drive part. The drive part contains the hardware and software that identifies the colon region and then dispenses the drug to the specific region. The device which contains the drug is referred to as the NaviCap\u2122 device. The NaviCap device is approximately the size of a fish oil pill, is made of plastic material known to be safe for ingestion and has rounded ends for ease of swallowing. Liquid tofacitinib in the reservoir is automatically released when the BT-600 localization technology determines that it has reached the colon. BT-600 passes through the colon and the NaviCap device is excreted via a bowel movement."
