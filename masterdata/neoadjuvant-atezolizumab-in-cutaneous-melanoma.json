            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to see whether using atezolizumab before surgery is safe and does not cause side effects that delay surgery in participants with cutaneous melanoma that has not spread to other areas of the body (non-metastatic) and can be removed by surgery (resectable) but has a higher risk of coming back after surgery (high-risk).",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using atezolizumab before surgery in participants with cutaneous melanoma that has not spread to other areas of the body (non-metastatic) and can be removed by surgery (resectable) but has a higher risk of coming back after surgery (high-risk). Cutaneous melanoma in its earliest stages before it has spread to other areas of the body can usually be cured with surgery alone. Unfortunately, some cutaneous melanomas have a greater likelihood of coming back after surgery. Your immune system is normally your body's first defense against threats like cancer. But sometimes cancer cells produce signals that allow them to hide from attack by the immune system. One such signal is called programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Atezolizumab is a drug that blocks PD-L1. By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab may boost your immune system to keep your cutaneous melanoma from coming back after surgery."
