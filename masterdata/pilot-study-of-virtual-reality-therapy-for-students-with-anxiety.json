Each scenario contains five levels, each increasing with anxiety stimuli and certain tasks the participant must complete. The participant will put on the Oculus headset, and go through a preliminary orientation game. The headset will be casted to an external monitor. Once they start gameChange, it will take the participants to the virtual therapist's room. They will be asked to choose which scenario they would like to participate in first and will complete all five levels for one scenario. Research staff will be taking event sampling-style observations of the participant. After completion of the levels, the participant will return to the virtual therapist's room for debriefing, and then will be asked to exit the game.",
