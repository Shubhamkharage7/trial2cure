However, if it is not feasible, at least 3 patients of each gender must be included in the study before reaching the \\[177Lu\\]-NeoB Dose level of 100% estimated cumulative dose (ECD) (Dose level 4) or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended phase two dose (RP2D), whichever is lower.\n\nExpansion part (Phase IIa):\n\nThe Phase IIa study will be conducted in adult patients (age \\>= 18 years old) with:\n\n* For Cohorts A, B, C respectively: Any of the following selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors: breast cancer (human receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) negative including HER 2 low), prostate cancer, and GIST all showing \\[68Ga\\]-NeoB lesion uptake.\n* For Cohort D: Patients affected by any advanced/metastatic solid tumor type known to overexpress GRPR, including recurrent GBM, and with moderate impaired renal function defined as creatinine clearance (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, or measured) \u2265 30mL/min and \\< 60mL/min.\n* For Cohort E (US and UK only): Patients eligible for enrollment in any of the three advanced/metastatic tumor types (as defined for Cohorts A, B, C) who will receive the first cycle of \\[177Lu\\]-NeoB upon co-administration with LCZ696\n\n  * Enrollment in cohort D will no longer be allowed with implementation of protocol version 07. \\*\\*"

Pregnant or breast-feeding women\n22. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, are not allowed to participate in this study UNLESS they are using highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 7 months after study drug discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods include:\n\n    * True abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to IMPs, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n    * Male or female sterilization. Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method if the partner is the sole sexual partner of the study participant and the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.\n    * Women tubal ligation is an acceptable highly effective contraception method, but surgical sterility is defined as bilateral salpingectomy (or bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n    * Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):\n\n      1. Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. In case of use of oral contraception, women should be stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking \\[177Lu\\]-NeoB treatment. This is not applicable for patients with breast cancer.\n      2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). IUS is not applicable for patients with breast cancer.\n      3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels \\> 40 mIU/mL \\[for US only: and estradiol \\< 20 pg/mL\\] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.\n\n    Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 4 months after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. Female partners of childbearing potential should use highly effective contraceptive methods during and up to 4 months after stopping treatment.\n23. Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to informed consent signature.\n24. Cohorts A, B, and C: Patient currently receiving NEP inhibitors (e.g., Entresto, racecadotril) and for whom images for dosimetry assessments cannot be acquired.\n25. Cohort E only: Patient meeting at least one of the following conditions\n\n    * Currently receiving NEP inhibitors (e.g., Entresto, racecadotril)\n    * Known history of angioedema related to previous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy or hereditary or idiopathic angioedema\n    * Hypersensitivity to the LCZ696 active substances or to any of the excipients\n    * Diabetes mellitus and receiving aliskiren-containing medicinal products\n    * Receiving ACE inhibitors or has discontinued ACE inhibitor therapy within 36 hours before receiving the first dose of LCZ696 in the study\n    * Systolic blood pressure \\< 100 mmHg\u00a5\n    * Serum potassium level \\> 5.5 mEq/L\u00a5\n\n      * To be considered as valid to determine the eligibility of a patient, exam results of exclusion criteria #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #10 (except LVEF) and #11 must be collected on or after date of patient's informed consent and must be available in the source documents for monitoring. LVEF evaluation is permitted within 6 weeks prior to IMP1 administration, even if performed outside the screening period as part of standard routine clinical practice of care, before ICF signature.\n\n        * No platelet transfusion, packed red cell transfusion, or G-CSF will be allowed during the selection phase after ICF signature. Transfusion for the sole purpose of making a patient eligible for the study inclusion is not allowed.\n\n          * Blood pressure and serum potassium level must be evaluated at screening and again at time of LCZ696 collection, within 7 days prior to \\[177Lu\\]-NeoB first administration (C1D1).",
