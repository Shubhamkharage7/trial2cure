The trial will begin with a safety run-in phase of 10 patients receiving combination therapy with pembrolizumab; FF 10832 will be dosed at 40 mg/m2 with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg).\n\nAfter confirmation of the appropriate FF-10832 dose for use with pembrolizumab, the trial will enroll up to an additional 100 patients in 2 cohorts (urothelial cancer \\[UC\\] and non-small cell lung cancer \\[NSCLC\\]) into 4 separate expansion treatment arms (approximately 25 patients in each treatment arm). The disease-defined cohorts will be patients who have progressed on PD-1/PD-L1 therapy who have UC or NSCLC.\n\nThe UC cohort will be randomized (1:1) to one of two treatment arms (monotherapy or combination therapy) and the NSCLC cohort will be randomized (1:1) to one of two treatment arms (monotherapy or combination therapy), to further establish safety and gain preliminary information on antitumor activity of FF-10832 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab."
