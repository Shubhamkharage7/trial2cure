Collecting and storing samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with brain tumors to study in the laboratory may help doctors develop new strategies to better diagnose, monitor, and treat brain tumors.",

To collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples that can provide a resource to the research community for biomarker discovery in patients with gliomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate the feasibility of serial CSF sampling from patients with brain tumors for longitudinal evaluation of tumor biomarkers.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of CSF samples via lumbar puncture at least 2 times. Patients may undergo additional collection of additional CSF samples if they choose.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
