Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: prostate capsule-sparing radical cystectomy or nerve-sparing radical cystectomy. Patients will be monitored following standard of care guidelines and clinical data will be collected. Patients in both groups will be asked to complete an erectile function questionnaire at multiple timepoints. Patients who receive an orthotopic neobladder will be asked to complete a questionnaire to monitor urinary function at multiple timepoints. Patient adverse events will be monitored to ensure patients safety.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine if prostate capsule-sparing cystectomy improves functional outcomes without compromising the oncologic outcomes in patients with bladder cancer. The comparison arm will be patients undergoing nerve-sparing radical cystectomy. Participants will be randomized to receive either a nerve-sparing radical cystectomy or a prostate capsule-sparing radical cystectomy. Patients will be monitored following standard of care guidelines every 3-months post-operatively up to and including 24 months post-operatively. As part of standard of care post-operative follow-up patients will have routine history and physical exams, urine cytology, urine culture, Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). Standard of Care diagnostic imaging will also occur. The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) Questionnaire will be given to patients 6-weeks post-operatively and every 3-months post-operatively up to and including 24-months post-operatively. To measure urinary function in patients who receive orthotopic neobladder, the Validated Pad Questionnaire will be given 6-weeks post-operatively and every 3-months post-operatively up to and including 24-months post operatively. Adverse Events will be monitored in both groups as defined by the CTCAE 5.0 guidelines."
