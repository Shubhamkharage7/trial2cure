Acalabrutinib targets a vulnerable part of cancer cells which leads to an inhibition of the growth of cancer cells.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved acalabrutinib for recurrent or refractory central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years as long as they do not have serious side effects and their disease does not get worse.\n\nApproximately 15 to 21 participants will be enrolled in phase1 and approximately 28 patients will be enrolled Phase 2.\n\nAstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the research study and the study drug, acalabrutinib."
