B) Patient is a post-menopausal or surgically sterile female \u2265 18 years old at Visit 1/Screening.\n2. Patient has provided written informed consent.\n3. Male patients who are sexually active with a female partner and are not surgically sterile must use a highly effective method of birth control as described in the informed consent form. Note: Male patients must refrain from sperm donation for at least 90 days after application of their last dose of IP (investigational product).\n4. Patient has active mild or moderate AD with a modified-Eczema Area and Severity Index (m-EASI) score of 5-16 and a history of AD duration \u2265 2 years.\n5. Patient has an AD body surface area (BSA) between 3 and 12% in the area to be treated (excluding head/neck, hands/feet, genitalia, and intertriginous areas) at Baseline.\n6. Patient is willing and able to apply the IP(s) as directed, comply with study instructions (including avoiding direct sunlight exposure to the areas of IP application), and commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study. Note: The use of topical sunscreen is permitted provided the patient has used the sunscreen previously and it does not contain any prohibited medications/ingredients.\n7. Patient, in the investigator's opinion, is in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition that might impair evaluation or exposes the patient to an unacceptable risk by study participation.\n8. Patient agrees to apply a bland moisturizer as directed for the duration of the study.\n9. Patient has normal renal and hepatic function as determined by the Visit 1/Screening laboratory results in the opinion of the investigator.\n10. \\[For PK Cohort Only\\] Patient is a non-smoker, defined as not having smoked or used any form of tobacco or non-tobacco products containing nicotine in more than 6 months before Visit 2/Baseline.\n11. \\[For PK Cohort Only\\] Patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 32 kg/m2 inclusive and body weight not less than 50 kg at Visit 1/Screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has any dermatological disorders of the skin within 20 cm of the areas to be treated with the possibility of interfering with the application of the IP or examination method, such as fungal or bacterial infections, psoriasis, folliculitis, notable scarring (linear scar \\> 2.5 cm, etc.), or skin atrophy at Visit 2/Baseline.\n2. Patient has any skin pathology or condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could interfere with the evaluation of the IP or requires use of interfering topical, systemic, or surgical therapy at Visit 2/Baseline.\n3. Patient has any visible inflammatory skin disease, injury, or condition of their skin that could compromise patient safety and/or interfere with the evaluation of local or systemic assessments performed during the study.\n4. Patient has a known or suspected malignancy at Visit 2/Baseline excluding basal cell skin cancer unless it is associated with the area to be treated per Exclusion Criterion no. 1.\n5. Patient has a positive blood screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibody.\n6. Patient has any condition, which, in the investigator's opinion, would make it unsafe for the patient to participate in this study, including clinically significant abnormal laboratory, or 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) findings during the screening period or Visit 2/Baseline prior to dosing of the IP.\n7. Patient has a hospital admission or major surgery within 30 days prior to Visit 2/ Baseline or planned for during the study.\n8. Patient is currently enrolled in an investigational drug, biologic, or device study.\n9.
