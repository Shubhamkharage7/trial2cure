Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A: Exercise group (EXE) vs. Group B: Waitlist control group (WC). Randomization means that a participant will be placed into one of the study groups by chance.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, blood tests, stool samples, and survey questionnaires.\n\nParticipation in this research study will last up to 6 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 84 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe American Cancer Society is providing funding for this research study."

This study targets insufficiently active persons to assess the effect of the described exercise intervention, where additional exercise done regularly will contaminate the intervention effects.\n* Unstable comorbidities that prevent participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise.

For the purpose of patients' safety, as well as because this study involves remote, home-based exercise where close supervision is not possible, patients with unstable medical conditions are excluded.\n* Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study.",
