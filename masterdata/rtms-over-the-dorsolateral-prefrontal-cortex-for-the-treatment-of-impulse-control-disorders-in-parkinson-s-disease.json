This is a randomized sham-controlled cross-over trial. All patients will undergo a session of active rTMS and a session of sham rTMS, with the order of sessions randomized across participants. Following recruitment and eligibility screening, the eligible participants will undergo two sessions of rTMS (active and sham), immediately followed by neurocognitive tasks and questionnaires, no more than 1-2 weeks apart. Each session will have a duration of approximately 1-1.5 hours."
