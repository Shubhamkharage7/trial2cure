Data about how they function in their daily activities will be obtained.\n\nParticipants may speak with a genetic counselor. They may have genetic testing.\n\nParticipants will give blood samples. They may have a cheek swab. For this, small brush will be rubbed against the inside of the cheek.\n\nParticipants may have a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Or they may have a CT scan of the chest and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis.\n\nParticipants will be monitored every 6-12 months at the NIH Clinical Center, for up to 10 years before having surgery. If they need surgery, it will be performed at the NIH. Then, they will be monitored every 6-12 months, for up to 5 years after surgery.\n\nIf a participant has surgery, tumor tissue samples will be taken.\n\nIf a participant does not need surgery, their participation will end after 10 years. If they have surgery, the 5-year monitoring period will restart after each surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common gastrointestinal soft tissue sarcoma, but remain a rare disease entity.\n\nMost GISTs are characterized by KIT or PDGFRA mutations, making them susceptible to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.\n\nWild-type (WT) GISTs are rarer tumors, usually characterized by SDH mutations and/or lack of KIT or PDGFRA mutations; paragangliomas are frequently associated with WT GISTs.\n\nNon-WT GISTs may become refractory to TKI therapy, whereas WT GISTs are generally resistant to TKI therapy.\n\nThe primary treatment modality for GISTs is surgical resection, which may involve the stomach, liver, and/or peritoneal surfaces; most patients will require multiple operations to remove disease not responsive to systemic agents.\n\nInvestigational systemic therapies are limited by toxicity and/or lack of efficacy, resulting in an unmet need for novel treatment options.\n\nObtaining fresh tumor tissue is critical to the successful development of GIST models for drug research, as well as for next generation tumor genomic sequencing, and to help identify novel targets and/or agents for the treatment of WT and TKI-resistant non-WT GISTs.\n\nObjective:\n\nEvaluate and follow patients with GISTs, particularly WT and treatment-refractory non-WT, to support translational research for this rare disease\n\nAssess disease-free intervals (DFIs) between surgical resection of disease for at least 5 years\n\nEligibility:\n\nParticipants with histologically confirmed or clinical presentation suspicious of GIST.\n\nDesign:\n\nProspective cohort study\n\nParticipants with histologically confirmed or clinical presentation suspicious of GIST will enroll on study and will have active surveillance every 9-15 months for up to 10 years prior to and up to 5 years after surgical resection and/or cytoreduction. As participants may have multiple resections during the course of the study, 5-year surveillance post-surgery may be initiated multiple times, relative to the last resection performed.\n\nAll participants enrolled will be evaluated for tumor resection or cytoreduction at the start of study and if appropriate, will be offered surgery, otherwise they will be on active surveillance until surgical resection or cytoreduction is clinically indicated.\n\nIt is expected that approximately 30-40 patients per year may enroll on this trial; the accrual ceiling will be set at 400 to permit accrual over a 10-year period."
