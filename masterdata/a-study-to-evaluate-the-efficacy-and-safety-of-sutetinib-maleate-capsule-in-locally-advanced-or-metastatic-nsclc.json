Mutated (changed) forms of the EGFR gene and protein have been found in some types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer. These changes may cause cancer cells to grow and spread in the body. The purpose of this study is to explore how effective Sutetinib maleate capsules are for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations."
