The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. What is the feasibility of delivering a personalized patient education program for individuals with chronic low back pain?\n2. What is the impact of personalized patient education materials on disease-specific self-efficacy and patient-reported function in a small sample of individuals with chronic low back pain?\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* access and complete online baseline questionnaires\n* access and follow online patient materials on chronic low back pain on days 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17\n* access and complete online follow-up responses to baseline questionnaires and a post-study survey",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a pilot single-arm study to examine the potential of personalized patient education materials to improve self-efficacy and perceived functional disability for patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP).\n\nThe investigators aim to recruit 30 individuals with cLBP. The investigators will aim to recruit 15 individuals from areas with an Area Deprivation Index (ADI) of at least 6 and 15 from areas with an ADI of 5 or lower.\n\nParticipants will complete a 3-week educational intervention aimed at improving self-efficacy in managing chronic LBP. Educational materials will be personalized for each participant depending upon things like baseline knowledge of cLBP, smoking status, exercise status, beliefs about safe movement with cLBP, preference for various health care interventions, and nature of work (sedentary vs. labor-oriented job).\n\nEducational materials will be provided electronically using Qualtrics.\n\nParticipants will complete outcome measures at baseline and follow-up as described elsewhere in this study record."

The investigators will use ADI as a marker of socioeconomic status. Although the sample size in this study will not be large enough to detect the ability of the intervention to reduce socioeconomic disparities in chronic LBP outcomes, the investigators do need to show that the investigators are able to recruit a sufficient population of individuals of lower socioeconomic status and individuals of higher socioeconomic status to demonstrate feasibility for a future larger study. State-level ADI is measured from 1 to 10, with lower scores indicating greater advantage, and higher scores indicating greater deprivation. It is measured at the level of a census block group. The investigators will identify a potential participant's ADI by inputting their address of residence into the Neighborhood Atlas mapping tool, which is freely available online at https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/mapping\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* any prior spine surgery\n* any orthopaedic surgery in the past 6 months\n* does not have own smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop to access study questionnaires and education materials",
