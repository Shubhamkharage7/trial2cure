            "briefSummary": "Researchers leading this study hope to learn about the safety of combining the study drug relugolix with another study drug called itraconazole or ritonavir in prostate cancer. This study is for individuals who have advanced prostate cancer and plans to have medical castration (the use of medications or chemicals to lower hormone production in the testicles). Your participation in this research will last up to 1 month.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of relugolix in combination with ritonavir or itraconazole. The goal of this research is to find out if combining two medications (relugolix and itraconazole or relugolix and ritonavir) could possibly lead to using less relugolix, which is an expensive drug."
