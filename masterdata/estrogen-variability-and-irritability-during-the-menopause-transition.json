            "briefSummary": "Women in the menopause transition (perimenopause) experience substantial day-to-day variability in estradiol and have a 2-4-fold increase in major depression risk. About 40% of perimenopausal women are susceptible to the emergence of affective symptoms tied to changes in estradiol. Among the perimenopausal women with affective impairment, most report irritability, not \"depression,\" is their primary source of impairment and distress. The purpose of this research is to determine the neurophysiologic basis of susceptibility to estradiol fluctuations and irritability symptoms in perimenopausal women.",
            "detailedDescription": "Using a within-subjects, cross-over design and transdermal estradiol to stabilize estradiol fluctuations (and increase levels) the investigators will test if neural dynamics (oscillatory activity in the theta and beta frequencies assessed via EEG) associated with key constructs of irritability (attentional bias to threat and frustration to non-reward) represent a biomarker target of irritability symptom response to transdermal estradiol."
