Tobacco smokers (n=20) will be imaged with \\[11C\\]raclopride PET, after overnight abstinence from tobacco. Subjects will smoke their preferred brand of cigarette during the PET scan.\n2. Marijuana smokers (n=20) will be imaged with \\[11C\\]raclopride PET, after overnight abstinence from marijuana. Subjects will smoke a marijuana cigarette during the PET scan.\n3. Cocaine users (n=20) will be imaged with \\[11C\\]raclopride PET, after overnight abstinence from cocaine. Subjects will be administered cocaine during the PET scan.\n\nAim 2. To examine the magnitude, location and timing of drug-induced beta-endorphin release. \\*The Investigators will attempt to use the same subjects from Aim 1 for Aim 2.\n\n1. Tobacco smokers (n=20) will be imaged with \\[11C\\]carfentanil PET, after overnight abstinence from tobacco. Subjects will smoke their preferred brand of cigarette during the PET scan.\n2. Marijuana smokers (n=20) will be imaged with \\[11C\\]carfentanil PET, after overnight abstinence from marijuana. Subjects will smoke a marijuana cigarette during the PET scan.\n3.
