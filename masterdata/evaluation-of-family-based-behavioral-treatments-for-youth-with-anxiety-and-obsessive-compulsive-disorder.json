            "briefSummary": "Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders are among the most common in children. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective and evidence-based treatment for such disorders, access to CBT is often limited. Family-based and internet-delivered therapy is one method to increase access to care. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the comparative efficacy and treatment mechanisms of two lower-intensity but effective treatments for families of children with anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) via telehealth compared to an adapted Relaxation and Mentorship Training (RMT) intervention involving breathing exercises with a therapist.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for anxiety, yet access to CBT is limited for most families due to the cost, practicalities of attending in-person treatment sessions, and limited availability of trained therapists. Low-intensity telehealth delivery of services is a promising method to improve access to care for youth with anxiety and their families, givens its reachability to a wider range of areas (e.g., rural/underserved) and its ability to minimize practical barriers (e.g., treatment could be delivered to home without need for travel), and reduce stigma (e.g., parents do not need to visit mental health clinics). Additionally, parent-involved treatments for youth anxiety are effective and have the potential to reach more children and adolescents who refuse to see a therapist. However, these interventions have not been widely evaluated. The goal of this project is to evaluate the comparative efficacy and treatment mechanisms of two lower-intensity but effective treatments for families of children with anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) via telehealth compared to an adapted Relaxation and Mentorship Training (RMT) intervention involving breathing exercises with a therapist. This study involves two CBT-based intervention groups, both of which have demonstrated efficacy in prior work: 1) a parent-led, therapist-supported Internet based CBT intervention (iCBT) and 2) parent training paired with bibliotherapy intervention (SPACE)."

One core aspect of treatment will be parents leading their child through graduated exposure. Exposures, a hallmark of CBT for anxiety, are used to gradually and repeatedly confront feared stimuli. For example, exposure therapy for a child fearful of dogs may begin with looking at pictures of dogs and standing across the park from a dog on a leash, to eventually petting a dog. All relevant information regarding parent-led exposures will be detailed in the treatment materials, and therapists will review with parents via email and/or video-conferencing sessions.",
