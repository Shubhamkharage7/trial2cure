I.m. poly-ICLC will be administered (30ug/kg i.m.) immediately following the vaccine. Poly-ICLC should be administered i.m. within 3 cm of the peptide-injection site.\n\nTo allow for flexibility with scheduling, the peptide vaccine and Poly-ICLC dose may be given within one week of the date that the vaccine and poly-ICLC administration are due.\n\nPatients will be evaluated for any possible adverse event, regimen limiting toxicity (RLT) as well as clinical/radiological responses by clinical visits and MRI scanning. Follow-up MRIs will be performed (Weeks 6, 15 and 24)."

Radiation therapy counts as a biologic regimen. Patients may not have received radiation therapy to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment. Patients may have tumor spread within the central nervous system (CNS).\n* HLA-A2 positive based on flow cytometry.\n* Patients must be clinically stable and off or on low-dose (no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day Dexamethasone) corticosteroid for at least one week prior to study registration.\n* Patients must be \u2265 12 months and \\< 22 years of age at the time of HLA-A2 screening.\n* Patients must have a performance status of \u2265 70; (Karnofsky if \\> 16 years and Lansky if \u2264 16 years of age.\n* Documented negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for female patients who are post-menarchal. Because the effect of the peptide-based vaccine and poly-ICLC on the fetus has not sufficiently been investigated, pregnant females will not be included in the study.\n* Patients must be free of systemic infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of registration. Patients must be off IV antibiotics for at least 7 days prior to registration.\n* Patients with adequate organ function as measured by: Bone marrow: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1,000/\u00b5; Platelets \\> 100,000/\u00b5 (transfusion independent); absolute lymphocyte count of \u2265 500/\u00b5; Hemoglobin \\>8 g/dl (may be transfused). Hepatic: bilirubin \\< 1.5x institutional normal for age; serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) \\< 3x institutional normal.\n* Renal: Serum creatinine based on age or Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \u2265 70 ml/min/ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2\n* Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to grade 1 or better. Patients must be at least 3 weeks from the last dose of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biological therapy and at least 1 week from the last dose of non-myelosuppressive biologic therapy.\n* No overt cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary or psychiatric disease.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients living outside of North America are not eligible.\n* Patients may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment.\n* Concurrent treatment or medications (must be off for at least 1 week) including:\n\n  * Interferon (e.g. Intron-A\u00ae)\n  * Allergy desensitization injections\n  * Growth factors (e.g. Procrit\u00ae, Aranesp\u00ae, Neulasta\u00ae)\n  * Interleukins (e.g. Proleukin\u00ae)\n  * Any investigational therapeutic medication\n* Patients must not have a history of, or currently active autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.\n* Use of immunosuppressives within four weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use of immunosuppressive agents. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used in the peri-operative period must be tapered to no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day dexamethasone for at least one week before study registration. Topical corticosteroids are acceptable.\n* Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study.\n* Patients who have received prior immunotherapy.",
