            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies an imaging technique known as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) in identifying the presence of pancreatic cancer. DCE MRI is a procedure that takes detailed pictures of functional and structural properties inside the body using magnetic field imaging. These images may better characterize pancreatic cancer in patients at high risk or in patients who may have undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients at high risk for hereditary pancreatic cancer.\n\nII. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas.\n\nIII. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to accurately predict tumor margins in patients who have undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.\n\nIV. Obtain DCE-MRI scans of from healthy volunteers (Group 4), to establish baseline imaging parameters of the normal, non-diseased pancreas for use as a comparator to affected pancreata.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Clinical factors associated with the presence of pancreatic cancer will be assessed in each of the three experimental groups, including disease free survival and overall survival.\n\nII. Additional MRI pulses sequences (e.g. MR fingerprinting, etc.) will be acquired for the assessment of tissue contrast before and after the administration of contrast agents.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.\n\nARM I (High-risk for familial or hereditary pancreatic cancer): Patients undergo DCE MRI yearly for a minimum of 3 scans.\n\nARM II (Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms \\[IPMN\\]): Patients undergo DCE MRI prior to surgery for resection of IPMN.\n\nARM III (Pancreatic cancer): Patients who undergo chemotherapy prior to resection will have 2 DCE MRI scans; one study scan prior to undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, as well as one study scan following neoadjuvant therapy as part of their pre-operative work up in addition to the standard imaging studies. For patients that do not require chemotherapy treatment prior to resection they will have just one DCE MRI scan prior to surgical resection. Patients currently undergoing neoadjuvant therapy or who have already completed neoadjuvant therapy that were unable to undergo imaging at baseline and are now proceeding to resection will have one DCE MRI scan prior to surgical resection.\n\nARM IV (Healthy volunteers): Patients undergo a single DCE MRI examination."

(For patients that are eligible but there is a concern of metal in their bodies, the will be given the option if interested to have a x-ray completed prior to study enrollment to determine if they can proceed with the study MRI.
