The study will compare Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) to a delayed treatment group (DTG). PRT is a naturalistic behavioral intervention based on the principles of applied behavior analysis which has shown to be effective in treating the core deficits in children with ASD. The study will compare the combination of parent training with intensive center-based PRT (PRT-C) to a DTG and will include 44 children ages 2 to 3.11 years with ASD and social communication deficits."
