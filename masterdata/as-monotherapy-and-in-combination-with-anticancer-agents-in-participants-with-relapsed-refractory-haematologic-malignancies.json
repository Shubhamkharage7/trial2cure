The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy following oral administration of AZD3470 as a monotherapy, and in combination with other anticancer agents in participants with haematologic malignancies.\n\nThis study will follow a modular protocol design evaluating AZD3470 as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents. New cohorts (including further monotherapy expansion) and new modules for combination treatments may be added as protocol amendments in the future based on emerging supportive preclinical and/or clinical data.\n\nModule 1 Part A includes a dose escalation of AZD3470 monotherapy in participants with r/r haematologic malignancies, initially focused on r/r cHL. Dose escalation cohorts will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy in participants with r/r cHL.\n\nModule 1 Part B optimization/expansion cohorts may be opened at selected dose levels. These cohorts will further characterise the safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of AZD3470 to support dose optimization. Both adult and adolescent participants with r/r cHL will be eligible for this part of the study. Adolescent participants will only be enrolled once there is sufficient PK and safety data in adults. A preliminary effect of food on AZD3470 pharmacokinetics will be explored in this part of the study.\n\nThe protocol may be amended in the future to incorporate further expansion of cHL at the RP2D, additional monotherapy cohorts in other hematologic malignancies, and/or additional modules investigating AZD3470 in combination with other anticancer agents."
