Participants will wear 3 I3 CGM devices for up to 15 days and be instructed to continue their normal daily activities and manage their glucose as usual between in clinic FST per routine care. Participants will not have access to the I3 CGM data for the management of their blood glucose between clinic visits and will continue their usual care including CGM, if they are CGM users.\n\nAt the clinic FST visits venous blood samples will be drawn from an intravenous cannula for FST for up to 10 hours for plasma glucose determination. During the clinic visits the investigative site staff will determine the participants' insulin doses and meals and may induce both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of up to an hour duration."
