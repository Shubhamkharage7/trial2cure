            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the benefits of using the Incrediwear knee products after anterior cruciate ligament arthroscopic surgery or anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament (ACL+MCL) arthroscopic surgery, on the postoperative pain, range of motion and effusion. Participant population includes female or male patients in relative good health, 18 to 65 years old. The investigators will compare participants with Incrediwear and placebo Incrediwear products during the first 6-month postoperative period. The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n* Will the Incrediwear products help participants to decrease postoperative pain and swelling?\n* Will the Incrediwear products help the participants by increasing the range of motion in a shorter amount of time than the placebo group? Participants will be asked to maintain a journal documenting surgical site pain, pain medication type and quantity taken.\n\nResearcher will compare 90 participants enrolled in one of six groups, double blinded and randomly assigned, to see if the Incrediwear products assist in controlling postoperative swelling, and increase range of motion in a shorter amount of time.\n\n* ACL participants randomly assigned the Incrediwear product, placebo product, or none\n* ACL+MCL participants randomly assigned the Incrediwear product, placebo product, or none",
            "detailedDescription": "Researcher will identify patients of the Primary Investigator (PI) who are candidate for the study. Subjects must otherwise be in good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and applicable laboratory tests and receive medical clearance for the procedure by the PI.\n\nSubjects must be able to read and sign an informed consent form indicating understand the purpose of, and the procedures required for the study, and are willing to participate and comply with the study protocol.\n\nThis will be a prospective study to evaluate the benefit of the Incrediwear product after ACL repair or ACL+MCL repair via arthroscopic surgery. Subjects who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed on a subject-by-subject basis at the time of informed consent documentation.\n\nPreoperative and Post-Operative Measurements:\n\nSubjective: Participants rates surgical site pain, on a 0-10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scale.\n\nParticipants will record pain medication type and quantity taken in a daily pain diary.\n\nObjective: Surgical extremity range of motion, and surgical extremity knee effusion.\n\nMeasurements will be taken at; Preop appointment, Postop Day 0, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, Day 30 (1 month), Day 45, Day 60 (2 month), Day 100 (3 month), and Day 180 (6 month).\n\nAfter the surgery, the participant will be placed in the study provided Incrediwear Leg Sleeve from the ankle to the thigh and the Incrediwear sock. The Participant will wear the products at all times, for a minimum of 23 hours per day, for days 1 through 30.\n\nAt day 31, the participant will wear the leg sleeve at night, knee sleeve during the day, and is no longer required to wear the Incrediwear sock, until day 180.\n\nAt the 6 month postoperative appointment, the participant will turn in the patient journal."
