            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nAldesleukin is used to treat metastatic or advanced melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab is used to treat many cancers including melanoma. Researchers want to see if these drugs can be used together to produce better results in people with these types of cancer.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if the combination of pembrolizumab and aldesleukin can be used to treat metastatic or advanced melanoma and renal cell cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older who have metastatic or advanced melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Electrocardiogram\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Ability to perform tasks of daily living\n* Imaging scans (CT, MRI, PET, and/or X-rays). They may get a contrast agent to enhance the images.\n* Photographs, if needed\n\nSome of these tests will be repeated during the study.\n\nParticipants will receive the study drugs by IV (a plastic tube that is put into a vein) for 4 days. A second cycle of treatment will be given 21 days later. They will stay in the hospital for each of the cycles in the first course of treatment. After 2 months, their cancer will be evaluated. They may receive a second course of pembrolizumab alone on Days 1 and 21. They will not have to stay in the hospital for this course.\n\nAbout 30 days after treatment ends, participants will have a safety follow-up visit. Then they will have visits every 3 months for up to 1 year, and then every 6 months for up to 4 years. Follow-up can also be done by phone, email, and mail. If their cancer gets worse, they will stop having visits.\n\nParticipation will last for 5 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nHigh-dose interleukin-2 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, with overall response rates of 15-16%. Complete regression of disease was seen in 6-7% of participants with many long-term durable responses. The regimen has not been widely adopted due to complexities in management and the development of alternative effective therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints (ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or small molecule inhibitors.\n\nPembrolizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma based on a series of studies demonstrating objective response rates from 21-34%. There remains a considerable population of participants with disease that never responded to treatment, in addition to participants with short durations of response prior to recurrence.\n\nThere has been limited clinical investigation of the combination of interleukin-2 and pembrolizumab. The hypothesis under investigation is that non-specific activation of the immune system with both positive stimulation (aldesleukin) and release of negative regulation (pembrolizumab) may have meaningful clinical impact for participants with limited therapeutic options.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary:\n\nTo determine the objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria to combined aldesleukin and pembrolizumab in participants with advanced melanoma refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy and treatment-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma\n\nSecondary:\n\nTo determine progression free survival with the combined regimen\n\nTo determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen\n\nTo determine the objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria to combined aldesleukin and pembrolizumab in participants with treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve advanced melanoma\n\nExploratory:\n\nTo evaluate clinical and laboratory correlates of response\n\nTo perform immunologic correlative studies of peripheral blood, tumor, and/or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes including but not limited to phenotype and functional analysis of longitudinal samples\n\nEligibility:\n\nParticipants must be/have:\n\nAge \\>= 18 years of age.\n\nECOG performance status of 0 or 1.\n\nExpected survival of greater than 6 months.\n\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma or renal cell cancer, as follows:\n\nCohort 1: Metastatic melanoma or advanced locoregional melanoma not amenable to curative surgical resection and refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nCohort 2: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (clear cell histology) refractory to at least one line of PD1/PDL1 based therapy.\n\nCohort 3: Metastatic or advanced locoregional melanoma not amenable to curative surgical resection na(SqrRoot) ve to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nNo allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin or pembrolizumab administration.\n\nNo concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency.\n\nNo history of Grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events affecting major organ systems associated with the administration of single agent pembrolizumab or nivolumab.\n\nDesign:\n\nStudy treatment will be given in two courses. A course shall consist of two cycles (each 21 days) of treatment. Cycles in Course 1 shall consist of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) infusion on the morning of Day 1 with aldesleukin (IL-2) administration (600,000 IU/kg intravenous bolus every eight hours) to begin later that day. IL-2 will be administered to tolerance or to a maximum of 10 doses.\n\nA second cycle of treatment will begin during Week 4 (Day 22-28).\n\nApproximately two months from the beginning of therapy, participants will be evaluated for response including physical exam, clinical laboratory testing, and cross-sectional imaging.\n\nParticipants that do not demonstrate progressive disease will receive a second course of pembrolizumab alone, if clinically appropriate.\n\nParticipants with stable disease will be monitored until disease progression (every 3 months x 3) up to one year.\n\nParticipants with an objective response will be monitored until disease progression (every 3 months x 3, every 6 months x 8) up to five years."
