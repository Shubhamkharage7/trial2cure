The registry facilitates our understanding of the clinical features, pathobiology, genetics of Scleroderma. This will ultimately lead to a potential treatment for this currently untreatable condition.",
            "detailedDescription": "What will be asked of you:\n\n* Completion of 2 health questionnaires\n* Donation of research bloods. This is optional, but encouraged (if possible).\n* We also encourage patients who come for initial visits to return so follow-up data can be collected.\n\nBenefits to Patients:\n\n* The HSS Scleroderma Registry gives patients the opportunity to participate in observational research with the goal of improving the lives of patients in the future.\n* By donating research bloods and providing clinical information, patients will help generate new knowledge about Scleroderma that can guide the treatment and care of patients afflicted with this rare disease.\n* Patients will also receive a comprehensive, medical evaluation from an HSS physician who specializes in treating Scleroderma. He or she will provide guidance on treatment options and recommendations for current or upcoming clinical trials.\n* Physicians will also make patients aware of the resources available to them, including support groups and educational programs."
