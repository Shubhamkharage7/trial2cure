An adjuvant is an ingredient used with some vaccines that may help people make an immune response. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\nAbout 42 people will take part in the HVTN 309 clinical trial. This clinical trial will take place at multiple sites in the US and South Africa and the clinical trial is divided into 3 parts: Part A, Part B and Part C. About 3 people will participate in Part A of this study. After results from Part A are reviewed, it will be determined whether or not Part B and Part C of the clinical trial will proceed."

Assessed by clinical staff as having a low likelihood of acquiring HIV per guidelines and agrees to discuss their potential for HIV acquisition, agrees to risk-reduction counseling, and agrees to avoid behaviors associated with a higher likelihood of acquiring HIV through the final study visit. Low likelihood may include persons stably taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n8.

WBC count = 2,500 to 12,000/mm3 (WBC over 12,000/mm3 is not exclusionary if further evaluation shows general good health and if PSRT approval is granted).\n10.

Systolic blood pressure of 90 to \\<140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 50 to \\<90 mmHg at screening visit. The average blood pressure between the screening visit and the enrollment visit must be below 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic. A single measurement greater than or equal to 160 systolic mmHg or 100 mmHg diastolic during the current study evaluation is exclusionary.\n15.

AFAB volunteers or volunteers who were intersex at birth must agree to not seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as oocyte retrieval, artificial insemination, or in vitro fertilization from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through 8 weeks after their last scheduled vaccination timepoint.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Volunteer who is breastfeeding or pregnant.\n2. Body mass index (BMI) \u2265 40. Enrollment of individuals with BMI \u2265 40, whom the site investigator assesses are in good health, may be considered by PSRT approval.\n3. Diabetes mellitus (DM). Type 2 DM controlled with diet alone (and confirmed by HgbA1c \u2264 8% within the last 6 months) or a history of isolated gestational diabetes are not exclusionary. Enrollment of individuals with Type 2 DM that is well controlled on hypoglycemic agent(s) may be considered by the PSRT on a case-by-case basis, provided that the HgbA1c is \u2264 8% within the last 6 months (sites may draw these at screening).\n4. Previous or current recipient of an investigational HIV vaccine (previous placebo/ control recipients are not excluded).\n5. Receipt of non-HIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 1 year. Exceptions include vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure or Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA or World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL), or if outside the US, by the national regulatory authority (RA) authorizing this clinical trial.\n6. Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, including systemic medication use likely to impair immune response to vaccine in the opinion of the site investigator, such as glucocorticoid use, equal to or greater than prednisone 10 mg/day within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n7. Blood products or immunoglobulin within 16 weeks prior to enrollment; receipt of immunoglobulin within 16 weeks prior to enrollment requires PSRT approval.\n8. History of myocarditis and/or pericarditis.\n9. Receipt of any vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n10. Initiation of Ag-based immunotherapy for allergies within the previous year (stable immunotherapy is not exclusionary); inclusion of participants who initiated immunotherapy within the previous year requires PSRT approval.\n11. Receipt of investigational research agents with a half-life of 7 or fewer days within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. If a potential participant has received investigational agents with a half-life of greater than 7 days (or unknown half-life) within the past year, PSRT approval is required for enrollment.\n12. History of serious reaction (eg, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis) to any related vaccine or component of the study-vaccine regimen. Of note, the study proposed vaccine regimen includes components similar to components of the licensed COMIRNATY (Pfizer) and SPIKEVAX (Moderna) mRNA vaccines; severe reaction to these vaccines is therefore exclusionary.\n13. Hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic forms of angioedema.\n14. Idiopathic urticaria within the past year.\n15. Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a clinician which would make study procedures a contraindication.\n16. Seizure disorder; febrile seizures as a child or seizures secondary to alcohol withdrawal more than 5 years ago are not exclusionary.\n17. Asplenia or functional asplenia.\n18.

Asthma is excluded if the participant has ANY of the following:\n\n    * Required either oral or parenteral corticosteroids for an exacerbation 2 or more times within the past year; OR\n    * Needed emergency care, urgent care, hospitalization, or intubation for an acute asthma exacerbation within the past year (eg, would NOT exclude individuals with asthma who meet all other criteria but sought urgent/emergent care solely for asthma medication refills or coexisting conditions unrelated to asthma); OR\n    * Uses a short-acting rescue inhaler more than 2 days/week for acute asthma symptoms (ie, not for preventive treatment prior to athletic activity); OR\n    * Uses medium- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (greater than 250 mcg fluticasone or therapeutic equivalent per day), whether in single-therapy or dual-therapy inhalers (ie, with a long-acting beta agonist \\[LABA\\]); OR\n    * Uses more than 1 medication for maintenance therapy daily. Inclusion of anyone on a stable dose of more than 1 medication for maintenance therapy daily for greater than 2 years requires PSRT approval.\n21. A participant with a history of a potential immune-mediated medical condition (PIMMC), either active or remote. Not exclusionary: 1) Remote history of Bell's palsy (\\> 2 years ago) not associated with other neurologic symptoms and 2) Mild psoriasis or other mild, uncomplicated, localized or dermatologic condition that does not require ongoing systemic treatment.\n22.
