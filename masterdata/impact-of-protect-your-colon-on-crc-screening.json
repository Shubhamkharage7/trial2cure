The Investigators hypothesize that Protect Your Colon\u2122, through optimizing shared decision making, will lead to selection of a test that accurately matches patients' values and increase CRC screening uptake. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess if provision of Protect Your Colon\u2122 improves communication on CRC screening, intent to complete screening, and ultimately uptake of screening vs. usual care."

Afterwards, the app will generate a personalized report that rank orders the importance of each test attribute (e.g., accuracy, invasiveness, test frequency) in patients' decision making and identifies the screening modality that best matches their preferences.
