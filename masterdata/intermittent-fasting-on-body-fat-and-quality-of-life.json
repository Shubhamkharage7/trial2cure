For the next four weeks, participants will do the intermittent fasting program. This program has participants fasting 16 hours from their last meal of the previous evening's meal to the first meal of their next day. Then for 8 hours, participants are able to eat. During the fasting, participants are allowed to consume water and black coffee/tea. Participants will also keep their normal weekly exercise routine.\n\nEnd of study: Body Fat Analysis, Questionnaires on quality of life, sleep, and stress."
