            "briefSummary": "Mobile food markets have been proposed as a strategy for mitigating health disparities related to poor nutrition and diet/weight-related health conditions because they bring low-cost, healthy food directly to underserved populations. Full-service mobile markets may improve multiple aspects of the diet by providing foods to meet all dietary needs through a convenient one-stop shop. The full-service mobile market to be tested (Twin Cities Mobile Market) sells nutritious and staple foods from a bus that regularly visits low-income neighborhoods. Foods are sold at prices \\~10% below those of grocery stores. SNAP/EBT is accepted, and a state-funded fruit/vegetable incentive program (Market Bucks) is available to shoppers. Working in partnership with our community team members, we will enroll 12 total sites and recruit 22 participants per site (N=264). We will collect baseline data and randomize sites to either receive the full-service mobile market intervention or serve as the waitlist control. We will then implement the full-service mobile market at intervention sites, follow participants for 6 months, and collect follow-up data. After follow-up data collection, waitlist control sites will receive the full-service mobile market intervention. Diet quality will be assessed through dietary recall interviews, food insecurity will be assessed by survey, and fruit and vegetable purchases will be measured by collecting one month of food purchase tracking forms at baseline and follow-up data collection. Analyses will determine whether the full-service mobile market changes diet quality, food security, and food purchasing outcomes."

After randomization, the study statistician will be unblinded to site names by being given the key that matches sites with their assigned numbers. The study statistician will use this key to inform the mobile market co-investigator of site allocation to allow time for the mobile market to plan for market routes and schedules while baseline data collection is ongoing. Participants, site locations, the PI, university non-statistician trial investigators, and research staff will be blinded to site randomization results until baseline data collection is complete. Only the project manager and study statistician will be aware of the key (the link between the site names and the assigned site numbers linked to the data to be used in analysis) until analysis is complete."
