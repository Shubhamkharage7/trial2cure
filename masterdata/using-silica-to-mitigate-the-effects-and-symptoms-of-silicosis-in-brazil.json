            "briefSummary": "This clinical study aims to address a research and clinical treatment gap related to individuals with symptoms of Silicosis resulting from quartzite mining work. Silicosis represents a challenge in this specific population in Sao Thome das Letras, Minas Gerais. Silicosis is a severe disease and is considered incurable. Current conventional medicine only offers palliative care for those with Silicosis, highlighting the important and urgent need for research into complementary care approaches.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study design is a simple clinical trial to assess the effect of the homeopathic medication Silica 12CH given alongside the conventional treatment of Silicosis, versus standard treatment alone for Silicosis.\n\nThe study design is a controlled non-blinded clinical study without randomization to test the effectiveness of a homeopathic intervention among individuals with symptoms of Silicosis as a result of working as quartzite miners. The intervention to be studied is a homeopathic preparation of Silica 12CH on a sample of clients with Silicosis already receiving ongoing conventional medical care. The intervention is Silica 12CH given over one year: a single dose at intervals of three months (three times in the study period).\n\nParticipants will be recruited locally through the clinic where they already receive ongoing medical attention. The local secretary of health authorizes the release of the patient files. Potential participants will be given printed information about the study details along with information about how to participate and the associated deadlines for joining the study. Interested individuals will be given the informed consent form.\n\nParticipants will freely elect to be in either the control or intervention group. Individuals in the control group follow the standard-care protocol without the homeopathic intervention. Individuals in the experimental group will receive the homeopathic intervention while also following the standard-care protocol. All individuals will be encouraged to continue with any concurrent conventional medical treatment for their Silicosis-related symptoms. Individuals in either group may freely leave the study at any time with no consequence. Additionally, participants may freely elect to be moved from the control group into the experimental group at the half-way point in the study."
