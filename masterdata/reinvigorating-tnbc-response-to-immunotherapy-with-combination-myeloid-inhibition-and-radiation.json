The primary objective is to assess the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate where pCR is defined as the absence of invasive disease in the breast and lymph nodes at the time of standard of care (SOC) treatment. Secondary objectives include evaluating the change in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), safety and tolerability of the combination, progression-free survival, event-free survival, overall survival, and node clearance."

Note: Subjects with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required treatment in the last 5 years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain parenchymal metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has known history of/active, non-infectious pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or has history of/active interstitial lung disease.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to start of study treatment (first dose of pembrolizumab). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: Negative urine or serum pregnancy test is also conducted within 72 hours prior to C1D1 for study procedures but if screening pregnancy test is done within 72 hours of C1D1, it is not required to be repeated..\n* Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).\n* Has a known history of active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or known active Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n* Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days of planned start of pembrolizumab. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.",
