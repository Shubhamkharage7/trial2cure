Study activities will include neuroimaging (MRI and fMRI), behavioral tasks, sensory testing, blood draws, and questionnaires. The neuroimaging data will be analyzed using specialized software; data from questionnaires, sensory testing, and behavioral task performance will be analyzed using standard statistical software. Risks and safety concerns include standard, minimal risks associated with MRI scans, sensory testing, blood draws, and confidentiality."
