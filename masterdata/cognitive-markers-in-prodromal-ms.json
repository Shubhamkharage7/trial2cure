The representative timed RT scores are provided by the Detection task (indicating when a card is revealed; DET/simple RT), Identification task (\"is the card revealed black or red?\"; IDN/choice RT), and One-Back (\"Is this the card that you just saw?\"). Performance is characterized by near complete accuracy (i.e. all, or almost all, items are answered correctly), and validity checks are built into the scoring. IIV is calculated as intraindividual standardized deviations (ISD) in RTs across both tasks, measured in milliseconds and with log10 transformation.",
