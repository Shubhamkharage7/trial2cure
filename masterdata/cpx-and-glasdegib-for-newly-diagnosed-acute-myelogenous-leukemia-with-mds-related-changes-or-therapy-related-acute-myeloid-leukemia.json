A woman of child-bearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n     1. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n     2.

Women of child-bearing potential has negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of initiating study drug dosing\n  3. Male subjects must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy\n* Leukapheresis, corticosteroid and hydroxyurea are permitted as initial management of hyperleukocytosis at the investigator's discretion for up to 7 days after starting study therapy. Hyperleukocytosis is defined as greater than 30k WBC. When possible, a bone marrow biopsy for screening should be performed prior to the initiation hyperleukocytosis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior treatment with Glasdegib or CPX-351\n* Previously treated AML except for initial management of hyperleukocytosis. Treatment with hypomethylating therapy for MDS is allowable but not since their diagnosis of AML. No prior treatment with cytarabine or daunorubicin are allowed\n* Concurrent FLT3 mutation that the treating physician deems necessary to treat with midostaurin, whereas patients with FLT3-mutated AML not treated with midostaurin can be enrolled. Patients with known Core Binding Factor -t(8;21), inv(16), t(16;16) are allowed for study participation at the treating investigator's discretion\n* Active CNS or testicular involvement by leukemia; diagnostic lumbar puncture is not required\n* History of neurologic disorder including but not limited to: prior seizure, epilepsy, structural brain abnormality, benign brain tumor, stroke, brain injuries, dementia, movement disorder or other significant CNS abnormalities\n* Baseline QT corrected interval based on Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval \\> 450 ms\n* Acute coronary syndrome in the past 12 months, NYHA class III or VI\n* Known history of Wilson's disease or other copper handling disorder\n* History of GI malabsorptive disease\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
