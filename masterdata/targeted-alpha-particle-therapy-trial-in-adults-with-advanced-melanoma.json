            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multi-center open-label dose escalation, dose expansion study of \\[212Pb\\]VMT01 in up to 52 subjects with histologically confirmed melanoma and a positive MC1R imaging scan (\\[203Pb\\]VMT01 or \\[68Ga\\]VMT02).\n\nMC1R is a receptor that is expressed on the surface of melanoma cells. As such MC1R represents a potentially useful means of targeting therapeutics to melanoma. Lead-212 (\\[212Pb\\]-) based peptide-radiopharmaceuticals are an emerging class of targeted alpha-particle cancer therapies which have the potential to improve delivery of a highly effective form of radiation.\n\nPatients may be eligible to receive up to 3 administrations of \\[212Pb\\]VMT01 approximately 8 weeks apart.\n\nThe first part of the study is an dose-escalation study to determine the Maximum Tolerated radioactivity Dose (MTD) or Maximum Feasible radioactivity Dose (MFD) following a single administration of \\[212Pb\\]VMT01.\n\nThe second part of the study is a dose expansion based on the identified MTD/MFD for the selection of \\[212Pb\\]VMT01 dose(s) for further clinical development.\n\nA dosimetry sub-study utilizing the SPECT imaging surrogate, \\[203Pb\\]VMT01, has been incorporated into the study in order to assess normal organ biodistribution, tumor uptake of the investigational products, to estimate radiation dosimetry, and to correlate uptake of the investigation products with observed toxicities and efficacy."
