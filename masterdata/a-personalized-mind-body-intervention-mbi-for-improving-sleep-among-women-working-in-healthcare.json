A total of 60 eligible participants will be randomized to one of two possible orders of treatment exposure comprised of three components: mindfulness, yoga, and guided walking, each assigned in 2-week block sequences for a total period of 12 weeks. The study will include a 2-week baseline period during which their baseline sleep duration and adherence to the Fitbit wear and survey submission will be assessed. Following the 2-week run-in period, participants deemed eligible and achieved at least 80% adherence of Fitbit wear and survey submission will be randomized to one of the two intervention arms. Exploratory aims include assessments of sleep quality, physiological factors and their direct and indirect relationships with participants' perceived stress, anxiety, and depression.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this pilot study is to determine if a personalized trial (N-of-1) employing a Mind-Body Intervention (MBI) can produce a meaningful increase in sleep duration among women 40-60 years of age working at Northwell Health. A total of 60 women with a history of short sleep duration (defined as an average \\<7h per 24-h period for at least three months) will be enrolled over a period of two years. Participants will complete a 2-week run-in period with no intervention, during which their baseline sleep duration and adherence to the Fitbit wear and survey submission will be assessed. Adherence to Fitbit wear will be defined as recorded activity of greater than 12 hours a day, and recorded sleeping activity greater than 180 minutes in total. Survey adherence will be defined as submission of a given survey. Participants who achieve at least 80% adherence of Fitbit wear and survey submission during baseline period will be randomized to Arm 1 (N=30) or Arm 2 (N=30). Each arm will receive a personalized intervention comprised of three components: mindfulness, yoga and guided walking assigned in 2-week block sequences for a total period of 12 weeks. During each 2-week block, participants will be prompted to complete 3 x 30-minute intervention sessions weekly. Interventions will be delivered by a virtual link to online videos recorded by an experienced wellness provider. Participants will be limited to three views of the study-provided intervention content each week. Changes in average daily sleep duration will be calculated for each participant based on daily measurements between the run-in and each treatment period. The Fitbit devices will also record sleep quality components (sleep onset, sleep staging, and overall sleep score) and physiological factors (breathing/resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and activity). We will also examine the direct and indirect relationships between perceived stress, anxiety and depression, and sleep quality assessed pre, during (bi-weekly), and post MBI. Enrollment will continue until up to 60 participants have been randomized. Following the intervention, all participants will be assessed over a 2-week follow-up period to allow for a personalized report of their observed data to be generated."
