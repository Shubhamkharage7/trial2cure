Patient-reported data will include prior usage of Mucinex\u00ae, treatment compliance, treatment satisfaction, and symptoms.\n\nDuring this same period of time, HCPs will report treatment satisfaction via electronic case report forms (eCRFs), and will also have the ability to spontaneously report any treatment-emergent adverse events."
