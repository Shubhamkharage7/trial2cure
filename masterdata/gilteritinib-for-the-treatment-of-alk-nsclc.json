While there are many approved targeted drugs for ALK NSCLC, resistance to these drugs frequently occur. Giltertinib is a drug that is already FDA approved for the treatment of a specific type of leukemia. However, studies using ALK positive lung cancer cells demonstrate activity of gilteritinib against these resistant cells. Therefore, in this clinical trial, the investigators plan to study the effect of giltertinib in patients with ALK NSCLC."
