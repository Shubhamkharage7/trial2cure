Assessments performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.\n\nAll screening procedures must be performed within 30 days prior to registration into the study unless otherwise stated. The screening procedures include:\n\nInformed Consent Medical history--Complete medical and surgical history Demographics--Age, gender, race, ethnicity Review subject eligibility criteria Review previous and concomitant medications Physical exam including vital signs, height and weight Vital signs (temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure), height, weight Performance status--Performance status evaluated prior to study entry. If there is any variability in the physicians' notes, the higher number will be used for research purposes.\n\nPositron emission tomography-computerized tomography or computerized tomography of neck (any time prior to registration) Laryngoscopy Pregnancy test (for females of child-bearing potential) Quality of life Questionnaires and Symptom Questionnaires --EORTC QLQ-C30, H\\&N 35, VHI, and EQ-5D. These forms will be referred to collectively as QoL Questionnaires. Can be given on paper, over the phone, or in EPIC as needed.\n\nProcedures During Treatment Day 1-First fraction of radiotherapy per standard, departmental stereotactic protocol\n\nFollow-up Procedures--After initial follow-up at 2 weeks (+/- 7 days) after completion of radiation therapy, subjects will be followed at 3 months and 12 months. These protocol mandated procedures will occur at each follow-up:\n\nInterim history Physical exam, vital signs, ECOG Performance Status Laryngoscopy (optional at 1-2 weeks) to assess tumor response and toxicity Quality of life and voice quality assessment. Can be given on paper, over the phone, or in EPIC as needed."
