To develop this repository, additional samples will be collected from children and adults who have been diagnosed with common childhood cancers such as leukemia and tumors of the central nervous system.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To collect and store blood, serum, tissue, urine, or tumor samples of children who have cancer or adults who have common childhood cancers.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Individuals who have been diagnosed with a common childhood cancer (e.g., leukemia) regardless of patient age.\n* Children, adolescents, and adults who have been diagnosed with a type of cancer more commonly found in adults.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Extra blood, serum (the liquid part of blood), tissue, urine, or tumor samples will be collected from participants at a time when sampling is required for medical care or as part of a research study.\n* No additional procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of obtaining additional tumor tissue, aside from what is required for clinical care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n-Laboratory-based investigations have contributed to an improved understanding of the biology of cancer and to the development of new therapies for pediatric malignancies.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-Systematic Molecular, Genomic, Proteomic, Metabolomic ( Omic ) and other profiling for enrolled subjects.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPediatric or Adult subjects of any age with one of the following:\n\n* Diagnosis of any tumor or malignancy, pre-malignant disorder or suspected cancer susceptibility familial syndromes, regardless of age\n* Individuals without malignancy undergoing surgery, other treatment or normal well visit.\n* Biological relatives of a subject with a pediatric tumor or malignancy or with suspected familial cancer syndrome.\n* Patients enrolled in an approved companion protocol\n* Blood and/or tissue specimens that have been previously collected and are available for research analysis\n* Biospecimens can be collected with minimal additional risk to the subject during sampling or procedures required for routine patient care.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This study will allow for the collection of specimens for a Tissue Repository, and for designated sample investigations including systematic molecular, genomic and proteomic (Omic) profiling, and growth factor and cellular profile investigations.\n* Testing activities may include:\n\n  * DNA, RNA and protein will be extracted from a section of tumor samples, the remainder will be stored.\n  * Germ line DNA and RNA will be extracted from lymphocytes or other normal uninvolved tissue\n  * Germ line DNA will be extracted from lymphocytes or other normal uninvolved tissue of the biological relatives of the subject.\n  * Xenografts, explant and cell lines established from tumor, pre-malignant and normal samples\n  * Tumor samples and samples for circulating tumor cells sent for the establishment of Xenografts and single cell suspension of tumor for drug testing\n  * Omics (Genomics and Proteomic) studies will be performed\n  * Growth factor and cellular profile investigations of bone marrow-derived cell populations to include quantification of hematopietic progenitor cells (HPCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), levels of matrix metalloprotease 2 and 9 (MMP2) and (MMP9), gene expression, growth factor and microvesicle analysis and bone marrow analysis of progenitor cells in blood and tissue.\n  * Research tests described in active IRB approved protocols\n  * Immune profiling and stromal profiling of blood, tumor, and normal tissues\n  * Immune function studies from blood and normal tumor tissues\n* Utilizing an oversight committee to oversee the receipt and the distribution of unlinked tissues to other investigators.\n* Qualitative methodologies will be used to ascertain knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in 25-35 parents/caregivers at NIH concerning the anticipated use of NGS for diagnosing and directing therapy for pediatric cancer and how incidental findings might be returned.\n* Expected accrual 100-150 patients per year."
