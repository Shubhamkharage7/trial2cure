An RCT assesses the efficacy of the LifeSkills Mobile intervention in comparison to a standard of care (SOC) condition among 5,000 YTW recruited online. At baseline and every 6 months through 12-48 months (depending on when the participant enrolled), enrolled participants will complete an online survey sent via a link to their mobile phone and will be mailed an OraQuick In-Home HIV Test kit. We will also estimate the total and incremental costs of the LifeSkills Mobile intervention relative to SOC, from healthcare sector and societal perspectives."
