This study will begin with a safety assessment in the first 10 subjects (part 1: Safety Lead-in). If the combination is deemed safe, the trial will proceed to the Phase II stage. The purpose of this study is to compare progression free survival (PFS) between patients receiving apalutamide and apalutamide + carotuximab using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3. The secondary objectives are to describe adverse events related to the intervention, overall response rate (ORR), proportion of patients resistant to apalutamide that benefit from the addition of carotuximab, and to determine the ORR, radiographic PFS, and biochemical PFS in the overall population."
