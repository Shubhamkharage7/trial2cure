Immunizations are a minimally invasive and cost-effective was to reduce these infections. Despite the importance of pre-transplant vaccination, the majority of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients are not up-to-date on age-appropriate immunizations at the time of transplant. The goal of this study is to pilot a novel health information technology immunization tool to improve immunization rates in pediatric solid organ transplant candidates.",
            "detailedDescription": "Triads of parents, primary care physicians, and transplant sub-specialists will be enrolled to use a pre-transplant immunization tool while their child awaits transplant. The tool will provide information about vaccines, information about vaccine-preventable infections in the transplant population, a central easily accessible vaccine record, and a communication portal. The tool will also send vaccine reminders when vaccinations are due. The investigators will assess 1) the effectiveness of the tool in improving pre-transplant immunization rates, 2) the acceptability of the tool to users and 3) the feasibility of the tool."
