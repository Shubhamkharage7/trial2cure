            "briefSummary": "The current investigation consists of the implementation and modest refinements of a culturally adapted version of the evidence-based PT intervention known as GenerationPMTO.\u00a9 The adapted intervention, CAPAS-Youth, is primarily delivered to parents. The primary research objectives are twofold: a) to conduct refinements of the CAPAS-Youth intervention for Hispanic immigrants in mid-Texas, and b) to measure implementation barriers and precursors, as well as implementation outcomes, in an effort to inform a future study focused on scaling the intervention. A special focus on faith-based organization informs the intervention, as a way of increasing reach with underserved Hispanic immigrant communities.",
            "detailedDescription": "Parent training (PT) interventions constitute the gold standard for strengthening parenting practices that are effective protective factors in the lives of adolescents. However, the availability of efficacious culturally adapted PT interventions in underserved Hispanic communities remains scarce throughout the US. Thus, there is an urgent need in the implementation science (IS) field to identify implementation strategies aimed at addressing service gaps affecting Hispanic populations. The current investigation consists of the implementation and modest refinements of a culturally adapted version of the evidence-based PT intervention known as GenerationPMTO.\u00a9 Our rationale is that implementing efficacious prevention interventions in faith-based organizations constitutes a key alternative to address service barriers experienced by underserved populations. We also propose that by training lay members of target communities as prevention interventionists, the sustainment of prevention programs can be significantly enhanced. The research aims of this R34 investigation are: (a) To implement a pilot study aimed at refining the CAPAS-Youth curriculum and study procedures, (b) to implement a randomized controlled trial, aimed at empirically testing the efficacy of the CAPAS-Youth intervention with first-generation low-income Hispanic families in Travis County, (c) to measure barriers and facilitators associated with the implementation of the CAPAS-Youth prevention intervention in the target context, and (d) to measure relevant implementation outcomes to inform a future R01 effectiveness trial. The investigation has high public health relevance as it addresses health disparities experienced by populations not adequately served by existing systems of care."
