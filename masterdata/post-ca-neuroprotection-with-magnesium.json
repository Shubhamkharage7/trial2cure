The primary aims are to assess the feasibility and safety of administering magnesium and measure serum markers of neuronal injury at prespecified time points in the post-cardiac arrest period. Because this is a pilot study with a limited sample size, the primary objective is to evaluate the precision and stability of the collected measures to inform the design and formal analysis in a larger trial."
