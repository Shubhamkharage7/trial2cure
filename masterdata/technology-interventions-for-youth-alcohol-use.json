Depending on their study condition, youth will receive a brief web-based computer program or the web program + 8 weeks of supportive text messages. Parents/caregivers of youth are encouraged to use a freely available app to guide conversations with their child about drinking. This study will have significant impact by evaluating response to these scalable interventions which can be deployed widely in clinical care settings."
