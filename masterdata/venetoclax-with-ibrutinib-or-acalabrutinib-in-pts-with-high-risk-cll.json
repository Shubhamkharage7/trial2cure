            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective:\n\n1. To estimate the therapeutic efficacy of venetoclax consolidation in patients who have detectable CLL after receiving ibrutinib or acalabrutinib for at least 12 months and who have high risk CLL. High risk is defined as the presence of at least one of: del(17p); TP53 mutation; complex metaphase karyotype; patients who have developed mutations in BTK and/or PLCG2, will be eligible if they have no clinical or laboratory evidence of progressive disease. The primary endpoint will be the rate of MRD-negativity in the bone marrow, using an assay method with at least 0.01% sensitivity after 12 cycles of combination therapy. One cycle is 4 weeks of treatment.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. Determine CR/CRi rate after 6, 12 18 and 24 cycles of combination therapy, in patients who were not in CR/Cri at study initiation and estimate the time to best response with this combination.\n2. Determine the cumulative rate of bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD)-free complete responders by an assay method with at least 0.01% sensitivity and median time to MRD-negativity.\n3. Determine the safety of combined ibrutinib and venetoclax.\n4. Determine the progression-free and overall survival.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax.\n\nPatients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) and ibrutinib PO QD and acalabrutinib PO BID. Treatment repeat every 4 weeks for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months."

Major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, experimental therapy within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drug.\n4.

Known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n8. Active hepatitis B infection (defined as the presence of detectable HBV DNA or HBe antigen). Patients who are HBsAg positive or HBcAb positive are eligible, provided HBV DNA is negative. These patients will have monthly monitoring of HBV DNA for the duration of the study, if clinically indicated. Please note that patients who have received IVIG may have false positive HBcAb results. In such patients, if HBV DNA and HBsAg are negative, serial HBV DNA monitoring is not necessary.\n9. Active hepatitis C, defined by the detection of hepatitis C RNA in plasma by PCR.\n10.
