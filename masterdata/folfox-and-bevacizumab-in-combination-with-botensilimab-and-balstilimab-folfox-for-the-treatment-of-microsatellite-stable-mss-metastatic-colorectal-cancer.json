            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, best dose, and efficacy of FOLFOX and bevacizumab in combination with botensilimab and balstilimab (3B-FOLFOX) in treating patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as FOLFOX, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Balstilimab and botensilimab are in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to proteins, called PD-L1 and CTLA-4, which is found on some types of tumor cells. These PD-1 and CTLA-4 proteins are known to affect the body's defense mechanism to identify and fight against tumor cells. The combination of these drugs may lead to improved disease control and outcomes in patients with MSS metastatic colorectal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) bevacizumab, balstilimab and botensilimab at each dose level in order to inform the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). (Phase I) II. To assess the overall response rate of FOLFOX bevacizumab, balstilimab at 240 mg and botensilimab at 25 mg and 75 mg (depending on dose level). (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the overall response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of FOLFOX bevacizumab, balstilimab at 240 mg and botensilimab at 25 mg and 75 mg (depending on dose level). (Phase I) II. To estimate the median PFS and median OS associated with FOLFOX bevacizumab, balstilimab at 240 mg and botensilimab at 25 mg and 75 mg botensilimab (depending on dose level). (Phase II) III. To estimate the duration of response associated with FOLFOX bevacizumab, balstilimab at 240 mg and botensilimab at 25 mg botensilimab and 75 mg (depending on dose level). (Phase II) IV. To evaluate the safety/feasibility of FOLFOX bevacizumab, botensilimab, and balstilimab, through the assessment of adverse events. (Phase II) V. To describe the rate of secondary resection in all arms of treatment and summarize their outcome in terms of disease relapse post-surgery. (Phase II)\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate potential circulating biomarkers of response, resistance, activity, and toxicity.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of botensilimab followed by a randomized phase II study.\n\nPHASE I: Patients receive FOLFOX, bevacizumab, balstilimab, and botensilimab intravenously (IV) on study. Patients undergo an x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial. Patients also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nPHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive FOLFOX, bevacizumab and balstilimab IV with botensilimab IV at a lower dose on study. Patients undergo an x-ray, CT scan, PET scan, and/or MRI throughout the trial. Patients also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive FOLFOX, bevacizumab and balstilimab IV with botensilimab IV at a higher dose on study. Patients undergo an x-ray, CT scan, PET scan, and/or MRI throughout the trial. Patients also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study."
