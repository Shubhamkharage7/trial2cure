            "briefSummary": "Over 1,900 mutations in the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein are implicated in causing Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Potential therapies that directly target defective CFTR are being evaluated in important clinical trials, but most target the most common CFTR mutation F508del. Many patients with rare CF mutations are not able to participate in those studies. The RARE study is specifically designed for people with CF caused by rare mutations. Eligible rare mutations are listed below:\n\n\u2022 CF patients who are heterozygous for pre-mature stop codons as noted below: i. one allele must be a F508del ii. the other allele must be a pre-mature stop codon mutation\n\n\u2022 CF Patients with other genotypes that require Study PI permission: i. CF patients with two mutations that are not eligible for Trikafta ii. CF patients homozygous or heterozygous (other allele must be F508del) for rare mutations of special interest (e.g., 711+3A-\\>G, 2789+5G-\\>A, 3272-26A-\\>G, 3849+10kbC-\\>T). Other rare mutations will be considered on a case by case basis\n\nThis is a multi-site, specimen collection study. Investigators will collect blood, intestinal cells and nasal cells from each participant. Cells from these specimens will be used to test future CFTR modulators to see if they might work for people with study eligible rare mutations. Having cells to test in the lab is an important first step in identifying potential new therapies for people with these mutations.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-site, specimen collection study for people with Cystic Fibrosis who have rare mutations. This study is non-interventional so there is no study drug or investigational treatment involved.\n\n* Once a potentially eligible participant is identified (either self-identified or by their CF care center), and the person has expressed interest in participating in the study, the participant will be referred to a participating study site to receive additional information about the study and about travel arrangements (if needed).\n* The eligibility criteria are broad and inclusive: Often studies have restrictions around lung function that limit who can participate. The only real restriction for this study rare mutations as defined on the RARE study eligible mutations list.\n* Blood, intestinal cells, nasal cells will be collected from all participants.\n* Participants will be compensated for the time of the visit and travel expenses will be pre-paid by the study. The study site research coordinator can provide more detail on how much participants will be paid.\n* This study is being conducted at six regional sites. Participants may travel to any of the regional study sites to participate, but the participant will need to talk with the research coordinator at the site of their choice to get all of the study details before making a decision to participate. The study site research coordinator will put participants in contact with the travel agency to arrange and pre-pay for travel (including hotel, airline/train arrangements as needed).\n\nVisit Schedule:\n\nTwo day study visit"
