            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see the impact of a modified Spencer's technique on tissue stiffness, mobility, and blood flow of the shoulder joint. Spencer's technique is a well-known osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) that is common for treating adhesive capsulitis and is believed to help blood flow. There are studies that look at the clinical effects of the technique and/or compare it to other techniques; however, measuring the extent to which Spencer's technique, or this modified technique, improves tissue stiffness and blood flow has never been written in the literature. This study will serve as a proof of concept that this technique improves tissue stiffness, blood flow, and mobility of the shoulder join as well as the nearby areas. Using ultrasound, the investigators will measure tissue stiffness and blood flow and will analyze the mobility of the shoulder joint using a Vicon motion capture system."

It is a series of direct OMT addressing the barrier of somatic dysfunction (SD) with the goal of restoring neurovascular balance and improved motion of the shoulder girdle and glenohumeral joint. Utilizing these three OMT techniques, the practitioner attempts restoration of glenohumeral joint motion using shoulder extension, flexion, circumduction with compression, circumduction with distraction, abduction, adduction, external rotation, internal rotation, and distraction in abduction. The study uses a modified version of the Spencer technique, done in the seated position for patient comfort, as well as adding to the treatment sequence: latissimus dorsi, pectoralis minor-major, serratus anterior, and rhomboid major-minor. Adding these muscles into treatment will help to address and correct sternoclavicular joint SD, acromioclavicular joint SD, and scapular SD.",
