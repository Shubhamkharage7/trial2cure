            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeople who have a blood stem cell transplant can sometimes develop cytopenia. This means that their levels of one or more types of blood cell, such as the red cells or platelets, are lower than they should be. This can occur because a person s immune system might attack these cells after a stem cell transplant. Cytopenia can lead to anemia, severe bleeding, infections, and other problems. Treatments are needed to help keep blood cell levels stable after blood stem cell transplant.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a study drug (fostamatinib) in people who have cytopenia after a blood stem cell transplant.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 to 75 years who have cytopenia after a blood stem cell transplant.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam. They will have blood, urine, and stool tests.\n\nFostamatinib is an oral tablet taken by mouth. Participants will take the pills 2 times a day for 12 weeks.\n\nParticipants will have a medical assessment every 2 weeks; their vital signs will be checked, and they will have blood and stool tests. Participants must come to the NIH clinic for these visits in weeks 4 and 12. Other visits may be done by telephone or telehealth; the blood and stool tests can be sent to the researchers from a local lab.\n\nAfter 4 weeks, some participants may begin taking a higher dose of the drug.\n\nParticipants will return for a final medical assessment 2 weeks after they finish taking the drug.\n\nParticipants who complete this study and show evidence that fostamatinib has increased their blood cell counts may enroll in an extension study to continue taking fostamatinib.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis open label phase II trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of fostamatinib in the treatment of post-transplant cytopenias as assessed by hematologic improvement in anemia and/or thrombocytopenia following a 12-week treatment course.
