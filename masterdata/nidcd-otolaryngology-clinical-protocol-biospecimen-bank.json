            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMany disorders of the head and neck can affect a person s hearing; balance; smell; taste; swallowing; voice; or speech. These disorders include cancers and genetic and inflammatory diseases. To find better ways to diagnose and treat these disorders, researchers need to study tissues and other biological samples from people who have them.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo collect biological samples for a repository that will be used for research.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople of any age with a disorder of the head and neck that requires the taking of biological samples. The conditions may be any that affect hearing; balance; smell; taste; swallowing; voice; or speech.\n\nDesign:\n\nPart 1: Participants will give permission for their leftover tissue samples to be used for research. These are tissue samples from the head and neck that were collected in the course of routine tests and care or other research studies. Information on each participant s age, diagnosis, and previous treatments will also be collected.\n\nPart 2: Some participants may be asked for more samples. All those aged 3 years or older will have a physical exam. They will provide blood and saliva samples. A cotton swab or brush will be used to collect cells from the inside of the cheek.\n\nParticipants 18 years or older may have additional tests. They may provide nasal secretions: A piece of gelfoam or a sponge will be placed in the nose to soak up secretions for 5 to 10 minutes. They may have biopsies: Small samples of tissue will be cut from the skin and the tissue lining the mouth.\n\nSamples may be used for genetic testing.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) investigators are studying the natural history and treatment of diverse conditions of the head and neck affecting hearing, balance, smell, taste, swallowing, voice and speech at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). These studies require the collection of biospecimens for research purposes.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary:\n\nTo create a biorepository of diseased and normal tissue specimens for research purposes. The samples will be obtained:\n\n(Part 1) From surgical waste materials from participants of all ages in NIH protocols who have head and neck disorders.\n\n(Part 2) Participants aged 3 and older may have collection of blood, saliva, and/or oral swabs. Participants aged 18 and older, may undergo oral mucosal biopsies and skin biopsies and nasal secretion collection, taken from subjects with head and neck disorders.\n\nSecondary:\n\nThe specimens may be shared with the NCI Frederick Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) team, other approved protocols or may be used under this protocol to conduct analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic biology of normal processes and disorders. These laboratory studies may support development of future protocols that include new therapeutic agents, novel treatment approaches, and new prognostic and diagnostic models for subjects with disorders of the head and neck affecting human communication.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is the creation of a head and neck biorepository from both surgical waste material and prospectively collected blood, saliva, oral swabs, oral mucosa biopsy and skin biopsy specimens."
