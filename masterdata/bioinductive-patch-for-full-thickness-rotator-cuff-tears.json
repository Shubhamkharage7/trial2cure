            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this randomized-controlled study is to compare outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair augmented with a Bioinductive Implant (study group) to standard arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (control group). The primary outcome of this study is rotator cuff repair integrity (absence of full- or partial-thickness defect) demonstrated on ultrasound at 1-year postoperatively. The investigators hypothesize that the study group will have higher rates of repair integrity demonstrated on ultrasound at 1-year postoperatively.",
            "detailedDescription": "A bioinductive patch is an implant that may foster tendon regrowth and healing following surgery. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: control and investigational. All surgical patients will have failed non-surgical/conservative options for 6 weeks. Patients in the \"control group\" will receive the standard surgery (arthroscopic rotator cuff repair) . Patients in the \"experimental group\" will receive the same surgical treatment, with the addition of the bioinductive patch. This patch will be implanted during surgery. Then, using a combination of ultrasound studies and other measures, the investigators will assess how well the patch works compared to surgery alone."
