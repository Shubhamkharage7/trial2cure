            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the developmental phenotype of ASD and ID and to identify biomarkers using advanced MRI methodology and electrophysiological biomarkers of synaptic function and connectivity predictive of ASD and ID presence and severity in patients with TSC. In addition, this study will be establishing infrastructure for the collection and storage of human bio-specimens, including genetic material, from TSC patients and their family members with ASD.",
            "detailedDescription": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system disease that usually exhibits a high variability in clinical findings both among and within families. About 50% of individuals with TSC develop intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The purpose of this research study is to learn more information about ASD/ID in individuals with TSC through neurobehavioral assessments, electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and magnetic resonance imaging so that ultimately effective treatments and interventions for ASD/ID can be realized.\n\nIndividuals with TSC will be asked to participate in this study if they are 18 months or older at the time of enrollment and have been diagnosed with suspected or confirmed autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability, as well as healthy controls. Both males and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study participation, individuals' primary communicative language must be English. The participant and at least one biological parent will be asked to provide biological specimens including DNA and RNA for inclusion in the TSC RDCRN Biorepository.\n\nThe study involves 3 on site visits over the course of two years. Study visits will vary in length from about 4 hours to 6 hours. Study visits involve a physical exam, medical history questions, and neuropsychological assessments. A subset of participants between the ages of 2 and 11 years old will take part in the EEG portion of the study. At one point during the study, a blood draw will be done for future research studies. Individuals who have a clinically indicated MRI will have an option to provide routine clinical scans for analysis."
