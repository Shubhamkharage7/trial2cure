            "briefSummary": "The goal of the study is to learn if Epidiolex (cannabidiol) works as a additional pain medication in patients who have had orthopedic shoulder surgery. It is also to learn about safe dosages and identify any side effects after surgery.\n\nResearchers will compare Epidiolex to a placebo solution to see if Epidiolex lowers pain after shoulder surgery.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* track their pain and what medications they use every day in a provided pain diary. A researchers will call every seven days to check on the participant and diary.\n* Complete two short surveys. Once before surgery and once after.\n* Have bloodwork tested after surgery",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects will be randomized according to their surgery type. They will receive either the Epidiolex cannabidiol in addition to their standard of care pain regimen or a placebo in addition to their standard of care pain regimen. They will be asked to track a pain diary for 2 weeks postoperatively.\n\nA member of the research team will conduct a follow-up telephone call on day 7 to assess subjects' drug compliance. Subjects will also be contacted for a safety monitoring call at day 7 and 1 week after completion of treatment in which they will disclose type, severity, onset, and duration of any adverse events. In addition, they will complete a suicidal assessment10 See attached safety screening document. After the 2 weeks, subjects will return the pain diary and vial of CBD/placebo at their postoperative appointment.\n\nSubjects will also be asked to complete validated questionnaires via Houston Methodist's Redcap system once before surgery and again at 14 days postop. The surveys are with regards to sleep, activity, and pain and should take no more than 15 minutes to complete.\n\nAt their standard of care postoperative visit (11-17 days following surgery), another liver panel will be taken and their final safety monitoring screening will be conducted."
