            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a prospective, single-arm, open label, phase 2 study designed to evaluate if a dose-increasing strategy for abemaciclib will have less side effects and be better tolerated than the standard dosage of abemaciclib for participants with early-stage high-risk hormone receptor positive breast cancer.\n\nThis research study involves adjuvant abemaciclib plus endocrine (anti-hormone) therapy that works to target breast cancer. Adjuvant therapy is treatment given after surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved abemaciclib as a treatment option for early-stage high-risk hormone receptor breast cancer. The FDA has also approved hormonal therapies as treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including laboratory evaluations and questionnaires, blood tests, tumor biopsies, and stool collections.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for at least 2 years and up to 5 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 90 people will take part in this research study.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is supporting this study by providing funding for the study and supplying the study drug, abemaciclib."

Other exceptions may exist following review with the sponsor-investigator\n* Serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\<30ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting uncontrolled Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea) or other conditions that in the opinion of the investigator limit compliance with study requirements.\n* History of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest.\n* Any of the following due to teratogenic potential of the study drugs:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (condoms, diaphragms, IUDS, surgical sterilization, abstinence, etc). Hormonal birth control methods are not permitted.\n  * Men who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (condoms, surgical sterilization, abstinence, etc).\n* Receipt of an experimental treatment in a clinical trial within the last 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to enrollment, or is currently enrolled in any other type of medical research (for example: medical device) judged by the sponsor-investigator not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.\n* Active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous \\[IV\\] antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment) or invasive/ systemic fungal infection\\\\\n* For patients with known HIV infection, CD4 baseline count should be evaluated: patients with a CDK count \u2265 350 cells/uL can be enrolled. Participants should be on established anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for at least four weeks and have an HIV viral load less than 400 copies/mL prior to enrollment. Potential pharmacological interactions of the ART with abemaciclib and endocrine therapy must be reviewed, particularly for the effects on CYP3A4.\n* Patients with active or chronic Hepatitis B or C are eligible provided they meet liver function laboratory criteria and cannot be on any medication with a known interaction with the study agents.\n* Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, including selected herbals (e.g., hypericum) and food (e.g., grapefruit) known for pharmacological interactions, cannot be enrolled, due to interference with the dose-escalation, unless the food or supplement has been discontinued at least after an interval equivalent to 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor.",
