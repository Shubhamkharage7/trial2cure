Approximately 1,500 participants - of all ages, living in selected Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) will be enrolled in the registry.\n\nThe registry database will be generated with data gathered at a single core visit, followed by optional additional visits. The registry will include assessments of various asthma and allergy characteristics to achieve a more flexible, efficient, selective, and inclusive approach to participant recruitment while still following national guidelines to foster participant safety. CAUSE investigators may invite children or adults without asthma or atopic diseases to participate in the registry as \"healthy\" controls; for validation of laboratory tests, study monitoring equipment, and/or procedures; or for site procedure training of study personnel for certification and quality assurance.\n\nParticipants may opt to withdraw their information or discontinue from the registry at any time, in person, by telephone, or in writing."
