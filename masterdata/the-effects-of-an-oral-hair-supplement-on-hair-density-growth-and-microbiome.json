            "detailedDescription": "Hair thinning and hair loss are highly prevalent conditions affecting both men and women. Various factors can contribute to hair thinning and loss, including nutrition, medications, family history, and more. Overall, hair thinning and loss have a significant impact on quality of life and patients with these concerns have limited options. For example, minoxidil, finasteride, hair transplantations, and platelet rich plasma are effective options but each are paired with their own limitations. Thus, those with hair thinning or loss are increasingly turning to natural therapies shown to improve hair density and self-perceived hair thinning.\n\nNutrition is closely related to hair health, as evidenced by hair thinning and loss that occur with malnutrition or restrictive diets. Additionally, the hair follicle microbiome has been shown to modulate inflammation that exacerbates inflammatory scalp diseases, and ultimately hair thinning and hair loss.\n\nThus, an oral supplement that addresses nutrient deficiencies and targets the hair follicle microbiome could support hair health. In this study, we examine the effects of an herbal oral supplement on hair density, shine, and growth."
