Known history of a primary immunodeficiency or an underlying condition, such as known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or a positive result for HIV infection per central laboratory.\n8. All participants will undergo testing for hepatitis B virus serology as defined in the protocol.\n9.

Opportunistic infection requiring hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobial treatment within 2 years prior to randomization.\n12. Significant organ system involvement or myositis damage (global muscle damage score \\> 5 on a 10 cm VAS scale on the MDI) that poses risks in the study or impedes assessments.\n13. Diagnosis of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) \\[(positive 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (anti-HMGR), anti-signal recognition particle (anti- SRP), or antibody negative)\\], inclusion body myositis (IBM) (including positive anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (anti cN1A), or drug-induced myositis.\n14. Current musculoskeletal, joint, or inflammatory disease, including significant joint contractures or calcinosis that in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the muscle strength assessments and confound the disease activity assessments.\n15. Wheelchair bound participants.\n16. Current inflammatory skin disease other than DM or ASIM that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the inflammatory skin assessments or confound the disease activity assessments.\n17. Severe interstitial lung disease where respiratory symptoms limit participant function or progressive pulmonary fibrosis.\n18. Myositis in overlap with another connective tissue disease that precludes the accurate assessment of a treatment response (for example, difficulty in assessing muscle strength in a scleroderma patient with associated myositis).",

Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
