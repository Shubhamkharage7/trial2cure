AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) \u22642.5 x ULN unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be \u22645x ULN.\n   6.

If vaccinated against COVID-19, the last vaccine dose must be 14 days or greater from the first investigational product administration.\n12. If a participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.

Patients with stable, controlled HIV (defined as CD4+ T-cell counts \u2265 350 cells/uL, on established antiretroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks, and have an HIV viral load less than 400 copies/mL prior to enrollment) are eligible for trial inclusion.\n5. History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other intrinsic lung disease requiring systemic steroid therapy, oxygen, or hospitalization\n6. History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease or QTcF \\> 470 within 12 months from first dose of study intervention, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular event, or cardiac arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic instability. Note: medically controlled arrhythmia would be permitted.\n7. History of immunodeficiency or receiving chronic systemic steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Steroid premedications for radiologic contrast allergy are permitted.\n8. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.\n9. Has history of a second malignancy, unless potentially curative treatment has been completed with no evidence of malignancy for 2 years. The time requirement does not apply to participants who underwent successful definitive resection of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other in-situ cancers.\n10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is allowed.\n11.
