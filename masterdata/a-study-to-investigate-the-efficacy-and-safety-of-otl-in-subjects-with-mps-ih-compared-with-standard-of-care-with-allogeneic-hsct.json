A total of 40 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS-IH who meet the study inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either OTL-203 or allo-HSCT. The trial will comprise of a screening, baseline, and treatment period, with a follow-up period of 5 years post-treatment, and primary analysis performed at 2 years follow-up of the last treated subject."
