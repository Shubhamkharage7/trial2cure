            "detailedDescription": "Dose-escalation Phase: Approximately 48 patients are planned for the dose-escalation phase, with at least 6 patients treated at the RP2D.\n\nCohort Expansion Phase: Two additional cohorts are planned. Cohort E1: advanced ovarian cancer and Cohort E5 Merkel cell carcinoma. Each cohort will be treated at the RP2D.\n\nIn each cohort, FF-10850 will be administered intravenously (IV) until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable AEs, or, after discussion between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor, changes in the patient's condition that prevent further study participation. A sufficient number of cohorts will be enrolled to identify the RP2D.\n\nThere will be 3 initial dose levels in this study. FF-10850 will be diluted and infused over 60 minutes.\n\nApproximately 96 patients are planned for the entire trial.\n\nIt is anticipated that approximately 4 centers will participate in the dose-escalation phase, with an expansion to approximately 10 centers in the cohort expansion phase. Accrual for the dose-escalation and expansion phases is expected to be approximately 3 years, with patients followed every 3 months from the last dose of study treatment to assess survival."
