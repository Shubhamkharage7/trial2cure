Any grade of DTR is eligible.\n* Subjects must not have more than one active malignancy at the time of enrollment\n* Written informed consent obtained from the subject and the subject agrees to comply with all the study-related procedures. All subjects and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign a written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional standard practice.\n* Use of contraception:\n\n  * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are heterosexually active must be using two highly effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy as Tazemetostat might counteract the effects of hormonal contraceptives. Birth control methods that can be used while in this study include: established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal birth control or placement of an intrauterine device \\[IUD\\] or intrauterine system \\[IUS\\]. They or their partner must also use a second method, (e.g., condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or occlusive cap \\[diaphragm or cervical/vault caps\\] with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. If their male partner is vasectomized, they do not need to use any of the birth control methods listed above. The type of birth control they use must be discussed with the study doctor before beginning the study. The study doctor must approve the method you use before they can enter the study. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.\n  * Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use physician-approved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence, condoms,vasectomy) throughout the study and should avoid donating sperm, for 90 days following the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects who are currently taking the following concomitant medications:\n\n  * Anti-cancer Agents: Subjects who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible.\n  * CYP3A4 Agents: Subjects who are currently receiving drugs that are strong inducers or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are not eligible. Strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited from 14 days prior to the first dose of Tazemetostat to the end of the study. Note: Dexamethasone for CNS tumors or metastases, on a stable dose, is allowed.\n  * Grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges and food/drinks containing them should be avoided one week before the first dose of the study intervention\n* Subjects who are acutely ill with an uncontrolled active infection on systemic anti-infective agents are not eligible.\n* Subjects with a prior history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or other myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).\n* Subjects who have any of the following underlying major cardiac issues or conditions:\n\n  * Known QTc prolongation or documentation\n  * Documented New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure.\n  * Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to registration.\n  * Unstable angina within 6 months prior to registration.\n  * Symptomatic arrhythmia.\n* Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator may be high risk for treatment complications or unable to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study\n* Heterosexually active males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two highly effective contraceptive methods for the duration of study treatment as Tazemetostat might counteract the effects of hormonal contraceptives. Female subjects of childbearing potential should agree to remain abstinent or use adequate contraceptive methods for 6 months after the last dose of Tazemetostat. Male subjects should agree to remain abstinent or use adequate contraceptive methods, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, and for 90 days after the last dose of Tazemetostat.\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding will not be entered on this study because there is currently no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal.\n* Administration of a vaccine containing live virus within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Note: Most flu vaccines are killed viruses, with the exception of the intra-nasal vainer (Flu-Mist) which is an attenuated live virus and therefore prohibited for 30 days prior to first dose. Non-live versions of the COVID-19 vaccine are allowed.\n* Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated, or subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness.\n* Known hypersensitivity to tazmetostat or any component of the formulation of tazemetostat\n* Inability to take oral medication OR have malabsorption syndrome or any other uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition (eg, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) that might impair the bioavailability of tazmetostat",
