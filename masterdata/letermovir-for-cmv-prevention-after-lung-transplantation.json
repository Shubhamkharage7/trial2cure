All patients will be followed for 12 weeks after completion of letermovir for the occurrence of CMV infection or disease after prophylaxis.\n\nHistorical controls will be LTRs for IPF from 2010-2019 who are CMV R+ or CMV D+/R- (donor positive/recipient negative). CMV prophylaxis in the historical controls was with valganciclovir for 6 months for CMV R+ and for 12 months for CMV D+/R-.
