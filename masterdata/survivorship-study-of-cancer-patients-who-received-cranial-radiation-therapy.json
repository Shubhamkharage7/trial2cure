The primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using a digital symptom tracking application focused on HRQoL and cognition in cancer survivors who received brain irradiation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients who may participate in the study are cancer survivors who received cranial irradiation for conditions including, but not limited to: primary brain tumors, brain metastases, patients with lung cancer receiving prophylactic brain irradiation, and long-term survivors of pediatric cancers. Patients will use the Noona\u00ae Healthcare Mobile PRO Application to identify real time select HRQoL and cognitive symptoms. Patients will be instructed to log symptoms as often as relevant using their own personal devices, as well as be prompted to fill out the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Screen (PROMIS Global Health-10 and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale) during treatment (weeks 9 and 14). Patient engagement with the application will be tracked to determine feasibility."
