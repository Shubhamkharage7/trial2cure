Develop an algorithm for objective evaluation of pain severity and distinguish the location of pain without needing patient cooperation.\n\nII. Find the relationship between fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) features and severity of pain as well as the relationship (if any) between perceived pain severity and visual perception.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Investigate the effect (and the reasoning of the effect) of alleviating severity of perceived pain utilizing virtual reality techniques.\n\nII. Monitor changes of brain activity to find out the reason for pain alleviation caused by virtual reality techniques and/or cognitive distraction.\n\nOUTLINE: Healthy participants are assigned to group A. Cancer patients are randomized to group B or group C.\n\nGROUP A: Participants undergo fNIRS for over 15 minutes.\n\nGROUP B: Patients undergo fNIRS for over 15 minutes followed by a relaxation period using virtual reality (VR) for over 15 minutes.\n\nGROUP C: Patients undergo fNIRS for over 15 minutes."
