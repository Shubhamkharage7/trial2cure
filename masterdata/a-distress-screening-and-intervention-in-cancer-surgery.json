The intervention focuses on improving emotional and physical health through relaxation, behavioral activation, increased physical activity, and adherence to medication and wound care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or to receive standard care. Outcomes assessed 4 and 6 weeks post-operatively will include: Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), health-related QOL (SF-36 MCS and PCS), number and type of complications, length of stay, and 30-day readmission."
