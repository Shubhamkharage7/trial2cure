This criterion includes the lack of or decreased mucosal wave of the vocal fold during videostroboscopy exam. Scoring of scar based on laryngoscopic exam: Type I: atrophy of lamina propria with/without affected epithelium. Type II: the epithelium, lamina propria, and muscle are affected. Type III: scar located on the anterior commissure. Type IV: this category includes extended scar formation in both anteroposterior and rostro-caudal axis, with significant loss of vocal fold mass)\n* Unilateral or Bilateral vocal fold scarring\n* At least 1-year delay after initial surgery\n* Negative pregnancy test and contraception for woman of childbearing age. Women of childbearing age must use contraception at least 4 months pre and post SVF administration.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Refusal of speech therapy\n* History of malignant lesion or severe dysplasia of the scarred vocal fold\n* Contraindication to anesthesia, anticoagulant treatment, coagulation disorders, active infectious disease\n* Refusal or inability to comply with study procedures\n* Pregnant and lactating woman\n* Major chronic medical condition that could affect treatment or quality of SVF product. These include:\n\n  * Current treatment or within 6 months of last treatment for cancer.\n  * Blindness\n  * Known history of Dementia,\n  * Known history of Kidney Disease\n  * Known history of Cerebral Vascular Accident or Stroke\n* Known history of Diabetes\n* Abnormal screening lab. If the laboratory reports a single, non-clinically relevant, non-life-threatening result for any of these studies and is the only excluding factor it may be repeated 1 week later if the subject wishes. Normalization of that laboratory study will then be considered non-exclusionary.\n* Post-Radiation scarring of vocal folds.",
