            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of the study drug, ORC-13361, in preventing hearing loss in patients with NTM infection who are undergoing treatment with IV amikacin therapy. The main question this study aims to answer is:\n\n* Is ORC-13661 effective for preventing or lessening hearing loss induced by amikacin treatment?\n* Is ORC-13661 effective for preventing or lessening other measures of hearing impairment?\n\nParticipants will be asked to take a study drug while they are being treated with IV amikacin. Participants will take study drug for 90 days or until the end of their amikacin treatment, whichever comes first. During this time, researchers will gather clinical data on the participants' health.\n\nResearchers will compare three groups - two groups taking different doses of the study drug and one group taking a placebo drug - to see if dose of drug has any effect on preventing hearing loss. A placebo is a look-alike substance that contains no active drug.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental bacteria that can cause chronic, debilitating pulmonary disease, primarily affecting those over age 60. In more severe cases of NTM infection, patients are given a therapy with parenteral aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGs), to achieve control or cure. Amikacin is the most commonly used aminoglycoside for treatment in this setting, however it is limited by in its use by its tendency to cause ototoxicity including hearing loss and/or vestibular dysfunction. Ototoxicity refers to substances (i.e. medications) which are damaging to the inner ear sensory cells and may result in functional hearing loss and other negative effects.\n\nThis main goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of the study drug, ORC-13661, a small molecule compound being developed as an adjunct therapy to be administered during AG use in order to prevent associated ototoxicity. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-ranging clinical trial to compare the effects and safety of ORC-13661 in preventing or mitigating hearing in patients taking amikacin.\n\n105 participants will be enrolled across 5 enrolling sites over the course of the study. Participants will be randomized in equal numbers between three different study arms: high-dose ORC-13661, low-dose ORC-13661, and placebo. Participants will take study drug for 90 days from the start of their amikacin treatment or until their amikacin treatment ends, whichever comes first.\n\nThe primary outcome of this study is prevention or mitigation of amikacin-induced ototoxicity. Secondary outcomes include changes in speech perception, auditory and balance effects, and quality of hearing."

History of congenital hearing loss, otological surgery (excluding myringotomy tubes or simple tympanoplasty healed and currently intact), sudden hearing loss, or Meniere's disease.\n12. Bilateral profound hearing loss (\\>90 Decibels \\[dB\\] HL) at all test frequencies.\n13. Conductive hearing loss evidenced by average air-bone-gaps \\>15 dB HL for 0.25-4.0 kilohertz (kHz)\n14. History of active malignancy, either untreated or under active treatment.\n15.

Current or anticipated use of excluded concomitant medications as specified in Section 6.5.\n19. Pregnant or lactating.\n20. Female of childbearing potential who does not have a negative serum pregnancy test and does not agree in writing to using a double barrier method of contraception.\n21. Female relying on menopausal status for contraception who does not have Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level consistent with that condition and who does not agree in writing to using a double barrier method of contraception.\n22.
