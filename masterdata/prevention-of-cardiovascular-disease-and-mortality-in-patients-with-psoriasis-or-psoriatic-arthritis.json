The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ranging from 0, worst health state, to 100, best health state. A scoring function is used to assign a value (i.e., EQ-5D\u2122 index score) to self-reported health states from a set of population-based preference weights. For the U.S. general population, the possible EQ-5D index scores range from -0.11 to 1.0 where 0.0 = death and 1.0 = perfect health.",
