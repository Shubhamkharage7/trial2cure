            "detailedDescription": "African American (AA) cigarette smokers (n=500) who are interested in switching to a nicotine salt-based electronic cigarette (EC) and are not established EC users will receive a 6-week supply of the EC and assistance with switching. After six weeks, those that are dual users (n=221) will receive an additional 12 weeks of the EC and be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive 12 weeks of varenicline (VAR) or placebo (PBO) and additional counseling to support a complete switch. Follow-up for all participants will continue through week 52. The primary outcome is change in the potent lung carcinogen, NNAL, between exclusive EC, dual cig-EC, and exclusive cig users at week 6."
