Known allergy to biological products or known hypersensitivity to any component of sabirnetug or hyaluronidase, including excipients.\n6.

Use of any over the counter (OTC) medication, nutritional or dietary supplements, homeopathic preparations, herbal remedies such as St. John's Wort Extract, or vitamins within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug until EOS without evaluation and approval by the Investigator.\n9. Use of any prescription medication, starting from 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of the study drug until EOS without evaluation and approval by the Investigator.\n10. Blood or plasma donation within 7 days before the first dose of the study drug until EOS. Blood/plasma donations should not be made for at least 90 days after the last dose of the study drug.\n11. Has any prior history of substance abuse or treatment (including alcohol) within the 2 years prior to the first study treatment administration.\n12. Regular alcohol consumption \\>14 units per week (1 unit=\u00bd pint beer, 25 mL of 40% spirit or a 125-mL glass of wine).\n13. Has a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates), cotinine, or alcohol.\n14. Has a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening or has been previously treated for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection.\n15.
