            "briefSummary": "Veterans with treatment resistant depression (TRD) have the opportunity to receive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment via the VA's National TMS Clinical Pilot Program. While some see improvement with their depression, others do not. Therefore, it may be beneficial to be able to predict with biomarkers what participants may see improvement with their treatment. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a means to identify such biomarkers. Four hundred Veterans with TRD will be enrolled in this trial to determine whether neuroimaging biomarkers of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be prospectively replicated in a large ecologically valid sample. Participants will have a total of EEG scans at baseline, every 5th treatment session, and at the end of treatment for a total of 7 EEG scans.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goals of this study are to: (1) test a potential predictive resting EEG biomarker of antidepressant response (differential patters of gamma oscillations) in a large sample of Veterans with TRD receiving TMS (N=400); (2) assess whether a second putative biomarker (early changes in theta cordance during treatment) predict eventual response to TMS, as well as, leverage this large sample to identify other potential biomarkers (such as markers of early versus late response to TMS, markers of response to other TMS parameters (e.g., 5 Hz, 1 Hz or theta burst TMS), and markers of change with treatment that may speak to mechanism); and (3) create an infrastructure to rapidly identify and test additional EEG-based biomarkers of treatment response in patients with depression and other psychiatric conditions."
