            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nAggressive B-cell lymphomas can be cured but people with disease that resists treatment or that returns after treatment have poor outcomes with standard therapies. Indolent B-cell lymphomas are generally incurable with standard therapy and treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and achieving a durable remissions. Researchers want to see if a combination of drugs can help patients with both aggressive and indolent B-cell lymphomas.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if it is safe and effective to give polatuzumab along with venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab, and lenalidomide to people with certain B-cell lymphomas.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma who have had at least one prior cancer treatment.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nAssessment of how they do their daily activities\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nHeart function test\n\nTissue biopsy (if needed)\n\nBody imaging scans (may get a contrast agent through an intravenous (IV) catheter)\n\nParticipants will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy. A needle will be put into the hipbone. Bone marrow will be removed.\n\nParticipants may give blood, tissue, saliva, or cheek swab samples. They may have optional biopsies.\n\nScreening tests will be repeated during the study.\n\nTreatment will be given for up to 6 cycles. Each cycle lasts 21 days.\n\nParticipants will take venetoclax and prednisone tablets by mouth. They will take ibrutinib and lenalidomide capsules by mouth. They will get obinutuzumab and polatuzumab by IV infusion. They will keep a medicine diary.\n\nParticipants will visit the clinic 30 days after treatment ends. They will have follow-up visits for 5 years. If needed, they can visit their local doctor instead. They may be contacted by phone, mail, etc., for the rest of their life....",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Combination chemotherapy with rituximab has been the mainstay of treatment for CD20-positive B-cell lymphomas.\n* Significant advances have been made in curing aggressive B-cell lymphomas with chemoimmunotherapy, but indolent lymphomas and relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas remain mostly incurable with chemotherapy alone.\n* Targeted therapies, aimed at disrupting key survival pathways in lymphoid malignancies, are emerging and showing significant activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in both the relapsed and first-line settings.\n* Mechanistically based combinations of targeted agents are likely to benefit patients who cannot tolerate or who relapse after or are refractory to standard chemoimmunotherapy.\n* ViPOR-P targets major survival pathways in B-cell lymphomas including BCL-2 (apoptosis); BTK (B-cell receptor signaling and NF-kB); Cereblon (NF-kB) and CD20 with additional genotoxic stress from the anti-mitotic antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b, polatuzumab.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety and toxicity profile of polatuzumab and venetoclax in combination with ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and Revlimid (lenalidomide) (ViPOR-P) in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas\n* To determine the complete response (CR) rate of ViPOR-P in relapsed/refractory non-GCB\n\nDLBCL\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Women and men greater than or equal to 18 years of age\n* ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma, excluding mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)\n* Adequate organ function unless dysfunction secondary to lymphoma\n\nDesign:\n\n* Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase 1 study\n* Standard 3 + 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of polatuzumab and venetoclax in combination with ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and Revlimid (lenalidomide) (ViPOR-P) in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas\n* A small expansion cohort will be treated at the MTD for a further analysis of safety and preliminary activity.\n* An expansion cohort of 32 patients (including 27 new patients + 5 patients already enrolled at DL3/MTD) with non-GCB DLBCL will be treated at the MTD to determine the CR rate to ViPOR-P of this aggressive lymphoma subtype.\n* Maximum 6 cycles of combination targeted therapy every 21 days.\n* To explore all dose levels in the phase 1 study and to assess the CR rate in non-GCB\n\nDLBCL patients in a dose expansion at the MTD as well as to allow for the possibility of a few screen failures and inevaluable subjects, the accrual ceiling will be set at 55 patients."

The effects of obinutuzumab on the developing human fetus is unknown. For these reasons, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception as described below. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n    * For women of childbearing potential:\n\n      * Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year as outlined below.\n      * Agreement to refrain from donating eggs during timelines specified below.\n      * Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing Revlimid for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days as required by Revlimid REMSTM) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking Revlimid FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.\n      * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (greater than or equal to 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).\n      * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n      * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n    * For men:\n\n      * Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n      * With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year as noted below. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n      * With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom as noted below to avoid exposing the embryo.\n      * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n  * Contraception Requirements\n\n    * Time frame/Study Drug (Pre-Treatment/During Treatment) - Women/Men (Time frame prior to/during dosing):\n\n      --- Pre-Treatment/During Treatment/All drugs; Women - Begins 28 days prior to treatment; Men - Begins on day 1\n    * Time frame/Study Drug (Post-Treatment) - Women/Men (Time frame after the last dose):\n\n      * Post-Treatment/Venetoclax; Women - 90 days; Men - 90 days\n      * Post-Treatment/Ibrutinib; Women - 3 months; Men - 3 months\n      * Post-Treatment/Obinutuzumab; Women - 18 months; Men - 6 months\n      * Post-Treatment/Revlimid; Women - 28 days; Men - 28 days\n      * Post-Treatment/Polatuzumab; Women - 3 months; Men - 5 months\n  * All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMSTM program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMSTM. NOTE: Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMSTM program.\n  * Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* The following restrictions apply to current or prior anti-cancer treatment, prior to the first dose of study drug:\n\n  * Patients who are actively receiving any other investigational agents.\n  * Any chemotherapy or anti-cancer antibodies within 2 weeks. NOTE: Short courses of corticosteroids or palliative XRT prior to enrollment are permitted within the 2- week washout period.\n  * Radio- or toxin-immunoconjugates within 10 weeks.\n  * Previous treatment with more than one of the study agents (i.e., polatuzumab, venetoclax, ibrutinib, or Revlimid ), excluding prior prednisone or anti-CD20 antibody treatment.\n  * Prior allogeneic stem cell (or other organ) transplant within 6 months or any evidence of active graft-versus-host disease or requirement for immunosuppressants within 28 days.\n  * Not recovered (i.e., less than or equal to Grade 1 or baseline) from adverse events due to previously administered anti-cancer treatment, surgery, or procedure. NOTE: Exceptions to this include events not considered to place the subject at unacceptable risk of participation in the opinion of the PI (e.g., alopecia).\n* Patients requiring the use of warfarin are excluded because of potential drug-drug interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin.\n* Patients requiring the following agents to the first dose of venetoclax or ibrutinib are excluded, as noted:\n\n  * Strong CYP3A inhibitors within 7 days\n  * Strong CYP3A inducers within 7 days\n\nNOTE: Moderate CYP3A inhibitors and inducers should be used with caution and an alternative medication used, whenever possible.\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the discretion of the investigator:\n\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Uncontrolled and/or symptomatic thyroid disease\n  * Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study enrollment, or any major episode of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to the completion of the course of antibiotics) within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1;\n  * Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis; as well as active infection with HBV or HCV:\n\n    * Patients who are positive for HCV antibody must be negative for HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible for study participation\n    * Patients with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as positive total hepatitis B core antibody \\[HBcAb\\] and negative HBsAg) may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable (i.e., none detected in copies/mL or IU/mL). These patients must be willing to undergo monthly DNA testing during treatment and for at least 12 months after completion of study therapy.\n  * Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women, or women who intend to become pregnant during the study, are excluded from this study because Revlimid has known teratogenic effects and polatuzumab, venetoclax, ibrutinib and obinutuzumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on study.\n* HIV-positive patients are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with venetoclax, ibrutinib and Revlimid and combination antiretroviral therapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Evidence of active tumor lysis syndrome based on laboratory assessment\n* History of recent major surgery within 6 weeks prior to the start of Cycle 1, Day 1 other than for diagnosis\n* History of other active malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results\n\n  * Patients with a history of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma or stage 1 melanoma of the skin as well as any in situ carcinoma are eligible.\n  * Patients with a malignancy that has been treated with curative intent will also be eligible. Individuals in documented remission who are not receiving active treatment prior to enrollment may be included at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Known allergy to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase; or, known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs",
