            "briefSummary": "A pilot study to evaluate feasibility of enrollment of patients in an intervention to improve neurocognitive function in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors using the cognitive training Lumosity program. In addition, patients' interest in receiving information regarding genetic risk of cognitive impairment post-HCT will be measured.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose using an \"off-the-shelf\" product - Lumosity (http://www.lumosity.com/) - an online cognitive training program, to address the cognitive impairment in outpatient HCT survivors. The program offers over 60 tasks in game-like format that cover the main cognitive domains: processing speed, working memory, and executive function. Training will involve a daily session of 5 training tasks for 12 weeks. Each time the patient is logged in for a session, a customized report will be generated by the Lumosity program to capture performance information.\n\nIdeally, targeting the intervention and offering it specifically to those at highest risk (integrating clinical and genetic markers) would ensure efficacy. However, evidence is lacking on whether patients are receptive to communication of individual genetic information and whether provision of such results would lead to enhanced intervention response. To realize the high expectations of personalized medicine, patients' preferences and attitudes need to be thoroughly investigated especially as more information on genetic risk becomes available. The investigators will examine patients' genetic knowledge to determine whether factual knowledge of genetics is essential for understanding genetic risk and for informing treatment decision making in this patient population."
