Such deaths are primarily cardiovascular, not hyperthermia itself, in origin. The central hypothesis of this work is that cardiovascular stress during heat wave conditions in the elderly can be reduced by applying low-energy cooling modalities. Comprehensive cardiovascular and thermal responses in the elderly will be evaluated during exposure to two prolonged heat wave conditions: hot and humid (replicating the 1995 Chicago heat wave), very hot and dry (replicating the 2018 Los Angeles heat wave). With each of these heat wave conditions individuals will be exposed to the following cooling modalities: no cooling (control), water spray, fan use, and fan use plus water spray."
