The team will assign patients by chance to one of the 3 treatments. Smoking cessation will be confirmed with a breath test (measured at 2, 6, and 12 months). The study will measure the effects of these treatments in based on gender, race, ethnicity, rurality, and social vulnerability; (b) their effects on patients' quality of life, self-confidence in quitting, and satisfaction with the treatments; and (c) their impact on patients' reported levels of motivation, commitment to values, and acceptance of triggers for smoking."
