            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is 1) to investigate correlation between cervical spine joint position error (JPE) and postural stability in asymptomatic older adults with forward head posture (FHP), 2) to examine the effect of a home-based exercise program on visual reliance and cervical spine proprioception for postural stability in asymptomatic older adults with FHP, 3) to study the effect of immediate postural correction on cervical spine JPE and active range of motion (AROM), and 4) to determine participant post-intervention perception of changes in FHP, postural stability and effect on quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will have a sample size of 50 older adults (males and females) aged 65-74 years old with FHP. This sample size will provide us with enough power to detect the needed effect size (medium effect size). The estimated attrition rate is 20%. The participants will be recruited from the local community through flyers, e-mails, and word of mouth. Study flyers will be delivered to physical therapy clinics, physician offices, and support groups with verbal description for further explanations. Potential participants who respond to the emails or flyers will be provided with a verbal description of the study.\n\nThe study will be conducted in the Department of Physical Therapy, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda. Hard copies will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked research laboratory and computer data will be stored on an encrypted computer in a locked research laboratory.\n\nAll data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27.0. For quantitative data, the investigators will use the General Linear Model (Mixed Factorial Analysis of Variance) and Correlation Analysis (Pearson's Correlation). Also, a statistician will be consulted to accurately analyze and interpret results. The alpha level will be set at 0.05.\n\nEfforts will be made to keep participants' personal information confidential, but the investigators cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. The investigators will use a pseudonym throughout the study for all recorded data so participant's actual name will not be used. Participants will not be identified by name in any publications describing the results of this study. Data in hard copy will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office and electronic data will be password protected."
