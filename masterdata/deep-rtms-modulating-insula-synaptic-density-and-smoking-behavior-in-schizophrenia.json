The investigators also seek to link plasticity changes in the regions targeted by the electric field (especially, the insula) to changes in the functioning of insula circuits and behavioral cigarette usage in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ).\n\nImportance of the study: This is the first study designed to directly evaluate the mechanism of action (MOA) of dTMS for smoking disruption in patients with SCZ. Patients with SCZ are a vulnerable population in high, immediate need of new smoking therapeutics for reducing premature morbidity and mortality."
