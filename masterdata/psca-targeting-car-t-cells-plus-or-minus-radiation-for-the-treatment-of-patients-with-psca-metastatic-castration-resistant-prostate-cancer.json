            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of autologous anti-prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-4-1BB/TCRzeta-CD19t-expressing T-lymphocytes (PSCA-CAR T cells), plus or minus radiation, in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Castration-resistant prostate cancer continues to grow and spread despite the surgical removal of the testes or medical intervention to block androgen production. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving PSCA-targeting CAR T-cells, with or without radiation, may kill more tumor cells in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess the feasibility, safety, and activity of lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by up to 3 cycles of 50M PSCA-CAR T cell immunotherapy per course either alone (treatment plan 1 \\[TP1\\]) or in combination with metastasis-directed radiation therapy (MDRT) (treatment plan 2 \\[TP2\\]) in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Describe persistence and expansion of CAR T cells in peripheral blood (PB). II. Describe cytokine levels over the study period. III. Estimate disease response rates. IV. Estimate 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. V. Estimate 1-year overall survival (OS) rate.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Describe the immune landscape changes in PB and tumors. II. Describe phenotype of CAR T cells in PB. III. Describe tumor evolution in PB (circulating tumor cells \\[CTCs\\], circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid \\[DNA\\] \\[cfDNA\\]) and tumors.\n\nIV. Determine whether urine cytokines and cellularity is predictive of cystitis occurrence/severity.\n\nV. Analyze microbial changes in stool associated with CAR T cell therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment plans.\n\nTREATMENT PLAN I: Patients undergo leukapheresis and lymphodepletion and receive PSCA-CAR T cells intravenously (IV) up to 3 times on study.\n\nTREATMENT PLAN II: Patients undergo leukapheresis, radiation in 2 doses, and lymphodepletion, and receive PSCA-CAR T cells IV up to 3 times on study.\n\nPatients in both arms undergo bone scan, computed tomography (CT) scan, tumor biopsy, and collection of blood, stool and urine samples throughout the trial."
