            "briefSummary": "The study involves annual 4D CTA imaging of the bicuspid aortic valve for a period of 5 years. CTA is often standard of care for BAV patients, but patients in this study will receive a higher radiation dose with a 4D imaging protocol. There may also be patients enrolled in the study who have a 4D CTA for research purposes when a routine CTA is not required for clinical care.",
            "detailedDescription": "The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease. The purpose of this study is to better understand the anatomy of physiologically normal, or competent, BAVs without stenosis or insufficiency (AI) in order to support evidence-based standardization of BAV repair surgery. Men and women over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of BAV and minimal aortic valve calcification at baseline will undergo annual 4D computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans, routine transthoracic echocardiograms, and history and physical assessments over the course of the 5-year study period. Patients who are pregnant, have renal insufficiency (creatinine 2 mg/dL), or who have a contraindication to intravenous contrast will be excluded. Patients will be stratified into study groups according to baseline AI: approximately half of patients will have no to mild AI at baseline and the other half will have moderate to severe AI at baseline. Anatomical measurements will be obtained from the 4D CTA scans and analyzed at each phase of the cardiac cycle, as well as longitudinally. The 4D CTA imaging and analysis will not impact medical care of the study participants; the anatomical measurements will be used in the future as evidence-based standards for determining valve repair candidacy for BAV patients with AI."
