The team identified the baseline clinical care delivery for LTVV in patients with ARDS across Intermountain hospitals and identified the barriers and facilitators to this standard of care. This pilot implementation study will focus on a Pilot Solution aimed at achieving ideal clinical care delivery of LTVV for patients with ARDS.\n\nAbbreviations for Mechanical Ventilation:\n\nPEEP: positive end expiratory pressure FIO2: fraction of inspired oxygen CPAP: continuous positive airway pressure PS: pressure support VC: volume control VC+: hybrid mode for volume targeted ventilation on Puritan Bennett ventilators PRVC: pressure regulated volume control, hybrid mode for volume targeted ventilation on Draeger ventilators PF ratio: ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2 mmHg) divided by the FIO2 expressed in liters"
