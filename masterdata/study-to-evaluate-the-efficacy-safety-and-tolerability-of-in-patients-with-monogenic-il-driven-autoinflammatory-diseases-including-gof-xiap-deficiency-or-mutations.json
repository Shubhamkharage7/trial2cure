The total study duration is approximately 3 - 4 years.\n\nPatients who enter Period 2 will be randomized to MAS825 or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nCohort 1 patients will complete all periods of the study, which will take approximately 4 years.\n\nCohort 2: Patients who are receiving MAS825 in a Novartis Managed Access Program with a diagnosis of NLRC4-GOF, XIAP deficiency, or CDC42 mutation who meet criteria will be eligible to directly enter into Period 3 for open-label long-term safety follow-up.

Previous treatment with anti-rejection and/or immunomodulatory drugs within the past 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is the longer) for immunomodulatory therapeutic antibodies (or as listed in the prohibited medications section) prior to MAS825 treatment with the exceptions of glucocorticoids, cyclosporin and targeted binding or blocking therapies.\n5. A positive HIV test result at Screening. Evidence of prior testing within 3 months is sufficient.\n6. A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result at Screening. Evidence of prior testing within 3 months is sufficient.\n7. Presence of tuberculosis infection as defined by a positive TB test at Screening. Evidence of prior testing within 3 months is sufficient.\n8. Live vaccinations within 1 month prior to MAS825 treatment, during the trial, and up to 3 months following the last dose.\n9. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females.\n10. Female patients of child-bearing potential (or Tanner stage 2 or above) who are or might become sexually active, agree to use highly effective contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy while on MAS825 therapy\n11.
