Pharmacogenomics is the study of how the differences in our genes can affect our unique response to medications.\n\nThis is a randomized study, which means that participants in this study will be randomly assigned (as if \"by flip of a coin\") to one of two different groups: a \"pharmacogenomics group\" or \"control group\"."
