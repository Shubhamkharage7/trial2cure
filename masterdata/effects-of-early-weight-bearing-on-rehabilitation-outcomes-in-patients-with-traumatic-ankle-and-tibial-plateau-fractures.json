Additionally, early weight bearing will be tested in patients with unicondylar plateau fractures that do not involve joint impaction in the context of a pilot study.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare outcomes following early versus delayed weight bearing among individuals with a traumatic ankle fracture. This study will enroll patients ages 18 or older surgically treated for an ankle fracture or fracture dislocation (without syndesmosis) at participating civilian trauma centers and military treatment facilities. Eligible patients will be identified during hospitalization for definitive treatment and enrolled prior to discharge or at the first post op clinic visit. Patients that consent to participate will complete a baseline assessment at the first post op clinic visit and will be randomized to early versus delayed weight bearing. Both treatment groups will receive standardized exercises that can be done at home or with a therapist. Outcomes will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months following definitive fracture fixation. All 6 week, 3 and 6 month evaluations will take place in the surgeon's outpatient clinic and involve clinical and radiographic assessments of healing as well as functional outcome surveys. The 12 month evaluation will be conducted by phone except for individuals who were judged not to be healed (clinically or radiographically) at 6 months; these participants will be asked to return for their 12 month evaluation (to assess healing). Simultaneously, a pilot RCT will be conducted in patients 18 or older surgically treated with a unicondylar plateau fracture without joint impaction."

METRC is committed to making data as widely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of study participants and protecting the intellectual property of the Consortium.\n\nData will only be made available after it is completely stripped of identifiable information such as dates, geographic locators, and any other event information which is sufficiently rare as to make it possible to deduce the identity of an individual participant.
