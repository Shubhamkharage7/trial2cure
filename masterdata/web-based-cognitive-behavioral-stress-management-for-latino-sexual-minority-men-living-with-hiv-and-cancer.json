Sexual minority Latino men living with HIV and cancer experience a variety of health disparities related to their diagnoses, including higher distress. The project will be a pilot randomized trial, comparing culturally-tailored CBSM to standard CBSM for dually-diagnosed participants. The project will use a community-based participatory research approach, and the investigators have included (and will continue to include) LGBT-serving community partners in all phases of the research from study design to implementation and dissemination of findings. The proposed study will aid in attenuating health disparities among Latino sexual minority men living with HIV and cancer."
