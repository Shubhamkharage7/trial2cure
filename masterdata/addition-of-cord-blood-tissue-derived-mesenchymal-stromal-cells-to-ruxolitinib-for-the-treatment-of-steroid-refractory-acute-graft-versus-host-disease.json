            "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial is to find out the effect of adding cord blood tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (cb-MSCs) to ruxolitinib in treating patients with acute graft versus host disease that does not respond to steroid therapy (steroid-refractory). Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. cb-MSCs are a type of tissue helper cell that can be removed from donated umbilical cord blood tissue and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other disease, such as graft versus host disease. This trial aims to learn if adding cb-MSCs to ruxolitinib may help control steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.",

To estimate between-arm differences (Arm 3 versus \\[vs\\] Arm 1, and Arm 2 vs Arm 1) for each of the 28-day co-primary outcome probabilities.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM 1: Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least 3 days and may consider tapering after 6 months of therapy if response occurs and therapeutic corticosteroid doses have been discontinued.\n\nARM 2: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive lower dose of cb-MSCs intravenously (IV) for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.\n\nARM 3: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive higher dose of cb-MSCs IV for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 28 and then for up to 6 months."

Participants must have had a biopsy that suggests GVHD; a repeat biopsy to enroll on the study is not necessary.\n3. Karnofsky/Lansky Performance score of at least 30 at the time of study entry.\n4. Participants who are women of childbearing potential, must be non-pregnant, not breast-feeding, and use adequate contraception. Male patients must use adequate contraception\n5. Participants (or legal representative where appropriate) must be capable of providing written informed consent, and assent if indicated.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. De novo chronic GVHD\n2. Isolated acute GVHD of skin\n3. Secondary systemic therapy for acute GVHD ruxolitinib greater than 96 hours before initiation of therapy.\n4. Primary treatment with agents other than alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) glucocorticoids and ruxolitinib.\n5. Participants with uncontrolled infections will be excluded. Infections are considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of enrollment, no signs of progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection.\n6. Adult and pediatric patients with cognitive impairments and/or any serious unstable pre-existing medical condition or psychiatric disorder that can interfere with safety or with obtaining informed consent or compliance with study procedures.\n7. Participants with significant supplemental oxygen requirement defined as \\>6 L oxygen by nasal cannula.\n8. Participants with known allergy to bovine or porcine products.",
