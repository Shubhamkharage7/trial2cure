            "detailedDescription": "The study will externally validate an algorithm that combines non-invasive oxygenation and perfusion measurements as a screening tool for CCHD. In a previous study, the investigators created an algorithm that combines non-invasive measurements of oxygenation and perfusion over at least two measurements using machine learning (ML) techniques. The prior model was created and tested using internal validation (k-fold validation). Thus, the investigators will test the model on an external sample of patients to test generalizability of the model. Additionally, the team will trial a repeated measurement for any \"failure\" of the screen to assess impact on the false positive rate. Study team will also use repeated pulse oximetry measurements (up to 4 total and including measurements after 48 hours of age, which may be done outpatient) to create a new algorithm that incorporates new data over time. The central hypothesis is that the addition of non-invasive perfusion measurements will be superior to SpO2-alone screening for CCHD detection and a model that incorporates repeated measurements will enhance detection of CCHD while preserving the specificity."
