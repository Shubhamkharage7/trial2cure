Patients and community participants will complete specialized training and provide feedback on clinical trials in development through the DIVERSE process; they will also provide feedback on the process itself. Investigator participants will request review and provide feedback on the DIVERSE process. The study is based on community-based participatory research.\n\nParticipation in this research is expected to last about 18 months. It is expected that about 20 patient and community participants and 20 investigators will participate in this research study. The National Cancer Institute and American Society of Clinical Oncology are providing funding for this research study."
