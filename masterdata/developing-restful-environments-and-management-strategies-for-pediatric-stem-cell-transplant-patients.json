            "briefSummary": "Pediatric patients undergoing stem cell transplant (SCT) are hospitalized for extended periods and are at high risk for sleep disturbances. In order to begin to address the environmental issues that SCT recipients face during inpatient hospitalizations, investigators will conduct a single arm pilot study of a program entitled 'Developing Restful Environments and Management Strategies' (DREAMS). The program will provide children receiving SCT and families with information and a kit that includes tools which may support sleep and circadian health during an inpatient hospitalization.",
            "detailedDescription": "In prior work, investigators conducted a study in which sound and light levels were recorded at one-minute intervals within an inpatient room on the SCT unit at Boston Children's Hospital using noise and light meters. Results showed that pediatric SCT recipients were consistently exposed to disruptive noise and light. Nighttime noise levels always exceeded World Health Organization recommendations for sleep, with recipients regularly exposed to multiple noise spikes associated with night wakings. While light levels were frequently dim enough to be conducive to sleep at night, participants were rarely exposed to light bright enough to preserve a healthy circadian rhythm during the day, which has the potential to dysregulate sleep at night. As a child's circadian rhythms may be affected by evening light to a greater extent than adults, such light spikes may be particularly disruptive to circadian rhythms in pediatric participants. The relatively low and afternoon-skewed daytime light, combined with the brighter than recommended light during the evening and early night, has been associated with longer hospitalizations and higher morbidity among adults.\n\nThis is a single-arm pilot study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the DREAMS intervention program in stem cell transplant pediatric participants to help support families during this critical phase in a participant's SCT recovery. The data collected from this study will help understand the practicality of delivering the program to a greater number of participants and conducting clinical research about the program in the setting in which it will be implemented.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and surveys.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for about 2 weeks.\n\nIt is expected that about 10 children will take part in this research study.\n\nThe American Cancer Society is supporting this research study with grant funding."
