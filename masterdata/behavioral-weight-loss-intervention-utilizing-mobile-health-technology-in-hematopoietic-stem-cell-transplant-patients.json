Parameters include percent over the 95th percentile (%BMIp95), zBMI, fasting metabolic metrics, addictive eating habits, and motivation for change.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a pilot study enrolling obese patients, age 13-30, in an addiction model based smartphone mobile health (mHealth) weight loss intervention with coaching at a minimum of 100 days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients will be screened and enrolled by the study coordinator, who will collect/submit biospecimens in addition to patient demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes. At the initial visit and enrollment, equipment will be disbursed to patients along with a schedule that outlines the 4-month intervention plan. After the initial visit, participants will participate in two additional in-clinic visits at 2 months and at the conclusion of the study at 4 months. Participants will also be involved in weekly phone calls and daily weekday texts to discuss their status for the 4 month duration.\n\nThis study will then correlate the results in change of BMI with patient characteristics, adherence to intervention, changes in metabolic parameters, physical activity levels, and addictive eating behaviors. Investigators are aiming to recruit a total of 20 adolescents/young adults total. No pilot group is necessary since the feasibility of this intervention has been validated in prior published studies.\n\nThe proposed model of delivery makes it possible to: 1) intervene with the participant and provide autonomy, 2) deliver the material over an extended period of time in a more convenient platform for the participant and families, 3) reduce many access barriers common in conventional outpatient obesity interventions, such as transportation or missed days of school and work, and 4) help youth develop skills to overcome their addictive eating behaviors."
