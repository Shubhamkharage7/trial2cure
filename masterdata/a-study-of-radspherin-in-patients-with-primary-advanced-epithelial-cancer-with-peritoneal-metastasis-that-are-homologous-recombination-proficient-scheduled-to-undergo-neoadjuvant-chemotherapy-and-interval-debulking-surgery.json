The study will be conducted in 2 parts; first, a Safety Lead-in Cohort will be recruited followed by the randomised part of the study. For both parts of the study, patients must be scheduled to undergo NACT and IDS and complete resection to no residual tumour (R0) should be deemed to be achievable during diagnostic work-up. Patients in both parts of the study will undergo the same procedures and assessments."

Concurrent congestive heart failure or prior history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV cardiac disease.\n12.
