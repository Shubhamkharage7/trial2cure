Repeated measures will be given three times (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up) to an ACT intervention group and a support group (control). The purpose of the present study is to compare the effects of a brief ACT-based workshop for parents of children with autism with a concurrent parent support control group using a variety of self-report measures addressing psychological flexibility, depression, thought suppression, cognitive fusion, positive aspects of caregiving, stress, self-compassion, and valued living."
