            "detailedDescription": "Several studies have shown promising results of taVNS to treat various disorders such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, headache, obesity, and diabetes. However, no mechanistic studies have investigated the taVNS neural network and autonomic nervous system effects of this technique. Therefore, we aim to assess how taVNS can affect EEG metrics and HRV and assess its safety. Also, we aim to evaluate predictors that can influence the response to taVNS, so understanding the variables associated with response to taVNS can help the design of future clinical trials to maximize the effects of this intervention."
