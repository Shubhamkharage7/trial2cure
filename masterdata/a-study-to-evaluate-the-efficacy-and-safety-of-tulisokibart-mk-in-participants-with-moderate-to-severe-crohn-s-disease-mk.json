Study 2's primary hypothesis is that at least 1 tulisokibart dose level is superior to Placebo in the proportion of participants achieving clinical remission per Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (\\<150, US/FDA) or stool frequency and abdominal pain score (EU/EMA) and in the proportion of participants achieving endoscopic response at Week 12 (US/FDA and EU/EMA).",
