The adequacy of the training program for the prescribing physician, implanting physician, emergency department physician, and patients will be assessed.\n\nA minimum of 500 patients who have had prior ACS events and who remain at high risk for recurrent ACS events will be enrolled in the PAS, for the purpose of accruing 314 adjudicated True Positive (TP) or False Positive (FP) ACS events. These ACS events will contribute to the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and false positive rate (FPR) endpoints of the study.
