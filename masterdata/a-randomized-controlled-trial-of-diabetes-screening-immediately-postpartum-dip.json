            "briefSummary": "To conduct a pragmatic, non-blinded randomized controlled trial (pRCT) of immediate in-patient postpartum OGTT prior to delivery discharge (intervention) versus 4-12 week outpatient postpartum OGTT (current standard care) to improve the frequency of post-partum diabetes screening among individuals with a pregnancy complicated by GDM.",
            "detailedDescription": "Individuals with gestational diabetes (GDM) during pregnancy have up to a 10-fold increased risk of developing of T2DM. Postpartum screening facilitates detection of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus with the possibility for subsequent preventive and treatment interventions. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend screening individuals with GDM postpartum with a 75-g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) that includes a fasting blood glu-cose.4,6 This is historically performed at 4-12 weeks so that it will coincide with the timing of the typical postpartum visit. However, the rate of postpartum screening with the recommended method are low, as many individuals do not seek timely postpartum care-only a quarter to one half of individuals undergo diabetes screening in the first year postpartum. Multiple structural barriers exist for patients and healthcare providers to effectively complete postpartum diabetes screening via the current recommended method. An immediate postpartum OGTT has been proposed as an alternative to the current standard practice which is generally performed between 4-12 week postpartum OGTT at the routine postpartum visit. An immediate OGTT has comparable performance characteristics for detection of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes compared with a 4-12 week postpartum OGTT."
