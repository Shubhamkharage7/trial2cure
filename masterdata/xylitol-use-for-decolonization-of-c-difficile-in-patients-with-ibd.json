            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to assess the safety and efficacy of xylitol as an oral therapeutic for decolonization of C. difficile in IBD patients. A total of 99 patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of two xylitol doses or placebo arm. All arms will receive an identical capsule dosing for four weeks. Microbiome assessment and C. difficile testing will be performed at baseline, week 4, 8, 26, and 52.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized placebo-controlled dose-finding trial will assess the safety and efficacy of xylitol as an oral therapeutic for decolonization of C. difficile in the IBD patient population.\n\nParticipants with confirmed IBD diagnosis who are scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy for any reason at Brigham and Women's Hospital or clinic appointment at the Crohn's and Colitis Center will be eligible for screening. Participants will be screened for C. difficile colonization via colonic wash sampling during colonoscopy or whole stool following a clinic appointment.\n\nParticipants may only have inactive or mild IBD based in clinical scores (see inclusion criteria) to be eligible for screening. Risk factors for colonization will be assessed by comparing colonized vs. not colonized patients.\n\nParticipants who are found to be colonized will be randomized 1:1:1 to either placebo or one of two dosing groups of xylitol. The dose A treatment arm will receive 7.5 grams daily of xylitol via gel capsule for 4 weeks. The dose B treatment arm will receive 15 grams daily of xylitol via gel capsule for 4 weeks. The placebo arm will receive identical capsule dosing for 4 weeks. Participants will end dosing at week 4, but monitoring will continue through week 52. Both participants and study team will be blinded to treatment arm allocation.\n\nThe primary endpoints assessed are decolonization at week 8 as well as safety and tolerability through week 8. In addition, secondary efficacy outcomes including IBD disease activity and development of CDI, which will be evaluated at week 8, week 26 and week 52. Disease activity and symptoms will be recorded from informed consent through the week 52 trial visit.\n\nStool samples for biomarker assessments and C. difficile testing will be collected at scheduled trial visits per Schedule of Assessments."
