The intervention and its approach have the potential to reduce health disparities in HPV-associated cancers in youth via low-cost technology and timely intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "Guided by Social Cognitive Theory, we propose to\n\n1. examine the feasibility and acceptability of a new HPV preventive intervention, the HPV Detective video game, designed for youth and their parents;\n2. explore pre-post, intervention-related change in vaccine intent and uptake as well as change in theoretically posited intervention mediators; and\n3. assess the potential for broader intervention implementation. Using a sequential mixed-methods, 2-group (intervention vs usual care), longitudinal design, 64 parent-youth dyads (32/per study condition) will be recruited.\n\nParent-youth dyads in the intervention will play HPV Detective (tablet format) at the clinic prior to the healthcare provider visits. The control dyads will receive standard clinic treatment."
