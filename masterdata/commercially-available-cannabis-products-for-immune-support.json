            "briefSummary": "This study will be a prospective observation of the use of commercially available hemp and cannabis products marketed for immune support.",
            "detailedDescription": "In the era of COVID-19, there has been much speculation about the risks and benefits of cannabis use for immune support. It is well known that the endocannabinoid system plays a role in the regulation of the immune response and its role in inflammation reduction may be useful in terms of a potential adjunctive therapy for acute infection. Cannabis products vary widely in their composition and may have a varying effect based on the strain and the associated terpenes. Here, we aim to track cannabis and hemp usage during an acute infection to understand it's safety and effects in a symptomatic population.\n\nGiven the fast and widespread acceptance and use of cannabis products in the US market, commercial use has outpaced randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Thus, carefully designed observational studies are important to understand how these products are affecting consumers. Prospective observational designs allow for real-world examinations of commercialized products with similar effect sizes to RCTs. Although observational designs have some drawbacks, a review covering 1,583 meta-analyses across 228 medical conditions compared the effect sizes from RCTs with those from observational studies for the same medical conditions and found no differences between the two. (1) These data provide evidence that a carefully designed observational study can help us better understand the effects of commonly used products such as cannabis edibles. The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the safety and associated effects of commercially available cannabis products in the US in symptomatic individuals seeking them for immune support."
