The first three patients will part of a safety run-in. Following determination of the recommended MTD or optimal biologic dose (OBD) of SD-101 for PRVI, the study will progress to\n\nPhase 1b to assess the safety of concomitant SD-101 and CPI usage, along with preliminary efficacy. Patients in Phase 1b will receive the SD-101 dose selected from Phase 1 together with systemic anti-PD-1, defined as any FDA approved anti-PD-1, checkpoint blockade. SD-101 will be administered over 2 cycles, with 1 dose per cycle and each cycle being about 6 weeks apart."
