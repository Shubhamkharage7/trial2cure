The study also aims to compare the electrical neuromodulation therapy (TEA) with medical neuromodulation therapy (escitalopram) in their ability to treat abdominal pain and improve the autonomic dysfunction in participants with IBS-C. This project will investigate the impact of 3 active treatment interventions vs. a sham control intervention on abdominal pain and other IBS symptoms in participants with IBS-C. This is a parallel-group study in which the participants will be divided into 4 treatment groups designed to investigate the feasibility of TEA using optimized parameters in comparison with medical neuromodulation therapy (escitalopram) and sham-TEA. The treatment will be home-based and last for a period of 8 weeks. To preserve scientific integrity and effective masking, certain details of arms and interventions will be made more precise upon or prior to reporting results"
