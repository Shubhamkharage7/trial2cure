Interoception involves your ability to feel sensations in your body (such as your heartbeat or muscle tension) as well as how you think about and interpret those sensations. Interoception may be an important component of chronic pain and the research team is studying whether yoga can change how you feel, think about, and interpret sensations in your body."
