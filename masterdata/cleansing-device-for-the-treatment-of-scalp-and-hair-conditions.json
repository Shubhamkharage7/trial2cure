            "detailedDescription": "Seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff are skin conditions that present with common features and respond similarly to treatments. Dandruff involves flaking skin that can cause irritation and itching. Dandruff only involves the scalp, whereas seborrheic dermatitis can occur on the scalp, face, chest, and retro-auricular areas. Seborrheic dermatitis can also result in itching and flaking, as well as inflammation and erythema. Both dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are known to be harmful to the scalp.\n\nDespite shampoo and washing, one may still continue to have flaking and scale present on the scalp. There are numerous scalp massages and brushes on the consumer market. Waterpik\u00ae was FDA approved in 2018 to provide pressured water combined with a powered toothbrush for optimal plaque and particle removal when cleaning the mouth and teeth. Waterpik\u00ae now has several products on the market designed for oral health, pet care, and washing in the shower. The off-label design utilizes the Waterpik\u00ae device, but with adjustments optimized for scalp health.\n\nThrough the investigational use of the off-label WaterPik\u00ae and brush device, the investigators propose the technique of massage and gentle water pressure will reduce seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff on the scalp."
