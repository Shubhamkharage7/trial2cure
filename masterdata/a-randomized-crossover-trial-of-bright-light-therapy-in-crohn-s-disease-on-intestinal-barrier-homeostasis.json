            "briefSummary": "Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are two of the most significant chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and affects over 1.5 million individuals in the U.S. Recently, there has been an increased understanding of the importance of sleep and sleep disruption in IBD as a potentially modifiable risk factor. We, therefore, hypothesize that intervening with morning bright light therapy (BLT) in IBD patients with CM will decrease intestinal permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines, positively impact intestinal microbiota, and improve quality of life (QoL).",
            "detailedDescription": "Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are two of the most significant chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). IBD affects over 1.5 million individuals in the US, so identifying risk factors for disease flares is essential to avoid complications, such as hospitalizations and surgery, and to improve quality of life (QoL). Recently, there has been an increased understanding of the importance of sleep and sleep disruption in IBD as a potentially modifiable risk factor.\n\nBright light therapy (BLT) in IBD patients with CM may decrease intestinal permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines, positively impact intestinal microbiota, and improve quality of life (QoL).In order to administer BLT efficiently and safely, a Re-Timer device, which is a lightweight, wearable set of glasses that emits blue-green light. Please note, the FDA has determined this device to be a General Wellness product and is not regulated by the FDA.\n\nPrior to starting treatment, IBD patients will be screened for subclinical inflammation using a fecal calprotectin (FC) level and a blood test. If no subclinical inflammation is detected, potential subjects will be informed of their ineligibility. Eligible participants will complete questionnaires assessing their dietary habits, fatigue, sleep habits, quality of life, and severity of their underlying disease. Participants will also be provided a wrist actigraphy, which is a watch like device, to wear for 21 days to objectively assess CM prior to initiating therapy. Once the subjects demonstrate both subjective and objective evidence of CM, during their follow-up visit they will be randomly assigned to wear either the Re-Timer device to receive BLT or the placebo Re-Timer device (non BLT) for 4 weeks. Prior to and following receiving BLT or non BLT placebo, the following samples will be obtained: i) serum markers of inflammation and endotoxemia, ii) urine samples to test for intestinal permeability, and iii) stool samples to assess intestinal microbiota. These proposed studies will assess whether BLT has an impact on IBD patients' inflammation, intestinal permeability, and intestinal microbiota."
