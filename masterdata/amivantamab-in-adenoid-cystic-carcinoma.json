However, this type of cancer tends to have a high rate of recurrence and metastatic spread, which develops over several years. We hypothesize that amivantamab, a bispecific EGFR and MET inhibitor will be efficacious in ACC. Patients will receive amivantamab at 1050mg weekly for the first cycle and biweekly thereafter (1400mg for patients \u226580kg)."

Subject has uncontrolled illness, including but not limited to:\n* Uncontrolled diabetes\n* Ongoing or active infection (includes infection requiring treatment with antimicrobial therapy \\[participants will be required to complete antibiotics 1 week prior to starting study treatment\\] or diagnosed or suspected viral infection).\n* Active bleeding diathesis\n* Impaired oxygenation requiring continuous oxygen supplementation (e.g., due to medical condition requiring chronic continuous oxygen therapy).\n* Psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Any ophthalmologic condition that is clinically unstable\n\n  10. Active or past medical history of Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, including drug-induced or radiation ILD/ pneumonitis.\n\n  11. Participant had major surgery excluding placement of vascular access or tumor biopsy or had significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks before enrollment, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned during the time the participant is expected to participate in the study. Note: Participants with planned surgical procedures to be conducted under local anesthesia may participate.\n\n  12. Immune-mediated rash from checkpoint inhibitors that has not resolved prior to enrollment.\n\n  13. Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia or Grade 2 neuropathy.\n\n  14. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients who have received other investigational agents previously who are no longer receiving these investigational agents may be eligible at the discretion of the PI. A 30 day washout from last dose of previous anticancer drug is required.\n\n  15. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with amivantamab.\n\n  16.
