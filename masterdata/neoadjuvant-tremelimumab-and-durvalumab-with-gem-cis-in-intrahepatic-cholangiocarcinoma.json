The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the rate of conversion of unresectable tumor to resectable cancer?\n* What are the side effects of this treatment combination?\n\nParticipants will undergo an initial tumor biopsy, imaging and laboratory studies prior to starting treatment with durvalumab, tremelimumab, gemcitabine and cisplatin. Participants will continue for 4 cycles and if the tumor is found to be resectable then they will undergo surgical resection. If the tumor is unresectable (can't be surgically removed) after 4 cycles, then participants will receive 4 more cycles and repeated imaging. If the tumor remains unresectable then the participant will be treated with capecitabine for up to 8 cycles and durvalumab for up to 12 months."
