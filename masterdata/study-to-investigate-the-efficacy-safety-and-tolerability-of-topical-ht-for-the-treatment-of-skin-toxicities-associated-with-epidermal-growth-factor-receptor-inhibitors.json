The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Determine the therapeutic effect of HT-001 for treatment of patients who develop acneiform rash undergoing Epidermal Growth Factor inhibitor (EGFRI) therapy using the acneiform rash investigator's global assessment scale \\[ARIGA\\]\n* Evaluate the safety of HT-001 during treatment\n\nParticipants will apply HT-001 Gel once per day for 6 weeks, during which the effect on treating acneiform rash or other skin disorders induced by EGFRI therapy will be evaluated using different assessment tools to measure severity of rash, pain, and itching (pruritus), as well as the change in quality of life.\n\nThe study will be completed in 2 periods: the first period is open-label (unblinded) and all patients will receive HT-001 topical gel with the active ingredient; the second period is blinded and patients will be randomized to receive one of three concentrations of HT-001 or placebo.\n\nResearchers will compare HT-001 to the placebo in the second period to see if HT-001 provides a significant treatment effect.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2a dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of HT-001 for treatment of EGFRI-induced skin toxicity. The study will include adult patients (\u2265 18 years of age) scheduled to receive initial or repeat EGFRI therapy.\n\nThe study will be conducted in 2 periods: Part 1, an open-label cohort consisting of 12 patients to measure pharmacokinetics of HT 001 gel followed by Part 2, a randomized, parallel arm study comparing 3 dose strengths of HT-001 gel to placebo (HT 001 vehicle). Patients in the randomized cohorts will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment arms in a 2:2:2:1 ratio (active groups = 2: placebo = 1).\n\nAll patients in both open-label and blinded cohorts will apply the study drug once a day to each area affected with cutaneous toxicity up to 30% body surface area (BSA) involvement, inclusive of skin, scalp, and nails.\n\nThe goal of the study is to determine the minimum efficacious dose strength(s) for further investigation. The dose effect, together with the application site safety assessments, and therapeutic effects based on the primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated."

Patient has abnormal laboratory values at Screening/Baseline (V1):\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count \\< 1000/mm3 and WBC count \\< 3000/mm3\n   2. Platelet count \\< 50,000/mm3\n   3. Aspartate transaminase (AST) \\> 2.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   4. Alanine transaminase (ALT) \\> 2.5 \u00d7 ULN\n   5. Bilirubin \\> 1.5 \u00d7 ULN\n   6. Creatinine \\> 1.5 \u00d7 ULN\n5. Patient has a prescribed cancer treatment plan that requires radiation treatment to the head, neck, or upper trunk concurrent with EGFRI therapy or has previously received radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline (V1).\n6. Patient has received aprepitant or other neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline (V1).\n7. Patient has had prior treatment with an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline (V1), or at least 8 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer.\n8. Patient has an active infection (eg, pneumonia) or any uncontrolled disease except for the malignancy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the result or the study or pose unwarranted risk in administering the study drug to the patient.\n9. Patient has received non-stable escalating doses of topical antibiotics, topical steroids, or other topical treatments within 14 days prior to Screening/Baseline (V1). Patients who have been on stable doses of topical antibiotics, topical steroids, or other topical treatments for 14 days or more are allowed to be enrolled and to stay on their current prescription. Reduction in dose due to improvement in EGFRI-related toxicities is allowed.\n10. Patient has used non-stable escalating doses of systemic steroids within 14 days prior to Screening/Baseline (V1) excluding low-dose systemic corticosteroids as part of standard of care for prevention or treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; acceptability of the steroid and dose is to be determined by the study Investigator. Patients who have been on a stable dose of systemic steroids for 14 days or more are allowed to be enrolled and to stay on their current prescription. Reduction in dose due to improvement in EGFRI-related toxicities is allowed. Use of steroid inhalers and nasal corticosteroids is allowed.\n11. Patient has received non-stable escalating dose treatment with a systemic antibiotic within 14 days prior to Screening/Baseline (V1). Patients who have been on stable doses of systemic antibiotics for 14 days or more are allowed to be enrolled and to stay on their current prescription. Reduction in dose due to improvement in EGFRI-related toxicities is allowed.\n12. Patient has received concomitant treatment with pimozide, moderate to strong cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (diltiazem, ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir), or strong CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) within 30 days of Screening/Baseline (V1).\n13. Patient has a history of hypersensitivity to aprepitant or any component of HT-001.\n14. Patient is pregnant or lactating at Screening/Baseline (V1) or planning to become pregnant (self or partner) at any time during the study, including the follow-up period.",
