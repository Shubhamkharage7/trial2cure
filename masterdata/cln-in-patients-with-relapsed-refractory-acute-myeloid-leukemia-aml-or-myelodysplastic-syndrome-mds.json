The transient use of corticosteroids for transfusion premedication or the treatment of infusion or transfusion reactions will not be considered for this criterion. Topical corticosteroids and steroid eye drops are allowed, and will not exclude the patient from eligibility.\n   8. Prior treatment with a FLT3-directed bispecific molecule, or a FLT3-targeted antibody.\n7. Currently participating/previously participated in an interventional study and received an investigational drug within 14 days (or five half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of CLN-049.\n8.

Patients with any active autoimmune disease or a history of known or suspected autoimmune disease, or history of a syndrome that requires systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for patients with vitiligo, psoriasis (in consultation with the Sponsor), resolved childhood asthma/atopy or autoimmune thyroid disorders on stable thyroid hormone supplementation.\n10. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy or whose control may be jeopardized by the complications of this therapy.\n11. Any concurrent condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the drug.\n12. Active uncontrolled infection within seven days of first dose of CLN-049. Prophylactic use of systemic antiviral, antibacterial, or antifungal agents for treatment of chronic, controlled infection or as prophylaxis is permitted.\n13. Has a history of, or a positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 1/2 or primary immunodeficiency disease such as HIV.\n14. Known history of hepatitis B (with positive testing for either hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] or hepatitis B core Ab), hepatitis C (HCV) infection (with positive testing for HCV antibody and/or HCV ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\] in serum), or acute hepatitis A (with positive testing for hepatitis A IgM). Note: patients with chronic HCV with undetectable viral load defined by sustained virologic response 24 weeks (SVR24) after completion of anti-hepatitis C treatment will be eligible. Patients with hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] or hepatitis B core Ab with negative viral load will be eligible.\n15. Active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection including history of positive SARS-CoV-2 testing without subsequent documentation of negative test results, patients with results that are pending but not yet known, or patients with suspected active infection based on clinical features\n16. History of the following events in conjunction with prior treatment with immunotherapy: Grade 3 or greater neurotoxicity, ocular toxicity, pneumonitis, myocarditis, or colitis; liver dysfunction meeting the laboratory criteria for Hy's Law.\n17.
