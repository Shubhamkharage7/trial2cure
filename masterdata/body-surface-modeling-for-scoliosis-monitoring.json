            "briefSummary": "This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized reproducibility study of the NSite device in patients undergoing evaluation for scoliosis. The NSite device is a pre-market, investigational device. The study will enroll 13 eligible patients, who will be scanned using the NSite device by 3 separate users in order to assess if the device generates similar results across users. This data will be used to support 510(k) submission.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to validate the reproducibility of device output in multiple users in a clinical setting. Device output will be predicted probability of major curve magnitude (i.e., Cobb angle) greater than or equal to 20 degrees with 95% confidence interval. We will test whether users obtain similar device output when measuring the same participant (at least 2 scans required for analysis). After excluding bad quality scans, the measurements obtained by these different users (at least 2 users after excluding bad scans) on each study participant will then be compared to determine if they are congruent (having overlapping confidence intervals) or different. The percentage of participants for which users generated congruent predicted probabilities will be reported.\n\nThe NSite Scoliosis Assessment App is intended as a clinical decision support tool and requires interpretation by the healthcare professional. It is intended for use for children and adolescent patients 10 to 18 years old. It is for use by prescription only. The NSite Scoliosis Assessment App provides a calculated Asymmetry Index for patients with or at risk for scoliosis, which will yield an output of percentage risk of major curve magnitude (i.e., Cobb angle) greater than 20 degrees, with 95% confidence intervals."

The patient will be asked to assume a forward bending position. One user will capture a scan of the patient's back in this position. The user will calibrate the device and then walk around the patient while scanning per app directions. Once this user captures the scan, it will be processed by the application. New scans will then be obtained by the two other users. Once all users have captured a scan, the scanning process and patient participation will be completed.",
