            "detailedDescription": "LTLD is a heat-activated formulation of liposomal doxorubicin that releases the drug when exposed to hyperthermic conditions (40-45\u00b0C). This novel agent has been well tolerated in adults with similar toxicity profile to doxorubicin. MR-HIFU offers a non-invasive and non-ionizing ability to selectively heat large tissue volumes. Thus, MR-HIFU is a promising technology for triggering doxorubicin release from LTLD. The investigator's approach involves continuous maintenance of the target at mild hyperthermia with MR-HIFU following LTLD infusion. Following hyperthermia, the investigators will deliver ablation therapy (\\>55\u00b0C) to targeted areas of tumor where feasible and safe. Addition of this ablation therapy after mild-hyperthermia-triggered drug delivery with LTLD has the potential to significantly potentiate chemotherapy with minimal additional adverse effects to improve local control and drug delivery without increasing toxicity."
