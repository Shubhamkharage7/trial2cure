            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy, patient preference, and utility of a novel eye shield that utilizes a different adhesive mechanism in comparison to the current standard of care. The aims are to see if this product could be incorporated into postoperative care in the future to improve patient satisfaction and compliance.\n\nThe study will involve 20 patients during the postoperative timeframe after cataract extraction and intraocular lens placement (CEIOL). These patients will be chosen from the clinic of Dr. Marc Toeteberg who will plan to have both eye surgeries done within 3 months of each other. These patients will be randomized to either control or intervention group. Intervention group will receive our novel eye shield prototype, while control group will receive an Alcon plastic eye shield. Both groups will receive the eye shields after surgery and will be sent home with these eye shields with normal postoperative care directions. Patient will be directed to wear eye shields for 24 hours then at night for first 2 weeks after surgery, while adhering to postoperative eye drops regimen.\n\nAfter successfully healing and passing the postoperative timeframe for the first eye we will proceed to the second arm of the study. Approximately 1-2 months after healing from the first surgery, patient will be scheduled for cataract surgery on the other eye, as is standard of care. After surgery on the second eye the patient will be given the other eye shield than what they received after the first surgery (control groups will receive the novel eye shield and experimental groups will receive the control eye shield). They will proceed to follow identical postoperative protocols after the second surgery. A short quantitative and qualitative questionnaire directly comparing the two eye shield experiences will be provided at the 1 month follow-up after the eye surgery."
