            "briefSummary": "This study aims to investigate the impact of accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on brain function and behavior in patients with focal hand dystonia. Previous research demonstrated that individualized TMS improved dystonic behavior after one session. Building on this, the current study administers four TMS sessions in a day, with assessments conducted on the same day, two weeks, and twelve weeks after each session. The research involves 10 in-person visits and focuses on functional MRI brain scans and writing behavior analysis. The potential risk of seizures from TMS is mitigated through careful screening, adhering to safety guidelines. The study's main benefit is enhancing dystonic behavior and deepening the understanding of brain changes caused by TMS in focal hand dystonia, paving the way for further advancements in clinical therapy for this condition.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim of this research is to investigate the impact of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on both brain function and behavioral outcomes among individuals suffering from focal hand dystonia. A preliminary examination of a previous TMS study carried out by our team revealed that the application of TMS, using personalized, fMRI-guided brain targeting and interleaved TMS delivery during motor tasks, has the potential to modify brain activity and ameliorate dystonic behavior after a single session of TMS in patients with focal hand dystonia. This present study seeks to build upon these promising findings by administering four TMS sessions in a single day, interspersed with four rest intervals, a protocol referred to as \"accelerated TMS.\" The investigation will consist of a total of ten in-person appointments. Participants with focal hand dystonia will receive accelerated TMS during three in-person visits. Following each TMS session, participants will evaluate changes in brain function and behavior. During the assessment visits, individuals will undergo functional MRI brain scans and engage in writing tasks on an electronic tablet. The principal risk associated with TMS is the possibility of inducing a seizure. However, this study will strictly adhere to safety guidelines, utilizing TMS levels that have not previously been linked to seizures in properly screened individuals. Notably, the dosages of TMS proposed for use in this study have not caused seizures in healthy volunteers. To further mitigate the risk of seizures, potential subjects will undergo medical screening for any known factors that could predispose them to seizures. The primary advantage of this study lies in its potential to enhance dystonic behavior in patients with focal hand dystonia, while also deepening our comprehension of the foundational changes in brain function before and after TMS intervention for focal hand dystonia. The discoveries stemming from this investigation will pave the way for future research endeavors aimed at advancing brain stimulation as a viable clinical therapy for focal hand dystonia."
