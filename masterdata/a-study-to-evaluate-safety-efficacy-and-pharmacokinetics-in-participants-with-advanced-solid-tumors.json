Participants with prior brain metastases treated at least 4 weeks before the first dose of EU101 that are clinically stable and do not require chronic corticosteroid treatment are allowed. Untreated but asymptomatic and clinically stable brain metastases per investigator's discretion are allowed\n* Received prior therapy with any anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or agent\n* Major surgery requiring general anesthesia within 3 weeks before first dose of EU101 or still recovering from prior surgery\n* Active infection that is not controlled or requires intravenous antibiotics in the last 2 weeks\n* History of allogeneic tissue or organ transplant\n* Active hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection\n* History of any noninfectious hepatitis\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* Received or receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy or any other form of systemic immunosuppressive medicaion 1 week before first dose of EU101\n* Known severe (\u2265Grade 3) hypersensitivity reactions to antibody, or severe reaction to immuno-oncology agents requiring treatment with steroids\n* Konwn or suspected hypersensitivity to EU101 or any component of its formulation\n* Current or history of interstitial lung disease, anaphylaxis, uncontrolled asthma, or pneumonitis that has required systemic corticosteroids\n* Patients with second primary cancer\n* Clinically significant concurrent cardiovascular disease\n* Pregnant women, breasfeeding women, WOCBP, or men with partners who are WOCBP who do not agree to use adequate contraceptive measures\n* Determined as unable to participate in the study per investigator's judgment\n\nOther protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply",
