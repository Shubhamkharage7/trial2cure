There are two versions of this intervention: 1) a dyadic version to be delivered to CWI youth and their caregiver of origin, and 2) a caregiver-only version to be delivered to any caregiver (including kinship caregivers) of a CWI youth. The study involves iteratively adapting the intervention with feedback from youth and caregiver participants and stakeholder partners, as well as evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention."
