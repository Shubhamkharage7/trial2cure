Participants will first complete an 8-hour drug administration session and after this initial session, participants will take participants' assigned study drug for the next 14 days at home, twice daily (participants will visit the lab on days 2, 7, and 14). Participants will return on day 21 (after 1 week washout) for a final visit. During the 8-hour session and visits occurring during the following 21 days, participants will provide biospecimens (urine, blood, oral fluid, hair) which will be tested for cannabinoid concentrations. Pharmacodynamic assessments (subjective and cognitive effects) will also be assessed during these visits."
