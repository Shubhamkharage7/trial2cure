Researchers want to see the levels of COX-1 (measured as distribution volume VT) are elevated in the brain of two groups of mood disorders patients undergoing MDE relative to the control group.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo determine whether COX-1 and COX-2 are detectable in the brains of individuals with MDD experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE).\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18-70 years with MDD and Healthy Volunteers aged 18 70 years.\n\nDesign:\n\nGroup A: MDD participants will be studied with the same dose of \\[11C\\]MC1 before and after administration of 600 mg celecoxib; the study is neither randomized nor placebo-controlled. Group B: MDD participants, both medicated and unmedicated, will be studied with \\[11C\\]PS13 and compared to healthy volunteers..\n\nhttps://nimhcontent.nimh.nih.gov/start/surveys/?s=TJW4RA4WN3LDD988",

Group B - Calculation of the density of COX-1 using \\[11C\\]PS13\n\nSecondary Endpoints, common to both groups:\n\n1. the relationship between peripheral markers of inflammation and COX binding;\n2. the relationship between clinical rating scales and COX binding"

Participants should not have taken NSAIDs for two weeks prior to the PET scan. Aspirin, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate) must not have been taken in the prior month.\n4. Participants with a history of DSM-5 substance use disorder (except for caffeine or nicotine dependence) within the preceding three months. In addition, participants must not have substance use disorder or alcohol use disorder. However, alcohol or cannabis use by themselves are not exclusion criteria, unless that use impairs function of daily life.\n5. Participants who have an unstable medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, makes participation unsafe (e.g., an active infection or untreated malignancy).\n6.

Have recent exposure to radiation related to research (e.g., PET from other research) that, when combined with this study, would be above the allowable limits.\n8.

Pregnancy.\n11. HIV Infection.\n12. Be NIMH staff or an NIH employee who is a subordinate/relative/co-worker of the investigators.\n\nEXCLUSION OF CHILDREN:\n\nBecause this protocol has more than minimal risk from radiation exposure without possibility of direct benefit, inclusion of children is not appropriate.\n\nEXCLUSION OF PREGNANT OR BREASTFEEDING WOMEN:\n\nPregnant women will be excluded because this protocol involves exposure to ionizing radiation. Lactating women will be excluded because radioisotopes may be excreted in milk.\n\nEXCLUSION OF PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE HIV POSITIVE:\n\nPersons with HIV infection are excluded because HIV infection itself may cause neuroinflammation, and we wish to specifically study the effect of depression on neuroinflammation.\n\nEXCLUSION OF NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PARTICIPANTS:\n\nNon-English-speaking participants will be excluded from participation in this study because neuropsychological testing is required by this protocol.
