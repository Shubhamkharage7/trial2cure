Black adults who are insufficiently active will be randomized to the HH intervention or an attention control group. We hypothesize that we will meet our recruitment goal of 50 participants over 5 months, \u226580% of participants will be retained at post-intervention and follow up, and \u226580% will adhere to sessions.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nThe secondary objectives of this study are:\n\n2.a. To explore the effects of HH on sitting time and LPA in Black adults who are insufficiently active. Participants will complete assessments at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 9), and follow-up (week 24), and changes in measured sitting time and LPA from week 0 to 9 will be assessed.\n\n2.b. To evaluate acceptability of the intervention and assessment protocols via in-depth interviews. After follow-up, we will conduct interviews with community partners (n=2), delivery agents (n=2), and participants (n=16) to assess acceptance and refine training and implementation protocols in preparation for a future large-scale randomized controlled efficacy trial."
