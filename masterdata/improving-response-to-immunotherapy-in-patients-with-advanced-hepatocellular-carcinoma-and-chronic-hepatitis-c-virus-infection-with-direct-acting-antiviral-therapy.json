Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n23. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n24. Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB; Bacillus tuberculosis).\n25. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of trial drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n26. Has untreated active HBV. Note: Antiviral therapy for HBV must be given for at least 3 months before the first dose of the study drug, and HBV viral load must be less than 100 IU/mL before the first dose of the study drug. Those on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 100 IU/mL should stay on the same therapy throughout the study treatment. HBsAg, HBsAb, anti-HBe, anti-HBc, and HBV DNA must be measured at baseline and during the study. Those subjects who are anti-HBc (+) and negative for HBsAg and HBV DNA do not require HBV prophylaxis but need monitoring with HBsAg, HBsAb, anti-HBe, anti-HBc, and HBV DNA\n27. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of the planned start of study therapy (Cycle 1, Day 1). Note: The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n28. Subjects with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease are excluded due to the hemolytic anemia associated with RBV. Subjects with proven coronary artery disease or angina.\n29. Has received prior first-line therapy within 14 days of the first dose of study medication.\n30. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n31. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperating with the requirements of the trial.",
