            "briefSummary": "To evaluate the impact of an adapted online, self-help relationship intervention (supplemented with brief coach calls) for survivors of breast cancer and their partners. Couples will be randomized to receive either the online intervention (Together after Cancer) or usual care (UC) and assessed at baseline, end of the program, and 3 months after randomization.",
            "detailedDescription": "As the fastest-growing and largest ethnic minority group, projections indicate that 128 million Latinos will reside in the United States by 2050; with one in three Latinos receiving a diagnosis of cancer during his/her lifetime. Latino cancer survivors have a lower quality of life, experience distress due to strained spousal and family relationships, have poorer physical health, and have more depression, pain, and fatigue when compared to non-Latinos. In addition, emotional and mental well-being between Latino survivors and their partners is related, with partners also experiencing increased distress and physical symptoms. Research has shown that couples-based psychosocial programs improve the quality of life and emotional and physical health of cancer survivors and their partners. Yet, much of the in this area has focused on non-Hispanic Whites. Features of Latino culture may influence and interact with social, psychosocial, health care, and clinical factors that influence cancer-related outcomes. Our goal is to add to this literature and develop a program for Latina breast cancer survivors and their partners that is culturally meaningful and relevant and responds to their needs and concerns.\n\nSpecifically, investigators plan to culturally adapt a widely-available and effective online couple intervention, OurRelationship (ORI), for Latina breast cancer survivors and their intimate partners. The online OR program - which can be done on a smartphone, tablet, or computer - was developed to serve as an online tool to help couples solve a specific relationship problem they selected. Investigators will adapt the OR program to be useful for Latina breast cancer survivors and their intimate partners using feedback from focus groups with patients, community partners, and research advisors. Once investigators have completed our adaptation, the plan to test the impact of the adapted program, Together after Cancer, using a type of study called a randomized controlled trial where participants will be randomly allocated to either receive the culturally adapted intervention or usual care. Investigators are interested in learning if couples in the group that are assigned to the intervention program report changes in their relationship functioning, psychological functioning (depression, anxiety, and perceived stress), and cancer-related quality of life (pain, fatigue, body image, and quality of life) compared to couples who are assigned to the UC group.\n\nThrough this comparative study, investigators expect to establish effective strategies that can be implemented in clinic and community settings to improve psychological functioning, relationship functioning, and quality of life. Investigators are enthusiastic about the potential for the intervention program to easily reach cancer Latina survivors around the nation, due to the online format and ease of access from any location. Throughout the project, investigators will continue to engage our local partners to ensure that the study procedures and outcomes are meaningful to all stakeholders.\n\nInvestigators are using patient-centered approaches to offer a culturally relevant web-based program that cancer survivors and their partners can access from the comfort of their homes."

In addition to the online content, couples will receive up to 100 minutes of scheduled research check-in/coaching calls from a research assistant to check-in. These coach calls will occur via a video chat via Zoom or, if not possible given a couple's technology limitations, over the phone. The coach calls serve several purposes: a) helping couples stay accountable to staying on the recommended schedule of activity completion; b) addressing any technical or program questions the couple has; and c) collecting research data as couples move through the program.",

At Sylvester, the Cancer Support Services offers caregiver support groups, \"mental well-being\" services (i.e., individual therapy), and an online support community for patients, caregivers, and survivors. At Moffitt, Support Services offers psychotherapy, support groups for patients, support groups for family/caregivers of cancer patients, and a program to help patients talk with their children about their diagnosis. At AdventHealth, patients are offered referrals to social services and psychoeducational programs like HEAL. However, none of the sites have services designed to focus on issues specific to patients' romantic relationships."
