The trial will aim to complete a total of 36 participants: 12 total participants within each age category and 18 participants within each HbA1c category; 12 participants at each site. The study may enroll up to 70 participants to account for dropouts across the study. The study will be performed for 5 days and 4 nights at a local hotel/rental. Following the hotel session, participants will undergo a 7 day/6-night remote monitored at-home use session. The study will also conduct a two-week control period gathering data on glycemic control and insulin administration with the participants usual care therapy. Participants will be randomized 1:1, stratified by age cohort, to either group A (control period prior to AIDANET use) or group B (control period after AIDANET use)."
