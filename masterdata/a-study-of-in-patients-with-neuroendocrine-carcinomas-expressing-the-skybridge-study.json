This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of PT217 in subjects with neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nPatients with the following tumor types will be eligible for screening: small cell lung cancer (SCLC), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC), and extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma (EP-NEC), including but not limited to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (GEP-NEC). Patients must have progressed after standard therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy) or standard therapy has proven to be ineffective, intolerable or is considered inappropriate."

Patients with a known concurrent malignancy that is progressing or has required treatment for active disease within the previous 24 months. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or other noninvasive or indolent malignancies that have either previously undergone potentially curative therapy or don't have active treatment indication (e.g., low grade prostate cancer).\n9. Patients who have received an investigational product, within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to start of study drug or who have not recovered from adverse events of prior therapy, either in the metastatic or adjuvant setting.\n10. Prior treatment with T-cell engager, CAR-T, NK cell engager, CAR-NK, DLL3 or CD47 targeting therapies, or anti-SIRP\u03b1 (signal regulatory protein alpha) targeting agents (prior Checkpoint inhibitor anti PD-1 and anti PD-L1 therapies are allowed).\n11.

Prior hemolytic anemia or Evans Syndrome in the last 3 months.\n15. RBC transfusion during the 4-week period prior to enrollment. RBC transfusions are not permitted during the screening period and prior to enrollment to meet the hemoglobin inclusion criteria.\n16. Patients who have \u2265 Grade 3 neuropathy.\n17. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia \\[triglycerides \\> 500 mg/dL\\], or active infection requiring parenteral treatment) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol.\n18. Patients who have received chemotherapy or small molecule targeted therapy, \u2264 5 half-lives or 3 weeks, whichever is shorter (6 weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin-C), other targeted therapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to starting study drug.
