MTK assessment will also be conducted on 150 non-injured adults matched to the injured cohort on age and gender. These individuals will be enrolled and assessed once at two participating centers.

Currently, a standard form will be available for researchers outside METRC to request access to final data generated from METRC studies. These requests will be transmitted to the METRC Coordinating Center for initial review to make sure the relevant materials are provided in support of the request. METRC is committed to making data as widely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of study participants and protecting the intellectual property of the Consortium.\n\nData will only be made available after it is completely stripped of identifiable information such as dates, geographic locators, and any other event information which is sufficiently rare as to make it possible to deduce the identity of an individual participant. When necessary for complete de-identification, data may be grouped."
