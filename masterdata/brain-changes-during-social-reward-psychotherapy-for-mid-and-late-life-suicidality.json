There is a critical need to develop a mechanistic understanding of the link between social disconnection and suicidality, identify biological targets, and address targets with scalable interventions. The investigators developed a novel psychotherapy, Engage \\& Connect, aimed to improve functions of the Positive Valence System (PVS) that are impaired in suicidality through increased engagement in rewarding social activities. This study will use state-of-the-art precision imaging methods and clinical measures to evaluate brain- and behavioral changes in the PVS during psychotherapy.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Be randomly assigned to 9-weekly sessions of either Engage \\& Connect therapy or Symptom Review and Psychoeducation\n* Complete 4 research assessments\n* Complete 3 MRI scans"
