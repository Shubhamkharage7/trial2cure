            "detailedDescription": "The main objective of this study is to compare the independent and combined effects of a 12-month intervention of resistance training (RT) plus bone-loading exercises and bisphosphonate use on dietary weight loss (WL)-associated bone loss among older adults, with an indication for WL, and low bone density to explore lasting treatment efficacy. All participants will receive the same group-mediated dietary WL intervention and be randomized to one of four groups. Due to its robust change following dietary WL and clinical utility in predicting fracture, the study's primary outcome is change in total hip areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measured via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This will be complemented by DXA assessment at other skeletal sites, as well as high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) derived compartmental volumetric (v)BMD, trabecular bone microarchitecture, cortical thickness/porosity, and strength at the distal radius and tibia allowing for assessment of intervention effectiveness on novel measures of bone quality."
