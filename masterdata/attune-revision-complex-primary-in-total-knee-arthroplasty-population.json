            "detailedDescription": "Within primary TKA, there are factors that lead to more complex procedures that include patients with high BMIs, advanced preoperative deformities and ligamentous laxity. Such cases may require the surgeon to treat using ancillary components, such as stems and/or augments and/or additional constraint.\n\nThis post-market study will evaluate the short/medium term clinical performance and medium term survivorship of the ATTUNE Revision system system, which includes instrumentation, in complex primary TKA. The study is designed as a worldwide non-comparative, multi-center study with each site initially having a cohort of approximately 20 Subjects to recruit. The study will enroll approximately 200 fixed bearing and approximately 200 rotating platform configurations.\n\nThe 2-year KOOS-ADL (activities of daily living) was selected as the primary endpoint because it will evaluate the post-operative period during which outcomes typically plateau and will therefore provide a good indication of longer term outcomes\n\nMale and female Subjects, age 22-80 years, inclusive, who require a primary knee arthroplasty in a joint that, due to deformity, instability, bone loss etc., necessitates the use of implants found within the ATTUNE Revision knee system and are suitable candidates for TKA using the ATTUNE\u00ae Revision system are eligible for enrollment in this study."
