The purpose of this observational, mixed-methods study is to better understand the relationship between prolonged sedentary behavior and cardiovascular and metabolic health in older women.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will recruit 20 women age 60-75 years, n=10 with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes (T2D) and n=10 healthy controls. Participants will wear two accelerometers and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for two different periods of 7 days for objective assessment of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and blood glucose, respectively, and complete a graded exercise test (cardiorespiratory fitness), assessment of insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and single leg exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy (microvascular function). Participants will also complete a semi-structured qualitative interview to understand knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and questionnaires to assess the relationship between modifiable psychological and behavioral factors and sedentary behavior.\n\nThe aims of the study are to:\n\n1. Compare objectively-measured, free-living physical activity and sedentary behavior between older women with and without T2D.\n2. Evaluate the relationship between prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior, cardiorespiratory fitness, glucose control, insulin sensitivity, and skeletal muscle microvascular function in older women with and without T2D.\n3. Assess knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and characterize the relationship between knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and modifiable psychological and behavioral factors in older women with T2D.\n4. Evaluate the relationship between sedentary behavior, mood states, and meaning salience during \"normal\" life and the period of confinement imposed by the COVID-19 epidemic."
