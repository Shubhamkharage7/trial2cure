            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether Behavioral Activation for depression delivered via home based telehealth (BA-HT) is effective in improving social and role functioning in Veterans recently discharged from Cardiovascular disease (CVD-related) inpatient care. Eligible participants will receive either (1) twelve sessions of BA-HT or (2) standard best practices post CVD hospitalization care.\n\nStudy participants will be 132 Veterans discharged from the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center inpatient care facilities with CVD diagnoses corresponding to ICD 10 codes I20-I25 (120 unstable angina, stable angina; 121 NSTEMI, STEMI, initial encounter; 122 NSTEMI, STEMI, subsequent encounter; 124 acute coronary syndrome; 125 coronary arteriosclerosis with angina). They will be male or female, age 21 and above, and with approximately 40-50% minority representation. There will be assessment at baseline, 1 week post treatment, as well as 3 and 9-months post treatment.\n\nThe investigators predict that BA-HT will more effectively increase social role and activity functioning, activity, mood and reduce 9-month re-hospitalization compared to current best-practices post-discharge care among patients scoring at least moderately depressed on the PROMIS Depression scale one week following hospital discharge for a CVD event.",
            "detailedDescription": "Following hospital discharge, risk of depression is significantly increased in cardio-vascular disease (CVD) patients. Moreover, CVD patients with depression face reduced functioning, increased morbidity and mortality, and diminished quality of life. Unfortunately, most depressed CVD patients do not receive appropriate evidence-based care for their depression, often because they are unable to, or fearful of travelling to providers for the regimen of 8-12 weekly visits of evidence-based psychotherapy such as Behavioral Activation (BA). The group developed, evaluated and subsequently implemented in VA clinics, the first VA program to use home based telehealth to deliver BA for depression to elderly Veterans. The investigators now propose to evaluate the ability of this evidence based treatment and delivery model (BA for depression via home-telehealth) to reduce functional impairment and improve recovery in depressed Veterans who have experienced a CVD event-related hospitalization.\n\nThe specific aims of this project are:\n\n1. To compare effectiveness of Behavioral Activation for depression delivered via Home-based Telehealth- to standard post-CVD hospital discharge best-practices care in a 2x4 (treatment by time) repeated measures RCT crossover design (baseline, post-treatment, 3 \\& 9-month follow-up; crossover for standard treatment group at 9 months) with 132 CVD Veteran patients evincing depression in terms of central outcomes of functioning (PROMIS Functioning and Global Health scales) and emotional symptoms (PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scales) and secondary objective outcomes related to activity (actigraphy data). At the 9 month point, the comparison group will have the option of receiving the intervention (thus complementing the RCT with a crossover phase).\n2. To repeat these comparisons with sex and age as independent variables.\n3. To evaluate BA-HT with respect to its effects on exploratory outcomes, including re-hospitalization.\n\nThe investigators predict that evidence-based psychotherapy for depression (i.e., Behavioral Activation) delivered via home based telehealth will more effectively increase social role and activity functioning, activity, mood and reduce 6-month re-hospitalization (exploratory hypothesis), compared to current best-practices post-discharge care among patients scoring at least moderately depressed on the PROMIS Depression scale one week following hospital discharge for a CVD event.\n\nIf effective, this innovative treatment and delivery strategy will enhance global functioning, improve quality of life, and reduce costs to Veterans and the VA. Importantly, the proposed strategy leverages existing VA infrastructure and capabilities so that BA-HT could be immediately offered throughout VA as a preventative measure to enhance resiliency."
