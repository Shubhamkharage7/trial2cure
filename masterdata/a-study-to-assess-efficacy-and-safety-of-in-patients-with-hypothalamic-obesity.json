The study will evaluate the effect of LB54640 on safety, weight reduction, hunger, and quality of life in patients 12 years of age and older with HO. Patients will take an oral daily dose of either LB54640 (low, middle, or high dose) or placebo through Week 14. Eligible patients who consent to continue in the study after Week 14 will take an oral daily dose of LB54640 through Week 56."
