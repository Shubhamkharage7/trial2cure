Women with endometriosis have a nine-fold increased risk of dyspareunia, when compared to the general female population.\n\nA prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be performed evaluating the change in pelvic pain and sexual satisfaction scores from baseline to 6 weeks after treatment with transvaginal photobiomodulation therapy or sham therapy. Treatment will involve 9 planned treatment sessions over 3-4 weeks. 40 women will be included in the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Active intervention: Transvaginal photobiomodulation (TV-PBM) Control intervention: Sham transvaginal probe\n\nAll subjects will complete 9 treatments over 3-4 weeks and all treatments will be performed with a sheet over the patient's pelvic area to prevent the subject from seeing the probe light, as well as a screen blocking the patient's view of the machine. Subjects randomized to active therapy will undergo TV-PBM treatment during each session per standard TV-PBM treatment protocol. Subjects randomized to sham will undergo blinded sham therapy using an identical probe but without photobiomodulation. Sham therapy will involve the same regimen as the active arm but with the machine turned off. Instead, there will be a recording of the usual noise of the machine to mimic the activation that occurs when stepping on the pedal with the machine on for TV-PBM treatment."
