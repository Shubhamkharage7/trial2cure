The primary objective will be to establish the safety of X-PACT when dosed with 5 intra-tumoral injections of the combination product (the phosphor device and methoxsalen sterile solution and subsequently exposing the tumor to X-ray energy) over a period of 6 weeks (on day D1, D3 and D5 of Week 1, on D1 of Week 2, and a booster on D1 of Week 6). After the week 8 tumor assessment subjects demonstrating stable disease, partial response or unconfirmed progression assessed by iRecist, will be eligible to receive two additional booster treatments 4-6 weeks apart. Treatment will be considered safe provided \u2264 2 out of 12 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the first intra-tumoral injection.",

After the week 8 tumor assessment subjects demonstrating stable disease, partial response or unconfirmed progression assessed by iRecist, will be eligible to receive two additional booster treatments 4-6 weeks apart. Part C has been added to the study to allow patients who respond to treatment to receive an additional 12 treatments over 12 months. In part C, up to two tumors in up to two radiation fields may be treated. Treatment will be considered safe provided \u2264 2 out of 12 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the first intra-tumoral injection. Subjects will have staging scans at baseline, day 8, week 7 and as per standard of care during the optional treatment and follow up study periods. There will be a two-year follow up period."
