How does this combination compare to the use of metformin plus sitagliptin in controlling blood sugar levels? Participants will receive Pioglitazone beginning at 15 mg daily and ending 45 mg daily.

The selection of subjects to each subgroup will be done randomly and the end of sub-study, subjects will continue therapy and follow-up from month 6 on in the main study."
