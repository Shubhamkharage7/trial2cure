            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMany kinds of good or normal bacteria live on your skin and inside your stomach and intestines (gut). These bacteria are important to your health. What you eat, where you live, and what medicines you take can affect the bacteria in your gut. Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is an ingredient in common medicines for mild diarrhea and stomach pain. Products that contain BSS include Pepto-Bismol, Kao-Tin, and Pink Bismuth. But how BSS affects the bacteria in a person s gut is not fully understood.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see how BSS affects gut bacteria in healthy people.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people aged 18 to 50 years.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 6 clinic visits in up to 18 weeks. Only 1 visit must be at the NIH clinic; others may be either in-person or remote.\n\nBSS is a liquid taken by mouth. Participants will take a dose of BSS 4 times a day for 2 days. They will take the same amount of BSS as a person would take to treat diarrhea or related problems.\n\nStool samples will be collected at each study visit. For remote visits, participants will be given a collection kit; they will collect the sample at home and send it in.\n\nParticipants will take surveys at each visit. They will answer questions about their diet and health.\n\nParticipants may also provide optional samples of blood, saliva, and urine.\n\nParticipants may have up to 2 optional colonoscopies. A long tube will be inserted via the rectum to collect tissue samples from the intestine. Participants will be sedated or placed under anesthesia for the procedure.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is a single-site, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the effect of bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) on the human gut microbiome and host immune response. Upon confirmation of eligibility, healthy adult volunteers will provide stool and optional blood, saliva, urine, and intestinal biopsy samples for a baseline assessment of gut microbiome and host immune response. Up to 18 weeks later, participants will undergo a 2-day/8-dose regimen of oral BSS. Stool will be collected at baseline, days 2 (+3), 8 (+/-3), 14 (-3/+7) and 28 (+/-7). Blood, saliva, and urine are also optional at these time points. Participants may also undergo a second optional colonoscopy at day 8 (+/-3) to provide colon biopsies for research analysis.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo evaluate the effect of BSS on the human gut microbiome.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\nTo evaluate the effect of BSS on the human gut metabolome.\n\nTertiary/Exploratory Objective:\n\nTo evaluate the effect of BSS on the systemic and intestinal host response (immune and inflammatory responses).\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nDifferences in the relative abundance of taxa in stool samples pre-BSS and approximately 1 month post-BSS. Differences in microbiome metrics of alpha diversity and beta diversity will also be assessed.\n\nSecondary Endpoint:\n\nDifferences in the stool metabolome (including short chain fatty acids, bile acids, and untargeted metabolomics) pre-BSS and approximately 1 month post-BSS.\n\nTertiary/Exploratory Endpoint:\n\nDifferences in systemic host immune and inflammatory responses, such as cytokines and immune cells, and host intestinal immune responses, such as specific T-cell populations in intestinal biopsies pre-BSS and approximately 1 month post-BSS."
