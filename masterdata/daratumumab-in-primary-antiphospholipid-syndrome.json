The dosing cohorts are: 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, and 16 mg/kg. Each cohort will receive intravenous (IV) administration of daratumumab according to the following schedule, for a total of 8 doses.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the safety of daratumumab in APS defined as Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occurring during the dose escalation phase.",
            "detailedDescription": "The trial is a phase 1b open-label study of daratumumab in participants with APS.\n\nThe study design is a modification of the 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. Three daratumumab dose cohorts are planned: 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, and 16 mg/kg of intravenous (IV) daratumumab administered weekly for 8 doses (weeks 0 through 7). Post-treatment follow-up visits will occur at weeks 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48.\n\nDose Escalation Phase Dose escalation will proceed according to safety criteria (Dose Limiting Toxicity, DLT) and efficacy criteria (antiphospholipid antibody negativity). An independent safety committee will review the data and approve escalation to the next dose.\n\nThe Highest Safe Dose (HSD) is the highest administered dose at which \u2264 1/6 participants experiences a DLT at or prior to week 9.\n\nExpansion Phase Four additional participants will be enrolled and treated at the HSD weekly for 8 doses."
