The main questions that this trial aims to answer are what is the best dose of venetoclax to give with tazemetostat to people with R/R NHL; what types of side effects do people with R/R NHL get when taking venetoclax with tazemetostat; and what effects does this combination have on R/R NHL. Participants will need to take pills by mouth every day and regularly come to the clinic for blood work and imagining to monitor side effects and cancer progression. Participants may receive study drugs for up to 24 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "This a phase 1, single arm, non-randomized trial of tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax in participants with two types of relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the combination of tazemetostat and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). This trial will be conducted in two parts. Part one will be a single-arm, open-label sequential dose escalation (3+3) of venetoclax in combination with a fixed dose of tazemetostat (800mg BID) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax. In part two, two expansion cohorts (R/R DLBCL and R/R FL) will be enrolled to further characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination, and to estimate the preliminary efficacy. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in part 1 and 20 participants will be enrolled in part 2."
