Participants will take part in a 12-week hip muscle exercise program (weekly supervised hip exercises with resistance progression) plus a home program with the same exercises 3 days per week. the exercise program will be administered by the licensed physical therapist with special focus in hip strength. The change in pelvic floor muscle strength (peak pelvic floor muscle squeeze pressures) pre- to post hip muscle exercises. Changes in UI symptom severity, and impact of UI symptoms on quality of life will be assessed. Objective measurement of pelvic floor muscle strength will be obtained using a perineometer. UI symptom severity and quality of life will be measured using validated questionnaires (PFDI and PFIQ, respectively)."
