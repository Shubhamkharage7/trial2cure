Another aim is to learn about treatment with Vedolizumab alone after the double treatment.\n\nAll participants will receive vedolizumab together with tofacitinib for 8 weeks and will be checked for response. Participants who show a response to the treatment after 8 weeks will be treated with vedolizumab alone for an additional 44 weeks.\n\nEach participant will be followed up for at least 26 weeks after the last dose of vedolizumab.",
            "detailedDescription": "The drugs being tested in this study are called Vedolizumab and Tofacitinib. Vedolizumab and Tofacitinib dual targeted therapy is being tested to treat people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who have experienced inadequate response, loss of response or intolerance to no more than 2 prior tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. This study will look at the clinical remission in people who take Vedolizumab and Tofacitinib dual targeted therapy.\n\nThe study will enroll approximately 65 patients. All the participants will be enrolled in a single treatment group to receive dual targeted treatment with Vedolizumab and Tofacitinib for the first 8 weeks:\n\nVedolizumab 300 mg + Tofacitinib 10 mg\n\nOnly those participants who show a clinical response at Week 8 will transition to Vedolizumab monotherapy for 44 weeks.\n\nThis multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall duration of the study is up to 76 weeks. Participants will be followed up for 26 weeks after the last dose of the study drug for safety."
