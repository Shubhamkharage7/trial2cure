            "briefSummary": "The main goal of this clinical study is to test how CYP2B6 genetic variations and efavirenz (cornerstone in HIV-1 therapy) dictate the disposition (PK) of CYP2B6 substrate (methadone) and PK and effect (PD) of CYP1A2 substrate (tizanidine). Specifically, the investigators will test whether efavirenz produces CYP2B6 genotype dependent unanticipated DDIs with CYP2B6 (methadone) and CYP1A2 (tizanidine), leading to lack of efficacy or increased toxicity. Healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2B6\\*6 and \\*18 alleles will be grouped in to three genotype predicted phenotype groups: 20 normal metabolizer (NM) (CYP2B6\\*1/\\*1); 20 intermediate metabolizer (IM) (\\*1/\\*6, or \\*1/\\*18); and 20 poor metabolizer (PM) (\\*6/\\*6, \\*6/\\*18 or \\*18/\\*18). Each phenotype group will receive methadone and tizanidine (separated by a washout period) on two occasions: at baseline (control) and after treatment with efavirenz (600 mg/day for 17 days).",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, two period, fixed sequence study in healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2B6 allele (\\*6 and \\*18) investigating the metabolism, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single oral dose of tizanidine and methadone before and after oral pre-treatment with 600 mg/day efavirenz for 16 days. Enrollment targets will be normal metabolizers (N=20, CYP2B6\\*1/\\*1), intermediate metabolizers (N=20, CYP2B6\\*1/\\*6 and \\*1/\\*18) and poor metabolizers (N=20, CYP2B6\\*6/\\*6; \\*18/\\*18, and \\*6/\\*18).\n\nSchedule of assessment:\n\nA. PHASE 1 (CONTROL PHASE): Tizanidine and methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be determined at baseline.\n\nDay 1 (1st inpatient ICRC overnight stay).\n\nEligible volunteers who fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be requested to arrive in the morning (about 7 am) at ICRC on the first study day (Day 1) after an overnight fasting. On the evening prior to the inpatient ICRC study day (day 1), it is important that subjects have nothing to eat or drink after 11 pm except for water. If a female volunteer, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. This test must be negative (not pregnant) to take part in the study. A sterile indwelling intravenous catheter (small, flexible, plastic tube) will be inserted in a vein in one arm for blood collection. A physician will be available for consultation. Pre-dose (baseline) blood (about 7 mL blood or about 1.5 teaspoons) and urine samples, vital sign such as blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart/pulse rate), respiration rate, oral temperature, breathing rate, and EKG recordings will be obtained.\n\nSubjects will then receive a single dose of tizanidine (4 mg) and a single dose of methadone (10 mg) on empty stomach by mouth with 250 ml drinking water. Blood samples (\\~7 ml) will be drawn into EDTA-containing tubes at 20 and 40 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours after tizanidine and methadone administration while at the ICRC. To measure tizanidine pharmacodynamic effects, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) will be measured twice from the forearm of the subjects in a sitting position with blood pressure monitor immediately after each blood sample. EKG will be monitored at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours after tizanidine and methadone administration. All urine voided during the 24 hours after drug administration will be collected in two fractions in urine jugs (0 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours); all of urine voided 0-12 hours in one container and all urine voided 12-24 hours in the other container. Plasma will be separated by centrifugation within 30 minutes. Urine volume in each fraction will be recorded and two 10-ml aliquots each will be retained from each fraction. Plasma and urine aliquots will be stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. Subjects will receive a standard breakfast 2 hours and lunch 4 hours after methadone and tizanidine administration, and free access to food and water thereafter. Subjects will be requested to report immediately of any unusual feelings.\n\nDay 2 (inpatient ICRC):\n\nAfter the 24-hour blood and urine sampling and measurements of EKG, blood pressure and vital signs (Day 2), the intravenous catheter (small, flexible, plastic tube) will be removed, and then subjects will be discharged from the ICRC inpatient clinic with the advice to comeback to ICRC outpatient clinic on the mornings of Day 3 and Day 4.\n\nDay 3 (outpatient visit):\n\nIn the morning of Day 3 (48 hour) after tizanidine and methadone administration, subjects will come to the ICRC for a short visit (approximately 30 min) to draw blood (about 7 ml or 1.5 teaspoons) by direct needle puncture of a vein in one of the arms.\n\nDay 4 (outpatient visit):\n\nIn the morning of Day 4 (72 hour) after tizanidine and methadone administration, subjects will come to the ICRC for a short visit (approximately 30 min) to draw blood (about 7 ml or 1.5 teaspoons) by direct needle puncture of a vein in one of the arms.\n\nAfter the blood draw on Day 4, subjects will be given the following to take home:\n\n1. a supply of the study medication, efavirenz, for subjects to start taking at home starting that evening and continue for 16 consecutive days (600 mg/day) per instructed.\n2. a diary will be given to subjects to take home to record the time subjects took efavirenz every evening and any side effects participants may experience.\n\nB. PHASE 2 (EFAVIRENZ TREATMENT PHASE)\n\nDay 4 to day 19 (home):\n\nAfter the 72-hour blood draw for period 1 (Day 4), subjects will be given a supply of efavirenz to take home. Starting day 4, subjects will be requested to take 600 mg efavirenz orally once a day every evening 2 hours before or 2 hours after a dinner for 16 consecutive days (Day 4 to Day 19). It is important that volunteers take the study medication approximately the same time on each evening. Taking efavirenz during the evening is required to reduce efavirenz-mediated CNS adverse effects. Since efavirenz has a long half-life (\u223c76 hours after single dose and\u223c50 at steady state), a total of 16 days of efavirenz treatment is required to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations of efavirenz and near steady-state autoinduction of metabolism. In the event subjects miss a dose it is very important that participants contact the research coordinator for further instructions. In addition, subjects will receive a diary to record the time of the medication was taken and to record CNS symptoms, and any other feelings or side effects experienced during the study. The subjects will be requested to adhere to dietary restrictions throughout the study. Minor rescheduling (+/- 2 days) of the subject's fixed inpatient/outpatient visits are allowed including adjusting the amount of study medication (up to 2 doses less or up to 2 doses more) to be given prior to the subject's second inpatient visit.\n\nC. PHASE 3 (STEADY STATE PHASE). In phase 3, tizanidine and methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be determined after chronic dosing with efavirenz 600 mg/day for 16 days).\n\nDay 20 (second inpatient ICRC overnight stay):\n\nOn Day 20 (Inpatient stay), subjects will be requested to arrive at the ICRC inpatient at about 7 am after overnight fasting. After 11 pm the night before admission to the ICRC, subjects will be requested not to eat anything except water. A urine pregnancy test (if female) will be obtained, and the urine pregnancy test must be negative. Then, a sterile indwelling intravenous catheter will be inserted in one arm for blood collection. Pre-dose (baseline) blood and urine samples, vital sign such as blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart/pulse rate), respiration rate, oral temperature, breathing rate, and EKG recordings will be obtained. Then, subjects will receive efavirenz (600 mg PO) with tizanidine (4 mg by mouth) and methadone (10 mg) in the morning with 250 ml water. All other subsequent procedures including tizanidine and methadone plasma and urine sampling, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics determinations will be made exactly as described in PHASE 1 (Day 1). The same samples collected will also be used to quantify efavirenz and metabolites. Subjects will receive a standard breakfast 2 hours and lunch 4 hours after methadone and tizanidine administration, and free access to food and water thereafter.\n\nDay 21 (inpatient ICRC):\n\nAfter the 24-hour blood and urine sampling and measurements of EKG, blood pressure and vital signs (Day 21), the intravenous catheter (small, flexible, plastic tube) will be removed, and then subjects will be discharged from the ICRC inpatient clinic with the advice to comeback to ICRC outpatient clinic on the mornings of Day 22 and Day 23.\n\nDay 22 (outpatient visit):\n\nIn the morning of Day 22 (48 hour) after tizanidine and methadone administration, subjects will come to the ICRC for a short visit (approximately 30 min) to draw blood (about 7 ml or 1.5 teaspoons) by direct needle puncture of a vein in one of the arms.\n\nDay 23 (outpatient visit):\n\nIn the mornings of Day 23 (72 hour) after tizanidine and methadone administration, subjects will come to the ICRC for a short visit (approximately 30 min) to draw blood (about 7 ml or 1.5 teaspoons) by direct needle puncture of a vein in one of the arms. On Day 23, subjects will be requested to bring the bottle containing home medications either empty or with any leftover efavirenz pills as well as study diary with participants. Day 23, after the 72-hour blood draw, marks the end of the entire study and subjects will be discharged home. Day 23 will mark the completion of the entire study and subjects will be discharged from the study after the 72-hour blood sample and health assessment."
