            "briefSummary": "The primary purpose of this study is to see if people with HIV who had a significant weight gain after starting INSTI (integrase strand transfer inhibitor)+TAF/FTC (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine) (TAF/3TC (lamivudine)) regimen could either slow their rate of weight gain or lose weight within about 1 year if they switch to a regimen containing doravirine (DOR; a newer, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor medication). The study will also try to see if participants changing from TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) to TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC) will experience less additional weight gain or a reduction in overall body weight at 48 weeks compared to persons continued on an INSTI + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) combination. INSTINs assessed in A5391 include bictegravir (BIC), dolutegravir (DTG), or raltegravir (RAL). Additionally, the study will see whether a change in ART can affect things like waist circumference, metabolic and cardiovascular health, fat and lean mass body composition, bone health, and maintenance of virologic suppression. Finally, the study will look at the safety and tolerability of DOR plus either TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) versus TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC)."

This includes transgender men who could become pregnant if menstruation were not suppressed. Participant-reported history is acceptable documentation of menopause.\n\n* Participants engaging in sexual activity and capable of becoming pregnant must agree to use contraception while on study drug (approximately 48 weeks) and for 8 weeks after the end of the study. At least one of the following contraceptive methods must be used:\n\n  * Intrauterine device (IUD)\n  * Hormone-based contraceptive\n  * Partner sterilization (i.e., vasectomy) and is the sole partner for the participant.\n\nNOTE: Participant report of partner sterilization is acceptable.\n\n* Transgender participants who are currently taking hormones must be on a stable hormone dose for \\>12 weeks prior to study entry. Transgender participants should not have active plans to change their hormone regimen or dose during the study period.\n\nNOTE: As some transgender participants may also use hormones purchased outside of the medical system (e.g., street hormones), the medication history should include questions about the use of these agents.\n\n* The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any network-approved non-US laboratory that operates in accordance with GCLP and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>750 cells/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin \\>10 g/dL for males and \\>9 g/dL for females (based on sex at birth)\n  * Calculated creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min as estimated by the CKD-EPI equation (a calculator is available at: https://qxmd.com/calculate/calculator_251/egfr-using-ckd-epi)\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) \\<3x ULN\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) \\<3x ULN\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Historical or current evidence of the K65R/E/N or M184V/I mutations (for participants who have undergone HIV-1 genotyping), due to the potential for viral rebound after switch from an INSTI- to NNRTI-based regimen.\n* Historical or current evidence of major mutations associated with any NNRTI resistance.\n\nNOTE: Refer to the IAS-USA 2019 mutations list, including significant substitutions at positions 100, 101, 103, 106, 138, 179, 181, 188, 190, 221, 225, 227, 230, or 234 \\[22\\].\n\n* History of prior virologic failure in the opinion of the site investigator. For example, a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA \\>1000 copies/mL after having achieved viral suppression.\n* Prior exposure to single-dose nevirapine for the prevention of parent-to-child transmission of HIV.\n* Any history of significant renal toxicity while taking TDF (as determined by site investigator).\n* Currently breast-feeding or pregnant, or intending to become pregnant during the duration of the study.\n* Anticipated start or cessation of any of the following drugs during study period:\n\n  * Antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, etc.) and antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline, etc.; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, etc.; and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, e.g., selegiline) associated with weight gain\n  * Anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers associated with weight gain (e.g., lithium, valproic acid) or weight loss (e.g., topiramate)\n  * Thyroid replacement hormones\n  * Anti-diabetic agents known to cause weight loss (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists such as exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, metformin, and SGLT-2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, etc.).\n\nNOTE A: Participants currently receiving antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers, and thyroid replacement hormones with no dose modifications for at least 12 weeks prior to entry are eligible.\n\nNOTE B: Participants currently receiving anti-diabetic agents known to cause weight loss with no dose modifications for at least 24 weeks prior to entry are eligible.\n\n* Planning to undergo bariatric surgery or initiate significant dietary or exercise changes within the study period (e.g., structured weight loss programs such as Weight Watchers), as determined by participant report.\n* Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drug or its formulation.\n* Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with ability to adhere to study requirements, or cessation of routine methamphetamine use within 60 days prior to study entry.\n\nNOTE: Routine methamphetamine use is considered \\>4 days per week.\n\n* Acute or serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days prior to entry.\n* A history of a diagnosis of osteoporosis or osteopenia.",
