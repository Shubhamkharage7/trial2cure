CET is a new, computerized training intervention that targets specific components of the working memory system. Two versions of CET were developed as part of our R34, each targeting a different combinations of executive functions. The final CET protocol reflects the contributions and feedback of a diverse group of caregivers, children with ADHD, and recognized experts in human cognition, ADHD treatment research, randomized control trial (RCT) intervention design methods, serious game theory and task design, cognitive training, and the role of executive dysfunction in ADHD."
