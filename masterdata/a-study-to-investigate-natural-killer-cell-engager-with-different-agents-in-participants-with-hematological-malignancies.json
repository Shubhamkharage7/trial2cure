Individual sub-studies will explore SAR443579 with combination partners, which may include approved or investigational agents.\n\nExperimental sub-studies will be tested through 3 parts:\n\nPart 1: dose finding (such as dose escalation/ safety run-in). Part 2: dose optimization (when applicable). Part 3: dose expansion. In each sub-study, a dose escalation will identify preliminary recommended dose for expansion (pRDE) of SAR443579 and its respective combination partner. Following the determination of the preliminary RDE, additional participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion part, or if dose optimization needs to be further evaluated, additional participants will be enrolled in the \"dose optimization/expansion\" part. Dose optimization and dose expansion part could involve randomization depending on specific sub-study design.\n\nStudy will consist of a screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment until documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, participant's decision to stop study treatment, or completion of the maximum cycles allowed in the sub-studies, or the participant meets other criteria for discontinuation per study protocol (whichever occurs first).",

The study duration includes a screening period, an induction and maintenance. After the end of study treatment participants will enter the follow-up period for up to 2 years.\n\nPlanned number of participants:\n\n22 participants planned to be screened, 8 being adults and 14 being elderly; 9-18 participants planned to be enrolled (dose escalation part)\n\nEnrollment will be paused upon completion of Part 1: Dose Escalation. The available data will be reviewed and the recommended doses and schedule for optimization will be selected by the study board. Enrollment in the Part 2: Dose optimization and Part 3: Dose expansion will be provided in a future protocol amendment."
