The mechanism by which vision loss in glaucoma occurs is still unknown, but it is clear that increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor. It is also thought that the LC is a site of primary damage during pathogenesis of the disease. This prospective study with determine the in-vivo mechanical response to IOP modulation at the level of the ONH and LC.",

Outcome measures will include measurements in microns based on these images quantifying the deformation of the lamina cribrosa."
