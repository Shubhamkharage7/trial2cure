            "briefSummary": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a critical public health problem. Heart failure (HF) affects over 5 million adults in the United States (US), and is a major source of morbidity, mortality, and impaired quality of life. Approximately half of individuals with HF have a preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), termed HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). While there are several effective pharmacologic therapies for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), none have been identified for HFpEF. Hypertension, which is present in approximately 80% of individuals with HFpEF, is the foremost modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of HFpEF. Despite the clinical importance of hypertension in HFpEF, there is limited information on how common antihypertensive agents, particularly calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and \u03b2-blockers, effect pathophysiologic mechanisms of HFpEF. This is a mechanistic investigation of the role of dihydropyridine CCBs compared to \u03b2-blockers (commonly used antihypertensive agents in clinical practice) in targeting key physiologic abnormalities in HFpEF."
