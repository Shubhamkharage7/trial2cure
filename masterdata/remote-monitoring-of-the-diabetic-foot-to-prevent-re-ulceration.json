Participants will also need to answer questions about their general foot health and, if using the system, their experience using the device and monitoring service.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a siteless study, which is planned to enroll approximately 200 patients with diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer which has healed within 2-24 months prior to screening. The study will be organized and conducted via a central coordinating center at the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Potentially eligible patients within the state of North Carolina will be contacted about the study and if willing, will provide consent to participation remotely, including use of the Pluto Health''s unified medical records platform. Participants will not attend study sites, as all study visits will take place virtually and/or by telephone contact from the coordinating center and the primary study outcomes will be ascertained by review of health records via the Pluto system.\n\nAll enrolled participants will be randomized to use of the Bluedrop Monitoring System (BMS) or not in addition to their otherwise usual care. Participants assigned to use of the Bluedrop Monitoring System (BMS) will be provided the Delta Foot Scanner device with monitoring system and will be instructed in daily device use by Bluedrop personnel.\n\nParticipants will continue to receive all other usual care during the study period, and the patient's other care may be adjusted as considered clinically appropriate by the usual care provider(s).\n\nAfter study enrollment, study visits will take place at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. These visits will include participant surveys including assessment of neuropathy-specific quality of life, and review of health records via the Pluto Health platform by the study Principal Investigator (PI) to identify the occurrence of foot injury or ulcer and any associated medical or surgical care."
