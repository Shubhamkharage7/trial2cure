            "detailedDescription": "People with Crohn's disease often suffer from sleep problems. Long term, sleep problems may lead to more flares of Crohn's disease or other complications. In general, patients with Crohn's disease also report that sleep problems can worsen symptoms of Crohn's disease the next day. In people with other medical problems, research has also shown that having sleep problems can make other things worse, such as pain and inflammation. In this study, the investigators want to understand if they can treat sleep problems in people with Crohn's disease, and what else might improve if sleep gets better. If this study is successful, it will help the investigators understand more about how to treat insomnia in people with Crohn's disease and how sleep impacts pain and inflammation. Long term, this information will be helpful in understanding how best to take care of people with Crohn's disease."
