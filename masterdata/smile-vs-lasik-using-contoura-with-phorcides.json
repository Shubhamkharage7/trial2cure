Surgical treatment will be randomized so there is a 50% chance to receive SMILE on the right eye and LASIK on the contralateral eye. Subjects will receive standard of care topical ophthalmic antibiotic and steroid drops. Visual outcomes and patient self-reported symptoms will be assessed at week 2, month 1, month 3, and month 6."
