Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive cognitive intervention versus usual care at a 1:2 allocation ratio. Patients assigned to the cognitive intervention group will receive cognitive training daily during hospitalization and cognitive rehabilitation weekly for 12 weeks after hospital discharge. Patients will be evaluated for global cognition (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes at 4-months."
