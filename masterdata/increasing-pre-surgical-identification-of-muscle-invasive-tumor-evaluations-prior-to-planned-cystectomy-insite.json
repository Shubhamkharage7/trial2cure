Urine and blood samples will be obtained day of procedure for utilization for urine biopsy, ctDNA, and future correlative studies.\n\nFollowing cystectomy, a diagnostic testing panel of pre-cystectomy cystoscopic and biopsy findings, ctDNA, and urine biopsy will be compared to final pathologic specimen.\n\nBlood samples will be obtained 4-6 weeks (\u00b12 weeks) post-procedure and 6 months (\u00b11 month) post-procedure for analysis and ctDNA for post-procedure surveillance and other additional correlative studies. Additional blood sample collections at 12 months and 24 months post-procedure are optional."
