            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial studies how well quizartinib, decitabine, and venetoclax work in treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome that is untreated or has come back (relapsed). Quizartinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving quizartinib and decitabine may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) including CR (complete remission) + CRp (complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery) + CRi (complete remission with incomplete count recovery) + partial remission (PR) within 3 months of treatment initiation of quizartinib and decitabine + venetoclax combination in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (\\> 10% blasts).\n\nII. To determine the safety and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of this combination.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine CR and CR+CRh rates within 3 months of treatment initiation of quizartinib and decitabine + venetoclax combination in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AML or high risk MDS (\\> 10% blast).\n\nII. To determine the duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), MRD status at response and best MRD response attained by flow-cytometry (all patients) and by FLT3-PCR (if applicable) or variant allele frequency monitoring (if applicable) and number of patients bridged to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and median duration to HSCT from the initiation of the combination.\n\nIII. To investigate correlations of response to this combination with a pre-therapy, on-therapy, and progression 81-gene panel of gene mutations in AML.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate possible relationships between response and non-response to the combination with pretherapy, on-therapy, and progression gene expression signatures.\n\nII. To investigate the characterization of genetic heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, by performing targeted single-cell sequencing on longitudinally collected AML tumor populations from patients using a novel microfluidic approach that barcodes amplified genomic DNA from thousands of individual leukemia cells confined to droplets (single cell sequencing).\n\nIII. To identify individual treatment-resistant cell populations and how their signaling state in disease relates to clinical outcomes we will perform CyTOF (mass cytometry) on patients' bone marrow samples and peripheral blood at diagnosis, remission and relapse.\n\nIV. To store and/or analyze surplus blood or tissue including bone marrow, if available, for potential future exploratory research into factors that may influence development of AML and/or response to the combination (where response is defined broadly to include efficacy, tolerability or safety).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10, quizartinib orally (PO) every day beginning on day 1 of cycle 1, and venetoclax PO on days 1-14 (days 1-21 if persistent leukemia). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years."

WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy until at least 3 months after the last dose of investigational drug.

Maintenance therapy, hormonal therapy, or steroid therapy for well-controlled malignancy is allowed.\n* Patients with a known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Patients with known positive hepatitis B or C infection by serology, with the exception of those with an undetectable viral load within 3 months. (Hepatitis B or C testing is not required prior to study entry). Subjects with serologic evidence of prior vaccination to HBV \\[i.e., hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBs Ag\\]-, and anti-HBs+\\] may participate.\n* Patients who have consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Starfruit within 3 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n* Patients who have had any major surgical procedure within 14 days of day 1.\n* Impaired cardiac function including any of the following: Screening ECG with a Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) \\> 450 msec. The QTcF interval will be calculated by Fridericia's correction factor (QTcF). The QTcF will be derived from the average QTcF in triplicate. Patients are excluded if they have QTcF \\>= 450. Subjects with prolonged QTcF interval in the setting of RBBB (right bundle branch block) may participate upon review and approval by the medical monitor. RBBB for patients' triplicate EKGs can show false corrected QT (QTc) prolongation; therefore, the Cardiology collaborator for this study will manually review to provide an accurate reading of the QTc. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome. History or presence of sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring medical intervention. Any history of clinically significant ventricular fibrillation or torsades de pointes. Known history of second or third degree heart block (may be eligible if the patient currently has a pacemaker).
