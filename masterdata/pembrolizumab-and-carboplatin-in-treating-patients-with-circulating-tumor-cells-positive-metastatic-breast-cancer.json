            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact on progression-free survival (PFS) with the combination carboplatin - pembrolizumab in patients with CTC (circulating tumor cells) positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. Previous studies have indicated that recurrent breast cancers are more resistant to chemotherapy and maybe associated with a weak immune system. This study is investigating the use of an immune therapy drug, pembrolizumab, that has the ability to restore the capacity of controlling and killing cancer cells of an important component of your immune system called T-cells. Pembrolizumab has been found effective in other types of cancer and has already been approved by FDA for those indications, but the efficacy in breast cancer is still unknown. In this study, pembrolizumab will be combined with chemotherapy to increase the cancer cell killing. There is no control or placebo treatment in this study.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the impact on progression free survival (PFS) of the combination pembrolizumab - carboplatin in patients with circulating tumor cells (CTC) positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in primary setting.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the impact on overall survival (OS) of the combination carboplatin - pembrolizumab in patients with CTC positive MBC previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in primary setting.\n\nII. To assess the overall response rate or objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients with carboplatin - pembrolizumab in patients with CTC positive MBC previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in primary setting.\n\nIII. To assess immune-related response using tumor response by immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) as immune-related partial response (irPR) or immune-related complete response (irCR).\n\nIV. Measure the time to new metastases (TTNM). V. Evaluate ORR and clinical benefit in relation to PDL-1 expression in tissue and CTCs.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Measure immune biomarkers (PDL-1) in CTCs (CellSearch) and immune cells such as cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs) (CellSieve) and correlate with therapeutic benefit.\n\nII. Measure cell-free circulating tumor deoxyribonecleic acid (ctDNA) and T-cell receptor sequencing analysis and correlate them with CTC enumeration and therapeutic benefit.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 beginning with course 3. Courses repeat every 21 days for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days, every 9 weeks for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks."

subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 28 days prior to registration and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to registration; this exception does not include known carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Patients who have evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis or have a history of severe pneumonitis that required treatment with steroids are not eligible for this study\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject?s participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies)\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B virus surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\] ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\] \\[qualitative\\] is detected)\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy\n\n  * Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed",
