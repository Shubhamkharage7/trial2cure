Initial study treatment arms will include:\n\n* UGN-301 monotherapy\n* UGN-301 + UGN-201 (imiquimod) in combination\n* UGN-301 + gemcitabine in combination\n\nAdditional study treatment arms investigating UGN-301 in combination with other agents may be added in the future.\n\nThe study will evaluate escalating doses of UGN-301 to determine the biologically effective dose (BED) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of UGN-301 either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.\n\nWhen evaluated in combination with other agents, the UGN-301 dose will begin at least 1 dose level lower than the highest dose level cleared in the monotherapy arm, or 1 dose level lower than the RP2D.\n\nEligible patients in each study treatment arm will enter a 12-week Induction Period.\n\nPatients with noninvasive papillary carcinoma and/or tumor that invades the lamina propria (Ta and/or T1) who do not have disease recurrence and patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) who have a complete response (CR) at 3 months after the start of treatment will return to the clinic for a Safety Follow-up Visit at 6 months after the start of treatment.\n\nTa/T1 patients without disease recurrence and CIS patients with CR at 6 months may enter an Optional Maintenance Period of up to 9 months."
