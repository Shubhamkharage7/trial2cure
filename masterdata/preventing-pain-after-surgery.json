Investigators will then assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the finalized intervention to prevent the transition to CPSP and reduce post-surgical opioid use six months following lumbar spine surgery. Finally, investigators will identify psychosocial and psychophysical phenotypes associated with response to this intervention."
