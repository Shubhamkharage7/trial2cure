            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective: The primary objective of this parallel-assignment longitudinal study is to determine whether the digital wellness modules (e.g., mindfulness and light to moderate physical activity) increase quality of life and decrease stress, anxiety, and depression, as mediated by health behavior motivation and change in a healthy population of adults. Secondary Objective(s): The secondary objective is to ascertain qualitatively through deductive thematic analysis specific themes of a) key drivers of health behavior change; b) types of motivations that drive health behavior change, and c) implementation of sustained health behavior change.\n\nThe study will be conducted virtually by Yale University researchers."

Respondents are asked to rate the extent to which each item was self-descriptive, using a 7-point scale (e.g., 1 = always through 7 =never).
