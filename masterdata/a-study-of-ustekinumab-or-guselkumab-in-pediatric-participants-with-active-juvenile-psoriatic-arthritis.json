            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ustekinumab and guselkumab in active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (jPsA).",
            "detailedDescription": "Juvenile psoriatic arthritis is a complex, chronic, progressive, debilitating musculoskeletal disease with significant remaining medical need. There is a need for medications which have a similar efficacy profile and a similar safety profile relative to currently available treatment for jPsA which include anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) inhibitors and secukinumab. STELARA (ustekinumab) is a fully human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds with high affinity to the p40 subunit common to both interleukin (IL)-12 and IL 23 preventing IL-12/23p40 binding to the IL 12 Rb1 cell surface receptor shared by both cytokines. Through this mechanism of action, ustekinumab effectively neutralizes IL-12 T helper 1- and IL-23 T helper 17-mediated cellular responses. TREMFYA (guselkumab) is a fully human IgG1 lambda (G1 lambda) mAb that binds to the p19 subunit of human IL-23 with high affinity. The binding of guselkumab to IL-23 blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23-specific intracellular signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine production. This study consists of Screening period (up to 6 weeks), Treatment period (up to 52 weeks) and a final safety visit at Week 68. The total duration of the study is up to 68 weeks."
