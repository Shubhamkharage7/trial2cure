            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare two Psychosexual Educational programs for women who have completed treatment for breast or gynecological cancer and their partners in preparation for a well-powered phase III study. The investigators plan to enroll 30 dyads in a 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nThe primary aim will be to assess the preliminary efficacy of the Psychosexual Educational Partners Program (PEPP) on sexual communication.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Psychosexual Educational Partners Program (PEPP) is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial that will compare two approaches to a self-paced, workbook-based intervention. PEPP was designed to enhance intimacy among breast and gynecological cancer survivors and their partners by improving sexual communication. The primary aim of the study is to assess the preliminary efficacy of the revised PEPP intervention on sexual communication. Secondary aims include assessing the preliminary efficacy of PEPP on self-efficacy to communicate about sex and intimacy among cancer survivors; and evaluating adherence, acceptance and adverse events within each study arm.\n\nThe intervention is six weeks long and does not require any in-person visits. If a breast or gynecological cancer survivor is determined eligible, they will be educated on the purpose, requirements, and procedures. If interested, participants will be emailed the consent form and will schedule a virtual consent/baseline visit that will include their partner. After consent is obtained from both partners, the dyad will be randomly assigned to a study arm and given study numbers. Both members of the dyad will complete online surveys at the virtual baseline visit. The PEPP workbook will be sent to the participants' address and a virtual education visit will be scheduled. At this second virtual visit, both members of the dyad will receive education about their study arm and a start date will be agreed upon for week 1. Beginning week 1 and continuing through week 6, dyads will work through the PEPP workbook which contains three modules. Participants will receive a scheduled email and/or text check-in message from study staff every two weeks to coincide with the end of each module. Messages will provide a link to a brief survey to assess adherence and respond to any participant questions or concerns. Online surveys will be repeated and adverse events will be assessed at week 6."
