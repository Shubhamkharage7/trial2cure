            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial at a single institution comparing erector spinae plane blockade (ESPB) with liposomal bupivacaine (LB, Exparel) to intravenous (IV) methadone for managing pain in pediatric subjects undergoing adolescent and juvenile idiopathic scoliosis correction. Specifically, the goal is to enroll 15 subjects in each group and to complete data collection for all subjects. If this pilot study is successful, we plan to then design a larger scale study powered to compare specific outcomes between the two groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of two groups: one group will receive intra-operative IV methadone as the primary means of controlling post-operative pain while the other group will instead receive intra-operative erector spinae plane blocks (ESPB) with liposomal bupivacaine (LB, Exparel) and bupivacaine hydrochloride as the primary means of controlling postoperative pain. All other aspects of peri-operative management will be standardized. Subjects and the post-operative care team will be blinded to which intervention was performed in order to reduce bias. Upon discharge, subjects will receive a wearable activity monitor and a daily journal in order to record post-discharge data. Subjects will receive weekly phone calls for data collection and then will have a final in-person clinic visit, at which point participation in the study will conclude."
