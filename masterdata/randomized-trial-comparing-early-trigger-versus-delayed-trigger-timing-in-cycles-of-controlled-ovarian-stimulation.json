Anticipated at least normal ovarian response evidenced by at least 8 antral follicles observed on ultrasound or a serum level of at least 1.5 ng/ml AMH.\n3. Ability read and understand English sufficiently to obtain informed consent.\n4. Patients with prior IVF cycles are allowed, but no patient can undergo more than one cycle with oocyte collection under this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any cycle type that would preclude immediate culture to blastocyst stage (e.g. oocyte banking).\n2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the physician or principal investigator, would place the patient at undue risk under this protocol or would otherwise make the protocol inappropriate for that subject.",
