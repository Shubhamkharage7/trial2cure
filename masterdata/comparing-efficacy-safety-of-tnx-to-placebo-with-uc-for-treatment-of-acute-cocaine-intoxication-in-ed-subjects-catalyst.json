In cases in which the investigator is unclear if the subject has the capacity to consent, a determination regarding capacity must be made by a psychiatrist trained in assessment of capacity to consent to research in order for the subject to be eligible.\n* At Screening, subject presents with cardiac symptoms while intoxicated with cocaine, inclusive of elevated systolic and diastolic BP, as defined below, with or without behavioral symptoms:\n\n  * Systolic BP \\>140 mmHg\n  * Diastolic BP \\>90 mmHg Note: subjects with a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) \\>500 msec may be eligible for study participation, based on investigator judgment.\n* At Screening and Baseline assessments, subject must have a SIS total score of \u22654 and a score \\>1 on at least one of the 2 BP items (systolic and diastolic BP).\n* At Baseline, subject has a CGI-S score \u22653.\n* Subject has a positive urine drug screen test at Pre-screening to confirm cocaine use and detect polysubstance abuse (subject may test positive for cannabinoids and/or opioids and remain eligible; subject may test positive for alcohol by breathalyzer and remain eligible).\n* Subject must be willing to practice the following:\n\n  * If female, practice one of the following methods of birth control throughout the study and for 28 days after study drug administration:\n  * Hormonal methods such as oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives for a minimum of one full cycle (based on the patient's usual menstrual cycle period) before study drug administration;\n  * Intrauterine device;\n  * Bilateral tubal ligation\n  * Double-barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jelly or cream);\n  * If male, practice double-barrier method throughout the study and for 28 days after study drug administration, if female partner is not following birth control methods a-c mentioned above\n* Subject is a suitable candidate for investigational treatment based on the opinion of the investigator.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject who has been admitted to the ED involuntarily.\n* Subject who participated in this clinical study previously.\n* Subject has a score of 3 on the systolic and/or diastolic BP SIS components, a \"mental state\" or \"orientation\" SIS component score of \u22652, or an \"orientation\" SIS component score of \u22651 and the subject is not oriented to either person or place.\n* Subject who, at Screening, expresses C-SSRS suicidal ideation of Type 4 or 5 in the prior week or any C-SSRS suicidal behavior in the prior week.\n* Subject tests positive for stimulant drugs of abuse other than cocaine, including methylphenidate, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, or other amphetamines at Screening.\n* Subject has a clinically significant untreated cardiac condition, such as prior myocardial infarction, current ischemia assessed by ECG-based criteria, aortic dissection, ventricular fibrillation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, significant conduction disturbance (e.g., greater than first degree heart block), QRS interval \\>120 msec, or severe or life-threatening hypertension. Untreated hypertension may be allowed if not considered severe or life-threatening. Note: hypertension will be considered severe or life-threatening if systolic BP is \\>200 mmHg and/or diastolic BP is \\>130 mmHg.\n* Subject incurred or is likely to incur a myocardial infarction or other life-threatening severe event or has acute ECG changes indicative of acute coronary syndrome according to investigator judgment. Such changes may include new, transient, or dynamic ST-segment elevation, ST-depression, or significant Q waves. Based on investigator judgement, T-wave inversion and T-wave flattening may also be considered in the risk assessment for acute coronary syndrome.\n* Subject has a heart rate \u2265180 bpm, atrial fibrillation, greater than first degree heart block, or chest pain with ECG-based evidence of ischemia.\n* Subject has a clinically significant or unstable medical illness, condition, or disorder that can compromise subject safety or adversely affect the evaluation of clinical outcome parameters.\n* Subject has a clinical history of anaphylaxis, severe asthma, hypersensitivity, or angioedema.\n* Subject requires physical restraints due to physiological and/or behavioral symptoms.\n* Subject receives anti-hypertensive medication(s) in the ED prior to study enrollment.\n* Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Participation in another investigational drug study (current or within 30 days of Screening) or previous participation in a study of TNX-1300.",
