Follow-up visits will occur via clinic visits or phone calls 4 weeks after the last study treatment and then quarterly for up to 1 year."

Three dose strengths will be investigated: a low, midlevel, and high dose. Lenti HPV-07 will be administered as either 2 \u00d7 intramuscular (IM) injections to participants in arm A (recurrent or metastatic stage, refractory to previous treatments) or as a single IM injection to participants in Arm B (newly diagnosed with locally advanced HPV+ cancer never treated). Eligible participants in Arm B will receive only 1 injection of Lenti-HPV-07 prior to the initiation of their standard of care (SoC) therapy. After 18 participants in either arm have been treated in the escalation phase and have completed the 14 day DLT period, the Safety Review Committee and Sponsor will determine the OBD for use in the dose expansion phase.",
