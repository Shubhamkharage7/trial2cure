The addition of HBV suppressive medication (i.e., entecavir) should be considered during the period of study treatment. Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus infection who have completed curative antiviral treatment and have a viral load below the limit of quantitation may be eligible and should be discussed with the PIs and Investigational New Drug (IND) Sponsor.\n8.
