Patients will be randomized into one of two Arms: Intervention or Control.\n\n* Arm A: Intervention Group: Use of the THOR LED Photobiomodulation helmet 3x per week for 6 weeks. Helmet will be in 'therapeutic setting', 35mW/cm2 = 42J/cm2\n* Arm B: Control Group: Use of the THOR LED Photobiomodulation helmet 3x per week for 6 weeks. Helmet will be in 'placebo setting', 0mW/cm2 = 0J/cm2\n\nThis study has been designed to assess the hypothesis that Photobiomodulation can have a positive impact on cognitive symptoms in cancer survivors with cancer-related cognitive impairment.\n\n30 participants will be recruited for this study, 15 per group. Self-report questionnaires assessing cognitive concerns, cognitive abilities, quality of life, depression, and anxiety will be administered at three timepoints through the study Baseline, End of Study Visit and 1 Month Follow Up"
