            "briefSummary": "The MOVIN (Mobilizing Older adult patients Via a systems-based Intervention) randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the impact of the MOVIN intervention on improving the functional ability of older adult hospital patients and reducing their healthcare utilization post-hospitalization. MOVIN is a program to increase patient ambulation while hospitalized. The study's hypothesis is that MOVIN will improve functional outcomes for hospitalized older adult patients by producing a change in nursing practice and culture of ambulation on inpatient units. MOVIN is a unit-based intervention. Therefore all patients on this unit are exposed to the intervention once it is implemented regardless of whether or not they participate in the trial. The study will enroll 360-420 total hospitalized participants 65 years and older for the duration of their stay.",
            "detailedDescription": "Up to 65% of hospitalized older adults will lose the ability to ambulate independently during their hospital stay. Loss of independent ambulation has been identified as a hospital-acquired disability and is a critical patient safety concern, resulting in permanent loss of function for 50% of older adults one-year post discharge. Functional loss is associated with multiple negative outcomes including a 33% increase in new nursing home placement, increase in length of hospital stay, need for home health services, falls, caregiver burden, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Given the rapid increase in the elderly population, loss of independent ambulation primarily due to the process of care in hospital settings may significantly increase future healthcare costs and further exacerbate concerns related to patient care quality.\n\nLack of walking during hospitalization has been directly linked to loss of independent ambulation in older adults. Nurses are responsible for promoting and maintaining patient independent mobility. However, the investigators research has identified multiple personal and organizational barriers that prevent nurses from walking patients. The investigators have developed and pilot tested a novel systems based multi-component intervention to improve ambulation of older adult patients, Mobilizing Older adult patients Via a systems-based INtervention (MOVIN). MOVIN is comprised of five components: 1) psychomotor skills training; 2) communication tools; 3) ambulation pathways; 4) ambulation resources; and 5) unit ambulation culture. The Investigators pilot study of MOVIN demonstrated a statistically significant increase in frequency and weekly distance of patient ambulation as well as changes in nursing practice and unit culture. Notably, these changes have been sustained for greater than two years after completion of the study.\n\nThe investigators' goal is to eliminate loss of independent ambulation in hospitalized older adults. In pursuit of this goal, the specific aims are to:\n\n1. Test the effectiveness of MOVIN to improve functional ability of older adult patients at discharge, and 1, 3 and 6 months post discharge;\n2. Test the effectiveness of MOVIN to reduce healthcare utilization of older adults at discharge, and 1, 3 and 6 months post discharge;\n3. Measure change in nurse behaviors and unit culture and identify ongoing systems barriers that impact translation of MOVIN across inpatient units and different hospitals."
