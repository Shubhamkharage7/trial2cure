Sutter Health worksites will be randomly assigned to either a control condition or to implement a sales ban on SSBs. Within all sites, employees will be randomized to receive/not receive a brief counseling intervention focused on reducing SSB consumption. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires, give blood samples, and provide measurements of waist circumference, height, and weight. These data will be analyzed to determine the effects of the interventions, both separately and in combination."
