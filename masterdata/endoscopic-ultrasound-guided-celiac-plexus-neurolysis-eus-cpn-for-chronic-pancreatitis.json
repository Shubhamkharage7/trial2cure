            "briefSummary": "Physicians need a tracking system for specific treatment modalities, and data to determine the impact of endoscopic ultrasound pain management for patients with chronic pancreatitis.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic pancreatitis is extremely painful and pain management in patients with chronic pancreatitis is challenging. The etiology of abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis is considered multifactorial. Current treatments for pain control primarily include narcotic \\& opioid administration; however, these medications require titration of dosage for optimal pain control and are frequently followed by adverse effects such as constipation, nausea or drug addiction. Currently, the FDA has imposed strict regulations regarding the amount, frequency \\& length of time patients may receive these medications. With tightly controlled regulations for prescribing narcotics and opioids for chronic pain management, the epidemic of street drug usage and overdose has dramatically increased. Alternatively, celiac plexus block and celiac plexus neurolysis performed under EUS guidance have been employed for pain control for at least 2 decades and deemed safe. Celiac plexus block refers to temporary inhibition of nerves of the celiac plexus, by using a combination of steroid and numbing medications injected into the celiac plexus ganglia. Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) refers to a temporary to semi-permanent inhibition of nerves of the celiac plexus ganglia. Injection of alcohol as a neurolytic agent is used in place of the steroid which causes neurolysis of the celiac plexus or ganglia.\n\nThis study will focus on collecting data related to endoscopic ultrasound procedures performed by Indiana University EUS physicians; specifically for the management of chronic pancreatitis pain. This data will be used for research purposes to determine the clinical impact of EUS-CPN management in chronic pancreatitis pain. The physicians will also be able to better understand the patient's condition and disease process that may lead to improved patient management."
