To mechanistically investigate the key social pairing components (i.e., older adults together, younger and older adult pairing) within a virtual program necessary to enhance social connectedness, decrease loneliness, improve well-being, and increase physical activity in older adults and younger adult participants in the short-term (pre-post) through surveys and qualitative interviews\n2. To mechanistically investigate the key social pairing components (i.e., older adults together, younger and older adult pairing) within a virtual program necessary to enhance social connectedness, decrease loneliness, improve well-being, and increase physical activity in older adults and younger adult participants in the long-term (8 weeks post-intervention / 18 weeks on study) through surveys and qualitative interviews"
