Thus, nutritional status is one important, modifiable clinical factor for maintaining physical and cognitive health among persons with dementia (PWD). This project will pilot an innovative approach to enhancing nutrition through the use of transitional-state snack supplements, or foods that start as one texture and change to another.\n\nSpecifically, this study aims to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a transitional-state therapeutic nutrition supplement among adults with dementia. The central hypothesis is that access to ready-made, savory, nutrient- dense snack supplements that resemble \"typical\" preferred foods and eating habits will result in improved nutritional intake and status among PWD."
