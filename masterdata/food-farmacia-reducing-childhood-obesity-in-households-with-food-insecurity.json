            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test whether the Food FARMacia intervention to reduce food insecurity is feasible and accepted among families with an infant age 6 to less than 18 months receiving pediatric primary care at Columbia / New York-Presbyterian Ambulatory Care Network.\n\nAll participants will receive nutrition education and anticipatory guidance to support healthy meal preparation in addition to usual care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Childhood obesity remains highly prevalent and originates early in life. Efficacious early life interventions to prevent childhood obesity are lacking, particularly among populations most burdened by childhood obesity. Food insecurity - defined as lack of enough food for an active, healthy life - may play key upstream roles in etiologies of obesity through establishment of unhealthy dietary patterns and stress-related metabolic perturbations. Household food insecurity during the first 24 months of life is a risk factor for later childhood obesity. Professional organizations recommend integration of household food insecurity screening into routine pediatric primary care. Yet, a critical gap exists in identification of efficacious clinical interventions to reduce food insecurity. Another gap exists in understanding relationships between food insecurity and etiologies of obesity. Food FARMacia is a clinically based mobile food pantry intervention developed to address the high prevalence of food insecurity among pediatric patients. No randomized trials of a clinically-based mobile food pantry intervention in pediatric primary care exist. To understand the role of food insecurity in etiologies of childhood obesity, efficacious interventions to reduce food insecurity are needed.\n\nHousehold food insecurity during infancy is a risk factor for later childhood obesity. In this pilot and feasibility study, the investigators will randomly assign infants and their parent in households with food insecurity to either 1) the Food FARMacia mobile food pantry intervention with twice monthly food distributions and self-directed meal preparation support or 2) self-directed meal preparation support. Infants age 6 to \\<18 months who are patients at Columbia pediatrics practices who have food insecurity identified on routine clinical screening will be identified as potentially eligible participants for recruitment. Parents will be asked to respond to survey questions about health behaviors for themself and their infant at baseline and follow-up.\n\nThe investigators will measure vital signs (e.g., weight and height/length) for parents and infants at baseline and follow-up. The investigators will examine feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction with the study procedures and intervention materials. The investigators will estimate intervention effects on infant weight characteristics and explore potential mediators such as reduction in food insecurity and changes in nutrition and other established obesity risk factors to inform a subsequent full-scale trial. If successful, results will lead to a full-scale trial to test effects of the intervention on food insecurity, nutrition, and infant growth. Eventually, these study results could transform clinical care to reduce childhood obesity."
