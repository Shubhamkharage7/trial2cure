The mobile app also includes e-questionnaires related to activities of daily living, pain, insomnia, quality of life and depression. The objectives of the study are to collect data on patients' symptoms with the application in a real life setting, to assess adherence to the use of the tool, user experience and satisfaction with the application, and safety of use.",

The existence of a possible learning effect on active testing will also be explored as a data point of interest.\n\nThe results will allow researchers to extend their knowledge of gMG from real-life data and of the use of digital tools in a gMG patient population"
