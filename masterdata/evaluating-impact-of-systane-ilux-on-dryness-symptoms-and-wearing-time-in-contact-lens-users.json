The pigments convert the light energy to heat, which is then transferred to the surrounding tissues, including the meibomian glands. The device heats the eyelid to 40-42\u00b0C and maintains it above 40\u00b0C during the heating period, which can be 40 seconds or more. This helps melt the meibum. After the heating phase, the meibomian glands are expressed with the built in expression system.",
