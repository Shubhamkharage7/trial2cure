The aim of this study is to observe the outcomes associated with the implants. Current stents have been suboptimal for treating benign stenosis of the airway and we are seeking to create a better treatment option. We hypothesize, based on the previous compassionate-use cases, that placing a patient-specific silicone stent will effectively alleviate symptoms associated with stenosis of the airway. The main measure of effectiveness will be patient-reported outcomes.\n\nThe implant will occur on Day 0 and TDI and formal assessment for AEs will occur on Day 1.\n\nPatients will be seen on Day 60 +/- 14 days for formal assessment including TDI and QOL, dynamic CT, and a bronchoscopy procedure will be performed as per our usual standard of care. Additional ascertainments of the TDI and QOL measurements will occur at 90 and 180 days after implantation.\n\nA standardized assessment of the stent as well and any modification or any other treatments will be recorded. Washing for cultures will also be done per standard of care during any bronchoscopy."

Plavix within one year of drug eluding cardiac stent (DES) or 6 weeks following bare metal coronary stent)\n* Unstable cardiac disease\n* Allergy to silicone\n* Stenting to manage vascular compression syndromes.\n* Multi-drug resistant bacterial or fungal chronic infections\n* Emergent/urgent clinically indicated stent.\n* Chronic/permanent mechanical ventilation.\n* Pure Excessive Dynamic Airway Collapse (EDAC) patients.\n* Pure Pulmonary Resistance (Rp) patients.",
