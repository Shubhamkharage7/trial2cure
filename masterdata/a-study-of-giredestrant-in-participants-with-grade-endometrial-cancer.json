but not limited to, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitors, endocrine therapy, biologic therapy, or herbal therapy within 28 days prior to the initiation of study enrollment\n* Any gastrointestinal condition causing malabsorption or obstruction (e.g., celiac sprue, gastric bypass surgery, strictures, adhesions, history of small bowel resection, blind loop syndrome)\n* Known hypersensitivity to giredestrant or its excipients\n* Known intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that will limit compliance with study requirements\n*

surgery, either for the treatment of cancer or any other surgery, during the study treatment period and up to 10 days after the completion of study treatment\n* Serious infections requiring IV antibiotics within 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment or any active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact participant safety\n* Participants who have clinically significant liver disease consistent with Child-Pugh Class B or C, including active hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B virus \\[HBV\\] or hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\]), current alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, or

tuberculosis\n* Severe infection per investigator judgment at the time of enrollment, including but not limited to, use of systemic antibiotics, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia, or any active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact participant safety\n* Significant cardiovascular disease, such as cardiac disease New

or history of cardiac dysfunction, as defined in the protocol\n* Major surgical procedure other than for diagnosis within 28 days prior to enrollment or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the study\n* Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or solid organ transplant\n* Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or renders the participant at
