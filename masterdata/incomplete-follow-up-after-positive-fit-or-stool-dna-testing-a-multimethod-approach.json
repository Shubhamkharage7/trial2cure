A navigator is an individual trained to help patients access necessary health care services and understand the test results and next steps. Participants will be asked to meet the navigator at their colonoscopy appointment and discuss any problems that are experienced in getting the colonoscopy done. This will take about 10 minutes to complete. Participants will tell him or her in their own words how the experience was and whether they faced any barriers to scheduling and colonoscopy completion. Study personnel will also look at participants' electronic medical record to see what testing participants had done that prompted the need for colonoscopy.The study will include about 30 people."
