            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) affects the immune system. People with CGD are more likely to get infections. Drugs can help control infections, but these treatments can cause side effects including kidney failure and deafness. Stem cell transplants can cure CGD, but these don t always work.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find out if a different drug treatment can improve the success rates of stem cell transplants in people with CGD.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 4-65 years with CGD.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will undergo screening. They will have a physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests and tests of their heart function and breathing. They will have imaging scans. They will have a bone marrow biopsy; a needle will be inserted into their hip to draw a sample of tissue from the bone.\n\nA tube called a catheter will be placed into a vein in the participant s chest. This catheter will remain in place for the transplant and recovery period. Blood for tests can be drawn from the catheter, and medications and the stem cells can be administered through it.\n\nParticipants will be in the hospital for either 10 or 21 days to receive 3 or 4 drugs before the transplant. They will get 2 doses of total body radiation on the same day.\n\nParticipants will receive donor stem cells through the catheter. They will remain in the hospital for 6 weeks afterward.\n\nParticipants will visit the clinic 2 to 3 times per week for 3 months after discharge.\n\nFollow-up visits will continue for 5 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder resulting from a failure to produce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, necessary for protection against a number of infectious organisms. Patients are subject to recurrent infections and inflammatory complications. The current management of these patients is limited to close surveillance for infections, administration of prophylactic antimicrobials, and rapid and aggressive treatment of suspected and documented infections with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although often effective, these treatments can require long hospitalizations, impacting the overall quality of life significantly and leading to significant morbidity, such as renal failure and deafness. CGD patients have autoinflammation that may manifest as inflammatory bowel disease, hypoxic lung inflammation, and/or liver nodular regenerative hyperplasia with venopathy as examples.\n\nCurrently the only available cure for these disorders is bone marrow transplantation, which preferentially uses a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related sibling as the donor (allogeneic stem cell transplantation). However, as only 30% of participants in the general population have an HLA-matched related sibling, allogeneic related transplantation is often not an option, resulting in the need for matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation. The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) serves as both a national registry of volunteers who are willing to donate progenitor cells to eligible recipients as well as a repository of cord blood products. Despite continued improvement in the use of transplantation schemas- including the development of nonmyeloablative regimens-there remain significant morbidity and mortality associated with transplantation, in particular graft versus host disease (GvHD) and graft rejection. CGD with severe autoinflammation manifested as C-reactive protein (CRP) \\>=100 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) has been a significant risk factor for mortality due to severe engraftment syndrome, and thus patients with elevated CRPs have not been eligible for prior transplant protocols.\n\nIn addition, despite improving engraftment rates, there continues to be mixed chimerism and late graft loss in CGD participants despite a variety of conditioning regimens being used at various centers.\n\nIn our most recent protocol, we have continued to have a low incidence of graft versus host disease and improved engraftment, but still could see improvement in graft stability. Thus, in order to improve outcomes with participants with elevated CRPs as well as improve overall engraftment, we are building on our prior regimens by targeting the inflammatory cytokines that appear to be involved in graft failure and engraftment syndrome.\n\nParticipants with a CRP of less than 100 mg/mL will be pretreated with a dose of tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody. Participants with a CRP of greater than 100 mg/mL will be pretreated with 2 doses of tocilizumab as well as an inhibitor of interferon-gamma in order to decrease the inflammation that has been seen in these participants with engraftment. Otherwise, the conditioning regimen will be similar to maintain the low rates of GvHD that we have seen to date."

Acceptable forms of contraception are:\n\n  * Contraceptive pills or patch, Norplant \\[Registered\\], Depo-Provera \\[Registered\\], or other FDA-approved contraceptive method.\n  * Male partner has previously undergone a vasectomy.\n  * Male participants will be advised to consistently use contraception throughout study participation and for 3 months post-transplant.\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and is available for protocol visits for the duration of the study when possible.\n* Patients who have a CRP of greater than 100 but otherwise meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled on the high-risk arm.\n\n  * CRP will be assessed no more than 7 weeks and no less than 6 weeks prior to anticipated transplant to determine on which arm the patient will be treated.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n* Ejection fraction of less than 30% by echocardiography.\n* Forced expiratory volume (FEV1%) of less than 35% and/or an adjusted diffusing capacity of lung of carbon monoxide (adj DLCO) of less than 30%.\n* Transaminases \\>5x upper limit of normal based on the individual s clinical situation and at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Psychiatric disorder or mental deficiency severe enough as to make compliance with the HSCT treatment unlikely, and/or to make regulatorily and legally effective informed consent impossible.\n* Major anticipated illness or organ failure incompatible with survival from allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (AlloPBSC) transplant.\n* Pregnant or lactating.\n* Uncontrolled seizure disorder per principal investigator (PI) discretion.\n* Individuals older than 65 years are excluded. It is known from standard transplantation that these individuals have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality related to transplantation. Given the investigational nature of this protocol, the risk-benefit ratio is not warranted to include these individuals at this time.\n* Active TB infection.\n* Any condition or circumstance that the PI feels would create difficulty in maintaining compliance with the requirements of this protocol.\n* Individuals who are not willing to submit their information as part of the alemtuzumab (Campath \\[Registered\\]) Distribution Program application or participants whom the Distribution Program committee has determined are not qualified to receive alemtuzumab.\n\nNOTE: Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) (intravenous \\[IV\\] formulation) is no longer distributed commercially. To receive product, the physician must contact the program for the patient. If the patient is not willing to consent to submit their info (demographics, contact information, and rationale for use) to the program such that we can obtain the drug, then we cannot proceed with conditioning; therefore no transplant will occur on this protocol. http://www.campath.com/",
