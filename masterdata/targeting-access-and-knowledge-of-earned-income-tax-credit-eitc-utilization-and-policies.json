            "briefSummary": "The earned income tax credit (EITC) is the largest United States poverty alleviation program, providing up to $6,600 for working families as a tax refund. Prior studies have shown the EITC's benefits for social outcomes and health. Effects are even more significant for single mothers and Black women. Despite these known benefits, 20%-33% of eligible individuals do not receive benefits, leaving $7 billion unclaimed annually. The Targeting Access and Knowledge of EITC Utilization and Policies (TAKE-UP) Study is a pilot randomized controlled trial that will develop and test the feasibility of several culturally tailored, scalable interventions to increase the take-up of the EITC among participants in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)."
