This survey research involves Phase 1 and Phase 2 of questioning, each phase involves up to 3 rounds of questions to determine agreement or disagreement. Each round will take approximately 20 minutes to complete, and responses will remain completely confidential. For both phases, the questions will either be 7-point Likert or multiple choices. For both phases, the group of questions will be sent up to three times until agreement (up to 80% of agreement consensus). Questions that have obtained agreement will be removed in each round. The questions will help the experts and the research team understand where there is current agreement on, or topic that may need to be discussed/studied further to unify trainings."
