Participants will be randomized in a 2:1:1 fashion to either the ProtEmbo arm, the Sentinel arm, or the 'No device' arm.\n\nEnrolled subjects will undergo an MRI at baseline and at 36 hours \u00b112 hours, to evaluate any new cerebral lesions. Enrolled subjects will be followed for 30 days.\n\nThe study aims to address:\n\n* whether the occurrence of all Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE) at 30 days is comparable between the ProtEmbo group and the hybrid control group.\n* whether the total new lesion volume in the brain assessed by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images at 36 \u00b112 hours is comparable between the ProtEmbo group and the hybrid control group."
