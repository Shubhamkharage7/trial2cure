ALZ-NET is a longitudinal registry with an expandable platform, designed to grow with scientific and medical advancements. As new treatments are approved and implemented in care, ALZ-NET will track the long-term health outcomes associated with their use in a real-world setting.

            "detailedDescription": "ALZ-NET is collecting longitudinal clinical and safety data for enrolled patients that are being evaluated for or being treated with novel FDA-approved AD therapies. ALZ-NET is a longitudinal registry with an expandable platform, designed to grow with scientific and medical advancements. As new treatments are approved and implemented in care, ALZ-NET will track the long-term health outcomes associated with their use in a real-world setting. ALZ-NET aims to assess the clinical course of people from a variety of backgrounds and communities, to achieve representativeness beyond the populations historically enrolled in clinical trials. ALZ-NET will be a resource for evidence gathering, information sharing, and education across clinical and research communities, encouraging innovative, inclusive research and supporting opportunities to improve clinical care delivery.\n\nALZ-NET will align with the following objectives:\n\n* Collect baseline and longitudinal patient data, including measures of cognition, function, and long-term safety.\n* Collect and archive diagnostic, neuroimaging, genetic and fluid biomarkers.\n* Track health outcomes and resource utilization through existing databases.\n* Share deidentified data, images and biosamples with the research community and other stakeholders.\n\nAll participating physicians and site staff will complete comprehensive training to ensure adherence of data requirements and registry timelines. ALZ-NET will collect longitudinal data through site submitted case report forms and payer claims. Additional objectives of ALZ-NET are to establish a biorepository of plasma, CSF and DNA samples and to archive brain images from participants who consent to these optional elements.\n\nIn addition to the aims and objectives outlined within this protocol, ALZ-NET will serve as a backbone registry and platform for collection of regulatory grade data and collaboration with affiliated studies. Affiliated studies are thoroughly reviewed by the ALZ-NET Steering Committee before receiving affiliation approval. ALZ-NET will allow for seamless co enrollment of participants that are being evaluated for or receiving a novel FDA-approved treatment for AD. This collaboration structure is designed to reduce the operational burden of participating sites and patients."

ALZ-NET archives the clinical and image data obtained as part of its research activity. This archive can be used for secondary research studies, to guide further drug or technology development, and for educational purposes. Access to CMS claims data used in ALZ-NET is handled separately and requires permission from CMS. Any individual or entity may submit a request for the clinical data, image data, or images linked to clinical data archived by ALZ-NET. The Network will provide requesters the raw data as it is archived in the database. However, requesters can specify subsets of data they desire using the annotated elements from the case report forms. The identity (and identifiable information) of network participants, sites and investigators will not be provided to requesters.",
            "accessCriteria": "The application forms for requesting archived clinical and image data is available on upon request. Requests for access to the ALZ-NET archive should be sent to alz-net@acr.org. Before indicating in a grant proposal that clinical and/or image data archived by ALZ-NET will be used to conduct the proposed research, an investigator should submit a request and obtain written approval from ALZ-NET prior to submitting the grant proposal. ALZNET treats such requests as it does any other."
