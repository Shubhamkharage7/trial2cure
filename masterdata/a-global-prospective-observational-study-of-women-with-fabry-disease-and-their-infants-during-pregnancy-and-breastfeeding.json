The study will evaluate outcomes of pregnancy and/or breastfeeding in women and infants exposed to migalastat. All pregnant women with Fabry disease are eligible to enroll, an unexposed cohort potentially can be used for comparisons.\n\nCases will be reported voluntarily to the Pregnancy Coordinating Center (PCC) from any country by Healthcare Providers (HCPs), by patients and secondary contacts. The PCC will follow patients throughout their pregnancies and/or breastfeeding and infant through 1 year of age.\n\nThere will be 2 cohorts enrolled in the study. Cohort 1 will be pregnant and/or breastfeeding patients who have Fabry Disease, and have been exposed to at least 1 dose of migalastat during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. Cohort 2 will be pregnant and/or breastfeeding patients who have Fabry Disease, who were not exposed to migalastat during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding.\n\nThis is an observational study, it will enroll patients and collect data as described in this protocol for a minimum of 10 years."
