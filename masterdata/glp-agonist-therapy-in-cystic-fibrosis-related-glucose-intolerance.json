While reduced \u03b2-cell mass contributes to the insulin secretory defects that characterizes cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), other modifiable determinants appear operative in the emergence and progression of abnormal glucose tolerance towards diabetes. Identifying interventions to preserve \u03b2-cell function are crucial for delaying and potentially preventing CFRD development. In this study, we hypothesize that weekly administration of the long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist dulaglutide will improve defective early-phase insulin secretion and improve glucose tolerance during a mixed-meal tolerance test.",
