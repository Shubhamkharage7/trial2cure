During the same procedure, muscle fiber fragments will be obtained from the sample and then immediately delivered via target injected into the bladder neck sphincter region using an endoscopic needle via cystoscope or under ultrasound guidance. All subjects will be followed at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment injection."
