            "briefSummary": "Despite advances in effective psoriatic disease treatment, the disease still has a serious impact on mental health and well-being of millions of patients. Up to 20.7% of patients report poor mental health, compared to 7.1% of the general population. Mental health treatment involves a combination of medication and talk therapy to address such issues. However, there is increasing evidence that optimizing behaviors such as sleep, physical activity, stress, and nutrition are critical components in improving mental health too. Numerous online health programs have evolved to help patients optimize such behaviors but very little exists for patients with psoriatic diseases. The \"Immune Strength\" 12 week program utilizes online electronic coaching (eCoaching) with weekly access to a wellness professional to provide a low-cost, high-touch, personalized intervention that patients can access 24/7. In conjunction with traditional clinical care, the goal of this program is to leverage the convenience, affordability, scalability and effectiveness of an online eCoaching program to improve key physical behaviors, thereby reducing the mental health burden experienced by psoriatic disease patients."
