Dose optimization could be performed as indicated by the emerging data.\n\nPhase 2 Part:\n\nPhase 2 part will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TSN1611 as monotherapy at the recommended dose in separate groups of patients with pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or other solid tumors, harboring KRAS G12D mutations."
