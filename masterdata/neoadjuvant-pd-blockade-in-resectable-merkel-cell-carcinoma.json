Must be expected to have an adequate amount of tumor burden to yield 2-4 pre-operative research core biopsy (14-gauge needle) specimens or the equivalent amount of tissue (4-6 mm punch biopsy), in addition, to the tissue required for diagnostic purposes. For stage III MCC patients, assessment of measurable disease/tumor burden will be determined by tumor imaging and reviewed by the treatment team.\n3. Must be expected to have an adequate amount of residual tumor after their pre-operative research tumor tissue collection, such that their operative research tumor collection will also yield at least 4-6 research core biopsy specimens or the equivalent amount of tissue.\n4. Must be willing to undergo the two paired tumor tissue biopsy procedures to obtain samples for biomarker analysis. Tissue obtained must not be previously irradiated.\n5. Male subjects must agree to use a contraception during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n6. Female subjects must not be pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR a WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n7.

Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subject with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.\n12. Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n13. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.\n17. Concurrent active Hepatitis B (defined as HBsAg positive and/or detectable HBV DNA) and Hepatitis C virus (defined as anti-HCV Ab positive and detectable HCV RNA) infection.\n18. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, such that it is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n19. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n20.
