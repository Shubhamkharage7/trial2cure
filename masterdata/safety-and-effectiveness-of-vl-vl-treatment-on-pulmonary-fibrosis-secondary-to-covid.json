            "briefSummary": "The COVID-induced fibrotic lung damage continues long after viral infection has subsided and is exhibited by severe respiratory pathology and concomitant symptoms. The long-lasting sequelae in patients who have recovered from severe COVID indicate that there is a 30% chance of developing a persistent respiratory system pathology and a 10% chance of developing a severe pathology. The symptoms of lung fibrosis include a severe disruption of respiration, reduction of exercise tolerance, and concomitant development of persistent fibrotic lung damage. This study intends to evaluate benefits of a combination of VL-P22 and VL-PX10 in Covid-19 patients exhibiting pulmonary fibrosis.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple clinical trials are underway to explore options for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with history of COVID. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have been used worldwide for various pulmonary diseases. A recent review of over 110 reports of clinical trials worldwide with MSC-based therapies in pulmonary diseases found that these therapies have been reported to be safe and effective in the treatment of acute/viral pulmonary disease, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), interstitial lung diseases (ILD), chronic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and lung cancer. A phase 2 clinical trial in 101 severe Covid-19 patients with lung damage using human umbilical cord derived MSCs found that the treatment exerted numerical improvement in whole lung lesion volume and the 6-minute walk test from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo.\n\nThis proof of concept, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of VL-PX10 and VL-P22, versus placebo, for use in the treatment of Covid induced Pulmonary Fibrosis. This is an add-on treatment study; subjects will be allowed to take standard of care treatments available.\n\nThe study will have two arms (n=10 each):\n\n1. Experimental/treatment arm: VL-PX10 and VL-P22 plus standard care\n2. Placebo: Saline plus standard care\n\nThe study duration would be 5 days of treatment plus 12 weeks follow up."
