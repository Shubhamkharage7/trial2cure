            "briefSummary": "The proposed research effort will:\n\nThe purpose of this study is as follows:\n\n1. Test the effectiveness of the Minds and Mentors Program in a group treatment trial in which individuals using medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) will be randomized in blocks of five to receive either the Minds and Mentors Program (n=120) or Twelve Step Facilitation (n=120).\n2. Determine whether the MiMP: a) improves adherence to MOUD b) reduces the rate of relapse and cravings c) decreases self-reported anxiety, stress, and depression and d) reduces cortisol levels and cortisol reactivity to drug cues.\n3. Examine whether pre-intervention cortisol reactivity is predictive of relapse outcomes, and/ or reductions in cortisol reactivity over the course of intervention mediate relapse outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Although medications for opioid use disorders (MOUD) is safe and effective and is currently considered the gold standard for treating OUD, adherence to MOUD regimens remains a challenge. Early studies have demonstrated efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions as adjunctive treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) while reducing substance use and cravings. In addition, non-randomized pilot studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals undergoing MOUD.\n\nThe goal of the proposed study is to determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention that also utilizes peer mentors in addition to professional substance abuse therapists (the Minds and Mentors program \\[MiMP\\]) in improving adherence to MOUD and reducing relapse rates in a sample of individuals with OUD who are also on MOUD versus a twelve-step facilitation (TSF) program. The MiMP is a twelve-week intervention that uses group therapy and meets once a week for about two hours. The primary outcome measure will is adherence to medications for OUD. The secondary outcome measures will include the demographic covariates, depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life, and cravings. Finally, exploratory outcome measures will include cortisol levels and rates of reactivity to drug cues. This study will randomize participants in either intervention or control group in blocks of five. Data collection will occur at baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks (end of treatment) and at 12- week and 24- week follow-up."
