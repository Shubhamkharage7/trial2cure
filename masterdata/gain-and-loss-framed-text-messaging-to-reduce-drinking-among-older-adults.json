            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of scalable, tailored text- messaging programs for alcohol use among older adults. This study focuses on gain and loss framing of behavior change goals (i.e., the positives of change and the negatives of remaining with the status quo), critical components of behavioral science and health behavioral interventions. Loss-framing is used to motivate individuals to avoid future problems by focusing on the consequences of no change in behavior, and gain-framing is used to facilitate progress by focusing on the benefits of change. The investigators will design and evaluate three text-messaging programs using a randomized controlled trial: (A) Loss-framed messaging (B) Gain-framed messaging; and (C) Combined (loss and gain) messaging among a sample of 150 older adults with hazardous drinking. Participants will be randomized to one of the three conditions, each of which will include 8 weeks of text-messaging. During the study participants will completed assessments online and via text messages to track drinking.",
            "detailedDescription": "There is an urgent call for efficient and effective assessment, prevention, and intervention among older adults (age 50 and older) to reduce health risk of hazardous drinking, encourage healthy aging, and reduce burden on healthcare systems. Brief, low-burden, low-cost, digital interventions among older adults can answer this call. Text-messaging health interventions are considered an effective, scalable way to deliver behavioral health interventions, and they have been used as evidence-based solutions in primary care settings among older adults for behaviors other than alcohol use to supplement traditional care. Contrary to stereotypes, older adults use mobile technology, seek online and mobile interventions, and often engage longer compared to younger populations. The primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate effectiveness of scalable, tailored text- messaging programs for alcohol use among older adults. This study focuses on gain and loss framing of behavior change goals (i.e., the positives of change and the negatives of remaining with the status quo), critical components of behavioral science and health behavioral interventions. Loss-framing is used to motivate individuals to avoid future problems by focusing on the consequences of no change in behavior, and gain-framing is used to facilitate progress by focusing on the benefits of change. The investigators will design and evaluate three text-messaging programs using a randomized controlled trial: (A) Loss-framed messaging (B) Gain-framed messaging; and (C) Combined (loss and gain) messaging among a sample of 150 older adults with hazardous drinking. Participants will be randomized to one of the three conditions, each of which will last 8 weeks. Participants will undergo cross- sectional online assessments (baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 16), and they will also complete a mobile assessment (via text message) once per week to track drinking. The effects of condition on drinking behavior will be compared at weeks 4, 8 and 16. In addition, attrition from the study will be closely tracked. Finally, the investigators will explore how the effects condition are impacted by gender and age (via moderation analysis)."
