            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this open label exploratory study is to evaluate the effect of CR to improve autonomic cardiovascular regulation in participants with symptoms of stress, anxiety, or insomnia.\n\nThe secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of CR on a variety of self-reported symptom inventories.\n\nTertiary objectives are to explore the impact of selected medications on outcomes associated with use of CR, the effect size in subgroups of participants who also report specific co-morbid symptoms or conditions of interest, and any unexpected challenges or barriers for working with the same. The latter includes those with TBI, PTSD, hypertension, hot flashes, chronic pain, or prior stroke.\n\nMethods: This will be a single site, open label, pilot clinical trial, enrolling people aged 11 or older, who have self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, or insomnia, and meet a threshold score on self-reported inventories. Up to 150 participants will be enrolled. Participants will receive between 6 and 12 sessions of audible tones echoing current brainwave activity (CR). Participants will continue their other current care throughout the study. There will be pre- and post-intervention data collection of physiological outcomes (BP, HR, and measures of autonomic cardiovascular regulation assessed by heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity), which will alse serve as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes to be collected include symptom inventories for insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies- Depression Scale, CES-D), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS), traumatic stress (PTSD Checklist for civilians, PCL-C, or military, PCL-M), , and overall quality of life (QOLS). Other secondary outcome inventories will be collected for physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ-SF), and physical activity satisfaction questions, as well. Participants who also self-report having specific co-morbid symptoms or conditions of interest may complete additional condition-specific outcome measures. All measures will be collected at an enrollment visit (V1), and the intervention will begin 0-14 days thereafter. Mean contrasts will be used to compare the changes in measures of autonomic cardiovascular regulation from V1 to V3, the primary outcome, as well as for secondary outcomes. Linear mixed models, which can accommodate within-subject correlations due to repeated assessments over time, will be used to generate point estimates for effect size along with 95% confidence intervals."

The CR system also includes 64-bit processing architecture for faster feedback, the use of 4 sensors, and the use of standard protocols (with flexibility regarding the length and sequencing of the standard protocols), all done with eyes closed. Four sensors are applied to the scalp at a time. However, only two sensors are actively echoing feedback. The software automatically switches from one sensor pair to the other when needed. This reduces the number of sensor placement changes needed, resulting in shorter session time and fewer interruptions.",
