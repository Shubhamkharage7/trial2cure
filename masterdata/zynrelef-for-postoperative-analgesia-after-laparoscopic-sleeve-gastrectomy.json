Postoperatively, intermittent IV acetaminophen will be administered as per need till discharge.\n\nGroup 2: 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine and 10mg dexamethasone into all surgical sites and intermittent IV acetaminophen as per need till discharge.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia achieved following the instillation of ZYNRELEF\u00ae all incision sites in addition to Ropivacaine with dexamethasone + postoperative IV acetaminophen, to the standard treatment of Ropivacaine with dexamethasone + postoperative IV acetaminophen in subjects undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate additional efficacy parameters, including opioid load, in this study population.\n2. To determine the impact of ZYNRELEF\u00ae on the cost of pain management.\n3. To assess the time taken to resume exercise after discharge.\n4. To assess the adverse events reported following the use of ZYNRELEF\u00ae."

Has a contraindication or a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity or clinically significant idiosyncratic reaction to Ropivacaine (or other local anesthetics), meloxicam, acetaminophen, ketamine, fentanyl, hydromorphone or dexamethasone. Subjects in all cohorts must not have any contraindications to any of the protocol-specified drugs (Ropivacaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, meloxicam, fentanyl, ketamine, acetaminophen, hydromorphone or dexamethasone).\n2. Has been administered Ropivacaine within 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery.\n3. Has been administered any local anesthetic within 72 hours prior to the scheduled surgery, other than for pretreatment prior to a needle placement, to treat an AE that occurs after signing the ICF, or to decrease venous irritation (eg, caused by propofol, in which case no more than a single administration of lidocaine 1% 20 mg IV may be administered).\n4.

Conditions may include but are not limited to, any of the following:\n\n   1. History of asthma or urticarial/ allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or NSAIDs.\n   2. History of clinically significant cardiac abnormality such as myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to signing the ICF, New York Heart Association class III or IV, or clinically significant abnormalities of electrocardiogram (ECG) or cardiac function.\n   3. History of coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 12 months prior to signing the ICF.\n   4. History of severe liver function impairment as defined by Child-Pugh Class C, having an aspartate aminotransferase \\>3 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN) or having an alanine aminotransferase \\>3 \u00d7 ULN.\n   5. History of severe kidney function impairment as defined by creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) \\<30 mL/min, being on dialysis, and/or having a serum creatinine \\>2 \u00d7 ULN.\n   6. History of known or suspected coagulopathy or uncontrolled anticoagulation (PLT count \\<100,000/\u03bcL; hemoglobin \\<12 g/dL; or hematocrit \\<35%).\n   7. Loss of sensation in extremities or significant peripheral neuropathy.\n6. As per subject history and/or medical records, has active infection or is currently undergoing treatment for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n7. Has uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with study assessments.\n8. Had a malignancy in the last year, with the exception of nonmetastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n9. Has a known or suspected history of drug abuse over the last 6 months, a positive drug screen on the day of surgery, or a recent history of alcohol abuse over the last 6 months. Note: Subjects with a positive drug screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder) may be eligible for participation in the study at the discretion of the Sponsor.\n10. Previously participated in a ZYNRELEF\u00ae or HTX-011 study.\n11. Received an investigational product or device in a clinical trial within 30 days or within 5 elimination half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to surgery, or is planning to take part in another clinical trial while participating in this study.\n12. Has undergone 3 or more surgeries within 12 months prior to signing the Informed Consent Form, other than for diagnostic procedures (eg, colonoscopy)",
