            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well a web-based program called Project Prepare works in helping patients with head and neck cancer adhere to swallowing and trismus exercises and coping strategies. Head and neck cancer patients who receive radiation therapy are at risk for permanent swallowing disorders and other side effects. Because of these potential problems, swallowing exercises and coping strategies are important parts of recovery. A web-based program designed to increase adherence to preventive exercises may help patients with head and neck cancer ameliorate the long-term effects of radiation therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the impact of a web-based adherence program (PREPARE) on self-reported swallowing function in head and neck cancer patients during radiation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine community participant adherence to targeted swallowing and trismus exercises delivered by the PREPARE website video demonstrations.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To promote the long-term dissemination of the Dysphagia Prevention program through measurement of patient satisfaction and engagement metrics, training and continual feedback between the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) research site and community collaborative research sites.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients use the password-protected Project Prepare website on a computer, tablet, or phone over 10 weeks to view: videos of the swallowing and trismus exercises, tips and stories from former patients, what to expect each week of treatment, recipes and cooking demonstrations, how to take care of their teeth during treatment, strategies for stress relief, and strategies for dry mouth and nausea. This website is designed to reach underserved populations who do not have ready access to specialized preventive care.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months."
