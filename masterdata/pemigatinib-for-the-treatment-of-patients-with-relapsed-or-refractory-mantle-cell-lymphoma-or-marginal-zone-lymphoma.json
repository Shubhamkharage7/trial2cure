            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well pemigatinib works in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory). Pemigatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of pemigatinib in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) MCL.\n\nII. To evaluate the efficacy of pemigatinib in patients with R/R MZL.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate at end of cycle 6 (C6). II. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR). III. To evaluate the median and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To evaluate the median and 2-year overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the factors predictive of response to pemigatinib and identify mechanism of resistance to therapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pemigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also under computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/CT and blood sample collection at screening and on study. Patients may also undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy during screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 or 6 months."

QTcF is calculated using Fridericia's Formula (QTcF)\n\n  * Correction of suspected drug induced QTcF prolongation can be attempted at the investigator's discretion and only if clinically safe to do so with either discontinuation of the offending drug or switch to another drug not known to be associated with QTcF prolongation\n  * Correction for underlying bundle branch block (BBB) allowed\n\n    * Note: Patients with pacemakers are eligible if they have no history of fainting or clinically relevant arrhythmias while using the pacemaker\n* Patients who have tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For patients with unknown HIV status, HIV testing will be performed at screening and result should be negative for enrollment\n* Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection based on criteria below:\n\n  * Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are excluded. Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and negative HBsAg require hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation before enrollment. Patients who are HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) PCR positive will be excluded. Patients with positive anti-HBc and negative HBV DNA should be on prophylactic nucleo(t)side analogue therapy to prevent reactivation with serial HBV DNA PCR monitoring\n  * Hepatitis C virus (HCV): positive hepatitis C antibody. If positive hepatitis C antibody result, patient will need to have a negative result for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) before enrollment. Patients who are hepatitis C RNA positive will be excluded. Patients with SMZL who have chronic HCV will need to have undergone antiviral treatment to participate\n* Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including but not limited to, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infection (except for fungal nail infection), or other clinically significant active disease process which in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor may pose a risk for patient participation. Screening for chronic conditions is not required\n* Active second malignancy unless in remission and with life expectancy \\> 2 years\n* Are pregnant and breast feeding\n* Pregnancy or nursing women or subjects expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through completion of safety follow-up visit (90 days from date of last dose for male subjects)\n* History and/or current evidence of ectopic mineralization/calcification, including but not limited to soft tissue, kidneys, intestine, myocardia, or lung, excepting calcified lymph nodes and asymptomatic arterial or cartilage/tendon calcification\n* Current evidence of clinically significant corneal or retinal disorder confirmed by ophthalmologic examination\n* Use of any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers or moderate CYP3A4 inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study drug. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not prohibited but should be avoided\n* Subject with history of hypovitaminosis D requiring supraphysiologic dose (such as 50,000 IU of vitamin D3) to replenish the deficiency. Subjects receiving vitamin D food supplements are allowed\n* Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of pemigatinib\n* Current evidence of clinically significant corneal (including but not limited to bullous/band keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation/ulceration, and keratoconjunctivitis) or retinal disorder (including but not limited to macular/retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment) as confirmed by ophthalmologic examination\n* Patients with ongoing grade \u2265 2 toxicity from prior therapy, with exceptions such as alopecia",
