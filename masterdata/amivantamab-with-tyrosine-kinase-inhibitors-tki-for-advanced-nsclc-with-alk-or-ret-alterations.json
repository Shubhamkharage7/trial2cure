            "briefSummary": "Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1(ROS1), and ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene fusions initially respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies, acquired resistance is inevitable. In many of these cases, increased activation of the erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue (ERBB) or cMet pathways appears to be a bypass signaling mechanism that allows these cancer cells to circumvent the selective pressure from TKIs. Recent data have suggested that these pathways compensate for each other in situations where one pathway is inhibited, leading to \"kinase switch\" drug resistance. Thus, the expected inhibition of both pathways via treatment with the amivantamab and combination TKI combination may improve overall efficacy by limiting the compensatory pathway activation."

The subject must also not donate sperm during the study and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study drug, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Note: Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
