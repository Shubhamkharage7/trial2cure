            "detailedDescription": "The study is a randomized control trial involving 100 participants (Black men within 1 year of release from incarceration) to examine the effect of a tailored nurse case manager on glycemic control and other clinical outcomes, self-care behaviors, and quality of life at 6 months post-randomization. Participants assigned to MANAGe-DM will receive the standard diabetes education mailing in addition to a novel nurse case management intervention. Nurse case managers are trained RNs who support patients with T2DM by coordinating services, supporting self-care and implementing disease management strategies (Welch 2010). MANAGe-DM will include NCM services tailored to the health needs of Black men with recent release from incarceration and T2DM. MANAGe-DM will include three components: 1) diabetes education and skills training; 2) healthcare navigation and 3) basic needs navigation. The NCM will serve as an adjunct to the participant's primary care provider; they will not be embedded within a clinic but instead interact with the participant over the phone after study recruitment from a community setting."
