Source documents to substantiate the clinical diagnosis (for example, ultrasonography, liver biopsy, liver/spleen scan, laboratory results or clinical findings), and medical history will be reviewed and signed by the investigator\n* Participants with severe hepatic impairment must have CrCL \\>= 45 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 as calculated per CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy\n* Participants with normal hepatic function with presence of sexual dysfunction (abnormal libido, erectile dysfunction, etc.) or any medical condition that would affect sexual function\n* Participants with normal hepatic function who have Hepatitis A immunoglobulin M positivity, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity, positive serology for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C antibodies. Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity is not exclusionary if participant can provide evidence of Hepatitis B vaccination\n* Participants with severe hepatic impairment who have acute or exacerbating hepatitis, fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function as indicated by widely varying or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment in the judgment of either the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor\n* Participants with severe hepatic impairment previously diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma",
