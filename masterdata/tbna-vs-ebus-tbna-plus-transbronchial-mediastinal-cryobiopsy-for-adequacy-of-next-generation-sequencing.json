Patients in outpatient clinics or pre-operative holding areas planning to undergo a bronchoscopic biopsy of a suspected malignant lesion (peripheral or mediastinal) for initial diagnosis, staging, or acquisition of tissue for molecular analysis will be considered for enrollment and consented. Patients will only be enrolled if intraoperative ROSE of a mediastinal 8 lymph node or mass suggests malignancy. Patients will be randomized to continue with the operator's initial EBUS-TBNA needle or switch to a cryoprobe to perform a transbronchial mediastinal cryobiopsy.",
