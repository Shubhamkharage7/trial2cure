            "detailedDescription": "This is an open label, single arm phase 2 trial evaluating ZN-c3 combined with gemcitabine in second-line advanced pancreatic cancer. There are lab experiments that show that pancreatic cancer cells can respond to a combination of ZN-c3, an experimental drug, with gemcitabine.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ZN-c3 as a treatment for any disease. The FDA has approved gemcitabine as a treatment option for advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits, radiological scans (Computerized Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Positron Emission Tomography), blood tests, electrocardiogram, and tumor biopsy.\n\nIt is expected that about 34 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Research and Stand Up to Cancer are supporting this research study by providing funding to conduct the study. Zentalis is supplying the study drug, ZN-c3."

Patients with infections that require antibiotics or antifungal agents may be eligible, provided that infection is resolved and treatment is completed at least 7 days prior to study treatment start.\n* Participants with a clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder that in the opinion of the treating investigator could impact the absorption of the study drugs, including but not limited to refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal disease, inability to swallow the formulated product, or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ZN-c3.\n* Participants with a history of a clinically relevant second primary malignancy within the past 2 years. Exceptions include: resected basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.\n* Administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers and P-gp inhibitors. (See Appendix B)\n* Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because gemcitabine/ZN- c3 are anti-cancer agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with gemcitabine/ZN-c3, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with gemcitabine/ZN-c3.\n* Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within 6 months of the first dose of ZN-c3:\n\n  * 12-lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) of \\>470 ms, except for subjects with atrioventricular pacemakers or other conditions (e.g., right bundle branch block) that render the QT measurement invalid.",
