            "briefSummary": "Inhaler nonadherence is a common problem that has been estimated to account for approximately 60% of all asthma-related hospitalizations. Unfortunately, prior interventions to improve inhaler nonadherence have shown a lack of long-term success. This study proposes to assess the problem of non-adherence using a D\\&I research lens while testing a new inhaler approach to potentially ameliorate the detrimental consequences of maintenance inhaler nonadherence.",
            "detailedDescription": "While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered the essential foundation of most asthma therapy, ICS inhaler non-adherence is a notoriously common problem and a significant cause of asthma-related morbidity. Partially acknowledging the problem of non-adherence, international organizations recently made paradigm-shifting recommendations that all patients with mild or mild-to-moderate persistent asthma be considered for symptom-driven ICS-containing inhalers rather than relying on adherence to traditional maintenance ICS inhalers and symptom-driven beta-agonists. With this novel approach, asthma patients are at least exposed to the important anti-inflammatory effects of ICS-containing inhalers when their inhaler is deployed due to symptoms. The proposed study aims to (Aim 1) undertake a pragmatic pilot randomized-controlled trial to evaluate if an inhaler strategy that utilizes symptom-driven ICS inhalers is particularly accepted and beneficial in maintenance ICS inhaler non-adherent asthma patients, and (Aim 2) use a D\\&I science conceptual framework to better understand patients' and providers' views of inhaler non-adherence. This study will use an electronic sensor to monitor inhaler adherence and include semi-structured interviews using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)."

An Asthma Control Test (ACT) score at enrollment greater than or equal to 12 but less than or equal to 20 indicating partially controlled or moderately uncontrolled asthma. Adolescents age 12-17 with an ACT score 12-25 will be considered eligible.\n6. iPhone or Android smartphone with an active data plan and willingness to use the Adherium device.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Relevant comorbid pulmonary diseases including, but not limited to a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency.\n2. Current use of a biologic medication or investigational treatment for asthma.\n3. History of asthma requiring ICU admission in the last year.\n4.

Of note, fluticasone and budesonide/formoterol are formulary tier 1-2 for Missouri Medicaid and most commercial insurances and are believed to be equally or less expensive as alternative inhalers for most patients.\n5.
