            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective, controlled, pivotal clinical investigation to assess the efficacy of the Paxman Scalp Cooling System (PSCS) at preventing hair loss in people undergoing treatment for metastatic breast cancer with either Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132 or Trodelvy\u2122), trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a or Enhertu\u00ae), or Eribulin (Halaven\u00ae).\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Paxman Scalp Cooling System as a treatment option for preventing hair loss while patients are undergoing chemotherapy. This system has however not been specifically studied to look at its ability to prevent hair loss in patients specifically receiving sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan, or eribulin.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, photographs, hair loss assessments, questionnaires and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment with scalp cooling with standard of care chemotherapy treatment and will be followed for 2-4 weeks after completion of treatment with chemotherapy.\n\nIt is expected that about 120 people will take part in this research study.\n\nPaxman Coolers Limited is a medical device company and is supporting this research study by providing access to the investigational device, Paxman Scalp Cooling System."
