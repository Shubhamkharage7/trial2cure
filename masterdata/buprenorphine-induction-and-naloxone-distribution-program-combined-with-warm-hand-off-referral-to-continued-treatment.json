            "briefSummary": "This study is a collaboration between the University of Utah and Castleview Hospital in Price, Utah.\n\nBuprenorphine is a medication approved by the FDA to treat Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Castleview Hospital currently does not prescribe buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) instead it refers patients to outside addiction treatment facilities. This is a service focused project which the University of Utah will provide mentoring and education to Castleview in implementing an in ED buprenorphine/naloxone distribution program along with referral to continued services. After the program has been implemented, the investigators will evaluate it using quantitative surveys of program participants and qualitative interviews of hospital staff and stakeholders.",
            "detailedDescription": "Among health care environments, ED often are the front lines of care for those with OUD or who experience opioid overdose.\n\nThe University of Utah Hospital ED has the Bridge Program which provides buprenorphine and naloxone with warm-hand off referral for continued treatment to people presenting with OUD. In order to extend the services offered by the Bridge Program to rural hospitals, the investigators will be providing mentoring and education to Castleview Hospital in establishing a similar program. Castleview Hospital is the only acute care hospital that serves Carbon and Emery counties, which outside of the Salt Lake City metro area have the highest opioid overdose rates in the State of Utah.\n\nThis project will utilize both quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate the impact of this program on patients, hospital staff, and community members."
