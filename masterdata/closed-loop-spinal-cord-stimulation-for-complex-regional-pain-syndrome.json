After the trial period, if the provider determines the device improved the patient's pain and function, the permanent device will be implanted. The patient will fill out an outcomes packet at baseline, end of trial period, 3 months and 6 months. There will also be a blood draw to evaluate prolactin levels, which are associated with stress and pain, at baseline, end of trial period, and 3 months."
