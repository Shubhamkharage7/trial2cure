            "briefSummary": "The objective of this study is to test the effects of caffeine on neurocognitive and clinical recovery after major surgery. Specifically, this trial tests the primary hypothesis that caffeine will reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium.",
            "detailedDescription": "Delirium is a syndrome characterized by failure of basic cognitive functions that affects approximately 20-50% of older surgical patients. Delirium during surgical recovery is associated with increased mortality, cognitive and functional decline, and prolonged hospitalization. In fact, 3-year survival rates for acutely hospitalized patients with delirium, and subsyndromal delirium, are both less than 50%. Older age is predictive of delirium after surgery, and with aging surgical populations, the incidence of postoperative delirium and related complications are likely to increase in the coming years.\n\nCaffeine represents a novel, neurobiologically informed candidate intervention for reducing risk of early postoperative delirium. Caffeine promotes arousal via adenosine receptor antagonism and improves cognitive function concurrent with increased cortical cholinergic tone. Our preliminary data suggest that caffeine reduces risk of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium in adult non-cardiac surgery patients by optimizing cortical dynamics for cognition. Caffeine also optimizes key neurocognitive processes that support information processing and may improve other, related aspects of clinical recovery, such as rebound headache in habitual caffeine users. The objective of this trial is to thus test the effects of caffeine on neurocognitive and clinical recovery after major surgery. Specifically, the primary hypothesis is that caffeine will reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium. The secondary objectives are to (1) test whether caffeine positively impacts the quality of postoperative recovery via validated patient-reported measures and (2) identify neural correlates of delirium and Mild Cognitive Impairment via advanced electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis."
