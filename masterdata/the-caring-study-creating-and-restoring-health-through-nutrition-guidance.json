Body weight, plasma lipids, HbA1C, dietary intake and adherence, and food acceptability will be assessed at baseline and at 16 weeks. Their longer-term medical utilization will then be tracked for another 2 years and compared with that of a control population selected from Blue Cross Blue Shield subscribers. Weekly classes will be offered for the whole 2-year follow-up period. Plasma lipids and HbA1C will be assessed every 6 months during the 2-year follow-up period."
