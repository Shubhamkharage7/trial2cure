            "briefSummary": "This study aims to identify the neural, behavioral, and pharmacological mechanisms promoting diminished expression of drug-related memories in human drug addiction. In this fMRI study with a within-subjects placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over design, oral methylphenidate (20 mg) or placebo will be administered to individuals with cocaine use disorders (CUD) to peak during the retrieval of a drug-cue memory before extinction; in addition to fMRI activations, skin conductance responses (SCR, acquired simultaneously) will serve as the psychophysiological indicators of memory modification. Assessments of interference with the return of drug-cue memories via SCR and craving will be conducted the day following MRI. This pharmocologically-enhanced behavioral approach to decreasing drug memories and craving in iCUD could ultimately be used to develop effective cue-exposure therapies for drug addiction. Procedures include MRI, blood draw, questionnaires and interviews, skin conductance response measures, and behavioral tasks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cue-exposure therapy has not proven efficacious in reducing relapse in drug addiction, illuminating the need for alternative strategies. Here researchers will test the neural correlates of two strategies, encompassing behavioral and pharmacological approaches, aimed to interfere with the return of drug memories in individuals with cocaine use disorders. Results may pave the way towards enhancing the efficacy of cue-exposure therapy in reducing cue-induced craving and relapse in drug addiction (generalizable across drugs of abuse/behavioral addictions)."
