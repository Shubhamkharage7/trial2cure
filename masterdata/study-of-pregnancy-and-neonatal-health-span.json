Study of Pregnancy And Neonatal health (SPAN), TIMing of dElivery (TIME) is a randomized trial that will recruit up to 3,450 pregnant women with uncontrolled GDM and randomize the timing of their delivery. Women with GDM who are approached for the trial and are found eligible but do not consent to participating in randomization for delivery will be asked to consent for chart review only (estimated additional n=3,000). The primary objective is to determine the best time to initiate delivery for GDM-complicated deliveries (defined as the time when risk of illness and death for the newborn is the lowest) between 37-39 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized clinical trial under an adaptive design nested in a larger observational study, among women who are diagnosed with uncontrolled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Women from multiple clinical sites around the United States will be recruited into the study (n=3,450). Women with GDM who are approached for the trial and are found eligible but do not consent to participating to randomization for delivery will be asked to consent for chart review only (estimated additional n=3,000). The primary objective is to determine the optimal time to initiate delivery for GDM complicated deliveries (defined as the time when neonatal morbidity and perinatal mortality risk is the lowest) between 37-39 weeks (n=3,450 women). Newborn developmental and behavior outcomes, and anthropometric measures will also be assessed as secondary outcomes, as well as an exploratory analysis to investigate whether there are clinical, non-clinical or biochemical factors such as glucose measures that will further assist in refining the interval for optimizing time of GDM complicated deliveries relative to neonatal morbidity and perinatal mortality."
