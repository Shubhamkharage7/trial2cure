This study addresses this issue by exposing participants to a vaping prevention text message program over a 28-day period in a randomized controlled trial with a matched attention control condition. A follow-up assessment is also made 4 weeks after the text messaging ends.",
            "detailedDescription": "Tobacco prevention communication is a key tool for reducing tobacco use among adolescents and young adults. While the use of e-cigarettes and vaping has increased greatly among adolescents and young adults, there has been a dearth of research on effective communication strategies to reduce vaping. This study will test the impact of a text-messaging program on reducing susceptibility to vaping in a randomized controlled trial, illuminating whether such programs can be effective. The investigators focus on adolescents and young adults (ages 13-20) who currently vape or who are at risk of vaping.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive either a vaping prevention text message program or a wellness text message program (control). Participants in the study will take 4 online surveys over an 8-week period - at Visit 1 (baseline), Visit 2 (2 weeks), Visit 3 (4 weeks), and Visit 4 (8 weeks)."
