FID-007 is a packaged form of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, and uses a polyethylozaxoline (PEOX) polymer which may allow the drug to reach deeper into tumors and less into normal cells by being smaller.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FID-007 and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).\n\nII. To determine the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel, (free and total) in patients treated with FID-007.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the safety and tolerability of FID-007 by assessing toxicities per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.)4.3.\n\nII. To obtain a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of FID-007 via objective radiologic tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate in a preliminary fashion the serum concentration of total paclitaxel and free paclitaxel, and explore potential associations with serum concentrations, efficacy and toxicity.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\nParticipants receive FID-007 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically."
