            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMost medications that treat depression take weeks or months to work. Researchers want to develop fast-acting treatments. One dose of ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect. For most people, this lasts a week or less. Repeated doses of ketamine may help maintain this effect.\n\nObjective:\n\nMain Study: To study the effects of ketamine in treating depression.\n\nKetamine Metabolites Substudy: To study how ketamine effects brain chemistry.\n\nTo study how ketamine effects the brain. This is done by looking at metabolites, which are created when a drug is broken down.\n\nEligibility:\n\nMain Study: People ages 18-65 with major depressive disorder and healthy volunteers\n\nKetamine Metabolites Substudy: Healthy volunteers ages 18-65\n\nDesign:\n\nMain Study:\n\nParticipants will be screened in another study, with:\n\n* Medical and psychiatric history\n* Psychiatric and physical exam\n* Blood, urine, and heart tests\n\nParticipants will be inpatients at NIH for 4 phases totaling 14-20 weeks.\n\nPhase I (2-7 weeks):\n\n* Gradually stop current medications\n* MRI: Participants lie and perform tasks in a machine that takes pictures of the body.\n* Mood and thinking tests\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Sleep test: Monitors on the skin record brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and movement during sleep.\n* Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A coil on the scalp gives an electrical current that affects brain activity.\n* Stress tests: Electrodes on the skin measure reactions to loud noises or electric shocks.\n\nPhase I tests are repeated in Phases II and III and in the final visit.\n\nPhase II (4-5 weeks):\n\n* 4 weekly IV infusions of ketamine or a placebo during an MRI or MEG. For the MEG, a cone over the head records brain activity.\n\nPhase III (optional):\n\n* 8 infusions of ketamine over 4 weeks\n\nPhase IV (optional):\n\n* Symptoms monitoring for 4 weeks\n* Participants will have a final visit. They will be offered standard treatment at NIH for up to 2 months.\n\nKetamine Metabolites Substudy:\n\nParticipants will be screened in another study, with:\n\n* Medical and psychiatric history\n* Psychiatric and physical exam\n* Blood, urine, and heart tests\n\nParticipants will be inpatients at NIH for 4 days.\n\nStudy Procedures:\n\nMood and thinking tests\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\n1 infusion of ketamine\n\nSpinal tap and spinal catheter: Used to get samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This is a fluid that moves around and within the brain and spinal cord. Studying CSF will help us learn how ketamine effects brain chemistry",
            "detailedDescription": "Objective\n\nThe current protocol has a two-fold purpose. In the pharmacodynamic imaging phase, we will investigate the neuropharmacodynamics of acute intravenous ketamine administration in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy volunteers (HV) using functional MRI (fMRI) and electrophysiological modalities \\[electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)\\]. We will also investigate if specific signatures from functional neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) associated evoked potentials (TMS-EP), sleep EEG (S-EEG), and psychophysiologic responses can be used to classify specific subpopulations of patients with MDD; preliminary findings from such an approach may be important in forging further studies identifying those who will respond to ketamine infusions. In the repeat-dosing phase, we will expand upon our previous findings of the immediate efficacy of glutamatergic modulators by investigating the safety and efficacy of repeated dose administrations of ketamine in MDD patients. We will include all MDD patients regardless of antidepressant response to single infusions of ketamine to allow for potential identification of patients who are able to attain and/or maintain a response over a series of infusions. To reduce any potential biases due to partial blinding, all patients will be randomized into groups to receive ketamine at either 0.5 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg (an active comparator).\n\nStudy Population\n\nThe study consists of 50 patients with treatment-resistant MDD between 18 and 65 years old and 50 age/gender matched HVs. Within the MDD group, 25 patients will be enrolled into each group in the repeat-dosing phase. An addition 50 HVs will participate in the Ketamine Metabolites Substudy.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis study is a Phase I Clinical Trial that comprises four phases.\n\nPhase I includes screening, medication taper (as needed), medication-free period, and baseline assessments, including optional TMS-EP, S-EEG, the None, Predictive, Unpredictive (NPU)-threat test, non-brain imaging cognitive tasks, and blood samples for plasma neurochemicals and peripheral blood biomarkers.\n\nIn Phase II, all subjects will receive an alternating series of placebo and ketamine infusions, once per week, for a total of 4 infusions (2 ketamine, 2 placebo). Concurrently with each infusion, subjects will be administered either resting-state fMRI with simultaneous EEG, or resting state MEG recording, thus each subject receives fMRI+EEG and MEG for both a placebo and ketamine infusion. Participants may also undergo optional sEEG, non-brain imaging cognitive tasks, TMS-EP, and NPU.\n\nPhase III involves MDD patients whose depression symptoms relapsed after the final infusion in Phase II. Patients whose symptoms did not relapse may receive an additional one-week washout. Subjects will be randomized to receive ketamine at 0.5 or 0.1 mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks (total of 8 infusions). Participants may undergo optional fMRI, S-EEG, MEG, non-brain imaging cognitive tasks, TMS-EP, pupillometry, and NPU at time points between infusions. Clinical rating scales will assess depression symptomology and blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetics testing and biomarker analyses.\n\nPhase IV includes patients who completed Phase III and who are responders. These patients will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks, or until relapse, to determine durability of response. The final study day will include rating scales, medical evaluations, blood tests, and an additional sMRI to assess structural changes that may have occurred due to repeated ketamine infusions.\n\nThe protocol includes a substudy evaluating ketamine metabolites in (Ketamine Metabolites Substudy). Only HVs will be enrolled in this substudy. Subjects will undergo a single infusion of ketamine concurrently with serial peripheral blood collection. Some participants may also undergo serial CSF collection during the ketamine infusion. Clinical rating scales, cognitive tasks, MEG, S-EEG, CSF and/or blood draws for pharmacokinetics testing and biomarker analyses will be done.\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nThe primary outcome measure of Phase II is the pharmacodynamic fMRI and MEG responses to ketamine compared to placebo. Secondary outcome measures include the difference in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to 24 hours between the placebo and ketamine infusion, correlations between an antidepressant response and TMS-EP, S-EEG, neuroimaging, cognitive, and NPU measures. In Phase II, the HVs acts as another level of control to identify a potential neuropharmacodynamic signature associated with an antidepressant response to ketamine.\n\nThe primary outcome measure for Phase III is the difference or change in MADRS from baseline to the end of 4 weeks of twice-weekly infusions. Secondary outcome measures include cognitive, TMS-EP, S-EEG, and NPU-threat test measures.\n\nOther outcome measures for both Phase II and III include clinical rating scales, neurocognitive tests, ketamine levels, plasma neurochemicals, and peripheral blood biomarkers. Additional outcomes in Phase III are baseline and post-repeated dose infusion MRI scans, and neurocognitive test results. Rating scales are the outcomes measures of Phase IV. Subjects will continue Phase IV for 4 weeks or until relapse."
