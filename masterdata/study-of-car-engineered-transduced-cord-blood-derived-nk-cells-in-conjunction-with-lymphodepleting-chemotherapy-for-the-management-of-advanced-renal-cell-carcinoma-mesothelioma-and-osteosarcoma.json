Although the clinical benefit of CAR.70/IL15-transduced CB-derived NK cells has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit and thus, the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability. Efficacy will be determined in each of the three cohorts.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To quantify the persistence of infused allogeneic donor CAR-transduced CB-derived NK cells in the recipient.\n* To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.\n* To obtain preliminary data on quality of life and patient experience."
