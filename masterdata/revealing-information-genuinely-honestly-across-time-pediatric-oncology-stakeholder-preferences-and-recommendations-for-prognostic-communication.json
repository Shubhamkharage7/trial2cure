Specifically, to learn what stakeholders (i.e., patients, parents, and doctors) believe to be the \"right\" content, timing, and delivery of this important information.\n\nSpecific Aim 1\n\n* To define key stakeholder preferences and recommendations for timing, content, and delivery of prognostic communication across the advancing illness course and bereavement.\n\nSpecific Aim 2\n\n* To engage stakeholders in the design of a patient/parent centered RIGHTime framework and communication intervention to promote individualized, timely prognostic disclosure.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will have two phases.\n\nPhase 1:\n\nInvestigators will define key stakeholder preferences and recommendations for timing, content, and delivery of prognostic communication across the advancing illness course and bereavement. Eligible parents and patients will participate in semi-structured interviews on prognostic communication preferences, stratified by cohort: poor-prognosis diagnosis, advancing disease, phase I/II trial enrollment, and bereavement; eligible oncologists will complete interviews on prognostic disclosure preferences. Participants will participate in a single interview that will last anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes.The interview will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Participant demographic and social determinants of health information will be collected.\n\nPhase 2:\n\nInvestigators will partner with a smaller group of stakeholders (parents, patients, and oncologist) from phase 1 to develop a clinical communication guide to help improve communication between patients, families, and cancer doctors. The panel will meet across 4 sessions to develop a conceptual framework that explains the interconnecting variables influencing stakeholder preferences and to design a prognostic communication intervention (i.e., a RIGHTime communication guide) that encourages oncologists to provide individualized, timely prognostic disclosure."
