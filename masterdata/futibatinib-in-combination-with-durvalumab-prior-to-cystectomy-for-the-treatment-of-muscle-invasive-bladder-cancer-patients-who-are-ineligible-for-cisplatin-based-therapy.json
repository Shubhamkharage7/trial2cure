            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well the combination of futibatinib and durvalumab given before cystectomy works in treating patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy. Cisplatin-based therapy is the standard of care for patients with MIBC. However, many patients cannot receive standard therapy due to poor renal function, peripheral neuropathy, poor functional status, or clinically significant heart failure. Futibatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radical cystectomy is a surgery to remove all of the bladder as well as nearby tissues and organs. Giving futibatinib in combination with durvalumab before surgery may be an effective treatment option for patients with MIBC who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the pathologic complete response rate of neoadjuvant futibatinib and durvalumab combination in patients with MIBC and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) overexpression.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the safety of this neoadjuvant regimen. II. Assess the pathologic downstaging rate. III. Evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). IV. Evaluate delay in cystectomy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate potential predictive biomarkers. II. Assess changes in the tumor microenvironment in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples in participants.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive futibatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radical cystectomy within 4-12 weeks. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during screening and on the trial and also undergo blood sample collection on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3 months for 2 years."

Female subjects, if sexually active, must agree to use dual methods of contraception during the study and for a minimum period of 100 days after the last dose of the study drug\n  * Women participants without childbearing potential should refrain from donating oocytes from screening through 100 days after the last dose of the study drug\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9.0 g/dL\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1500 per mm\\^3\n* Platelet count \\>= 100 x 10\\^9/L\n* International normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) \\< 1.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), unless the patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy provided INR or PTT is within the therapeutic range of the intended anticoagulant therapy\n* Serum bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n* Measured creatinine clearance (CL) \\> 30 mL/min or calculated creatinine CL \\> 30 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks before the first dose of trial treatment\n* Has upper tract urothelial carcinoma\n* Has small-cell carcinoma component on histology\n* Evidence of measurable nodal or metastatic disease\n* Concurrent anticancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, investigational therapy, intravesical therapy, or tumor embolization)\n* Received prior systemic chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer at any time in the patient's medical history\n* Participation in any other study in which receipt of an investigational study drug or device occurred within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose. For investigational agents with long half-lives (e.g., 5 days or more), enrollment before the fifth half-life requires medical monitor approval\n* Has received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy or FGFR inhibitor previously for MIBC, except if used in earlier stage urothelial carcinoma such as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and completed \\> 3 months prior to registration\n* Underwent major surgery and has not recovered adequately from the intervention's toxicity and/or complications before starting therapy\n* Has an active second malignancy except for low-risk localized prostate cancer on \"watch and wait\"\n* Subjects with a history of malignancy that has been completely treated, with no evidence of active cancer for 2 years before enrollment, or subjects with surgically cured tumors with a low risk of recurrence are allowed to enroll at principal investigator (PI's) discretion\n* Has active cardiac disease, defined as:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris within 3 months of the first date of study therapy\n  * Unstable arrhythmias\n  * Decompensated heart failure\n  * Average QT corrected by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) \\> 470 msec (males and females) (Note: If the QTcF is \\> 470 msec in the first electrocardiography \\[ECG\\], a total of 3 ECGs separated by \\>= 5 minutes should be performed. If the average of these 3 consecutive results for QTcF is =\\< 470 msec, the subject meets eligibility in this regard.)\n* Has any medical condition that may prevent the patient from undergoing radical cystectomy\n* Must be at least 2 weeks beyond high-dose systemic corticosteroids; chronic steroid use up to 10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) is permitted\n* Has active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment with steroids (\\> 10 mg daily doses of prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive agents or any condition that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes treatment with durvalumab\n* Has a history or evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or non-infectious pneumonitis\n* Has a known history of HIV-1/2 with detectable viral load and/or CD4 count \\< 300/mL within the previous 3 months\n* Has detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if there is a known history of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n* History and/or current evidence of significant ectopic mineralization/calcification including but not limited to the soft tissues, kidneys, intestines, myocardium, and lungs, except calcified lymph nodes and asymptomatic coronary calcification\n* Current evidence of corneal or retinal disorder/ keratopathy including but not limited to bullous/ band keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation/ulceration, keratoconjunctivitis etc., confirmed by ophthalmologic examination\n* Have current evidence of endocrine alterations of calcium/phosphate homeostasis (e.g., parathyroid disorders, history of parathyroidectomy, tumor lysis, tumoral calcinosis) unless well controlled\n* Have used drugs that are dual p-glycoprotein and strong CYP3A inducers or inhibitors within 7 days prior to the first dose of the study drug\n* Has other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation or prevent completion of the study procedure and follow-up examinations",
