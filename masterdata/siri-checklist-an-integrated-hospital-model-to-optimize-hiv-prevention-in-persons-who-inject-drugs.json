            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to develop and test a serious injection-related injections (SIRI) checklist aimed at increasing evidence-based treatment for rural people who use drugs (PWUD) including innovative, long-acting injectable agents. The central hypothesis is that hospital-based care models can successfully engage rural and Southern (PWUD) in effective addiction treatment and infection prevention. The activities in this study will be foundational to Ending the HIV epidemic in rural states.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1:\n\nWe will conduct a prospective study of 60 PWUD hospitalized at UAB. Using a standardized survey, we will elicit HIV risk behaviors, substance use, and HIV-related stigma. We will use the 14-item Behavioral Risk Assessment for Infectious Diseases (BRAID) scale, which queries drug use and sexual behaviors while using drugs. We will also collect clinical and patient reported data related to infections (bacterial, viral), PrEP use, HCV treatment, and medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). We will query perception of HIV risk, PrEP awareness, and interest. Surveys will be completed electronically in private hospital rooms to reduce social desirability bias.\n\nAim 2:\n\nWe will conduct surveys with 60 PWUD hospitalized at UAB to evaluate attitudes and preferences toward opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and HIV prevention, including long-acting injectable formulations. We will explore interest and preferences related to hospital initiation of each medication. Each session will include open-ended questions on barriers, such as stigma, and opportunities for increasing evidence-based care including HIV prevention and addiction treatment.\n\nAim 3:\n\nThe SIRI Checklist will build on the existing standard of care for SIRI, Addiction Medicine and ID consultation, by adding a standardized reminder to offer MOUD, PrEP, and arrange appropriate community-based care with both Addiction and ID providers. SIRI Checklist will be inspired by the iCARE checklist, developed for endocarditis in PWID, but will be applicable for all PWUD and will incorporate HIV prevention education and linkage to care, including Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment. The checklist will be integrated into the provider's documentation using a smartphrase text for ease of use and standardization.\n\nOf the 60 participants we will randomize them to SIRI checklist (15), SIRI checklist plus enhanced Peer Recovery Coach (15), enhanced Peer Recovery Coach (15), or standard of care (15)."
