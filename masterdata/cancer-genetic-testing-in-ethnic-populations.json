To determine the prevalence of genetic mutations in cancer patients from various ethnic populations seeking care at Mayo Clinic Arizona and Mayo Clinic Florida cancer clinics.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Perform a chart review to assess the impact of genetic testing as part of standard of oncology care:\n\nIa. Determine prevalence of pathogenic germline mutation detected by multi-gene panel testing.\n\nIb. Determine differences in germline mutation detection in these patients as compared to traditional guideline (National Comprehensive Cancer Network \\[NCCN\\]) based approach for genetic evaluation.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood or saliva sample for genetic testing."
