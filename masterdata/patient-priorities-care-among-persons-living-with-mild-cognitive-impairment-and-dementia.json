Individuals who receive a packet will have the opportunity to engage in a conversation about what matters most to them and what their priorities are, with trained facilitators at the clinic."

Typically, we would include instances of these billing codes within a year of each other but, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, recognize that there may be less frequent clinical visits and less robust billing. Diagnostic codes include:\n\n\u2022 F01.50, F01.51, F02.80, F02.81, F03.90, G30.0, G30.1, G30.8, G30.9, G31.01, G31.09, G31.1, G31.2, F41.81, G31.84 and F03.91.\n\nCare Partner Inclusion Criteria\n\nCare partners must meet all of the following criteria to participate in the study:\n\n* 18 years or older\n* English-speaking at both Indiana sites or English and/or Spanish speaking at the University of Texas site\n\nA note about inclusion of care partners: Clinician determination of a patient's capacity to participate in a visit independently is part of a pragmatic approach. This means that clinic staff will determine when a care partner is needed. Generally, we act under the assumption that patients who require a care partner will have already included them in previous visits and/or provider communications (and we anticipate that this will be documented in the EHR), whereas patients who attend clinic visits independently and have no documentation indicating the involvement of a care partner in their medical decisions, or a need for one, will be determined to have the capacity to also participate in a PPC visit.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:\n\n* Is not community-dwelling- e.g. lives in a nursing home\n* Is enrolled in hospice\n* Individuals who decline to receive the PPC intervention (i.e. decline to have the PPC conversation) will be excluded from the study.\n\n  * Note that declining to receive the PPC intervention will in no way impact the care that patients receive now or in the future.",
