            "briefSummary": "MI-CARE is an innovative coordinated care team intervention to improve medication adherence and blood pressure derived from research findings that build on existing clinical practice. Designed with an eye toward sustainability, MI-CARE incorporates billable pharmacist and CHW services for patients with low medication adherence and high burdens of chronic illness and preventable consequences. MI-CARE offers interprofessional team care with comprehensive expertise and complementary skill sets that mitigate the silo effect of specialized medicine to deliver primary care to diverse, high-risk populations experiencing disparities in hypertension.",
            "detailedDescription": "MI-CARE is a practice-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive, individually- and culturally-tailored intervention for high-risk patients with hypertension, polypharmacy, and low adherence. MI-CARE leverages the specialized expertise of a clinical pharmacist together with a community health worker (CHW) who will serve as a cultural broker and patient navigator to address individual, clinical, social-cultural, and structural barriers to adherence.\n\nThis comprehensive and tailored, coordinated care intervention aims to improve medication adherence and hypertension outcomes among African-American, Latino, and Vietnamese immigrant patients. The proposed practice-based RCT is designed to meet the following specific aims:\n\nAim 1: Implement MI-CARE, an innovative, tailored adherence intervention delivered by a pharmacist and CHW team.\n\nAim 2: Determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of MI-CARE by assessing pre- to post-intervention changes in a) medication adherence (proximal outcome) and blood pressure (BP, distal outcome), and b) other comorbid health outcomes (e.g., HbA1c, BMI) using a randomized controlled trial.\n\nAim 3: Identify factors associated with MI-CARE effectiveness including a) tailored intervention features, b)medication beliefs, c) barriers to adherence, d) intervention dose, e) health literacy and f) cultural group.\n\nThe investigators will follow an intention-to-treat randomized design using a waitlist control with 230 African-American, and Latino patients with hypertension and low (\\<85%) medication adherence. Data collection via pill count, self-report, electronic health record, and clinical measures will assess medication adherence, BP, and other factors at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 6 months post-intervention."
