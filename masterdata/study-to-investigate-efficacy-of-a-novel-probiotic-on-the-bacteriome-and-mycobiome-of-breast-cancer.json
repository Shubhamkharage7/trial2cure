            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of probiotics on the breast tumor microbiome and gut microbiome in breast cancer. Microorganisms that make up the microbiome (such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi) may have an important role in breast cancer development. Understanding the association of microorganisms with breast cancer may enable new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat breast cancer.\n\nThe probiotic, BIOHM, which is owned and distributed by BIOHM Health LLC, will be used in this study. BIOHM is a food supplement that is believed to balance bacteria and fungi in the body and has received the designation as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study is being done to determine the effectiveness of BIOHM in breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will investigate the efficacy of the investigational product (a novel probiotic) on altering the microbiome (bacteriomeand mycobiome) and polymicrobial biofilms in the gut of 50 women with breast cancer given the novel probiotic, compared to 50 women with breast cancer given a placebo.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to:\n\n1. Determine the efficacy profile of the novel probiotic\n2. Analyze bacteriome and mycobiome profiles as well as polymicrobial biofilm composition from breast tissue and stool before and after consumption of the probiotic.\n3. Compare quality of life (QoL) of those receiving novel probiotic compared to placebo."
