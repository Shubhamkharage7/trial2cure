There has been no prospective dose escalation study performed to date to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients treated with FSRT. Prescription doses in the series described above ranged from 18 Gy to 42 Gy, delivered in 3 to 12 fractions. The results of this study will be used to plan future Phase II/III studies to determine the efficacy of different dose fractionation schedules of FSRT. We thus propose a phase I study to determine the feasibility and safety of FSRT in patients with brain metastases."
