            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase II, randomized, controlled study to determine the efficacy, safety, and other indicators of clinical and biological activity of the combination of danvatirsen and pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for R/M HNSCC.\n\nAfter providing informed consent, patients will be assessed for eligibility during the screening phase of the study. All patients must be willing and able to provide a formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival or fresh tumor sample collected during the screening period; a fresh biopsy is preferred if safe and feasible to obtain and consented to by the patient. Following the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to danvatirsen + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy, respectively. Patients will receive treatment in 21-day cycles. Patients assigned to the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm will receive treatment until a criterion for discontinuation is met or a maximum of 24 months of treatment. Patients assigned to combination therapy will receive both treatments until a criterion for discontinuation is met or the patient has received a maximum of 24 months of treatment, after which they may remain on danvatirsen monotherapy.\n\nPatients in both treatment arms will have radiologic tumor assessments every 6 weeks (\u00b11 week), regardless of treatment delays, until objective disease progression, initiation of new anticancer treatment, death, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first.\n\nAll patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason will have a safety follow-up visit 30 days (+7 days) after the last dose of study treatment and a follow-up for AEs 90 days (+7 days) after the last dose of pembrolizumab. Patients will be followed for survival at 12 week (\u00b17 days) intervals until death or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. Survival follow-up will continue until at least 15 months after the last patient is randomized in the study."
