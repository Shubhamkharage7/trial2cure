            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if ultrasound-guided bilateral pectointercostal fascial plane blocks with bilateral rectus sheath blocks block decrease pain scores, decrease opioid consumption, improve respiratory function, and improve quality of recovery in patients recovering from elective cardiac surgery involving primary median sternotomy and mediastinal chest tubes in comparison to pectointercostal fascial plane blocks alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study. We anticipate recruitment of 50-60 subjects, with 25-30 in each group.\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n\nPain scores on a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and with deep breathing at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours post-extubation between subjects receiving PIFB + RSB versus subjects receiving only PIFB.\n\nTotal cumulative opioid consumption at 24 and 48 hours post-operatively.\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n\n* Intraoperative total opioid consumption\n* Change from baseline on incentive spirometry at 1, 3, 12, and 24 hours post-extubation\n* Time from ICU arrival to liberation from mechanical ventilation\n* QoR-15 (Quality of Recovery) score23 24 hours after extubation\n* Hospital and ICU length of stay\n\nPreoperative Management :\n\nSubjects will be randomized on the morning of surgery to receive bilateral PIFB and bilateral RSB with local anesthetic versus bilateral PIFB with local anesthetic and bilateral RSB with saline (placebo).\n\nIntraoperative Management All subjects will receive the standard of care anesthetic regimen for their cardiac surgery.\n\nPostoperative Management Each PIFB will be performed with 15 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 5 mcg/ml of epinephrine, and bilateral RSB will be performed with an additional 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 5 mcg/ml of epinephrine (10mL on each side).\n\nPostoperative Evaluation:\n\nEvaluation of acute postoperative pain intensity using a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS) will be undertaken at the following time points, both at rest and with deep breathing:\n\n\u2022 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours post-extubation Incentive spirometry will be assessed at 1, 3, 12, and 24 hours post-extubation, with three measures taken at each time point in order to compare postoperative performance with baseline spirometry.\n\nReview of the medical chart will be made post-operatively to gather other data, including total intraoperative oral morphine equivalent consumption, cumulative opioid consumption at 24 and 48 hours, time from ICU arrival to tracheal extubation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and QoR-15 (Quality of Recovery) score administered 24 hours after extubation (with margin of error of 18-30 hours to avoid waking patients in the middle of the night) . Occurrences of any adverse events reported by the subject or medical team will also be collected."
