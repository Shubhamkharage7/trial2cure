The total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 56 weeks. Approximately 400 participants will be enrolled. Participants will receive tezepelumab via subcutaneous injection at the study site, over a 48-week treatment period. The study also includes a post-dosing follow-up period from Weeks 48 to 52."
