            "briefSummary": "A subset of autoimmune diseases (ADs) in children and young adults are life-threatening and unresponsive to conventional treatments. In these patients, the delivery of high dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) offers a treatment strategy capable of purging the pathogenic, autoreactive immune system and an opportunity for \"immune reset.\" This strategy has been used in adults across a myriad of indications with evidence for efficacy. This study proposes a pilot study to assess this therapeutic strategy in children and young adults with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), two potentially life threatening autoimmune diseases that may response to this therapeutic approach."
