The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is Go Move accepted by youth with unilateral cerebral palsy and their caregivers?\n* Does Go Move support goal attainment for youth with unilateral cerebral palsy?\n\nParticipants will set up and participate in a goal-driven home program using the Go Move mobile website. Participants will spend 1 hour and 15 minutes per week for 6 weeks working on their home program and will complete pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments."
