This study will also evaluate whether abdominal FES can improve: 1) bowel-related quality of life, 2) participant-reported bowel function, 3) bowel management strategy, 4) bladder symptoms, and 5) unplanned hospital admissions. In addition, we will also explore participant perspectives and experiences about the stimulation sessions and use of the device."
