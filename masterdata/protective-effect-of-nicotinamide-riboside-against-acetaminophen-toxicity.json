            "briefSummary": "Over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol\u00ae) can be detrimental. In space, astronauts who have pain and constant discomfort use acetaminophen extensively. Investigators are studying the effects of acetaminophen under space-like conditions since acetaminophen might affect astronauts' health. Investigators also wish to see whether a dietary supplement can reduce some negative effects of acetaminophen.\n\nIt is believed that acetaminophen promotes the productions of chemicals in the body that could be toxic.\n\nIn this study, measurements of these chemicals in urine after ingestion of 1 tablet of acetaminophen and compare these measurements to when acetaminophen is taken at the same time as a dietary supplement. This study will also explore whether these products are more abundant when blood is placed under conditions that mimic space. Therefore, this study will collect blood from a few volunteers who took acetaminophen, and acetaminophen with the dietary supplement.",
            "detailedDescription": "In space, astronauts are constantly exposed to conditions the body is not used to. To relieve pain and discomfort, astronauts often use acetaminophen. This study investigates a possible negative synergistic effect between using acetaminophen and space-like stressors as they both generate oxidative stress and produce toxins that distribute around the body and disrupt cellular function in other tissues. The study seeks to examine whether a dietary supplement, nicotinamide riboside (NR), can reduce some adverse effects of these toxins by reducing their production when taking acetaminophen.\n\nThe study will measure these materials in urine after ingestion of 1 gram of acetaminophen and compare these measurements to when the same amount of acetaminophen is taken at the same time as NR. It will also evaluate whether these toxins are more abundant when blood is placed under conditions resembling space. Therefore, blood collection from a few volunteers who take acetaminophen, and acetaminophen with NR. Ultimately, this work will establish whether NR could reduce the generation of specific endotoxins.\n\nFor this study, male and female volunteers are needed to donate urine for testing the effect of 1000mg dose of Tylenol\u00ae and one 1000mg dose of Tylenol\u00ae with one 250mg dose of Nicotinamide Riboside on the abundance of uremic toxins in urine and in blood. Volunteers are also needed to donate blood."

Two weeks after this first collection, participants are asked to repeat the process but this time with only acetaminophen ingestion.\n\nTubes will be provided for the collection of the urine and zip lock bags will be provided to place the tubes in after samples have been collected. All samples should be stored in the freezer until completion of the samples at which time they should be brought to the USA Mitchell Cancer Institute. Some volunteers will participate in 4 total blood draws collected on the first day at the time of the consent then again 6 hours after taking NR and Acetaminophen.
