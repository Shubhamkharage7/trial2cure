For Arm 2, 10 subjects with Connective Tissue Disease Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH-CTD) will be consented and enrolled.\n\nStudy Design This study will be observational. Subjects in both arms of the trial will undergo a 129Xe MRI/MRS at timepoints of baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. In addition to the this, data from standard of care assessments, such as labs, echocardiography, and six-minute walk distance (6MWD), will also collected at these timepoints.\n\nPrimary Study Endpoints The primary endpoint for this trial will be the change in defect + low percentage of RBC signal on hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI from baseline to 12 months\n\nSecondary Study Endpoints\n\nThere will be several secondary endpoints for this trial:\n\n* Change in regional and global RBC Oscillation Amplitudes on hyperpolarized 129Xe MR spectroscopy from baseline to 12 months\n* Change in 6MWD from baseline to 12 months\n* Change in NTproBNP from baseline to 12 months\n* Change in WHO FC from baseline to 12 months\n\nPrimary Safety Endpoints\n\nThere will be several primary safety endpoints for this trial:\n\n* Frequency of Adverse Events (AE) and/or Serious Adverse Events (SAE)\n* Withdrawals due to adverse event or death\n* Incidence of Adverse Events of Significant Interest (AESI):\n* Electrocardiogram and any findings\n* Physical examination and vital signs"
