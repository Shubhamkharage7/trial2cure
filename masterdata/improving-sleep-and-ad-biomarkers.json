            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to learn whether a dietary citicoline supplement will impact sleep and cognition. Cognitive disorders include such things as memory disorders and mild cognitive impairment. The investigators are studying persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For this population, the team will assess whether citicoline also impacts biomarkers, a marker of the patient's biological state, in their body.\n\nThe investigators are interested in learning more about a dietary supplement called citicoline and how it helps sleep, cognition, and markers of Alzheimer's. Previous studies have evaluated this dietary supplement and shown that citicoline may impact cognitive decline. The investigator would like to evaluate if citicoline will also impact sleep and markers of Alzheimer's. This dietary supplement has been assessed in older adults and found to be well tolerated. Citicoline has been used safely in cognitive impairment populations at the same dosage.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial. To assess the hypothesis in this proposed study, the investigator will leverage infrastructure from the Emory Alzheimer's disease research center (ADRC), ADRC-affiliated centers, mild cognitive impairment, related research cohorts with potential eligible participants interested in participating in future studies, the Emory Sleep Center, and also recruit from the community. The research team will be actively recruiting individuals with MCI with confirmed medical diagnoses. The investigator will also collect data from personal interviews on prior medical diagnoses from the medical record along with current medication usage. Researchers will also obtain available baseline AD biomarker data from participants at baseline if they have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or blood data available on AD biomarkers within the past year from prior research studies, the investigators will use this data for the study records which will serve as their 'baseline' AD biomarker level). AD biomarkers of interest include Amyloid-Beta 1-42 (A\u03b242), t-tau, and P-tau181. Should participants not have this data available at baseline, the research team will conduct a blood draw for AD biomarker levels at baseline and at follow-up."
