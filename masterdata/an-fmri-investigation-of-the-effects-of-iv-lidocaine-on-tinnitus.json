            "briefSummary": "This is an exploratory pilot open-label study to identify the signal changes on fMRI of patients with tinnitus and with temporary suppression of the tinnitus with IV lidocaine. Patients will include those with hearing loss (both unilateral and bilateral) and tinnitus, subjects with normal hearing and tinnitus, and control subjects with normal hearing and no tinnitus. Eligible subjects will have functional and subjective data collected at baseline, receive an IV lidocaine infusion, and have functional and subjective data collected post-infusion for comparison and identification of involved neural networks.",
            "detailedDescription": "A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Ten study volunteers will be enrolled in each of the following four groups:\n\n1. - Normal hearing (NH) without tinnitus (T-)\n2. - Normal hearing (NH) with tinnitus (T+)\n3. - Unilateral hearing loss (uHL) and ipsilateral unilateral tinnitus (uT+)\n4. - Bilateral hearing loss (bHL) and bilateral tinnitus (bT+)\n\nApplication of the study treatment may occur at the initial Screening Visit (pending all eligibility requirements can be confirmed) or at Visit 1. The first visit (not including IV lidocaine infusion) should take no more than 3 hours. The investigators will assess patient eligibility and obtain a baseline MRI, audiometry with high frequency, and middle ear muscle reflexes. Three questionnaires (THI, TFI, VAS) will also be given prior to IV lidocaine infusion to assess patients' perception of their tinnitus.\n\nThe patient visit and baseline screening may take up to 8 hours total. Patients may have completed the screening/baseline visit on a prior day, in which case the visit should take no more than 5 hours. At the screening/baseline visit, patient will be asked to complete three questionnaires; have an audiogram with high frequency and middle ear reflexes; a pregnancy test if the patient is a woman of childbearing age, and a baseline MRI to assess brain activity. We will also obtain a baseline EKG to evaluate the patient's heart and blood draw to check liver and kidney function. At the infusion visit, patients will receive IV lidocaine infusion for 30 minutes (500mg maximal dose) and an fMRI of the brain. After the infusion, the investigators will draw some blood samples to test for serum lidocaine levels, perform another audiogram with high frequency and middle ear reflexes, and administer the same three questionnaires (THI, TFI, VAS). The investigators will follow-up with patients via email 30 (\u00b17) days after the infusion visit for any adverse event and ask them to complete the three questionnaires (THI, TFI, VAS)."
