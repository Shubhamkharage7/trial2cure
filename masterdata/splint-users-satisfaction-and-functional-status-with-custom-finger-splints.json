Fifty participants with a hyperextended finger condition are assigned by researcher to either an interventional group (customizable 3D-printed finger splint) or a control group (conventional thermoplastic finger splint). Participants will wear assigned splint for 1 month. Functional status and satisfaction with splint will be assessed at the end of the 1-month duration in the form of surveys on satisfaction and functional status participants will be asked to complete. The findings will contribute to evidence that customizable 3D-printed finger splints can serve as a feasible, cost-effective option to improve patient satisfaction and functional status. It will further justify the need for the application of 3D-printing in a clinical setting."
