Subjects with a Wagner Grade 1 or 2 Diabetic Foot Ulcers will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to one of the two treatment groups at the time of completion of screening to either Symphony\u2122 treatment or Standard of Care (SOC) treatment groups.\n\nFollowing initial enrolment, eligible subjects will then undergo:\n\n* A screening phase consisting of 14 days to determine eligibility.\n* Eligible subjects will then undergo a treatment phase involving weekly treatment and evaluations for up to 12 weeks.\n* Subjects that heal will undergo a follow-up phase that includes 1 visit (Healing Confirmation Visit), 2 weeks from initial healing.\n* If the subject does not heal, they will exit at Week 13, End of Study visit.\n\nBoth treatment groups will receive accepted routine procedures being part of SOC, including offloading of the DFU (removable cast boot or total contact casting \\[TCC\\] if the subject's foot is too large for a removable cast boot), appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, and infection management.\n\nIn addition to what is noted above, Group 1 will receive a weekly application of Symphony\u2122 and Group 2 will receive SOC comprising of calcium alginate Fibracol dressing. Both Groups will have a silicone non-adherent dressing (MepitelTM or equivalent), a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll, compressive wrap and Coban (Threeflex 3layer or equivalent) applied."

Within 3 months of SV1, adequate circulation to the affected foot as documented by a dorsal transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TCOM) or a skin perfusion pressure (SPP) measurement of \u2265 30 mmHg, or an Ankle Branchial Index (ABI) between 0.7 and 1.3 using the affected study extremity. As an alternative, arterial Doppler ultrasound can be performed evaluating for biphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the level of the ankle or a TBI (Toe Brachial Index) of \\> 0.6 is acceptable.\n* 7. The target ulcer has been offloaded for at least 14 days, prior to TV1.\n* 8. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception (birth control pills, barriers or abstinence) during the course of the study and undergo pregnancy tests.\n* 9. Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply with weekly visits.\n* 10. Subjects must have read and signed the IRB approved ICF before screening procedures are performed.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1. Index ulcer(s) deemed by the investigator to be caused by a medical condition other than diabetes\n* 2. Index ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer and should undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out a carcinoma of the ulcer\n* 3. Index ulcer is overtly infected (i.e., purulent drainage)\n* 4. Subjects with a history of more than two weeks of treatment with immune-suppressants (including systemic corticosteroids \\>10mg daily dose), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or application of topical steroids to the ulcer surface within 1-month prior to first SV1, or who receive such medications during the screening period or who are anticipated to require such medications during the course of the study\n* 5. Subjects on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days preceding SV1\n* 6. History of radiation at the ulcer site (regardless of time since last radiation treatment)\n* 7. Index ulcer has been previously treated or will need to be treated with any prohibited therapies\n* 8. Subjects with a previous diagnosis of HIV or Hepatitis C\n* 9. Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to complete this study or has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment\n* 10. Osteomyelitis or bone infection of the affected foot as verified by xray within 30 days prior to the first screening visit. (In the event of an ambiguous diagnosis, the Principal Investigator will make the final decision)\n* 11. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding\n* 12. Presence of diabetes with poor metabolic control as documented with an HbA1c \\>12.0 within last 90 days\n* 13. Subjects with end stage renal disease as evidenced by a serum creatinine \u22653.0 mg/dL within 6 months of enrollment\n* 14. Presence of acute Charcot Neuroarthropathy to the affected limb\n* 15. Index ulcer that has reduced in area by 30% or more after 14 days of SOC from SV1 to the TV1/Randomization visit",
