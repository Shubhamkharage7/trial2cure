            "briefSummary": "In this experiment, the investigators study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects. Specifically, the investigators examine the separate and joint effects of two of the most powerful context interventions: Social modeling-observing someone else being effectively treated-and prior treatment success or failure experiences. Participants will be randomized into 4 groups (Social modeling: observed success vs. observed failure and Conditioning: experienced success vs. experienced failure). The objectives are to investigate the placebo effect on pain relief and aversive image stimuli between and within-subjects. Each group will undergo a behavioral induction phase, fMRI placebo test phase, and an identical 3-month follow up fMRI placebo test phase. Follow-up assessment will provide some of the first evidence on predictors of the durability of placebo and context interventions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nHumans are highly social creatures, and others' behavior and experiences can have profound effects on symptoms, physiology, and behavior. Social modeling-watching a similar other experience treatment benefits-may also strongly enhance placebo effects and their durability over time, particularly when combined with other context interventions. Social influences can affect core motivational circuitry (e.g., nAC and amygdala), shape learning trajectories, and appears to have distinct mechanisms from other (e.g., conditioning) manipulations. Their impact on brain mechanisms of placebo has not been studied. Likewise, initial perceived treatment success or failure can powerfully shape learning trajectories and placebo analgesia. Initial failure experiences with a treatment type (e.g., pill) may explain some of the treatment failures in studies that (a) attempt to wash out placebo responses with ineffective pills before starting verum drug, or (b) re-randomize non-responders to different pills, as in the STAR\\*D antidepressant study. But the effects of initial success/failure experiences on the brain mechanisms of placebo effects have not been studied.\n\nDesign:\n\nIn an initial observation phase, participants will watch a video of another participant (\"demonstrator\") undergoing the baseline assessment and placebo test procedure. Next, participants will undergo a conditioning phase. The intervention is a 2 x 2 factorial between-groups manipulation (N = 30 per group) of social modeling (Observed treatment success vs. failure) and participants' initial success experience (Experienced success vs. failure). Thus, the demonstrator will either show strong signs of pain relief during placebo (Observed-Success condition) or no signs of relief (Observed-Failed treatment). During the conditioning phase, all participants will experience high-intensity heat before placebo treatment and then either low-intensity heat after application of a placebo cream, as in the investigator's and others' past work, creating experience of pain relief (Experienced-Success condition) or they will not experience relief (i.e., temperatures will not be lowered; Experienced-Failed treatment). In a subsequent fMRI test phase, participants experience painful heat and aversive IAPS images (as a transfer/specificity test) during fMRI, on skin sites treated with Control and Placebo creams, in a Control -\\> Placebo -\\> Control block design as in past research. Finally, a 3-month follow-up fMRI test phase, without additional observation or conditioning, will assess durability of brain and behavioral placebo effects."

            "description": "The investigators are strongly committed to contributing to open and reproducible science. All MRI and behavioral data will be submitted to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) according to the terms and conditions outlined on their website (https://ndar.nih.gov/contribute_data_sharing_regimen.html ) and with OpenFMRI.\n\nThe investigators will ensure that our IRB has approved our Data Sharing Plan. The investigators will use an informed consent document that permits subjects to allow sharing of de-identified (face removed) MRI and fMRI data with open-sharing repositories, including the NDA and OpenFMRI databases. The consent form will stipulate that: \"Scientists can use my information, without personal identifiers, for any kind of genetic research.\"",
            "timeFrame": "All data will be de-identified prior to sharing. Raw data will be submitted to NDA within one year from the end of data collection or 6 months from the acceptance date of the first primary study manuscript on the full dataset (excluding methods development papers), whichever is later. Analyzed data/maps of statistical results and models accompanying each paper will be submitted to NDA/OpenFMRI when the primary study manuscript is accepted.",
            "accessCriteria": "These data would generally be made available to any qualified investigator for neuroimaging studies only including:\n\ni. Research on any brain phenomenon; ii. Neuroimaging research on non-disease traits (intelligence, behavioral traits); iii. Methods development research.\n\nThe requesting investigator must provide documentation of local IRB approval.\n\nThese data would not be made available to:\n\ni. Any criminal justice organization, because data may not be used for any criminal justice applications; ii. Any commercial entity, because use of the data is limited to not-for-profit organizations and data may not be used for any commercial purposes."
