            "detailedDescription": "The University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine (UTGSM) is investigating 99mTc-p5+14, an amyloid-reactive synthetic peptide, p5+14, radiolabeled with technetium-99m, as a radiotracer for planar gamma scintigraphy (PGS), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or SPECT with x-ray computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis, notably with cardiac involvement. Based on nonclinical data and clinical data of 124I-p5+14 from Study AMY1001, peptide p5+14 binds many types of human amyloid and is rapidly cleared from the central compartment. When radiolabeled with 99mTc, p5+14 may enable visualization of amyloid laden tissues and organs by SPECT/CT imaging or PGS. Thus, this study has been designed to evaluate the dosimetry and biodistribution of 99mTc-p5+14 in patients with systemic amyloidosis compared with the biodistribution in healthy volunteers."
