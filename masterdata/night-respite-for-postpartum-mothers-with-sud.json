            "detailedDescription": "This single arm pilot feasibility study will evaluate the implementation of overnight infant respite care provided approximately 3 nights per week for 6 weeks (18 nights total) to each of 20 - 25 mothers with substance use disorders in the early postpartum period residing in residential substance use disorder treatment programs. Overnight respite care will last for eight hours, with one hour reserved each morning to provide teaching about infant-specific temperament and cues. The program is a unique public/private/academic partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF), Boston Baby Nurse and Nanny (BBNN), two residential treatment programs, and Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nPartnering with BBNN, Newborn Care Experts interested in providing respite care to families impacted by SUD will be paired with postpartum families residing in two residential treatment programs in the Boston area. New Day in Somerville, MA and Entre Familia in Mattapan, MA will partner with MGH to recruit individuals to complete a screening and baseline intake, receive night respite care, and complete a follow up study visit at the completion of the intervention and at 3 months post intervention.\n\nThis study will use mixed methods to understand the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention including experiences of this pilot program through the perspectives of program participants, respite care givers, residential treatment overnight staff, and study staff. Respite caregivers and residential treatment program staff will be invited to participate in interviews after each dyad receives their allotted hours of respite care to reflect on this program participant's specific experience.\n\nBBNN, DCF, and residential treatment program leadership staff, will be invited to participate a focus group once at the completion of the study to understand the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation of this program through the lens of their organizations. They will also be invited to take a short survey aimed at assessing their perception of the intervention's appropriateness and feasibility."
