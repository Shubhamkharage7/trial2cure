Female patients with reproductive potential must practice two effective contraceptive measures for the duration of study drug therapy and for at least 90 days after completion of study therapy. The two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom, copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progesterone agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).\n10. Male patients who are sexually active with women with reproductive potential must agree to use contraception for the duration of treatment and for at least 90 days after completion of study therapy.\n\n    Cohort 1:\n\n    In addition to meeting the inclusion criteria for all patients, patients who are enrolled into Cohort 1 must fulfill the following cohort-specific inclusion criteria:\n11.

Prior radiation therapy (or other non-systemic therapy) within 2 weeks prior to enrollment\n2.

Red blood cell transfusion dependence, defined as requiring more than 2 units of packed RBC transfusions during the 4-week period prior to screening. Red blood cell transfusions are permitted during the screening period and prior to enrollment to meet the hemoglobin inclusion criterion.\n4. Prior anticancer therapy including, but not limited to, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to SG treatment\n5. Current participation in another interventional clinical study\n6. History of previous malignancy other than malignancy treated with curative intent.

Patients with known hepatitis B, hepatitis C (HCV), or HIV infection could go on study provided the viral load is undetectable at screening.\n8. Disease or medical conditions that would substantially increase the risk-benefit ratio of participating in the study that include: acute myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable angina, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, significant active infections, and congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III-IV\n9. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n10. Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, the metabolites, or formulation excipient\n11. Received a live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.\n12.
