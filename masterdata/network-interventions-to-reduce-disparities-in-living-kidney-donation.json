            "briefSummary": "For this current phase of the larger project, the investigators will survey transplant candidates as well as the participants family and friends to understand the barriers to volunteering and evaluation. This project will examine how network characteristics are associated with eventual living donor kidney transplant outcomes and test the efficacy of evidence-based interventions designed to assist kidney transplant candidates in participant donor search on a multi-center scale.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal is to understand the process and assist participants who do not receive unsolicited offers to be evaluated as a living kidney donor in initiating and effectively conducting these critical conversations with participants kin and friends. In the search intervention, based on what they can tell investigators about the number, type, perceived health, perceived relationship, and potential willingness to donate, as well as analyses of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) investigators will counsel them on which members of participants family and friendship networks appear most biomedically promising as donors among the subset of these individuals that participants have not ruled out for known medical or perceived relationship reasons. In the rhetorical intervention, investigators will test non-coercive, promising verbal scripts that have proven promising in preliminary tests in vignette experiments in online and phone surveys.\n\nAIM 1: Survey transplant candidates about their social network and transplant-related attitudes, knowledge, and characteristics; and randomize participants into one of two interventions or a control group.\n\nAIM 2: Send network member participants a survey that measures potential donor attributes that are hypothesized to influence donation decisions, such as medical contraindications, blood type, health insurance status, and barriers to living donation.\n\nAIM 3: Test whether participant social networks and interventions affect donation outcomes using medical records and follow-ups provided by Penn and UAB. Investigators will create the first predictive model of potential donor evaluation and actual donation. This information is critical to improve clinical practice and efforts to ethically influence the living donor search process."

The second intervention is the script intervention, where in addition to the survey, transplant candidates will review a set of suggested talking points and an example script to guide discussion of potential living donation with members of their network. 25% of participants will be assigned to each of the following factorial experimental groups: no intervention, search intervention only, script intervention only, or both search and script intervention.",
