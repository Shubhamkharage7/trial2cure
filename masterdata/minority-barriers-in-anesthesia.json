            "briefSummary": "The investigators aim to survey members of the ASA (medical students, residents, and attendings) who self-identify as minorities to assess if there are systemic barriers to minorities pursuing leadership positions. The investigators hypothesize that structural issues such as a lack of formalized mentoring programs play a role in reduced minority professional advancement.",
            "detailedDescription": "Within the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) underrepresented minorities comprise only 6.0% of leadership. Within the ASA, women additionally only hold 21% of House of Delegates and state society officer positions, while comprising 38% of the national anesthesiology workforce.\n\nThe investigators will be using a survey via SurveyMonkey with potential for an opt-in phone or Zoom interview via the interviewee using the contact information at the bottom of the SurveyMonkey. The questions for the Survey Monkey are below. The investigators will use the Tufts HIPAA-compliant Zoom account for any Zoom interviews.\n\nIn order to deidentify the phone and Zoom interviews, investigators will not label any transcripts of the interviews with names or identifying information. The investigators will also destroy all correspondence after a time and date for the phone/Zoom interview is set.\n\nParticipants will be self-selecting for this survey. The investigators aim to email the coordinators of the ASA (medical student component, resident component, general body) who will then forward investigators' contact letter and survey to participants' constituents. Given the self-selecting nature of the survey, the investigators are not specifically targeting individuals who identify as minorities--as there are variable definitions to this term--but rather investigators will use the survey to evaluate for trends within the responses. The investigators hypothesize that gender/race/sexual orientation may play a role in career choices for individuals, which will be elucidated through the survey responses. The investigators will sort the surveys into groups to where minority identification played a large role in career versus where it did not and then calculate the trend as a percentage of the total survey responses.\n\nThe investigators recognize that it may be more possible to provide in-depth responses to the survey via a phone or Zoom interview. Therefore, investigators have included a contact information in the contact letter and the Survey Monkey and will give participants the option of doing a phone/Zoom interview instead of the Survey Monkey.\n\nSurvey Questions:\n\nWhy did you decide to pursue medicine as a career? Why anesthesia? Did gender play a role in your decision to pursue medicine? In your decision to do anesthesia? Did race play a role in your decision to pursue medicine? In your decision to do anesthesia? Do you have any regrets about your career choice? Where do you currently practice? What led you to choose that practice setting? What mentorship resources were available to you along your career path? What is a professional success you had? What is a perceived failure you may have had? How did that effect your career? What if your five-year plan? Ten-year plan? Twenty? What is a minority?"
