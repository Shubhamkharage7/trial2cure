            "briefSummary": "Severe depression is devastating for those affected and is often associated with significant risk of suicide. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective acute treatment for severe depression, but its use and acceptability are limited by cognitive side effects. Of these, retrograde memory loss is most concerning, and can be long-term. The introduction of ultrabrief right unilateral (UBRUL) ECT into clinical practice has been an important step in reducing the risk of memory impairment, but significant deficits still occur.\n\nA new form of UBRUL ECT which utilises a Frontoparietal electrode placement represents a further development. Preliminary data suggest that Frontoparietal UBRUL has good efficacy and less cognitive side effects than UBRUL given using the conventional Temporoparietal electrode placement. Designed as a pivotal trial, this protocol will be the first RCT comparing these two forms of ECT, producing the rigorous efficacy and safety data required to change clinical practice/policy.\n\nThis is a multicentre, parallel group RCT with 1:1 allocation ratio between Frontoparietal (intervention) and Temporoparietal (comparator) forms of UBRUL ECT. Participation will involve receiving randomised acute ECT under blinded conditions during the randomised acute treatment period (typically around 4 weeks), then completion of a 24-week follow-up period which commences after the cessation of all acute ECT. The study protocol aims to provide 12 randomised acute ECT treatments, though the number of treatments (and hence the length of the randomised acute treatment period) can be adjusted by the participant's own treating/admitting psychiatrist according to their clinical judgement."
