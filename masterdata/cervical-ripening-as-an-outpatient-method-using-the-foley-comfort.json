The investigators will be comparing outpatient cervical ripening with a Foley catheter to routine inpatient cervical ripening (Foley +/- other method). With this trial, the investigators aim to test our central hypothesis that outpatient Foley will decrease the primary Cesarean Delivery (CD) rate and risk of maternal/neonatal morbidity compared with inpatient cervical ripening."
