            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies the use of \"smart\" body-weight scales to monitor weight and nutrition among patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Malnutrition affects 30-50% of patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer, and approximately 30% of patients have malnutrition prior to diagnosis. \"Smart\" body weight scales can possibly make self-weighing easier, faster, and more accurate through weight recordings through mobile applications available for \"smart\" scales. This has the potential to maximize nutritional guidance through quick weight updates, possibly delaying or removing the use of patient enteral feeding (tube feeding). By avoiding or minimizing the use of enteral feeding during radiation therapy, the risk of long-term tube dependence and swallowing ability complications may be reduced.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the feasibility of \"smart\" body scales in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Head and Neck Cancer (MDASI-HN) questionnaire, overall pain scores, and weight loss percentage.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patients weigh themselves daily using the \"Smart\" scale over 5-8 weeks during standard radiation therapy.\n\nCOHORT II: Patients do not weigh themselves using the \"Smart\" scale during standard radiation therapy.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up within 2 weeks and 3 months post-radiation therapy."
