            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of a new 8-chloroadenosine in combination with venetoclax in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). 8-Chloroadenosine may help block the formation of growths that may become cancer. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving 8-chloroadenosine in combination with venetoclax may help prevent the disease from coming back in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a regimen combining 8-chloro-adenosine (8-Cl-Ado) and venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including type, frequency, severity, attribution, and duration of the toxicity.\n\nII. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 8-Cl-Ado when given in combination with venetoclax.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Obtain preliminary estimates of the anti-leukemia activity of the 8-Cl-Ado/venetoclax regimen by assessing the overall response rate (Complete remission\\[CR\\]+ complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery \\[CRi\\]+ partial response \\[PR\\]) and complete remission rate (CR+CRi).\n\nII. Obtain preliminary estimates of duration of remission (DOR), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS).\n\nIII. Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of plasma 8-Cl-Ado and metabolites when 8-Cl-Ado is given in combination with venetoclax.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of VEN/8-Cl-Ado combination therapy to identify biomarkers of clinical response and resistance.\n\nII. Identify genes and pathways associated with response to VEN/8-Cl-Ado. III. Determine the metabolic consequences of VEN/8 Cl-Ado treatment on leukemia stem cells (LSCs).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive 8-Cl-Ado intravenously (IV) over 4 hours daily on days 1-5 and venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 28 days for up to 1 year."
