The outcome variables will be further analyzed to understand their relationship to quantitative measures of postural instability and gait dysfunction. As such, the project can be classified as basic physiologic research. The protocol is not designed to determine if measures of corticocortical or corticofugal excitability can be used as a biomarker to predict disease progression."
