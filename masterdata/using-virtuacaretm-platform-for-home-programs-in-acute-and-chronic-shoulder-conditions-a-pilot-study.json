            "briefSummary": "This study will be performed to determine if Band Connect's VirtuaCare\u2122 platform increases patient compliance and provides an effective alternative to current physical therapy treatment while reducing the frequency of visits compared with standard orthopedic physical therapy treatment performed in the outpatient clinic.\n\nParticipants are being asked to take part in this research study if 18 years and older and have been prescribed physical therapy rehabilitation for an acute or chronic shoulder condition and as part of the participant's physical therapy will receive a shoulder exercise home program.",
            "detailedDescription": "In today's environment, review of a patient's rehabilitation progress and recovery is limited to in-person, one-on-one clinic visits with their therapist periodically. While these sessions are typically well-defined and comprehensive, there are no mechanisms currently available to help the clinicians and therapists to effectively engage with patients when they are not in the clinic.\n\nPatients are prescribed at-home exercises after each visit and the therapists have no line of sight as to how the patient is progressing or if the patient is even adhering to the treatment plan. The patient typically receives some rudimentary instruction about how an exercise or treatment needs to be performed, a setup that can result in unknown adherence and/or poor form. There are also no mechanisms for active feedback to the patient about any aspect of their treatment of recovery - e.g., whether the patient is doing better or worse. These gaps and inconsistencies result in a circumstance wherein less than 35% of patients typically adhere to their prescribed plans of care.\n\nPatient Adherence Today, it is estimated that while 64% of physical therapy patients comply with short-term exercise regimens, only 23% preserve adherence throughout their physical therapy treatment. While this number seems accurate, these percentages are still unknown because patients typically do not admit non-compliance and adherence is typically not measured objectively \\[6\\]. Results from a study examining at-home adherence for patients with chronic low back pain indicate that barriers include \"the exercise program (number, effectiveness, complexity and burden of exercises), the healthcare journey (breakdown between supervised sessions and home exercise, lack of follow-up and difficulties in contacting care providers), patient representations (illness and exercise perception, despondency, depression and lack of motivation), and the environment (attitudes of others, difficulties in planning exercise practice) \\[4\\].\" Conversely, the study found that opportunities to increase adherence include improving patient performance through feedback capabilities and increased support from care providers. The study concluded that new technologies have the potential to meet these barriers and are attractive to patients but only if the technology is not a substitute for in-person relationship between the patients and care providers \\[4\\]. Unlike technologies currently on the market that focus solely on virtual environments, the VirtuaCare\u2122 platform provides a tool for physical therapists to supplement their in-person treatment with a higher-caliber experience outside of the clinic environment.\n\nBand Connect will address some of these constraints by using digital health technology in conjunction with a personalized simulation of each exercise, allowing patients to adopt the correct form, review progress, and receive continuous real-time instruction through a visual mechanism. Additionally, the physical therapist can remotely review the patient's progress on the platform in an objective manner and adjust their treatment plan accordingly.\n\nThis study, specifically, will focus both on measuring the effectiveness of VirtuaCare\u2122 to drive towards higher adherence rates while providing the usual and customary orthopedic physical therapy with a platform that allows for lower frequency of in-clinic visits over the typical outpatient rehabilitation duration. This is an incredibly relevant and important consideration in the current healthcare environment.\n\nThis study will be performed to determine if Band Connect's VirtuaCare\u2122 platform increases patient adherence and provides equivalency to current physical therapy treatment while reducing frequency of visits compared with standard orthopedic physical therapy treatment performed in the outpatient clinic The study will measure and collate a variety of data points with patients using VirtuaCare\u2122 and compare these to a historical control group of patients with the same orthopedic conditions."
