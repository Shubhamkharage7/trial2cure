            "detailedDescription": "In accordance with the European Medical Device Regulation MDR 2017/745/EU, the legal manufacturers of medical devices are obliged to evaluate medical devices with regard to their clinical performance and safety.\n\nThe VERTICALE\u00ae Cervical System is intended for immobilization and stabilization of spinal segments of the craniocervical junction (occipital-C2), subaxial cervical spine (C3-C7) and upper thoracic spine (T1-T3).\n\nThe investigators interest is the continuous improvement of the surgical procedure in the context of degenerative cervical spine diseases. Patient satisfaction, as well as the avoidance of possible complications, are the main focus here. In addition, CE-certified medical devices must be evaluated for long-term performance and safety in clinical practice in accordance with the Medical Devices Act. The VERTICALE\u00ae Cervical System is a rod-screw system for immobilization (= immobilization) and stabilization of the affected segments, in the area between the occiput, the cervical spine and the upper thoracic spine (up to the 3rd thoracic vertebral body). Surgical intervention with the VERTICALE\u00ae Cervical System is performed from behind (posteriorly) and usually serves to stiffen the affected areas.\n\nThe goals of surgical intervention depend on the exact clinical picture and the associated symptoms, but usually consist of surgical relief of the affected structures of the nervous apparatus and/or spinal cord, stabilization of the bony structures to restore and/or maintain function, and relief of pain."
