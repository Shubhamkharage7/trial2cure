The neo-bladder is like a reservoir or pouch that will be surgically attached to the bladder to assist with urine collection.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, open-label, single-group clinical study. All subjects will have non-neurogenic, fibrotic contracted bladder that is refractory to medical treatment and require augmentation cystoplasty for preventing long-term sequelae (i.e., kidney failure) that result from persistently high intravesical pressure. Subjects will undergo an open full thickness bladder biopsy from which autologous urinary bladder smooth muscle and urothelial cells will be procured and expanded ex vivo. After approximately 5 - 7 weeks, expanded cells will be seeded on a biodegradable scaffold to produce the neo-bladder construct that will be surgically implanted onto an opened native bladder during an augmentation cystoplasty. Subjects will be followed for 36 months."
