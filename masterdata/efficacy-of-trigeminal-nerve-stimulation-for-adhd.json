            "briefSummary": "This study is a large multisite randomized clinical trial to asses the efficacy of external trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS), a novel, minimal risk, non-invasive neuromodulation treatment, for ADHD in children ages 7-12 years old (N=180).\n\nStudy hypotheses address potential differences in ADHD symptoms over 4 weeks treatment with active vs. sham TNS in an expanded multi-site investigation; whether resting state fronto-parietal connectivity mediates TNS impact on ADHD symptoms; if changes in fronto-parietal activation, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), predict TNS-related treatment outcomes; and whether a baseline cognitive profile similarly predicts response to TNS therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS), an FDA-approved, non-invasive minimal risk intervention approved for treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), administers a low amount of electrical stimulus to the forehead during sleep and is shown to increase activity in brain regions associated with attention and impulse control.\n\nThe current study seeks to replicate previous efficacy and safety findings of TNS in a larger, multisite group of ADHD-diagnosed youth, ages 7-12. The study will be conducted at UCLA and Seattle Children's Hospital.\n\nThe study comprises 3 phases, with subsequent 12-month follow-up for participants who demonstrate positive response to active therapy. We will screen up to 280 participants to yield an overall study N=225 completers meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) ADHD criteria across the two sites.\n\nPhase 1 is a 4-week double-blind, controlled trial of active vs. sham TNS. Once inclusion/exclusion criteria are assessed, eligible participants have an initial baseline assessment comprised of behavioral ratings, cognitive assessments, and electroencephalography (EEG), and are subsequently randomized 2:1 to active vs. sham treatment. Participants will begin use of TNS as directed each night during sleep for 4 weeks. Participants, families, and most of the study team will remain blind to treatment assignment. Weekly behavioral rating will be obtained from parents, teacher, and clinical investigators. EEG, along with other cognitive measures, will be repeated at week 4.\n\nIn Phase 2, participants initially randomized to sham will receive active TNS for an additional 4 weeks, with continued weekly assessments. Phase 3 entails brief naturalistic follow-ups via phone or Zoom at months 3 and 6 post-treatment."
