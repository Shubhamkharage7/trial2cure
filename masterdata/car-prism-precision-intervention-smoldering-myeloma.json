            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase II study to test the safety and effectiveness of study therapy cilta-cel in treating participants with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). T cells are a part of a person's immune system which usually helps fight infection and prevents/fights cancer cells.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved cilta-cel as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma but not specifically for smoldering myeloma.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including evaluations, blood collections, radiologic scans of tumors, bone marrow biopsies, and follow-up visits.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last about 15 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational therapy to learn whether the therapy works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the therapy is being studied.\n\nJanssen Research \\& Development, LLC is supporting this research study by providing the study treatment and funding."
