            "detailedDescription": "A total of 20 adult participants will be treated with MRgFUS through this study. A matched comparison group of archived samples from patients with UPS who have not received focused ultrasound will be used as a control group to further evaluate the secondary endpoints (stratified and matched for age, sex, and history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy). All patients enrolled will receive timely standard of care surgical resection, as clinically indicated. For patients enrolled with metastatic disease pre- and post-MRgFUS biopsy samples will be obtained\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall rate and severity of adverse events following MRgFUS of newly diagnosed or metastatic undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To measure possible immune response effects related to MRgFUS by serial serological analysis with flow cytometry panels (T-cell, natural killer cell, myeloid panels).\n\nII. To measure possible immune response effects related to MRgFUS by multiplex immunohistochemistry assays of resected tumor specimens (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD68, FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1, CD45) as well as RNA sequencing.\n\nIII. To compare possible immune response effects in patients receiving MRgFUS prior to either surgical resection or follow-up biopsy of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma to either 1) a comparison group of archived samples from patients who have had resection of UPS but did not have pre-operative focused ultrasound (for patients with newly diagnosed local disease or 2) individual pre-MRgFUS biopsy analyses."

Our local institutional standard is to treat patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical resection when tumors are \\> 5 cm in maximal dimension and within deep muscular compartments. Our institutional standard is to treat patients with doxorubicin plus ifosfamide for younger patients (typically \\<50 years old) and gemcitabine plus taxotere for older patients (typically \\>= 50 years old).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

History of interstitial lung disease or other active malignancy (may confound immune response results).\n3. History of previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers) (may confound immune response results).\n4. All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue must have resolved to grade 1 (NCI CTCAE version 4) or baseline.\n5. Subjects must have recovered from the effects of major surgery or significant trauma at least 14 days before the study procedure.\n6. Subjects with an acute medical condition expected to hinder them from completing the study, unstable cardiovascular status, and severe cerebrovascular disease.\n7. Treatment with any investigational agent within 28 days of the treatment procedure.\n8. Any absolute contraindications for study magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per standard University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) departmental MRI safety guidance (https://radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/mri) and additionally:\n\n   * Metal in other parts of body that will cause safety issues\n   * Claustrophobia\n   * Weight \\> 400 pounds (lb) or 181.4 kilograms (kg).\n   * Pregnancy\n   * Known intolerance or allergy to magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent (gadolinium chelates)\n9. Unable to safely receive anesthesia/sedation for the treatment, or known intolerance or allergy to medications used for sedation/anesthesia.\n10. Unable to verbally communicate with the investigator and staff.\n11. For Group 1 Patients (newly diagnosed disease) only: Have received neoadjuvant radiotherapy or planning to receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy.",
