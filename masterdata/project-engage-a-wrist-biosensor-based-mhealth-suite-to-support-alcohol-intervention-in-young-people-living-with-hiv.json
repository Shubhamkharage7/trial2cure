A subset of the sample will also be micro-randomized twice daily to test two empirically-based engagement strategies - reciprocity and personalized feedback. Data from the 30-day MRT will be used to (a) develop and validate the algorithm for alcohol detection based on Skyn data; and (b) address scientific questions concerning which engagement strategy works best, for whom and under what conditions in terms of facilitating proximal engagement in biosensor wearing. We will also collect alcohol biomarker (i.e., PEth) at 1-month follow up."
