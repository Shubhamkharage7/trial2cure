            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well lutathera works in treating patients with meningioma that cannot be treated with surgery (inoperable) and is growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive) after external beam radiation therapy. Lutathera is a radioactive drug administered in the vein that is designed to target and kill tumor cells. The goal of this study is to determine whether this drug is safe and effective in treating meningiomas that progress after radiation treatment. WHO Grade I and Cohort WHO II/III cohorts will be evaluated.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (LUTATHERA) treatment in patients with recurrent grade 1 meningioma as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate.\n\nII. To estimate the efficacy of LUTATHERA treatment in patients with recurrent grade 2 or 3 meningioma as measured by 6-month PFS rate.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall survival (by grade cohort) of patients with recurrent meningioma during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.\n\nII. To determine the progression-free survival (by grade cohort) of patients with recurrent meningioma during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.\n\nIII. To determine the toxicity of LUTATHERA treatment in patients with recurrent meningioma.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the impact of treatment on the patient's quality of life (QOL) using the Promise-10, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and Mayo Patient Survey National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Brain Symptom Index Questionnaire-24 (FBrSI-24) (version 2) instruments.\n\nII. To compare the response assessment between standard of care brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\n\nIII. To determine the best objective response (Macdonald criteria) of patients with recurrent meningioma during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.\n\nIV. To determine the duration of local control with death as a competing risk (by grade cohort) of patients with recurrent meningioma during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.\n\nV. To perform a quantitative dosimetric analysis of radiation dose delivered with lutathera:\n\nVa. To determine intratherapeutic dosimetry for the target meningioma; Vb. To correlate treatment response of lutathera with target dose received; Vc. To determine intratherapeutic dosimetry for kidneys and other abdominal organs.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/MRI or PET/computed tomography (CT) before cycles 1 and 4. Patients then receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate IV over 30-40 minutes. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo MRI on study and during follow-up, as well as blood sample collection and possible single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT dosimetry on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 5 years."
