            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for a range of autoimmune diseases may be useful to provide symptomatic relief, prostate shrinkage, and/or decrease prostatic inflammation in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), sometimes described as prostatic enlargement.\n\nBPH includes a significant amount of inflammation. Prior studies show that there are common links between autoimmune diseases, inflammation, and BPH. TNF-antagonists such as adalimumab are anti-inflammatory drugs commonly prescribed to treat autoimmune diseases. NorthShore researchers, including Drs. Glaser, Hayward, and Helfand, showed that these drugs reduced the incidence of BPH in patients with autoimmune diseases.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will study the TNF-antagonist adalimumab in patients with BPH who do not have autoimmune diseases. Adalimumab used in this study is investigational because it is not approved by the FDA for BPH. However, adalimumab is an approved, widely-prescribed, and commonly used drug utilized in a variety of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and uveitis. It has a well-studied side effect profile and was approved for use by the FDA in 2008. The purpose of this study is to determine whether adalimumab is an effective way to reduce symptoms and/or prostatic inflammation in BPH patients without autoimmune diseases. If this research is successful it may open up a new method of therapy for patients with BPH and associated symptoms.\n\nThis study will include a total of 70 subjects. Of those subjects, all 70 will be from NorthShore University HealthSystem (\"NorthShore\")."
