            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects about 29.5 million people in the United States. Only 3 medicines have been approved by Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD. Researchers want to find better treatments for AUD. Animal studies found that a medicine called spironolactone, may decrease the amount of alcohol the animals drank. Spironolactone is approved to treat high blood pressure, or heart failure in people. It is not approved to treat AUD.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a medicine (spironolactone) in people who sometimes drink excessive alcohol in order to understand how the body breaks down spironolactone and if there are any side effects in people who drink alcohol while taking this medicine.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 21 and older with AUD.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 4 separate 7-day stays at a clinic in Baltimore over 2 months. Spironolactone is a capsule you swallow. Participants will take a capsule twice a day for 5 days during each clinic stay. During 1 of their 4 stays, they will take a placebo instead of the medicine. The placebo capsule looks just like the spironolactone capsule but contains no medicine. Participants will not know when they are taking the medicine or the placebo.\n\nParticipants will not drink alcohol until day 6 of each clinic stay. Then they will be asked to drink alcohol in a bar-like area in the clinic. Their breath and blood alcohol levels and their well-being will be measured.\n\nParticipants will undergo other tests in the clinic:\n\nA DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan uses X-rays to measure bone density and muscle mass. Participants will lie on an open-top, padded table, then a small arm will scan the full length of their body. The radiation participants will get in this study is about the same as from one regular x-ray.\n\nBlood tests. Participants may feel some discomfort at the site of needle entry.\n\nElectrocardiogram. This test records the heart activity. Sensors are attached to the skin with stickers and removed after a few minutes.\n\nUrine tests. All urine will be collected over a 3-day period during each stay. We will measure the amount of urine, and different hormones and salts in the urine.\n\nQuestionnaires and tasks. Participants will answer questions about their alcohol use. They will perform tasks to test mood, craving, mental and physical coordination, and how much they feel an effect from alcohol after drinking.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will examine pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of spironolactone and alcohol, during concomitant oral administration (0, 100, 200, 400 mg/day spironolactone PO), and test the safety and tolerability of spironolactone, co-administered with alcohol, in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD).\n\nObjectives:\n\nOur objective is to assess PK and PD parameters during spironolactone-alcohol co-administration, in individuals with AUD. We will also test the safety, tolerability, and potential drug-alcohol interaction.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\nSpironolactone and alcohol PK during concomitant administration (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/day spironolactone).\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n1. Assessment of subjective and cognitive effects of acute alcohol administration during concomitant spironolactone treatment (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/day).\n2. Number and severity of adverse events (AEs) experienced, compared between placebo (0 mg/day) and all three spironolactone doses (100, 200, 400 mg/day).\n3. PK characteristic of spironolactone active metabolites, canrenone, 7-alpha-thiomethylspirolactone (TMS) and 6beta- hydroxy-7alpha-thiomethylspirolactone (HTMS), before and after administration of alcohol."
