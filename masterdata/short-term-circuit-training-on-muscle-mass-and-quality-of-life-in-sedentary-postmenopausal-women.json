            "detailedDescription": "A randomized controlled trial design will investigate the effects of circuit training on the following dependent variables: muscle mass, strength, inflammatory markers, balance, functional capacity, and quality of life.\n\nBody composition measurements will utilize IN-BODY technology. The Motor Control Screen Lower Body (MCS) will determine balance. For assessing strength, we will use the Dynamometer, specifically for grip strength. Ultrasound will gauge muscle mass, while the BTE (Baltimore Therapeutic Equipment) will handle quadriceps isometric muscle tests. The Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) will evaluate respiratory strength. Participants' aerobic capacity will be gauged via the 6-minute Walk Test. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) evaluations will rely on Polar devices, and the Fitbit Inspire3. We will also employ the Fitbit Inspire3for tracking sleep quality. Psychosocial factors will be examined through: Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), SF-36 QOL Questionnaire, PHQ-ADS, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Activity levels will be determined through the IPAQ-SF questionnaire. The questionnaires will be completed on Qualtrics or in hardcopy format. Blood tests will monitor inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and hs-CRP. The study will be conducted over 10 weeks, starting from the initial and final data collection. During the first week, participants will need to visit the research laboratory to undergo basic tests. After completing all procedures, including informed consent and blood collection, participants will be randomly assigned (computerized generated) to the experimental (exercise) group (N=18) or control (non-exercise) group (N=18).\n\nIn the first week, the exercise group will participate for two additional days to introduce the exercise, evaluate their movements, and determine their maximum exercise capacity. The experimental group will participate in circuit strength training sessions lasting approximately 45 minutes three times a week for 8 weeks. The exercise protocol will consist of a 10-minute warm-up and cool-down, two sets of 12-minute high-intensity circuit training exercises, and a 3-minute break between sets. The intensity of the exercises will be gradually increased every two weeks for 8 weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the control group will need to maintain their sedentary lifestyle without changing their activity levels or diet.\n\nAfter completing the 8-week exercise protocol, all participants will visit the lab for a second round of data collection. Additionally, the exercise protocol will be shown to the control group during the retest day of the study."

There will be a 3-minute break between the exercise sets. The heart rate required during the exercise will be between 70-90% of their maximum capacity and a pre-scale rate of 7.5. The intensity of the exercise will be progressive each two weeks, commencing at 50% of their one rep max and increasing to 80% in their last week.
