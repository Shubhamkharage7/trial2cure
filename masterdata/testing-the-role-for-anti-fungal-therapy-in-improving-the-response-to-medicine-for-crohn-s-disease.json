            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of fluconazole in combination with IL-23 therapy versus IL-23 therapy alone for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). IL-23 therapy may include ustekinumab (anti-interleukin-12/23) or risankizumab (anti-interleukin-23).\n\nSubjects will be stratified into two groups based on standard of care treatment: IL-23 therapy initiation or IL-23 therapy dose escalation. Subjects in each group will then be randomized to one of two treatment arms:\n\n1. IL-23 Therapy with Fluconazole (200 mg on Day 0 and 100 mg on Days 1-13)\n2. IL-23 Therapy with Placebo (200 mg on Day 0 and 100 mg on Days 1-13)\n\nSubjects will blindly receive the fluconazole treatment only if they meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will return for standard of care clinic visits 2 weeks post-treatment initiation and 12 weeks post-treatment initiation. Disease activity will be assessed at standard of care visits. Stool and blood samples will collected for research from subjects at Day 0 (pre-treatment initiation), Week 2 post-treatment initiation, Week 8 post-treatment initiation, and Week 12 post-treatment initiation. If subjects consent to biopsies, biopsies will also be collected for research at endoscopic procedures (colonoscopies and/or flexible sigmoidoscopies). After Week 12, subjects will have the option to pursue open-label fluconazole treatment. Subjects will return at Week 24 and 1 year post-treatment initiation for standard of care visits, where blood and stool will also be collected for research."
