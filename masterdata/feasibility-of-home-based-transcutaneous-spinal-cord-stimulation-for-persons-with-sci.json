Participants will be supported with video-telehealth to assist with any difficulties that may arise and to progress their upper extremity home program. Evaluations will assess the feasibility of this video telehealth supported model as measured by the ease of use of the technology (QUEST 2.0, NASA-TLX) as well as participants ability to attend and complete all the training visits. Changes in upper extremity physical function will be measured using validated clinical tools (GRASSP, CUE-Q, DASH, COPM) as well as detailed evaluation of upper extremity muscle activation from surface EMG and strength measurements of pinch and grasp.\n\nThe primary outcome measure of this study is feasibility, and the secondary outcome measure is to capture changes in upper extremity performance."
