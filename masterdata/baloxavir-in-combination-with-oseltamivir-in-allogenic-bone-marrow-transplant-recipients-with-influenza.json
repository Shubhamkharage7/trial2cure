Although there are no data about this treatment option currently available, the investigator hypothesizes that combination therapy may be more effective in clearing influenza virus infection and decreasing the rate of emergence of resistant influenza in immunocompromised human hosts.",

Participants with be randomly assigned (1:1) to either baloxavir + oseltamivir or baloxavir-matched placebo +oseltamivir. Before randomization, patients will be stratified by hospitalization status and influenza type A (yes/no).\n\nPatients in the baloxavir combination arm will receive weight-adjusted baloxavir (40 mg for patients weighing \\<80 kg and 80 mg for those weighing \u226580 kg) at baseline and at day 4 and day 7. They will also receive oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 10 days. Patients in the baloxavir-matched placebo + oseltamivir arm will receive baloxavir-matched placebo at baseline and at day 3 and day 7and oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 10 days."
