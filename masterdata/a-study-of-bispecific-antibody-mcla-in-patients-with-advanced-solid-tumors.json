            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 1/2 open-label, multi-center, multi-national study with an initial dose escalation part to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MCLA-158 single agent in patients with mCRC.\n\nThe dose escalation part has been completed and the RP2D will be further evaluated in an expansion part of the study. Cohorts of selected solid tumor indications for which there is evidence of EGFR dependency and potential sensitivity to EGFR inhibition will be evaluated including head and neck cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\nThe study will further assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor activity of MCLA-158.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design:\n\nThis open label, multicenter, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MCLA-158 studying patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Enrollment in the dose escalation part has been completed.\n\nIn the dose expansion (single-agent cohorts) part of the study, the activity, safety, and tolerability of MCLA-158 at 1500 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) (preliminary RP2D) as a single agent will be evaluated in cohorts of selected solid tumor indications with dependency on EGFR signaling. The most recently enrolled cohorts were in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Enrollment into the HNSCC cohort of single-agent MCLA-158 for the treatment of patients with second/third line (2L/3L) HNSCC is closed. Other closed cohort indications included gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEA) with EGFR amplification and/or high EGFR expression, esophageal carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In the dose expansion part of the study, safety will also be characterized at two dose levels in this setting.\n\nAdditionally, in the dose expansion (combination cohorts) part of the study, the activity, safety, and tolerability of MCLA-158 at 1500 mg Q2W will be evaluated in combination with other therapies. Enrollment in the combination cohort of treatment of MCLA-158 with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with first line (1L) HNSCC is closed. A second combination cohort of MCLA-158 with FOLFIRI chemotherapy combination (i.e., 5-fluorouracil \\[5-FU\\], leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) will be explored in mCRC (RAS/RAF wild type) patients in the 2L setting. Other expansion cohorts may be considered for combination treatment in the future."
