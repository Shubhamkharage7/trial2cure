Specifically, burn survivors who will undergo standard of care laser therapy to treat burn-related scars will perform whole-body heating and local heating procedures prior to the initiation of laser therapy, at an intermediate point during the laser therapy regimen, and upon conclusion of the laser therapy regimen.\n\nFor this pilot investigation a placebo will not be incorporated.\n\nPrimary outcome variables will be skin blood flow and sweating responses from skin treated with laser therapy and adjacent untreated/uninjured skin."
