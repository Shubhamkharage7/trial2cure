            "detailedDescription": "The aims of this study are to determine whether the endoscopic surgical view is objectively clearer using Normal Saline versus Lactated Ringer's Irrigation during endoscopic skull base surgery for pituitary adenoma. Other objectives include determining whether lactated Ringer's irrigation decreases total estimated blood loss and whether use of lactated Ringer's irrigation shortens surgical time.\n\nHot saline irrigation at 40 degrees Celcius has been shown to improve endoscopic surgical field clarity and its use is common practice in both endoscopic inflammatory sinus surgeries and skull base procedures. Saline irrigation dilutes blood in the surgical field keeping the endoscopic view clean and more bloodless and the elevated temperature promotes hemostasis.\n\nPreliminary evidence suggests that the use of calcium-containing irrigant may further improve endoscopic surgical views. This mechanism is thought to be mediated through the activation of platelets and providing a calcium source to calcium-dependent factors in the coagulation cascade thereby promoting hemostasis. Using lactated Ringer's, a calcium-containing fluid, may result in improved surgeon visualization, decreased blood loss, and decreased complications during endoscopic approaches to the skull base."
