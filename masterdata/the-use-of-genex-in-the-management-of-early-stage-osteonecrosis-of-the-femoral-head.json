            "detailedDescription": "Avascular necrosis (AVN) or osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head refers to a condition in bone metabolism when cells of the trabecular bone (porous bone found at the end of long bones like the femur) in the hip spontaneously die. Depending on the amount of femoral head involvement, parts of the surface, like the articular surface that do not have blood vessels may collapse as the disease advances. Although the exact common occurrence of AVN or ON is unknown, the incidence is estimated to be between 20,000 to 30,000 newly diagnosed patients each year in the US.\n\nCore decompression of the hip is a minimally invasive surgical technique performed to manage symptoms in early stages (precollapse) of the condition. The procedure involves drilling holes into the femoral head to relieve pressure and create channels for new blood vessels to nourish the affected areas. Multiple adjuncts to core decompression, such as structural bone grafts, bone marrow concentrates, and bone proteins have been developed to accelerate the healing process in these patients. In recent years, considerable research activity has also been expanded to find new bone substitutes with osteoconductive properties (where bone grows on a surface) for the use in the treatment of surgically created defects.\n\nGenex\u00ae Bone Graft Substitute is a catalyst for bone healing. It complements the body's natural healing processes and encourages normal bone structure to be restored at a steady rate. Over 12 months, the graft matrix is completely absorbed and replaced by bone. No foreign artifacts are left behind to impair structural integrity."
