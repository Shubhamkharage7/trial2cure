If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "To better understand the effects of hemp-derived CBD with and without a small amount of THC, the investigators propose a Phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT) to examine the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of Full Spectrum CBD (fsCBD, contains less than 0.3% THC) vs. Broad Spectrum CBD (bsCBD, does not contain THC), vs. a matching placebo in a population of opioid users.\n\nThis is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the tolerability and efficacy of fsCBD and bsCBD, compared to a placebo control, to reduce opioid use, anxiety, and pain and improve sleep and cognitive function. If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 12 weeks.\n\nStudy visits will take place both in-person and via Zoom/online. Study participants will attend four in-person visits at the University of Colorado Anschutz at Week 0 (Baseline Medical Director Screen and Medication Dispense), Week 6, and Week 12. Research staff will meet with participants over Zoom during their Week 1 visit and will be contacted weekly during the 12-week study period. Following the Week 1 Zoom visit, participants will have the option to receive the survey link via email for Weeks 2-5 and 7-11 in lieu of meeting with a research team member over Zoom to allow more flexibility in time to complete the study surveys (participants can complete surveys at their convenience within a 3-business day period). In Week 16, approximately 4 weeks after the end of dosing, a final follow-up Zoom interview will occur."
