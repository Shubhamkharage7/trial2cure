This is an open label, between-subject, randomized pilot study to assess the effect of minimal filter ventilation vs. moderate filter ventilation on smoking behavior and biomarkers of exposure (e.g., nicotine, carbon monoxide) in menthol smokers switched to non-menthol cigarettes. Subjective measures, alveolar carbon monoxide, blood pressure and cigarettes smoked per day will be collected remotely. Biological samples will be collected at home and mailed into the clinic."
