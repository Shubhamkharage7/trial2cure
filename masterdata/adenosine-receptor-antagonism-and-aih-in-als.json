            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of a medication, istradefylline, in conjunction with breathing air with reduced oxygen for short periods of time (called acute intermittent hypoxia, or AIH), on breathing. This project will study breathing in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and unaffected, age-matched adults. Istradefylline is prescribed to increase movement in people with other neuromuscular conditions. A recently completed study found that people with ALS took deeper breaths, 60 minutes after using AIH.",
            "detailedDescription": "This repeated measures, placebo-controlled, randomized study will study feasibility and efficacy of istradefylline, an adenosine 2A receptor antagonist in conjunction with acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH).\n\nParticipation in this study includes a screening for eligibility, plus 4 individual study visits separated by 1 week. The eligibility screening will include a review of medical history and medications, along with a breathing test and sleep study.\n\nEach participant will experience a different study condition on each of their 4 study visits: an \"AIH + istradefylline\" (AIH+IST) visit, and a \"sham-AIH + istradefylline\" (sham+IST) visit, an \"AIH + placebo (AIH+CON)\" visit, and a \"sham-AIH + placebo\" (sham+CON) visit. The visits will be in random order for each subject. Participants and the testing investigators will not be told which order the visits will be. Participants need to avoid exercise and caffeine and nicotine products for \\>8 hours before each study visit.\n\nAIH + istradefylline visit: participants will take 20 mg of istradefylline. After a 4-hour break, participants will receive a 45-minute session of AIH, consisting of 15, one-minute periods of low oxygen (10% O2) with two-minute periods of normal oxygen (21% O2).\n\nSham AIH + istradefylline visit: participants will take 20 mg of istradefylline. After a 4-hour break, participants will receive a 45-minute session of SHAM AIH, consisting of 15, one-minute intervals of normal oxygen (21% O2) with two-minute periods of normal oxygen (21% O2).\n\nAIH + placebo visit: participants will take 20 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. After a 4-hour break, participants will receive a 45-minute session of AIH, consisting of 15, one-minute periods of low oxygen (10% O2) with two-minute periods of normal oxygen (21% O2).\n\nSham AIH + placebo visit: participants will take 20 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. After a 4-hour break, participants will receive a 45-minute session of SHAM AIH, consisting of 15, one-minute intervals of normal oxygen (21% O2) with two-minute periods of normal oxygen (21% O2).\n\nVenous blood samples will be collected at the start of each visit as general safety labs (complete blood count, uric acid, blood chemistry), and to assess levels of istradefylline levels in the blood. Additional blood tests 4 and 6 hours later will measure changes in serum istradefylline.\n\nThe study will assess vital signs, patient-reported symptoms, resting breathing, strength of the breathing muscles, and maximal voluntary pinch force at the start of each visit. These measures will then be repeated 1 and 2 hours after AIH or SHAM. Throughout the AIH and SHAM interventions, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored.\n\nFor the primary efficacy endpoint, the study will measure breath volume at the start of each visit, and 1 and 2 hours after the AIH and SHAM interventions. A linear mixed model will be used to compare differences in tidal volume. Main effects include treatment and time, with participants as random effects."
