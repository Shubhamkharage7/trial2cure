            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to replicate and extend findings from prior electrophysiological studies that demonstrated a reduction in epileptiform discharges and seizures in patients living with drug-resistant (medications are not effective) epilepsy after listening to specific music.\n\nIt is believed to be the first study to examine the effect of daily, self-administered musical stimuli in reduction of epileptiform event detections over days to weeks. The study will enroll a cohort of patients already implanted with NeuroPace Responsive Neurostimulator (RNS) device to treat their epilepsy. This device uses continuous, outpatient electrocorticographic recording data to provide immediate (or 'responsive') closed loop neurostimulation.\n\nPrimary hypothesis is that patients with drug resistant epilepsy, implanted with RNS, will have fewer epileptic activity episodes (RNS 'long episodes') during the weeks of experimental music intervention. The study team expect to see improvement with daily listening to specific music intervention (experimental, Music A), but not with active comparators (Music B or C). The effect, if any, of music intervention is expected to last at least one week after the intervention period (block) (for each music piece) ends.\n\nSecondary hypothesis is that the music listening every day will be associated with improved self-report of mood, quality of life, and self-reported measures of cognition. The study team suspects that this effect will not be limited to just one specific musical piece.\n\nThis study will also look to determine the feasibility of an at-home, self-administered auditory intervention in drug resistant epilepsy."
