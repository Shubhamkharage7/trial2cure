Beginning radiation therapy for breast cancer can be stressful. Education about what to expect often reduces the stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by these patients. This study is being done to see how effective photos are in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression associated with radiation therapy for patients with breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assessment of patient reported anxiety and depression, confidence with information, and side effect expectations of radiation therapy following counseling with or without photo guide at pre-treatment, 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Efficacy of intervention to impart reasonable expectations of the side effect burden of radiation therapy (RT).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Picture Guide book.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo verbal counseling and view a photo guide. Patients also complete questionnaires at 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo verbal counseling. Patients also complete questionnaires at 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months."
