The specific objectives of this study are to determine if sulfasalazine treatment 1) results in reduced serum ALP and other biomarkers of liver injury in PSC; 2) improves PSC patient symptoms; and 3) is safe in patients with PSC.\n\nWe are recruiting remotely throughout the United States so an individual anywhere in the US with PSC and IBD can be enrolled.",
            "detailedDescription": "As there is a strong association between PSC and IBD, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a therapy of proven benefit for UC may prove to also be effective for PSC. Unfortunately, several therapies which are indicated for the treatment of UC have not been effective in PSC including anti-TNF therapies and other anti-inflammatory medications. Sulfasalazine and mesalamine, medications commonly used for the treatment of UC, may be exceptions to this trend. While this therapy has never been formally tested in PSC, some retrospective reports suggest a possible benefit. Our current understanding of the mechanism of action of these medications suggests there is reasonable to believe they may also be effective in PSC.\n\nWe are recruiting remotely throughout the United States so an individual anywhere in the US with PSC and IBD can be enrolled."
