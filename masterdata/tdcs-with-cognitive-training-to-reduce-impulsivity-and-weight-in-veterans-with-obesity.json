The long-term goal of this research is to develop new treatment approaches for individuals with obesity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Two-hundred forty individuals will be screened with the goal of consenting and enrolling 124 patients and 88 patients completing the study. Participants completing the study will concurrently complete a structured weight loss program. The investigators' study protocol will consist of 13 study visits including four testing days, one before (V1), one on the day of the tenth session of tDCS (V11), another test visit (V12) 6 weeks later, and a final test visit approximately 4 months after beginning stimulation (V13)."
