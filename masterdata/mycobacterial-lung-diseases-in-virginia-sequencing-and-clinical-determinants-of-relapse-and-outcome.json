It is also harder to treat and results in poorer outcomes despite longer drug regimens. In this project we utilize a state-wide clinical cohort of NTM lung disease patients to understand what features of the organism (such as the species or subtype or drug resistance profile), the host (such as antibiotic drug absorption), and the environment (such as household exposure to NTM) are most important in predicting clinical outcome. The sum of this research will direct future therapies and management algorithms for this difficult disease.\n\nFirst, we will perform whole genome sequencing of NTM isolates to discern relapse versus reinfection and the environmental sources of acquisition. Second, we will utilize a state-wide cohort of new and prior diagnosed NTM lung disease patients, starting initial therapy to correlate clinical outcomes with NTM species, drug susceptibility, other bacterial in vitro assays, and serum drug levels."
