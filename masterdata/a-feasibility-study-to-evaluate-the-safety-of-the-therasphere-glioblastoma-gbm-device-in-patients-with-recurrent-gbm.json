            "briefSummary": "The FRONTIER Study is a prospective, interventional, single-arm, multi-center, study to assess the safety and technical feasibility of TheraSphere GBM in patients with recurrent GBM.",
            "detailedDescription": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer with a grave prognosis, resulting in \\<7% of patients surviving to five years post-diagnosis. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is currently a mainstay treatment for GBM; however, the dose delivered is limited by side effects. The targeted radiotherapy of the TheraSphere GBM Y-90 Glass Microsphere System (TheraSphere GBM) has promising potential to provide GBM patients with reduced side effects compared to external beam radiotherapy as well as a more effective treatment for this catastrophic disease.\n\nThe TheraSphere GBM device utilized in the FRONTIER trial is an yttrium-90 (Y-90) glass microsphere therapy for selective internal radiation therapy (endovascular radiotherapy) in recurrent GBM patients. The TheraSphere GBM treatment utilizes intra-arterial delivery and takes advantage of blood flow and direct tumor delivery. Treatment can be delivered by specific placement of a catheter close to the tumor through known angiographic techniques currently utilized by neuro-endovascular or interventional radiology physicians. Angiographic evaluation prior to treatment allows identification of tumor feeding arteries and definition of the treatment volume. TheraSphere GBM could achieve a high tumor response rate based on delivery of a tumor absorbed dose that is not currently possible with EBRT.\n\nIn consideration of the potential benefit of a more localized, targeted treatment with a reduced side effect profile compared to other treatment options, and the potential impact on patients' quality of life for this devastating disease, this First-in-Human Early Feasibility Study (EFS) of the TheraSphere GBM Y-90 Glass Microsphere System for the treatment of recurrent GBM is being conducted."
