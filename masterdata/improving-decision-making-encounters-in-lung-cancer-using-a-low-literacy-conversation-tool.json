This research is being conducted to help doctors understand the information patients need to participate in shared decision-making about their lung cancer treatment options. The focus of this research is to study how patients choose lung cancer treatment options and the information needed to make that choice, with a focus on patients with lower health literacy.",

Conduct a randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a conversation tool on patient-centered health and decision-making outcomes among patients making lung cancer treatment decisions. A subset of participants from control and intervention groups will also have their clinic conversations with providers recorded II. Conduct in-depth, semi-structured qualitative audio or video recorded interviews among a subset of Aim 1 participants.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients review decision aid.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive standard of care.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months."
