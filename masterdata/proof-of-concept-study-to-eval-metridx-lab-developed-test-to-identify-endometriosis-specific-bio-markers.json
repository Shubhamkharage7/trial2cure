Eligible participants in the active group will have history of endometriosis and will be having a laparoscopy for diagnosis within the next few weeks. Eligible participants in the control group will have no history of endometriosis but will need or have recently had a laparoscopy surgical procedure for a reasons such as tubal ligation.\n\nThe participant will have an uterine biopsy (similar to a pap smear) in the physician's office before the laparoscopy. The biopsied tissue will be sent to a special lab for analysis and diagnosis of endometriosis by an innovative proprietary procedure that analyses the cells of the tissue collected in the biopsy.\n\nThe results of the biopsy will be compared to the laparoscopy for accuracy."
