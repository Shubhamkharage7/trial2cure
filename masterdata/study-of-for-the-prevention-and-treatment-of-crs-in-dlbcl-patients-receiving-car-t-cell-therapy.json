This study will enroll adult patients with DLBCL who are scheduled to receive CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nThe first phase of the study will be open label with dose escalation. Participants will start taking CTO1681 just prior to receiving their CAR T-cell therapy and continue to take the study drug three times daily for a total of 15 days.",

In addition, urine samples, ECGs, scans, and other medical evaluations will be performed that are associated with the CAR T-cell therapy and/or necessary to verify study eligibility. Participants will be monitored for safety and efficacy for 43 days, and then will have follow-up to continue to monitor for safety and monitor for tumor response for up to 6 months for phase 1."
