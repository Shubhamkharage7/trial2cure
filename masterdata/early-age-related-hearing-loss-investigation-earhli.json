This study will provide information on reducing cognitive decline in those at risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).",
            "detailedDescription": "EARHLI will be a phase II 1:1 randomized controlled trial of a hearing intervention (including prescription hearing aids) versus a health education program. Participants must be 55-75 years old and have early-stage age-related hearing loss and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The trial will last 1 year and occur at a single site (Columbia University Irving Medical Center). Outcome measurements will include cognition, social engagement, and change in brain organization/connectivity. Assessments will occur at study start, 6 months, and 12 months. A total of 150 participants will be enrolled (75 per intervention group). Participants will also have a hearing test and a blood test. Approximately half of participants will have two MRI scans. As part of participating, all participants will get prescription hearing aids, either at study start or end."
