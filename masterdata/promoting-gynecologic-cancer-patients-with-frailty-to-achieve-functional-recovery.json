Compare primary quality of life endpoint of \"healthy days at home\" between non-frail and frail participants (primary quality of life endpoint).\n\nII. Compare other perioperative, oncologic, and quality of life outcomes between non-frail and frail participants.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nAll new patients being evaluated for a new diagnosis of gynecologic cancer by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Gynecologic Oncology service and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will be recruited in both the outpatient or inpatient setting. Study participants will be enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed for up to one year after undergoing surgery for cancer."
