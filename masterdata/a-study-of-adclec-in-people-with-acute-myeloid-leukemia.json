Once the researchers find this dose, it will test it in a new group of participants to see if it is effective in treating their relapsed/refractory AML."

At least one course of standard intensive induction chemotherapy (e.g., 7+3, MEC, HiDAC, etc.) or hypomethylating agent (HMA) or low dose cytarabine-based combination regimen including but not limited to venetoclax (e.g. venetoclax in combination with azacytidine, decitabine or cytarabine) ii. Four cycles of HMA monotherapy b. Relapsed AML is defined the appearance of \u22655% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood at any time after achieving a CR, CRh, or CRi.\n3. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n4.

Adequate organ function defined as:\n\n   1. Serum creatinine \\<2.0 mg/100 mL.\n   2. Total bilirubin \\<2.0 mg/100 mL, unless benign congenital hyperbilirubinemia or due to leukemia organ involvement\n   3.

Radiologically-detected or symptomatic CNS disease or CNS 3 disease (i.e., presence of \u22655/\u00b5L WBCs in CSF). Subjects with adequately treated CNS leukemia are eligible.\n3. Oxygen saturation \\<90% on room air.\n4. Patients with prior allogeneic HSCT are allowed as long as HSCT occurred \\> 3 months of signing ICF and without ongoing requirement for systemic graft-versus-host therapy.\n5.

Chemotherapy: Should be stopped one week prior to leukapheresis or starting conditioning chemotherapy. Hydroxyurea for cytoreduction can be administered up to 72 hours before leukapheresis or CAR T cell infusion.\n7. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to first study medication; or the presence of unstable angina or congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Grade 2 or higher; or cardiac ejection fraction \\<40%.\n8. Uncontrolled clinically significant infections such as ongoing fever for 48 hours, persistent bacteremia or requiring new supplemental oxygen.\n9. Previous treatment with CAR therapy\n10. Positive serologic test results for HIV.\n11. Acute or chronic HBV infection as assessed by serologic (HBVsAg) or PCR results, defined as HBVsAg+, HBVcAb+, HBV PCR+. 12. Acute or chronic HCV infection as assessed by serologic (HCV ab) or PCR results, defined as HCV Ab+ with reflex to positive HCV PCR.\n\n13.
