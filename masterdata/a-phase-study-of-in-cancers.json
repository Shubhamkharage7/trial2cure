Once a provisional MTD/RP2D is determined, Part 2 will enroll additional cohorts to optimize dose selection and to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of IAM1363 as monotherapy and in combination with trastuzumab. Following completion of Dose Optimization, Part 3 will be opened to enroll tumor-specific cohorts utilizing a Simon 2-Stage Minimax Design to evaluate IAM1363 as monotherapy or in combination with trastuzumab at the selected dose(s)."
