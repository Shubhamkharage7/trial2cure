To determine the effect of SPOT-ON and Enhanced Usual Care on the change in intensity of dyspnea (NRS) between baseline and 24 h in hypoxemic hospitalized patients with cancer.\n2. To determine the effect of SPOT-ON and Enhanced Usual Care on the change in intensity of dyspnea (NRS) between baseline and 24 h in non-hypoxemic hospitalized patients with cancer.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To determine the effect of SPOT-ON and Enhanced Usual Care on patient outcomes over 72 h, including intensity of dyspnea (NRS), unpleasantness of dyspnea (NRS), dyspnea response, ital signs, symptom burden, health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), adverse events, patterns of device use, and hospital outcomes.\n2. To identify factors associated with dyspnea response in the SPOT-ON intervention, including patient demographics, preferences, and level of usage of oxygen delivery modalities.\n3. To identify patient factors associated with their preferences (after Phase II and Phase III) for each of the oxygen delivery modalities in the SPOT-ON intervention, such as patient demographics and dyspnea characteristics."
