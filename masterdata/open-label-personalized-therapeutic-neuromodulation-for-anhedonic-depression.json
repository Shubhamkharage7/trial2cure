            "detailedDescription": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for 40 min over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been effective in real world situations. The limitations of this approach include the duration of the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session, 5 days per week, for 4-8 weeks). Recently, the investigators have pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with an accelerated treatment paradigm. This study aims to further study the accelerated protocol and examine changes in neuroimaging biomarkers."
