The findings will help determine \"how much\" stimulation is needed to enhance memory and thinking abilities, how it affects brain functioning, and who is most likely to benefit. Ultimately, this information may guide treatment efforts for those at various stages of Alzheimer's disease. The study will use brain imaging to see whether these treatments change how participants learn and remember information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans will be used. The study will also use cognitive tests and questionnaires to examine whether participants' memory (and related abilities) change because of treatment. The study will enroll participants with a diagnosis of MCI or DAT. It is expected but not required that participants will be co-enrolled in the University of Michigan Memory and Aging Project (UM-MAP; HUM00000382)."
