Motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient education will accompany intensive collaborative problem-solving and creation of accountability structures to create lasting change.

We hypothesize that these visits will control for the effect of research participation and increased knowledge about HBRs, and that simply providing standardized didactic content as an intervention modality without any personalization will have negligible effects on participants' healthy behaviors (HBs), self-efficacy, or quality of life. Content will follow the WCRF/AICR HBRs. Weeks 1-2 will focus on physical activity; weeks 3-4 will focus on diet and alcohol, and weeks 5-6 will focus on weight management and generalized strategies for HB change.",
