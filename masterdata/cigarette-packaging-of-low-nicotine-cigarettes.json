The investigators will aim to recruit and randomize 500 daily smokers (\\~250 male, \\~250 female) in a 35-day protocol. After completing a 5-day baseline period of smoking their own brand, participants will be randomized to a 30-day experimental period when they will receive either their own preferred brand (control), or LNC cigarettes in one of four types of packaging: standard investigational (gray packaging); red, or blue (tobacco industry strategy); or plain packaging (tobacco control strategy). Participants will be asked to attend 5 in-person sessions at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA) on Days 0, 5, 10, 20 \\& 35. At Intake and Days 15, 25 and 30 participants will complete sessions with research staff remotely (i.e. by video call). Sessions will occur every 4-6 days, for a total of 5 in-person and 4 remote sessions across 35 days."
