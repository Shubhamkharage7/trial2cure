The study is designed to systematically assess safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of STC-15 in adult subjects with advanced malignancies. Dose levels for further evaluation in expansion cohorts will be selected based on all available PK, pharmacodynamic, target engagement, efficacy, safety, and tolerability data including long-term safety data beyond dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The study may be amended to evaluate STC-15 in combination with a Food and Drug Administration-approved standard of care treatment regimen, which could encompass targeted/chemotherapy, radiation therapy and/or immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockers."
