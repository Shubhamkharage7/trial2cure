The study's hypotheses are 1) dynamic vision testing will reveal vision impairments right after a person sustains a concussion, 2) these impairments may still be present upon clearance to return to play.",
            "detailedDescription": "The subjects of interest are CSUN student-athletes who give consent to participate in the study. Dynamic vision will be assessed through the administration of the Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) test and the Gaze Stabilization Test (GST). Additionally, the 6-condition Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), which is currently a component of CSUN's established concussion protocol, will be administered to assess balance impairments. This cluster of tests will be administered three times per athlete: (1) during preseason to establish baseline measures, (2) acutely post-concussion once the athlete subject has been cleared by the team physician for return to exercise, and (3) when cleared to return to sport. The results will be used to evaluate whether or not dynamic vision results have returned to baseline by the time that CSUN Athletics clears the athlete to \"Return to Play.\""
