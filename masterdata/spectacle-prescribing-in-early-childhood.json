The SPEC study compares outcomes for young children (12 to \\< 35 months of age) with astigmatism meeting spectacle prescribing recommendations and randomized to either Full-Time spectacle wear (encouraged and reinforced) or Ad Lib spectacle wear (only as accepted by the child). The primary outcome analysis compares cognitive development at 38-42 months in children randomized to the Full-Time and Ad Lib groups. Secondary analyses compare Language, Motor, Social-Emotional, and Adaptive Behavior developmental outcomes and visual acuity outcome for children randomized to the Full-Time and Ad Lib groups."
