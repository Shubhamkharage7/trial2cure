Sepsis is a type of severe infection of the blood stream, and its diagnosis may be obscured by many other conditions such as surgery, trauma, and cancer. MicroRNAs are biomarkers found in the blood and tissue. Blood samples may help correlate changes in microRNA expression to patient reactions to a sepsis infection.",

To examine whether the cellular and viral micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) changes in plasma and peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMNCs) correlate with the diagnosis and outcome of sepsis.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To distinguish systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without infection from sepsis and septic shock.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP A: Patients undergo blood specimen collection at baseline (before surgery), the day after surgery, either the day of hospital discharge or the day of sepsis diagnosis, and 6 days after the baseline blood draw if still hospitalized.\n\nGROUP B: Patients undergo blood specimen collection at baseline (day of sepsis diagnosis), the day after baseline, and on day 7 from baseline if still hospitalized."
