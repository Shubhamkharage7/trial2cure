The researchers will use this information to learn more about how physiologic data may relate to cancer diagnosis and response to treatment, and to identify factors that may lead to higher or lower risk of cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "Project 1: HealthKit This prospective registry cohort study will aim to recruit a total of 3,000 patients and 500 adults without a history of cancer. The targeted patient cohorts / settings will aim to be : (1) pre-treatment / during treatment: patients with newly diagnosed early-stage, low-grade, or locally advanced solid tumors that are either pre- or during treatment, (2) post-treatment: patients with primary solid tumor diagnosed from 2015 onwards that are post-treatment, (3) advanced disease setting: patients diagnosed with metastatic or high-grade disease, (4) patients enrolled onto investigational trials in the early drug development (EDD) Service, (5) patients admitted to Urgent Care Center (UCC), and (6) patients completing a Baseline Medical History Questionnaire (BMH) as part of standard intake in an MSK care clinic. This study will accrue patients receiving care at any MSK site. Adults without a history of cancer will be recruited as a comparison group. The targeted adults without a history of cancer cohorts will aim to be (n=250/cohort): (7) adults without a history of cancer \\<50 years of age, and (8) adults without a history of cancer aged greater than or equal to 50 years.\n\nProject 2: DigIT-Ex This prospective registry cohort study will aim to recruit a total of 120 patients and 24 adults without a history of cancer. The targeted adult patient cohorts / settings will be (n=12/cohort), excluding cohort 6, which will be (n=48): (1) patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplantation, (2) patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (3) patients scheduled to undergo surgery for localized prostate cancer (4) patients scheduled to undergo surgery for lung cancer, (5) patients scheduled to undergo total neoadjuvant therapy for advanced rectal cancer, (6) patients scheduled to undergo antiandrogen therapy for advanced prostate cancer, and (7) patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The targeted adults without a history of cancer cohorts will be (n=12/cohort): (8) individuals without a history of cancer aged less than 50 years, and (9) individuals without a history of cancer aged greater than or equal to 50 years."
