            "briefSummary": "Aging is associated with progressive impairment of tissue and organ function, resulting in increased susceptibility to chronic disease, frailty and disability. Currently there are limited treatment options to alter this inevitable process. The proposed work has the potential to identify a new therapeutic intervention to decrease aging-related degenerative processes.\n\nRapamycin or sirolimus is a macrocyclic immunosuppressive drug that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is part of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent pathway which is a fundamentally linked to cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This pathway is altered in a variety of diseases, including cancers, immunosuppressed states, and fibroproliferative diseases. The mTOR kinase is considered one of the leading regulators of this pathway. Changes in mTOR signaling are closely associated with inflammation, cell growth and survival, leading to the development of chronic diseases. Recent evidence also suggests that mTOR inhibitors are promising modulators of the aging process by slowing the mechanisms of aging at the cellular level. There is a growing appreciation of the potential impact of sirolimus in slowing aging processes and in prolonging healthy lifespan.\n\nThe proposed study addresses critical gaps in our understanding of the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in delaying aging processes and is based on findings in animal studies and incidental clinical observations. The investigators will overcome potential biases with a randomized control trial. The proposed intervention study is intended to improve our insight into clinical outcomes leading to prevention of chronic diseases such as skin cancer and mortality. Our overarching hypothesis is that sirolimus is one of the first pharmacological agents that will impact the aging process and chronic disease development. Specifically, the investigators aim to investigate whether sirolimus can reduce the occurrence or increase in biomarkers of aging processes."

The medications would be dispensed from UT Southwestern Medical Center. To ensure patent's safety, all patients will be closely monitored. We will start with a 0.5 mg tablet- the smallest sirolimus dose available. Sirolimus level will be checked weekly in the first month to ensure we maintain a low goal (5-7) that will decrease the risk of developing side effects. In order to monitor study drug compliance, we will ask the patient to keep a pill diary. After the first month, the patient will have monthly blood work and monthly phone call to enquire about potential side effects. The patients will be followed in clinic in person every 3 months. Functional assessment will be obtained at baseline, 3 months 6 months 9 months and 1 year follow up. Completion of the 1-year treatment period will be followed by a follow-up phone call 1 month later.",
