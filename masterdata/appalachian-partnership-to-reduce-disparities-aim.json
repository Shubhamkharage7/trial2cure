            "detailedDescription": "This CBPR study will advance prevention science and practice through testing an innovative intervention to promote and support the use of needed HIV, STI, and HCV prevention and care services among GBMSM and transgender women; and developing priorities and recommendations to improve their health that will be disseminated to inform public health practice, research, and policy. By integrating peer navigation and mHealth strategies, the proposed study provides a unique opportunity to improve health among vulnerable, hidden, and neglected populations living in rural Appalachia. Findings from this research may inform strategies and approaches to address other health disparities in other rural populations."

As opinion leaders, community health leaders will reframe health-compromising and bolster health-promoting norms and expectations about testing and use of other prevention and care services.\n\nEach community health leader will also conduct formal in-person group activities with their social network members.

For example, when planning a group activity (described above), the community health leader will use social media to remind social network members about the activity and help them problem solve barriers to attending.
