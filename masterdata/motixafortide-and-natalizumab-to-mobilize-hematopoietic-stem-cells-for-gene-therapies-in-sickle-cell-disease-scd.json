            "briefSummary": "Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapies now offer curative potential for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), with decreased toxicity compared to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. However, effective HSC-based gene therapy depends on collecting sufficient HSCs to generate the therapeutic product, and currently available mobilization regimens carry unacceptable risk for patients with SCD or do not reliably yield optimal numbers of HSCs for gene therapy.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that HSC mobilization with motixafortide (CXCR4i) alone and the combination of motixafortide plus natalizumab (VLA-4i) will be safe and tolerable in SCD patients. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that combined CXCR4 and VLA-4 blockade with motixafortide plus natalizumab will result in a rapid, robust, and synergistic increase in HSC mobilization to peripheral blood (PB) in patients with SCD, when compared to motixafortide alone."
