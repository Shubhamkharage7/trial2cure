With support from NFP supervisors and nurses, the investigators will develop new NFP materials promoting healthy diet, activity, sleep, and smoking behaviors, along with optimal weight, glycemia, lipid, and blood pressure profiles. The investigators will conduct a pilot study with up to 40 NFP clients (or women similar to NFP client population) and their nurses to determine feasibility and acceptability of the materials and study protocol."
