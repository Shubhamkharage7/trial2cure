While willingness to undergo the biopsy is required if archival tissue is not available, PET/CT guided biopsy is not a mandatory study assessment. As described in section 9.3, the guided biopsy may be waived at the discretion of the principal investigator if the DLL3 PET/CT reveals no sites of DLL3 tracer-avid tumor or if the principal investigator deems it is not in the best interest of the patient, according to best clinical judgement.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of anaphylactic reaction to humanize or human antibodies\n* Pregnant or breast feeding\n* Psychiatric illness that would interfere with compliance with the study procedures\n* Inability to undergo PET scan due to weight limit",
