Approximately 60 patients with melanoma or SCCHN will be included (approximately 15 for each indication).During the neoadjuvant period, patients in cohort A, cohort B and Cohort C (Arm A) will receive IO102-IO103 and pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA\u00ae Q3W. Patients in Cohort C (Arm B) will receive pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA\u00ae Patients with melanoma will receive 3 doses of neoadjuvant treatment. Patients with SCCHN will receive 2 or 3 doses of neoadjuvant treatment, at the investigator's discretion. Surgical resection will be performed 1 to 3 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment. All patients in cohort A,B and Cohort C (Arm A)will receive post-surgery treatment with IO102-IO103 and pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA\u00ae for a total of 15 cycles (up to 45 weeks). Patients in Cohort C (Arm B) will receive post-surgery treatment with pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA\u00ae for a total of 15 cycles (up to 45 weeks).\n\nPatients with melanoma and patients with SCCHN who do not require SOC RT \u00b1 cisplatin will start post-surgery treatment after adequate recovery from surgery (approximately 1 to 2 months; no more than 12 weeks).Patients with SCCHN who require postoperative SOC therapy after surgery will start post-surgery IO102-IO103 and pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA\u00ae after adequate recovery from SOC therapy (approximately 1 to 2 months; no more than 12 weeks).\n\nObjective response will be based on imaging; pathologic tumor response of the surgical specimens will be assessed at the time of surgery. Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients with major pathologic response (MPR) in the resected tumor tissue after neoadjuvant treatment. Secondary endpoints include disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years after surgery. All patients will have an end-of-treatment visit approximately 4 weeks after their last dose of trial treatment. Follow-up visits will be conducted at 6 and 12 months after the end-of-treatment visit. Following completion of the 12-month follow-up period, long-term follow-up for overall survival (OS) will be conducted every 6 months for at least a further 12 month."

Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Patients who are currently receiving steroids at a dose equivalent to \\<5 mg/day of prednisone do not need to discontinue steroids prior to enrollment. Patients who require topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational steroids will not be excluded from the trial. Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome will not be excluded from the trial.\n7. Additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n8. History of an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n9. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Patients with type I diabetes mellitus; hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement; skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment; or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.\n10. History of radiation pneumonitis\n11. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease\n12. Active infection requiring systemic therapy\n13. HIV-infected patients with a history of Kaposi sarcoma and/or Multicentric Castleman Disease\n14.

Known history of HBV or HCV infection\n    2. Mandated by local health authority. Patients with a history of hepatitis will be screened using serology to confirm status.\n15. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n16. Psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with the patient's ability to cooperate with the trial requirements\n17.
