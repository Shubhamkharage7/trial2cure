To examine how GI inflammation and GI microbiome changes influence symptom experience is used above in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.\n\nIII. To examine associations between microbial composition functional profiles at T1 and T2, T3 as well as T4 in patients who report symptom severity in neuropsychological and GI symptoms at the last three timepoints.\n\nIV. To evaluate for differentially abundant metabolites and perturbed metabolic pathways associated with microbiome diversity in patients who do and do not report neuropsychological and GI symptom occurrence at T2, T3 and T4.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients undergo stool and blood sample collection, complete questionnaires, and have their medical records reviewed on study."
