Participants will be assessed at week 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks. An additional 4 weeks follow up will be undertaken if confirmatory assessment is required after week 24.\n\nAssessments will include:\n\n* cutaneous lesion response using photographic imaging\n* area of ulceration using photographic imaging\n* presence or absence of ulceration, bleeding, discharge and eschar\n* patient-reported assessments for pain and itch, using numeric rating scales\n* quality of life assessments\n* safety On Day 1 of treatment, the participant will undergo an ECG assessment post-infusion and a blood sample for determination of concentration of REM-001 in plasma will be collected post-infusion."
