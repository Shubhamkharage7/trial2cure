Implanted subjects will be followed for 5 years post-implant.\n\nSubjects will be recruited in accordance with the approved Inspire UAS indication for use and will only include those subjects who are within the new age indication (18-21 years of age). Implanted subjects must meet the registry eligibility criteria. Those subjects that are enrolled but fail to meet the eligibility criteria will be considered screen failures.\n\nThis registry will collect safety and effectiveness data on 60 implanted subjects at a minimum of 5 qualified clinical centers in the United States.\n\nStudy data will be collected at the following timepoints:\n\nBaseline (pre-implant) Implant Activation (1 month post-implant) 6 Months post-implant\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years post-implant"
