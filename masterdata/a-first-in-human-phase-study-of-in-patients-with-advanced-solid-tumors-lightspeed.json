            "briefSummary": "This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation and cohort-expansion study of LAT010 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, PD, and antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1 dose-escalation and Phase 2 cohort expansion.",
            "detailedDescription": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) agonists have shown significant antitumor activities but are associated with severe toxic side effects, due to prioritized activation of high-affinity IL-2 receptor (i.e., IL2R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3). LAT010 is a human IL-2 based immunocytokine designed to exclusively interact with intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor (i.e., IL2R\u03b2\u03b3) but not the high-affinity IL2R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 receptor. Its exceptional selectivity in activating CD8+ T cells and NK cells may confer the clinical benefits of IL-2 in promoting antitumor immunity without the associated safety concerns.\n\nPhase 1 of the study will examine LAT010 in an accelerated and standard \"3+3\" dose-escalation design. It consists of 7 planned cohorts. Approximately 20 to 50 patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled in the cohorts. Each treatment cycle consists of 4 weeks, during which patients will receive an IV injection of LAT010 at the assigned dose once weekly. The DLT observation period is the first treatment cycle (28 days).\n\nPhase 2 will be initiated after the MTD or a RP2D has been determined in Phase 1. Approximately up to 30 patients per cohort by tumor type will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of LAT010 in the treatment of selected tumor types at multiple dose levels based on the results of Phase 1. The primary objective of Phase 2 study is to define the preliminary efficacy in the setting of advanced cancers with high unmet medical needs."

Patients have received the established standard therapies for the selected tumor type prior to enrolling to this study and patients consent that they may be delaying or forgoing specific treatments known to confer a clinical benefit for their disease.\n    4.

Patient has a history of sensitivity to LAT010, or components thereof, or a history of drug or other allergy that in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor (if appropriate), contraindicates their participation.\n11. Patient has any illness, medical condition, organ system dysfunction, or social situation, including mental illness or substance abuse, that is deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign the informed consent form (ICF), adversely affect the patient's ability to cooperate and participate in the study, or compromise the interpretation of study results.\n12.
