Intervention participants will receive type 2 diabetes education and web-based lessons on appetite self-regulation. Participants will also receive a Fitbit to monitor daily physical activity. The investigators will follow up with participants at six months.",

Sixty AAs will be randomized to the Centering Appetite intervention or the control group. Over the 6 months, Centering Appetite participants will have two intervention sessions supplemented by monthly booster sessions and weekly messages related to the program. The control group will also receive two intervention sessions and weekly nutrition tutorials. The study will examine the following: recruitment feasibility, attendance/retention, treatment adherence, intervention, HbA1c, and binge eating."
