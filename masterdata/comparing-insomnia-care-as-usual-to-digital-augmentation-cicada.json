            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this pragmatic non-inferiority randomized clinical trial is to evaluate whether Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (CBTI) delivered through a clinical decision support digital platform is non-inferior to insomnia care delivered as usual at three military treatment facilities for treatment of insomnia, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and treatment satisfaction.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic insomnia is pervasive among service members and adversely affects health and readiness. Insomnia rarely remits spontaneously, and sleep-focused treatments are required to reduce or eliminate insomnia. Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (CBTI) is the first line treatment for insomnia. CBTI remains underutilized and is often unavailable in care settings where service members receive sleep healthcare. Digital health technology is one of the strategic components identified by the DHA to support behavioral health, including sleep health. NOCTEM\u00ae has developed and validated its Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COAST\u2122) platform to scale delivery and access to CBTI. This non-inferiority trial will evaluate and compare the changes in insomnia severity following COAST-enhanced CBTI or insomnia care as usual (ICAU) pre- to post-treatment and at the 3-month follow up. Secondary outcomes of interest include changes in depression and anxiety over time, and patient satisfaction with insomnia care following COAST-enhanced CBTI or ICAU."
