Preclinical data using patient derived xenografts have shown loss of ECAD due to CDH1 mutation is associated with an upregulation ROS1 activity, and ROS1 inhibitors have demonstrated synthetic lethality in CDH1-mutated cell lines. Taletrectinib is a novel ROS1/NTRK inhibitor with demonstrated activity in ROS1 mutated non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of the trial is to estimate the activity of taletrectinib in previously treated CDH1-mutated metastatic breast ILC."

Taletrectinib has been shown to have anti-tumor activity against recombinant ROS1, NTRK1, and NTRK3 in sub-nanomolar concentration in an ATP dependent manner, in addition to completely inhibiting ACK, ALK, DDR1 and LTK at micromolar concentrations.
