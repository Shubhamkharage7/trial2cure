            "detailedDescription": "CIDP is a rare, chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensation. Nipocalimab (also referred to as JNJ-80202135 or M281) is a fully human aglycosylated immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to selectively bind, saturate, and block the IgG binding site on the endogenous neonatal Fc receptor. The study will consist of the following periods: (a) identification of participants with active CIDP (including screening \\[up to 4 weeks\\] and run-in \\[up to 12 weeks\\]); (b) open-label treatment with nipocalimab (Stage A) (12 weeks); (c) double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal (Stage B) (up to 52 weeks); and (d) an open-label extension (OLE) (until to 2 years after marketing authorization in the participant's local country or until nipocalimab becomes available commercially or via other continued access program, whichever comes first). Participants who discontinue treatment and intend to withdraw from the study at any point during the treatment periods (Stage A, Stage B, or the OLE) will be requested to enter an 8-weeks follow-up after the last dose of study intervention. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and biomarker evaluations will be assessed."
