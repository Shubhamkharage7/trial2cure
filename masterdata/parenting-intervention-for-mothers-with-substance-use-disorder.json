            "briefSummary": "Children of mothers with substance use disorder (SUD) constitute a growing and highly vulnerable population. Evidence-based parenting interventions have the potential to both support parents' recovery and mental health by helping them cope with stress of parenthood and promote the optimal development of their children by supporting responsive parenting. The Supporting Our Families through Addiction and Recovery (SOFAR) pediatric medical home for families and children impacted by SUDs, with integrated behavioral health (IBH), provides an opportune setting for addressing the needs of mothers and children impacted by SUDs. While many families are thriving in the program, there is a strong unmet need for evidence-based parent-training interventions, particularly during the preschool period.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the implementation of a brief, parent child interaction therapy (PCIT)-based intervention, entitled Threat, harm, risk, investigation, vulnerability and engagement (THRIVE), that will be offered in the SOFAR Clinic at Boston Medical Center. THRIVE is a safe, 6-session telehealth intervention that has been tested in pediatric and community-based settings. The evidence-based suggests that THRIVE is associated with significant improvements in child behaviors and parenting stress.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that offering THRIVE through the SOFAR pediatric primary care program will be feasible and acceptable, improving access to and engagement in evidence-based parenting interventions among mothers with substance use disorder who receive parenting support through our integrated behavioral health model. In addition to studying the implementation of this evidence-based intervention, this study will allow the researchers to test data collection procedures (pre and post-interventions assessments) to inform a future clinical trial."
