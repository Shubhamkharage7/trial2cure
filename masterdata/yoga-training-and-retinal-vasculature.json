The word list includes words from the previous list, words related to the previous list, and words unrelated to the list. Units of measurement are points. The test has three recall trials of 12 words each scored from 0 (none remembered to 12 (all remembered). Therefore, there are 36 points available for the 3 trials. After 20-25 minutes the subject's delayed recall is tested as the subject is asked to recall the same list of words, scored 0-12. Then a retention trial using a list of 24 words (12 words from the previous list, 6 related words, and 6 unrelated words) is read. The subjects must identify if each word was on the previous list or not.",
