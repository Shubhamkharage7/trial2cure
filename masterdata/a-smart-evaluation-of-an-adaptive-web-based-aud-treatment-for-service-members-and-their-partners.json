The investigators want to identify for whom this intervention is most efficacious and on what drinking behaviors and mechanisms. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will reduce concerned partner drinking and increase service member help-seeking, compared to website resources, and that phone-based CRAFT will increase help-seeking behaviors, compared to those who are guided via a CRAFT workbook."

Finally, Session 4 focuses on continuing self-care and talking with their partner about their concerns while interacting with them in healthy ways. The WBI contains audio, video, text, and exercises that utilize digital storytelling and vignettes to convey teaching points - a method utilized by the military to address stigma and increase treatment utilization. Actresses portrayed different experiences that the CP may be going through and modeled skills. CPs clicked on the vignette that they most connected with and followed that character across all the sessions.",
