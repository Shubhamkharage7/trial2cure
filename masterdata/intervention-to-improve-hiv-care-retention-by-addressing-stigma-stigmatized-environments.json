HIV-related stigma is a known impediment to the care and health outcomes of people living with HIV. The proposed study will test theory-based interventions designed to manage HIV stigma in order to improve care retention and medication adherence in communities with high-levels of HIV-related stigma.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial is conducting a randomized test of a behavioral self-management intervention designed to improve HIV treatment outcomes in people living with HIV in stigmatized contexts. The trial includes a control arm and a non-stigma enhanced treatment adherence intervention arm. Participants living in an economically under-resourced area of South Africa are recruited through clinical care settings. The goal of the research is to examine whether directly addressing HIV stigma and medication adherence management improves treatment outcomes beyond those observed from a standard behavioral intervention without added stigma-addressing components."
