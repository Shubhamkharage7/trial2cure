            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate a program for adults who live alone and have some cognitive impairment (CI) to see if it is useful and acceptable. This program aims to help older adults with cognitive impairment who live alone to be engaged and active, as well as safe at home. The investigators want to see how useful this program is and how it can be improved.\n\nThe specific aims are:\n\n* Specific Aim 1: Develop and Adapt Home Alone to Prepare for Pilot Testing.\n* Specific Aim 2: Pilot Test a Revised Version of Home Alone.\n\nPhase I participants will be asked to:\n\n* Participate for 3 months\n* Complete 3 surveys\n* Complete 7 1-hour meetings on a weekly basis with a coach\n* Complete a final interview\n\nPhase II participants will be asked to:\n\n* Participate for 6 months\n* Complete 3 surveys\n* Complete 7 1-hour meetings on a weekly basis with a coach\n* A sub-sample will be asked to complete a final interview",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary goal of this proposal is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of a novel intervention, \"Home Alone.\" Home Alone will be targeted to older persons with CI or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who live alone in the community. This National Institute on Aging (NIA) Stage I effort will adapt and tailor established, evidence-based mental health and dementia care intervention models (behavioral activation, Skills2Care\u00ae, Tailored Activity Program) to reduce environmental stress and enhance engagement in desired activities to improve social well-being and maintain cognition and function for those who live alone with CI. Relying on a robust, mixed methods strategy and an implementation science lens at the outset of intervention development, the investigators seek to position Home Alone as a scalable program that, as its efficacy and effectiveness is determined in subsequent trials, is primed for widespread dissemination and adoption in home-based and community contexts.\n\nThe Specific Aims are as follows:\n\nSpecific Aim 1 (Phase I): Develop and Adapt Home Alone to Prepare for Pilot Testing. The investigators will identify treatment components and examine feasibility and relevance by obtaining insights from 15 persons with CI who live alone and participate in the Home Alone intervention over a 3-month period. The investigators will utilize the Phase I period to determine whether various elements of Home Alone (e.g., delivery mode, length, and other intervention characteristics) require adaptation. The investigators will use a convergent parallel mixed methods design (i.e., the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data concurrently) when doing so. Through analysis of the various quantitative and qualitative data elements to inform adaptation, the investigators will finalize and refine Home Alone prior to project Phase II (Specific Aim 2).\n\nSpecific Aim 2 (Phase II): Pilot Test a Revised Version of Home Alone. This R21 project will evaluate the following indices of implementation potential over a 6-month period: whether Home Alone is carried out as intended and is feasible (the degree to which Home Alone can be successfully delivered); acceptable (Home Alone is agreeable and satisfactory among users), and useful (participants perceive benefit from the Home Alone intervention). A sequential explanatory mixed methods design (a quantitative component followed by a qualitative component) will be utilized to pilot test Home Alone. The investigators will enroll 50 persons living alone with CI over a 6-month period. The investigators will also examine whether key empirical outcomes (perceived loneliness; activity engagement; measures of cognition and functional dependence) change over a 6-month period. Available qualitative data will provide information on how and why Home Alone was beneficial or not for persons with CI and allow for greater understanding of the intervention's mechanisms of benefit.\n\nHome Alone combines Behavioral Activation (BA) with other evidence-based intervention approaches (i.e., Tailored Activity Program (TAP); Skills2Care\u00ae) that target the environment in order to tailor activity that is fulfilling and meaningful to persons with CI. An additional intervention component that will be incorporated in Home Alone includes environmental assessments that help the person with CI by removing objects and improving lighting and safety in areas of the home where a desired and meaningful activity will be conducted."
