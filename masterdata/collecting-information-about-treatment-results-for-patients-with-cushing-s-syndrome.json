If patient does not have any of these results, pathology of ACTH tumor may confirm presence of disease.\n* For pituitary patients, if the patient demonstrates non-classic testing or no pituitary lesion is seen on MRI then petrosal sinus sampling or positive surgical pathology will be used to confirm pituitary source of Cushing's. Clinical or biochemical remission after surgery will also confirm pituitary source.\n* Ectopic Cushing's will be confirmed by petrosal sinus sampling and appropriate imaging tests, or positive surgical pathology.\n* Adrenal Cushing's will be confirmed by a suppressed plasma ACTH value and identification of an adrenal lesion on CT or MRI, or positive surgical pathology.\n* In lieu of MRI, surgical, or laboratory reports, physician's assessment note including mention of results will also be used as source for eligibility purposes.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a diagnosis of iatrogenic Cushing's.",
