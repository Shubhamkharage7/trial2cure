Numerous studies have demonstrated near 100% agreement between p16 and HPV for patients with oropharyngeal cancer. As such, the use of p16 has been accepted as an appropriate surrogate for HPV status.\n* Clinical stage I, II, or III disease (AJCC Eighth Edition); Note: Patients with M1 tumors (distant metastases) are not eligible;\n* History/physical examination within 6 weeks prior to registration, including assessment of weight and recent weight loss;\n* Age \u2265 18;\n* PET/CT within 6 weeks prior to registration;\n* Patients must sign a study-specific informed consent form prior to study entry.\n* Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Non-English speaking, deaf, hard of hearing and illiterate individuals are eligible for this trial.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years;\n* Patients who have had initial surgical treatment other than the diagnostic biopsy of the primary site or nodal sampling of the neck disease are excluded;\n* Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable;\n* Receipt of prior radiotherapy that would result in overlap with proposed field.",
