            "briefSummary": "At the Ohio State University, and across the country, surgical patients admitted to the hospital are over-prescribed a significant amount of opioid medications upon discharge to home. Recent studies reveal that a large percentage of patients prescribed opioid medications after surgery have approximately half of the prescribed medication left over. This study aims to evaluate reported opioid use after surgery in patients undergoing cystectomy in order to better approach the issue with current opioid use and abuse trends while still providing adequate medical care and pain management to patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "Previous studies show that 67% of patients prescribed opioid medications in urologic procedures and surgeries had leftover opioid medications with a mean use of about half the medications prescribed. A similar study in thoracic surgery patients reported similar results with 71% of patients admitting to taking half or less of their prescribed opioid medications. Recent advancements in cystectomy protocol have already shown promise with reducing hospital length of stay from eight to four days, including the simultaneous reduction of opioid analgesics for pain management, with 4.9 mg morphine equivalents per day when using enhanced recovery techniques compared to 20.67 mg in traditional care. Results of the current prospective study could further support these results and include low to no risk assessments and follow-up phone calls. This study is observational and involves consenting adult patients undergoing cystectomy to pre-operative assessments including the Self Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) questionnaire, a cognitive test to identify mild-moderate cognitive impairment, and collection of demographic data and medical history. Phone call follow-ups include assessments of post-discharge pain and opioid consumption, and completing verbally an adapted Activities of Daily Living questionnaire. No additional risks have been identified by participating in this study. Participants may not directly benefit from participating in this trial, but the data collected could provide valuable insight into the discrepancy between required opioid pain medications and opioid pain medication prescription for adequate pain management. This insight could then be applied to reevaluate post-discharge pain management procedures and standards of care, therefore curbing opioid use and abuse trends"
