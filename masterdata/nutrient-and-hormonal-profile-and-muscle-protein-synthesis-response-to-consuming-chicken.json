            "briefSummary": "The study aims to evaluate if there is a difference between eating conventionally raised or organic chicken. The investigators will measure and compare the nutrient and hormone levels in the participant's blood and the muscle protein synthesis rate (the rate at which your body builds muscle) after eating chicken from different farming practices. This will help the investigators to understand if these farming practices impact muscle protein synthesis and overall health.\n\nSpecific aim 1: Describe the post-prandial nutrient and hormonal profile in serum in the 3 hours following consumption of 100 grams (\\~32g of protein) of boneless-skinless conventional vs. regenerative chicken breast meat.\n\nSpecific aim 2: Compare the ability of boneless-skinless chicken breasts grown with these two farming practices to activate mTORC1-specific and whole muscle protein synthesis in an in vitro model of muscle.",
            "detailedDescription": "Indicators of longevity in humans include skeletal muscle mass and strength. Muscle mass depends on the balance between myofibrillar protein synthesis and degradation, influenced by diet and physical activity. Muscle strength correlates with muscle mass, and weight lifting until failure increases muscle protein synthesis, enhancing muscle mass and strength over time. Protein intake is crucial for positive protein balance and muscle growth. Animal proteins promote muscle synthesis more effectively than plant proteins. Limited research exists on the impact of agricultural practices on meat quality. Studies indicate that organic meat may have higher nutritional value and better lipid profiles. This project aims to compare the serum nutrient, hormonal profiles, and muscle protein synthesis rates after consuming isonitrogenous amounts of chicken from conventional versus regenerative/organic practices.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to quantify and compare the serum nutrient and hormonal profile, and muscle protein synthesis rates, in response to consuming isonitrogenous amounts of chicken grown using different agricultural practices (conventional vs. regenerative)\n\nSpecific aim 1: Describe the post-prandial nutrient and hormonal profile in serum in the 3 hours following consumption of 100 grams (\\~32g of protein) of boneless-skinless conventional vs. regenerative chicken breast meat.\n\nSpecific aim 2: Compare the ability of boneless-skinless chicken breasts grown with these two farming practices to activate mTORC1-specific and whole muscle protein synthesis in an in vitro model of muscle.\n\nStudy participant will come to the CTSC Clinical Research Center on two separate occasions.\n\nThe two study visits will be scheduled over a 2-week period (i.e. once per week for 2 weeks), at the same time in the morning following an overnight (\\> 12-hour) fast. The participants will be asked to refrain from vigorous exercise, caffeine, nicotine and alcohol for 24 hours before each visit. Female participants will be asked to schedule their study visits within the first two weeks of their menstrual cycle (starting on the first day of menstrual bleeding), to control for ovarian hormone fluctuations which may impact digestion and metabolism.\n\nUpon arrival at the research center on the first test visit, each participant's height and weight will be measured. Each participant will also fill out a questionnaire regarding physical activity and dietary habits.\n\nI. Baseline blood draw.\n\nParticipants will then be placed in individual testing rooms, equipped with a reclining phlebotomy armchair. A registered nurse or nurse practitioner will insert a 22G catheter in a forearm vein and an initial 5 mL baseline blood sample will be collected.\n\nII. Test meal.\n\nAfter the baseline blood sample is collected, participants will consume one of the two chicken test meals. The meat will be equivalent to an isonitrogenous amount of 20 g of protein:\n\nThe food will be weighed before cooking and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt will be added for palatability. The boneless-skinless chicken breasts will be grilled on an indoor electric grill until the internal temperature reaches 165-170\u00b0F to comply with the USDA Recommendations for Food Safety (Chicken, minimum 165\u00b0F). The internal temperature of the chicken breasts will be determined using a meat thermometer. The chicken will be served to the participants as soon as it has finished cooking. Participants will be asked to consume each boneless-skinless chicken breast without condiments within a 10-minute period and instructed to chew thoroughly. Participants will also be asked to drink a 250 mL glass of water with the meal.\n\nIII. Postprandial blood draws.\n\nFollowing consumption of the test meal, the participants will remain at the research site, in their individual testing room, for another 3 hours, they may bring books or electronic devices to pass the time. Five more blood samples of 5 mL each will be obtained at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the test meal, totaling six blood draws of 5mL per visit (30mL per visit), and 60 mL of blood drawn in total for each subject completing the entire study.\n\nBlood will be collected in 5 mL serum-separating tubes. The blood will be allowed to clot for before centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 minutes. The serum will be frozen and kept at -80\u00b0C until processed. 1 milliliter of each serum sample will be used for determining nutrient and hormone concentrations. The rest of the serum will be used for muscle protein synthesis and mTORC1 bioassay analysis."
