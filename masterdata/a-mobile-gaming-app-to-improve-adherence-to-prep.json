Formative evaluation interviews will be conducted with stakeholders (healthcare workers, clinic administrators, and patients taking PrEP) to inform intervention delivery. Data from the formative interviews will also be used to make necessary adaptations to the game and assess acceptability for diverse populations and clinics. Viral Combat will then be further tested with 200 participants ages 15-34 years, receiving PrEP care at clinical sites in the South (n=100 Jackson, MS) and New England (n=100, Providence, RI; Boston, MA) in a multisite Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial (RCT). This trial will test the efficacy of the intervention compared to a control condition (a non-PrEP related game) on biological and behavioral measures. At the end of the trial, a summative evaluation of the implementation context using the i-PARIHS framework will occur. These interviews with study participants and clinic staff will inform future implementation and dissemination of Viral Combat.",

This trial will test the efficacy of the intervention compared to a control condition (a non-PrEP related game) on biological and behavioral measures. At the end of the trial, a summative evaluation of the implementation context using the i-PARIHS framework will occur. These interviews with study participants and clinic staff will inform future implementation and dissemination of Viral Combat.\n\nAim 1: To conduct formative evaluation interviews, guided by the i-PARHIS framework, with approximately 30 stakeholders (23 PrEP patients, 4 clinical staff, 3 clinic administrators) in order to adapt Viral Combat for diverse PrEP patient populations, and to identify individual, organizational, and structural factors associated with its implementation.\n\nAim 2: To evaluate, in a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial with 200 participants taking PrEP (15-34 years of age), the effectiveness of Viral Combat compared to a control group that receives a non-PrEP related game.\n\nThe investigators will examine the impact of the intervention on:\n\n2a: improving adherence to PrEP using a biological measure (tenofovir from DBS), clinic records, and self-report; 2b: the potential mediators of the intervention, such as knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy, and game metrics.\n\nAim 3: To conduct summative evaluation interviews, following the RCT phase, with an additional 30 stakeholders ((23 PrEP patients, 4 clinical staff, 3 clinic administrators). Interviews will assess and summarize the i-PARIHS constructs relevant to the intervention's future implementation success."
