It is a single arm pilot trial designed to provide information on the ease of use, feasibility, and perceived usefulness of a smartphone application to monitor symptoms and quality of life during cancer treatment, as well as assess barriers to care and perceptions of the smartphone app.\n\nPatients will download the study app onto their personal smartphone, if the phone is compatible with the app, or a study smartphone will be loaned to them. The smartphone app will first ask patients to complete the 15-25 minute baseline survey, followed by one daily brief survey that ask about symptoms, quality of life, and barriers for 75 days. At the end of this period, the smartphone app will prompt the patient to complete a final survey, followed by a brief in-person or telephone interview to assess opinions about the app. Patients' symptoms, treatment effects, medication adherence, pain, quality of life, and general barriers to care will be assessed with questionnaires to measure the impacts of the mobile health-based assessment platform. Results from this study will be for research only and will not impact treatment decisions."
