The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Are peer coaching models effective at promoting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus self-management?\n* If effective, which facets of the peer model are most effective? Peer coaches will\n* Undergo peer coach training.\n* Reach out to peer participants on a weekly/biweekly time frame to discuss self-management and goal setting.\n* Retain records of contact, topics discussed, and general notes on interactions. Researchers will compare differences in the frequency of contact, as well as how peer coaches were matched to peer participants to see if efficacy of the intervention is altered between groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Older Adults using Social Support to Improve Self-Care (OASIS) intervention is an asset-based approach, utilizing the unique social structure existing in Kentucky's rural Appalachian communities to address self-care behaviors as they relate to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) management. The intervention will be composed of two groups: peer coaches who have managed T2DM (HbA1c \\< 7.5%), and peer participants who have unmanaged T2DM (HbA1c\\> 7.5%). Peer coaches will undergo training prior to intervention initiation to develop coaching skills. Peer participants will be linked to a peer coach in one of four ways: (1) self-select coach with contact once a week (2) self-selected coach with contact every 2 weeks (3) matched with peer coach with contact once a week (4) matched with peer coach with contact every 2 weeks. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of a peer coaching model, the four groups will be evaluated allowing for a more detailed understanding of factors that influence self-care behaviors. Stakeholders will also be engaged at three time points: prior to the intervention, study mid-point, and at study conclusion. At study conclusion, a small cohort of both peer participants and peer coaches will be invited to contribute to stakeholder group interviews. Information exchange with stakeholders will aid in developing a robust understanding of influential factors and how to effectively promulgate the intervention."
