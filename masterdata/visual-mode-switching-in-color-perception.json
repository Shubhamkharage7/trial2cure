            "briefSummary": "Participants will be given experience wearing colored lenses that add a tint to the environment. Changes in visual perception and neural processing that arise as a result of this experience will be measured. These are expected as participants learn to switch to \"colored lenses mode\" where the effects of the lenses are discounted and colors appear more normal as soon as the lenses are put on.",
            "detailedDescription": "All participants will wear tinted lenses for 1 hour at a time, 5 times per day. Perception (behavior) and neural function (with functional MRI and EEG) before and after this experience will be measured. In the neural measurements, activity will be recorded while participants view stripes of many different colors both with the lenses on and off. In the perceptual measurements, participants will adjust the color of a small patch to appear neutral, neither red nor green. Behavior will be measured in a variety of conditions to test different hypotheses about the origins of the mode-switching effects. These include: 1) surrounding the patch with different colors, 2) preceding the presentation of the patch with presentation of different colors, 3) presenting the tests in a red-illuminated room, 4) presenting the tests in a completely darkened room, and 5) using a head-mount-display (virtual reality goggles) to present simulated lenses that gradually change in strength."

The investigative team is giving all subjects a treatment- behavioral training in visual mode switching- and measuring effects of that treatment, by comparing measures made before to measures made after the treatment. Thus, this is a within-subjects, repeated measures experimental design. The experimenters have 6 different measurements they are using this design in different groups of subjects run in parallel, all examining different effects of the same treatment. . This is why parallel study model is appropriate. These parallel groups with different measurements, but same treatment, are the arms of the study.",
