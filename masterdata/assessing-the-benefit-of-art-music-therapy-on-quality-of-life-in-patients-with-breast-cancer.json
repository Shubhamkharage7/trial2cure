            "briefSummary": "This is a study of art-based and music-based therapy programs lasting three months (with additional follow-up 3 months after the end of the trial) in breast cancer patients currently receiving therapy as well as in cancer survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "A cancer diagnosis is often associated with adverse psychosocial effects, including: increased stress and anxiety, fatigue and sleep disturbance, impaired memory and cognition, and poor quality of life. Chemotherapy can cause a cognitive decline in up to 75% of patients; an impairment that oftentimes persists beyond completion of the regimen. This is known as \"chemobrain\". Integrative therapies are actively being investigated to help improve psychological wellbeing among cancer patients and survivors.\n\nThe current standard at this institution is to inform patients of different complementary services that are available, including art therapy, music therapy or acupuncture, but not require patients to use them.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomized to one of three arms 1) Art therapy program, 2) Music therapy program, or 3) Standard of care (SOC). In-person and at-home therapy sessions will be scheduled in alternating, weekly sessions, to allow one week of self-reflection and remote therapy between in-person sessions. Each participant will be asked to attend two in-person therapy sessions per month (total of 6).\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a 3-month, therapist-led art or music therapy program to improve quality of life in breast cancer patients currently receiving therapy and in cancer survivors.\n\nSecondary objectives of this study are:\n\nTo determine the effect of these programs on patient cognition in this population.\n\nTo determine the effect of these programs symptoms of anxiety and depression in this population.\n\nTo assess whether the effect of these programs is sustained at a 3-month follow-up."

They will be asked to write a journal entry about the topic discussed. Journal entries can be freely written or a prompt/question can be provided.
