            "detailedDescription": "Care in an emergency department has many benefits. It delivers high-intensity critical care on demand to large populations and serves as an efficient gateway to hospitalization. However, some populations may not be well-served by the traditional emergency department, particularly older adults, adults with serious illness, and those who are homebound. Many harms may come to older adults in the emergency department, including delirium, pressure injuries, infections, anxiety, and others. Emergency department crowding secondary to hospital capacity constraints may also lead to suboptimal care, as patients wait many hours for their inpatient bed even after a disposition decision is made.\n\nAs a result, the investigators will evaluate in a randomized controlled trial the efficacy of emergency care delivered at home instead of in the emergency department"
