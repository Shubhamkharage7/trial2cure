Control (no dog) patients will have an active control where they color for 3 minutes before their dental exam, cleaning, and simulated radiographs, without a dog present. Biometric data will be collected with a small wireless wrist device (Shimmer 3) which measures heart rate and sweat response (skin galvanic response). Salivary samples will be taken before and after the dental visit to measure salivary cortisol and amylase, as a metric of physiological stress. Finally, a video feed of body movements during the dental visit will be collected for observational coding. Pre-visit and post-visit surveys will be given to all the patients on their experiences regarding pain, anxiety, and perceptions of the dental experience."
