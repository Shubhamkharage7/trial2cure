Patient-level data are submitted by participating hospitals to The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and American College of Cardiology Foundation's (ACCF) joint TVT Registry. The purposes of the TVT Registry include: (i) collecting pertinent and standardized data elements from participating hospitals, health care providers and others that measure and assess the quality of care for patients receiving TVT; (ii) providing confidential periodic reports to participating hospitals, health care providers and others, to evaluate and improve the quality of care in these areas; and (iii) permitting and fostering appropriate research based upon the data collected by means of the TVT Registry.\n\nThe secondary aim of the TVT Registry is to serve as a scalable data infrastructure forpost market studies."
