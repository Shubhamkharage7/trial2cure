            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to conduct a Phase I - II clinical trial to extend preclinical studies involving in situ HSV-tk + Valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer. This will provide a novel therapeutic approach to prostate cancer and hopefully impact on the development of metastatic disease and the control of preexisting metastasis.",
            "detailedDescription": "This investigational new drug application describes a proposed phase I/II study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AdV-tk gene therapy in combination with standard brachytherapy for patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after having failed radiation as a primary treatment with or without minimal metastasis. These patients do not have any standard treatment that has been demonstrated to have a high degree of efficacy in eradicating the tumor with a reasonable degree of safety. Thus, the potential risks associated with the use of gene therapy in this group would appear reasonable. This application is for use of a replication defective adenovirus vector (ADV/RSV-tk) delivering the HSV-tk gene as a biologic vector for gene therapy.\n\nDirect introduction of therapeutic genes into malignant cells in vivo may provide an effective treatment of solid tumors such as prostate cancer. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene codes for an enzyme which phosphorylates the nucleoside analog ganciclovir (GCV) into an intermediate that is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and terminates further replication, leading to cell death. Since normal mammalian cells do not possess this enzyme, cytotoxicity depends on the successful introduction and expression of the HSV-tk gene, phosphorylation of ganciclovir and synthesis of DNA. Non-dividing cells may express HSV-tk and phosphorylate ganciclovir but are not harmed since they do not synthesize DNA. This approach is especially suitable for the treatment of tumors where rapidly dividing tumor cells are adjacent to tissues made up largely of non-proliferating cells. Using human and animal models for prostate cancer we have demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated transfer of the HSV-tk gene resulted in sensitivity to ganciclovir in vitro and growth suppression of mouse prostate cancer in vivo."

The gene is called the thymidine kinase (tk) gene, which the cell uses to make a protein that can change valacyclovir, The way the tk gene will be transported into the tumor cells is by using a vector or \"vehicle\" to carry the tk gene into the cells. In this case the vector is a virus - an adenovirus. Scientists at the Department of Cell and Gene Therapy at The Methodist Hospital removed a portion of the adenovirus' genetic material that allows it to replicate so that it cannot cause infections. In place of the removed genetic material the scientists inserted the tk gene. Now the vector can carry the tk gene into tumor cells. When the vector/gene combination gets into tumor cells, it inserts itself into the cells' command center (nucleus) and tells the tumor cells to begin making thymidine kinase protein.",
