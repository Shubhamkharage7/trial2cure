The investigators hypothesize that HZ/su administration will be non-inferior to placebo with respect to the risk of moderate or severe SLE flare(s) occurring within 24 weeks of receiving the first dose of the assigned treatment. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that immunogenicity of the vaccine in SLE patients will be at least 50% of levels observed in healthy subjects from prior large clinical trials."
