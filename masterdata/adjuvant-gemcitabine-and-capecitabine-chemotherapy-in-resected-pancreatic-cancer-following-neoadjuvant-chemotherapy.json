This study will help the study doctors find out if this different approach is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach. To decide if it is better, the study doctors will be looking to see if the study approach increases the lifespan of patients compared to the usual approach. There will be two arms of the study. Arm one will receive treatment with gemcitabine and capecitabine every 28 days for 6 cycles. Arm two be will receive standard of care observation. Participants will be asked to undergo imaging (e.g., CT) and laboratory testing to monitor for disease recurrence. The time in the study will be for 30 months."
