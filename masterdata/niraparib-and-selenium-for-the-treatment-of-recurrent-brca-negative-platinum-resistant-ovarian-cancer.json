            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of a combination therapy (niraparib and selenium) in treating patients with BRCA negative ovarian cancer that has come back (recurrent) and does not respond to platinum based therapy (platinum resistant). Selenium is a form of the trace element with potential antineoplastic activity which may help block the formation of growths that may become cancer. Niraparib is in a class of medications called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. It works by killing cancer cells and helps maintain the response of certain types of ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers. Giving selenium and niraparib may kill more cells in patients with ovarian cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of administering niraparib/selenium combination therapy. (Phase I) II. To determine the anti-tumor activity of niraparib/selenium combination therapy, as assessed by median progression-free survival (PFS). (Phase II) III. To evaluate the tolerability of the combination therapy as assessed by a reduction in nausea, fatigue over historical rates. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of treatment on quality of life over time, as evaluated by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) scores. (Phase I and Phase II) II. To estimate overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), response duration and time to progression (TTP). (Phase I and Phase II)\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the molecular effects of selenium/niraparib combination therapy in ovarian tumors, as assessed by (Phase I and Phase II):\n\nIa. Changes in RAD51 foci formation which is a surrogate marker to examine homologous recombination by looking at tumor tissue prior to study and after 2 months of study therapy; Ib. By DNA full exome and RNA sequencing of tumors, protein profiling, prior to study and after 2 months of study therapy; Ic. Changes in RAD51AP1 expression in tumor tissue by Western blot prior to study and after 2 months of study therapy; Id. Changes in the endosomal vesicles (EV) markers in the urine, vaginal secretions, malignant effusions and plasma.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of niraparib and selenium followed by a dose-expansion study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 phases.\n\nPatients receive selenium intravenously (IV) and niraparib orally (PO) on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biopsy, and collection of blood samples throughout the trial."

Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (90 days) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, or any psychiatric order that prohibits obtaining informed consent\n* Known history of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection\n* Other active malignancy\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Major surgery (other than debulking or exploratory surgery for ovarian cancer) for any reason within 3 weeks prior to randomization and/or incomplete recovery from surgery\n* Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem cell transplantation\n* Diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)\n* Known leptomeningeal disease, carcinomatous meningitis, or radiologic signs of CNS hemorrhage. Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids. Patients with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to study enrollment, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 4 weeks and are neurologically stable\n* Active infections\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension as defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) \\>= 160mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \\>= 90mmHg; patients whose blood pressure can be controlled medically are allowed to be rescreened once BP is under control\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
