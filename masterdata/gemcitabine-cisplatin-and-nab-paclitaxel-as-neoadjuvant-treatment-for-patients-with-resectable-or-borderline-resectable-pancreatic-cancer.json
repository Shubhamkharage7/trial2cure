            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well gemcitabine, cisplatin and nab-paclitaxel given before surgery (neoadjuvant) works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery (resectable) or that is borderline resectable. The standard treatment for resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to improve overall survival compared to patients receiving surgery first. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill tumor cells. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, an antimicrotubule agent that stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Nab-paclitaxel may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel. Gemcitabine, cisplatin and nab-paclitaxel may be an effective neoadjuvant treatment option for patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the major pathological response rate, feasibility and safety of biweekly gemcitabine, cisplatin and nab-paclitaxel (GCN) in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine if neoadjuvant GCN increases tumoral infiltration of lymphocytes with local and systemic phenotypic features that assist in the antitumor immune response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, cisplatin IV over 60 minutes, and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease, partial or complete response undergo surgical resection per standard of care. Additionally, patients undergo biopsy on study and undergo blood sample collection and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at pre-study and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for up to 24 months."
