Pediatric candidates with severe isolated left ventricular or biventricular dysfunction who are candidates for cardiac transplant and require circulatory support may be treated using the EXCOR Pediatric.\n\nEXCOR Active is intended for use in a clinical setting. EXCOR Active can be used in any kind of hospital unit (e.g. OR, ICU, intermediate care unit or general care unit). The driving unit may be moved between clinical units using the caddy or baby buggy; however, a patient must always be accompanied by a person trained in the use of the manual pump and emergency procedures during transport in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe driving unit can be transported during operation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective study of subjects implanted with the EXCOR Pediatric VAD supported by the EXCOR Active Driving System and patients recently implanted with EXCOR Pediatric supported on the Ikus Driving Unit as reported in the ACTION Registry database.\n\nChildren who are transplant eligible in need of mechanical circulatory support and are supported with the EXCOR\u00ae Pediatric VAD will be included in this study. All patients must meet the indications and contraindication as indicated in the device labelling. There are no known additional indications or contraindications associated with the EXCOR\u00ae Active Driving System beyond those already established in the EXCOR\u00ae Pediatric VAD labeling.\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate device performance and monitor safety and effectiveness of the Berlin Heart EXCOR\u00ae Active Driving System while being used with the approved EXCOR\u00ae Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device."
