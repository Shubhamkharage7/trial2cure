            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will be testing a pharmacist-led model of PrEP delivery combined with mobile app-based PrEP support developed by the investigator's team to improve PrEP initiation and persistence. Alto Pharmacy is a full-service online pharmacy already using mobile and web apps to communicate with patients, providers, laboratories, and insurers to provide timely medication delivery. Alto can provide PrEP prescriptions, order laboratory tests, and perform clinical referrals through a collaborative practice agreement (CPA) with SFDPH that allows transfer of these responsibilities. The investigators have integrated online tools with Alto Pharmacy's technology platform to create PrEP-3D: Digital Diary and Delivery, combining a tailored online support tool with the personalized service of a community pharmacy and the convenience of medication delivery. By removing the requirement for initiation and quarterly visits with a primary care physician for PrEP, the PrEP-3D model will expand access to PrEP visits (including for persons who choose not to go to their primary care provider for PrEP) and reduce burden on the health care system."
