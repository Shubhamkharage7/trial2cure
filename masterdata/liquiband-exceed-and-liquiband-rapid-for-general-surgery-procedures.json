            "detailedDescription": "LiquiBand\u00ae Exceed\u2122 and LiquiBand\u00ae Rapid\u2122 are the \"study\" devices. The study devices are an adhesive used to close surgical wounds. When the adhesive is applied to the skin, it polymerizes (forms a chemical bond) within minutes due to the moisture on the skin's surface and allows the wound edges to remain in the correct position. The use of the study devices are not \"investigational\" (experimental) because it is already cleared for doctors to use for surgical wound closure in the United States of America.\n\nIn this study, LiquiBand\u00ae Exceed\u2122 and LiquiBand\u00ae Rapid\u2122 will be used to close surgical wounds following general abdominal surgery. Subjects will be followed up for 14-days post surgery, and safety and performance of the study device will be evaluated."
