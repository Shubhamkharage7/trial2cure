Usual Care plus advice to weigh daily on simple scale\n3.

            "detailedDescription": "Obesity is a major public health issue because of its high prevalence and many health consequences. Obesity is driven by a dysregulation of the body's energy regulatory systems and is life-shortening. Obesity during the critical adolescent period increases risk of diabetes, cardiometabolic disease, all-cause mortality, and adulthood obesity. Rates of obesity-related cancers are increasing in younger populations. In addition to poorer health, individuals with obesity during adolescence are at risk for lower productivity, income, and likelihood of employment in adulthood, making obesity treatment and prevention important for reducing disparities. Despite consensus on the need for multi-component interventions for obesity, rates continue to climb for adolescents, youth of low-income backgrounds, and youth of racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Clinicians cite lack of time and tools to help patients lose weight as barriers to weight counseling, and thus need practical, effective interventions they can feasibly disseminate from a busy clinical setting.\n\nSelf-weighing, grounded in behavior change theory, is effective for weight loss in adults. Self-monitoring is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), which describes behavior change as happening with reciprocal interactions with one's environment, creating external and internal self-reinforcement. Self-monitoring is one such interaction that improves self-awareness through proximate self-measurement, and improves self-efficacy, self-control, and self-reinforcement. Self-weighing (SW) is a form of self-monitoring for weight loss that is grounded in SCT. Daily SW in adults has been associated with increased exercise and cognitive restraint, and reduced snacking, television watching, and consumption of sweets.\n\nThe investigator found no data on patient and parent perspectives on connecting scales to the EHR for daily weights in adolescents with obesity seeking obesity treatment.\n\n99 patients age 12 to \\<18 years old with obesity (BMI \\>/=95th percentile), to be randomized to one of three treatment interventions:\n\n1. Usual Care\n2. Usual Care plus advice to weigh daily on simple scale\n3. Usual Care plus advice to weigh-daily on an EHR-connected scale\n\nSurvey data collected at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 12-weeks, and qualitative interviews at 12 weeks, will assess acceptability, safety, self-efficacy, and BMI.
