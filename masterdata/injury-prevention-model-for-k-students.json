The Teddy Bear Injury Clinic (TBIC) is a unique modification of the teddy bear clinic to facilitate classroom injury prevention teaching\n\nThe TBIC will be administered to K-1 students, aged 5-7 years. Initial analysis will be descriptive and qualitative. Subsequent randomization of students to test and control groups followed by statistical analysis will be done to evaluate for effectiveness of the educational model",
            "detailedDescription": "The TBIC is a 40minute educational intervention divided into two sections with the first section consisting of classroom teaching with two safety messages each for four safety topics and the second section being that of students acting as caregivers for their teddy bears, using role-play for the messages taught.\n\nQualitative data collection will be initially done in an inductive manner and qualitative content analysis done using the directed method to analyze effectiveness and appropriateness of the TBIC for a pilot group.\n\nControlled trial will consist of randomizing students to either the TBIC group or the control group which will receive an alternate teddy bear clinic for non trauma related hospital education. Pre and post questionnaires will be administered to evaluate the efficacy of the TBIC.\n\nStatistical analysis will be done using the Wilcoxon signed test rank score for the Likert scale based evaluations generated."
