OCT systems are optical imaging technology that allow non-contact imaging of the microanatomy of the retina, cornea, optic nerve head and retinal blood vessels. The MIOCT has been integrated into the surgical microscope used in retinal and anterior segment surgeries so it does not touch the eye. Unlike visible light from many examination devices, the infrared OCT beam is barely visible to the human eye as it sweeps across the retina. Thus the patient is not disturbed by the light.",
