            "detailedDescription": "Based on preclinical data from Ciorba Lab (WUSM) the investigators hypothesize that \"SCRT is a foundational regimen to examine adjunctive immunotherapy in LARC and that inhibition of IDO1 mediated tryptophan metabolism will safely improve anti-tumor immunity and therapeutic response to SCRT based therapy.\" In this multi-center phase II clinical trial, first 20 patients will be randomized to either Treatment Cohort or Biomarker Cohort. Patients on Biomarker Cohort will undergo standard SCRT and CAPOX chemotherapy, and provide research biopsies before and after SCRT, and at the time of surgery. Patients on Treatment Cohort will receive epacadostat 400mg twice daily, along with standard SCRT and CAPOX chemotherapy. After the first 20 patients, additional patients will be enrolled to Treatment Cohort until 27 patients who are evaluable for the primary endpoint are enrolled. Patients will be assessed for clinical outcomes including response to therapy as measured by neoadjuvant rectal score (NAR score), local and distant control of their disease, toxicities and survival. Up to 37 evaluable patients (27 patients in treatment cohort and 10 patients in biomarker cohort) of any gender, race, or ethnicity with locally advanced rectal cancer will be included in this clinical trial. Tumor and blood samples will be collected for analyses to determine factors that underlie treatment response or resistance."

Patients who go off warfarin and have INR within normal limits have no washout period.\n* Any history of serotonin syndrome (SS) after receiving serotonergic drugs. This syndrome has been most closely associated with the use of MAOIs, meriperidine, linezolid, or methylene blue; all of these agents are prohibited during the study\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Has an active or inactive autoimmune disease or syndrome (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, moderate or severe psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease) that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years or is receiving systemic therapy for an autoimmune or inflammatory disease (i.e. with use of modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Exceptions include subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy, hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement, controlled asthma, Type I diabetes, Graves' disease, or Hashimoto's disease.\n* An abnormal screening ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically meaningful.\n* Presence of a gastrointestinal condition that may affect drug absorption.\n* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study treatment. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of cycle 1 day 1.\n* Evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis including symptomatic and/or pneumonitis requiring treatment\n* Known presence of active TB.\n* Known active hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactive or HBV DNA detected) or hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection. Testing at screening is required (Serology testing with HBsAg, HBsAb, and HCV Ab are required; HBV DNA or HCV RNA are only required in the setting of serology tests compatible with possible active infection.).\n* Known microsatellite instability- high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient rectal cancer.",
