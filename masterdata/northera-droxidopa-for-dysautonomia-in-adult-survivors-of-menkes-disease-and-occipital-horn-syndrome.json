The outcomes and information from this study may help adult survivors of Menkes disease and individuals with OHS lead more normal day-to-day lives.",
            "detailedDescription": "This pilot clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, dosing, and preliminary efficacy of Northera (Droxidopa) treatment in young adults who survived the major neurodegenerative and neurocognitive effects of Menkes disease through early Copper Histidinate treatment. We hypothesize that Northera (Droxidopa) in Menkes disease survivors with symptoms of dysautonomia (e.g., syncope, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, abnormal sinoatrial conduction, nocturnal bradycardia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction) from persistent deficiency of the copper-dependent enzyme, dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase, will be safe, and correct or improve blood neurochemical levels, raise systolic blood pressure, and produce symptomatic improvement and better overall quality of life. We will test this hypothesis in six to ten Menkes disease survivors or OHS patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover clinical trial."
