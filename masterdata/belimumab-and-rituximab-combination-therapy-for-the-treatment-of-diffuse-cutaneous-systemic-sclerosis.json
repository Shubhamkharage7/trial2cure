            "briefSummary": "This is a 52 week, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\n\nAfter patients maintain a stable dose of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) for at least 1 month, they will be randomized to treatment with either Belimumab \\& Rituximab or placebo.Patients in both groups will be on background MMF for the entirety of the study. Belimumab will be administered subcutaneously and Rituximab intravenously. Placebo injections and infusions will be of normal saline. Randomization will be done in a 2:1 manner to favor the treatment group. It is hypothesized that that Rituximab and Belimumab combination therapy with Mycophenolate Mofetil background therapy will improve fibrosis in SSc skin when compared to treatment with placebo and Mycophenolate Mofetil in a group of patients with early dcSSc.",
            "detailedDescription": "The specific objectives of this study are to:\n\n1. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is safe and tolerable in the treatment of patients with early diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc when compared to patients treated with placebo/placebo/mmf, as assessed by comparison of adverse and serious adverse effects. In this study stand of care will be protocolized as mycophenolate mofetil.\n2. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is more effective than placebo/placebo/mmf, as measured by change in CRISS, which is a composite outcome measure provisionally endorsed by the ACR for scleroderma clinical trials. It incorporates change in the mRSS, FVC percent predicted, physician and patient global assessments, and HAQ-DI. Additionally, hemoglobin corrected diffusion capacity (DLCO), Medsger Severity Scale (MSS), and by other physician and patient derived outcome measures will be used.\n3. Determine the biological activity of rituximab/belimumab/mmf vs placebo/placebo/mmf as assessed by effect on histology of skin, gene expression of skin and blood, change in B-Cell profiles including assessment of B regulatory cells, and effect on serological and cutaneous biomarkers of disease activity."

The scale consists of eight domains relating to gastroesophageal reflux (13 items), disrupted swallowing (7 items), diarrhea (5 items), bowel incontinence/soilage (4 items), nausea and vomiting (4 items), constipation (9 items), belly pain (6 items), and gas/bloat/flatulence (12 items). The scales correlated significantly with both generic and disease-targeted legacy instruments, and demonstrate evidence of reliability.",

Diagnosis of dcSSc, as defined by LeRoy and Medsger.\n4. Disease duration of less than or equal to 3 years as defined by the date of onset of the first non-Raynaud's symptom.\n5.

Disease duration of greater than 3 years.\n3. Patients with mixed connective tissue disease or \"overlap\" unless the dominant features of the illness are diffuse systemic sclerosis.\n4. Limited scleroderma.\n5. Systemic sclerosis-like illness associated with environmental or ingested agents such as toxic rapeseed oil, vinyl chloride, or bleomycin.\n6. The use of other anti-fibrotic agents including colchicine, D-penicillamine, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (nilotinib, imatinib, dasatinib) in the month prior to enrollment.\n7. Use in the prior month of corticosteroids at doses exceeding the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg daily. Use of corticosteroid at \\< 10 mg of prednisone can continue during the course of the study.\n8. Concurrent serious medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient inappropriate for this study such as uncontrollable CHF, arrhythmia, severe pulmonary or systemic hypertension, severe GI involvement, hepatic impairment, serum creatinine of greater than 2.0, active infection, severe diabetes, unstable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, malignancy, HIV, or severe peripheral vascular disease.\n9. A positive pregnancy test at entry into this study.
