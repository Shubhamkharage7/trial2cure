            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether cabozantinib and atezolizumab work to shrink tumors in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer that had spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and atezolizumab may kill more tumor cells in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the disease control rate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with non-measurable disease as assessed by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nII. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination as measured by PSA 50% response rate.\n\nIII. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination as measured by radiographic progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nIV. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination as measured by overall survival (OS).\n\nV. To evaluate the safety of cabozantinib S-malate (cabozantinib) in combination with atezolizumab in patients with mCRPC with non-measurable disease.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To analyze tissue and tumor-based biomarkers to evaluate the mechanisms of treatment activity and resistance.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months until disease progression or start of another therapy."

Note: Complete healing of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before first dose of study treatment\n  * Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures (e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medication, \\[subjects may not receive the drug through a feeding tube\\], social/ psychological issues, etc.)\n* Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis of \\> 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of red blood, or other history of significant bleeding (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose of study treatment\n* Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease manifestation\n* Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels\n* Any active or history of known or suspected autoimmune disease as determined to be clinically significant by treating investigator's clinical judgement will be excluded , including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sjogren syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or multiple sclerosis (see Appendix for a more comprehensive list of autoimmune diseases and immune deficiencies), with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are an insulin regimen\n  * Autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are on thyroid replacement hormone\n  * Skin disorders (e.g., vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment\n  * Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are eligible for the study provided all of following conditions are met:\n\n    * Rash must cover \\< 10% of body surface area\n    * Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low potency topical corticosteroids\n    * No occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months\n  * Conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger\n* Any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days before first dose of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after Principal Investigator confirmation has been obtained\n  * Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study\n  * Note: Inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, or topical steroids are permitted. Adrenal replacement steroid doses \\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted. Transient short-term use of systemic corticosteroids for allergic conditions (e.g., contrast allergy) is also allowed\n* Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia\n* Any active infection requiring systemic treatment.
