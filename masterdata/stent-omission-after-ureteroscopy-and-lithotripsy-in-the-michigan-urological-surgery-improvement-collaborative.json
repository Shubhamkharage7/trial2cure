This hypothesis will be evaluated separately in the randomized and observational cohorts.\n* Unplanned healthcare utilization in the treatment arms will have different unplanned healthcare utilization ranks leading to a win proportion significantly higher or lower than 0.5 in the stent omission arm compared to the stent placement arm. This hypothesis will be evaluated separately in the randomized and observational cohorts.",
