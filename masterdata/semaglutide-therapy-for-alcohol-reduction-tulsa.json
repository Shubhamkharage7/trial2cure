Participants will complete a remote phone screening and an on-site screening visit to determine study eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of either semaglutide or a placebo (1:1 ratio). Doses will be titrated according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule starting at a dose of 0.25 mg/week for four weeks, then 0.5 mg/week for four weeks, and finally the dose will be increased to 1.0 mg/week for four weeks, for a total of 12 weeks of treatment. Participants will be asked to complete experimental procedures at the baseline and endpoint visits (Week 1 and Week 12), which include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiments, and virtual reality experiments. Participants will also complete questionnaires, biospecimen collections, and computer-based behavioral therapy modules at various study timepoints. Participants will periodically meet with a study physician and will be monitored for any adverse events. A remote follow-up assessment will take place 9 weeks after the participant's last dosing visit."
