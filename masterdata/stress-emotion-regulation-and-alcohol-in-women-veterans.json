Additionally, the study looks at whether a woman's use of emotion regulation techniques changes the association between stress or negative emotion and behavior. Lastly, the study examines how women's reactions to stress, and the effects of stress, vary across the menstrual cycle - depending on the level of circulating hormones.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aims for the current study are two-fold: 1. conduct a randomized trial testing the effects of an emotion regulation skill (cognitive reappraisal) on stress-induced drinking among women with alcohol misuse and varying levels of co-occurring PTSD; 2. examine whether progesterone levels and/or severity of co-occurring PTSD - factors which impact women's stress reactivity and emotion regulation - moderate the effectiveness of the cognitive reappraisal in reducing stress-induced drinking.\n\nThe proposed study will combine experimental, in-person sessions with daily self-report data from the Veterans to assess the effect of cognitive reappraisal on alcohol craving, cognitive (inhibitory) control, physiological arousal (HRV), and alcohol use. Participation will take place across a period of at least 35 days, to encompass an entire menstrual cycle. All participants complete all sections of the study - the experimental sessions and the longitudinal (35-day) data collection."
