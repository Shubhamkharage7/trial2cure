This objective includes sub-studies to assess radiotracer distribution in the lung, the reproducibility of PET scans and the relationship of the scan to distribution of inflammatory cells in human lung tissue. The overall goal is to assess the potential of the radiotracer to track inflammatory cells in lung diseases.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single site, pilot Phase 0/1 clinical trial to establish the uptake of Cu-DOTA-ECL1i in additional patients with ILD fibrotic lung disease (n=60). Healthy volunteers without known pulmonary disease will be recruited as controls (N=5). All subjects will be recruited and undergo one dynamic PET/CT scan to characterize the lung uptake of Cu-DOTA-ECL1i. Among those with pulmonary fibrosis imaging, an arterial catheter will be placed for blood draws in n=10 subjects, an additional sub group of subjects (n=10) will undergo a second PET/CT within two months. A third subgroup of subjects (n=10) who undergo lung transplant will have analysis of CCR2+ cells in their explanted lungs."
