In addition, this study will evaluate the safety of administering an initial or additional dose or bivalent booster of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to individuals experiencing an adverse reaction to a natural COVID-19 infection (\"long COVID\").\n\nEligible participants enrolled in this trial will receive an initial or additional dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. Participants will also be required to have 1-2 in person visits along with phone call follow up visits.\n\nWe hypothesize that individuals who have had adverse reactions to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will tolerate an additional dose of the primary mRNA vaccine or bivalent booster, as indicated, and those with a personal history of allergic reaction will tolerate an initial dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. We also hypothesize that those individuals experiencing an adverse reaction will tolerate an initial or additional dose of a primary mRNA COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, as indicated.\n\nThe study hypothesizes that individuals that have had adverse reactions to a dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will tolerate an additional dose and those with a personal history of allergic reaction will tolerate vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine."
