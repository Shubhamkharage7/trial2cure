            "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a combination of study drugs including zimberelimab, etrumadenant, and quemliclustat in combination with metastasis-directed irradiation in men with hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer.\n\nThe study aims to test the hypothesis that targeted inhibition of the adenosine signaling axis (quemliclustat (CD73 antagonist) + etrumadenant (A2AR/A2BR antagonist)) and immune checkpoint inhibition (zimberelimab, \u03b1-PD-1) in combination with metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) will improve local control, progression-free survival (PFS), and hormone therapy-free survival and mitigate immunosuppressive changes to the tumor microenvironment (TME), compared to SBRT alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "The optimal therapeutic approach to men with oligometastatic (1-3 or 1-5 sites of metastatic disease) prostate cancer is ever more important as advanced imaging technologies are becoming standard of care, providing clinicians with the tools to accurately diagnose and localize oligometastatic prostate cancer. Hence, methods to improve the local curative potential of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a timely and important opportunity. In addition, previous data suggest that the adenosine A2A pathway may be a particularly attractive avenue for intervention in the context of radiation, thus influencing multiple suppressive populations within the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n\nImmunotherapy based on the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis is a mainstay of therapy across multiple types of malignancies. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a PD-1 inhibitor (zimberelimab) in combination with a selective dual antagonist of A2aR and A2bR (etrumadenant) and an anti-CD73 (quemliclustat). Immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted inhibitors of the adenosine signaling axis modulate the TME and aspects of the systemic immune system to overcome tumor-induced immune suppression and improve responses to therapy.\n\nThis study aims to determine the effect of etrumadenant, quemliclustat and zimberelimab \\[experimental\\] when given with ablative radiation (SBRT)\\[standard of care\\] on the oligoprogressive disease (hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer), defined by being free from radiographic progression of irradiated target metastases and PSA (prostate surface antigen) response at 6 months. PSA response, local control, progression-free survival (PFS), treatment response, ADT-free survival, time-to-pain, and safety and tolerability will also be measured. By employing a Simon Two-Stage design, the trial will test whether or not etrumadenant + quemliclustat and zimberelimab combined with ablative radiation (SBRT) will improve PFS compared to SBRT alone (ORIOLE)."

Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are required to use highly effective contraceptive measures which include condom use. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy. A female partner of is considered a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile.\n\n    * Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\n    * A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.\n\n    Highly effective contraceptive measures include:\n    * Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, transdermal\n    * Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, implantable\n    * Intrauterine device\n    * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system\n    * Surgical sterilization\n    * The male participant is vasectomized (with documented medical confirmation of surgical success) and is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP participant\n    * Female partner of the male participant has undergone bilateral tubal ligation\n    * Complete sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with study treatment.

The ADT could not exceed 3-years in duration and must have occurred greater than 6 months before time of enrollment.\n2.

Spinal cord compression or impending spinal cord compression.\n4. Pulmonary and/or liver metastases \\> 1.0cm in largest dimension.\n5. History of malignancy other than prostate cancer within 2 years prior to screening, except for malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS rate \\> 90%), such as nonmelanoma skin carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ.\n6.

Positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at screening. Patients can be eligible if positive total HBcAb test followed by a negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA test at screening. The HBV test will be performed only for participants who have a positive total HBcAb test. Due to safety concerns related to viral activation, development of a secondary malignancy, as well as the potential for increased treatment-related toxicity, eligible participants must not have evidence of chronic viral infection at screening.\n14. Due to the potential risk for drug-drug interactions with etrumadenant, participants must not have had:\n\n    1. Oral treatment with strong inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (e.g., cyclosporin A, eltrombopag) or BRCP substrates with a narrow therapeutic window, administered orally (e.g., prazosin, rosuvastatin) within 4 weeks or 5 drug-elimination half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.\n    2.
