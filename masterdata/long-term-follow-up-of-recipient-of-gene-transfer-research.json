            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to collect information about the long-term safety of gene transfer therapy. This study is also designed to create a database of medical information about patients who have received gene transfer therapy, in order for researchers to track and review the long-term safety and any effects (good or bad) of gene transfer therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Procedures for Years 1-5:\n\nIf you agree to take part in this study, you will come to the clinic for study visits once a year during Years 1-5. It is your choice whether to visit your regular local doctor or your study doctor at MD Anderson. (If you visit your regular local doctor, you will need to have your test results and blood samples mailed to the study staff.) You will receive a reminder phone call once a year, when it is time to schedule these visits.\n\nAt these visits, the following procedures will be performed:\n\n* Blood (about 2-4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).\n* You will fill out a questionnaire that asks about your medical history (your general health, the status of any medical conditions, and any illnesses or hospitalizations that may have occurred). It should take about 15-30 minutes to complete.\n* You will be asked if there have been any changes in your contact information.\n* If necessary to check the status of the disease, you will have scans (x-rays and/or computed tomography \\[CT\\] scans) and/or additional routine blood tests (about 1-2 tablespoons).\n\nStudy Procedures for Years 6-15:\n\nOnce a year during Years 6-15, the research staff will contact you. Either over the phone, by email, or by mail (but usually by mail, with an enclosed questionnaire), you will be asked about your medical history (including if you have had any children since the infusion) and whether there have been any changes in your contact information. The phone calls and questionnaires should take about 15-30 minutes each time.\n\nResults of Study Testing:\n\nIf any of the tests that are performed in this study suggest that you may have a medical condition and/or side effect that is likely to be related to the gene transfer therapy, the study doctor will contact you. You will receive a referral in case you would like to seek medical care for the condition and/or side effect.\n\nYou and/or your insurance provider will be responsible for the costs of any CT scans and x-rays that may be needed for this study.\n\nStudy Database:\n\nYour medical information that is collected for this study will be stored in a research database at MD Anderson for use in future research related to the safety and effects of gene transfer therapy.\n\nYour data will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to your data. Only the researcher or authorized personnel in charge of the database will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the data to you. This is to allow medical information related to your data to be updated as needed. Other researchers using your data will not be able to link this data to you.\n\nChanges in Parent/Guardian Contact:\n\nIf you are younger than 18 years old when joining this study but turn 18 during this study, starting then, the research staff will contact you directly for this study instead of your parent/guardian. However, if you would prefer for your parent/guardian to still be the main contact person, please tell the study staff.\n\nLength of Study Participation:\n\nAfter 15 years, your participation in this study will be over unless the FDA decides that follow-up must continue.\n\nThis is an investigational study.\n\nUp to 130 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
