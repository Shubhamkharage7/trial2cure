We will also examine preliminary, within-group effects on social participation. The findings of this study will inform a larger trial to examine intervention efficacy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Social isolation has been shown to negatively affect physical and mental health, particularly among people with disabilities. Social isolation among people with disabilities has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even now, people with disabilities remain hesitant to return to social and community activities due to ongoing risk of severe cases and death. Yet, we do not have strong models of intervention designed to address this problem.\n\nENGAGE is an intervention that may address this gap. ENGAGE was designed to address social and community participation among people with stroke. We have since conducted qualitative research to inform adaptation of ENGAGE to meet the needs of a broader range of people with disabilities related to participation in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This study is the next step in testing and refining the adapted intervention protocol. At the end of this study, we will have a finalized adapted intervention protocol ready for large-scale efficacy testing."
