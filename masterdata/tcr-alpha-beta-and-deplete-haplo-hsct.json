Reagents and supplies are to be used for research only but are manufactured and tested under a quality system certified to ISO 13485. Should CD34 selection be required to augment stem cell dose, Miltenyi Biotec's CliniMACS\u00ae Plus CD34 Reagent System is FDA approved as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). The approved indication was the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing myeloablative transplant from matched related allogeneic donors.
