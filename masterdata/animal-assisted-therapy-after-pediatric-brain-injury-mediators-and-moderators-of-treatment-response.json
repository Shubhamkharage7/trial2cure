A within subject crossover design will be used to determine whether involving dogs in physical and occupational therapies while receiving inpatient rehabilitation improves patient engagement, how involving dogs improves engagement, and identify who is most likely to benefit. This project addresses the critical need to establish an evidence base for animal-assisted therapies in pediatric rehabilitation, incorporates innovative methods, and has the potential to lead to improved clinical care for children and adolescents receiving intensive rehabilitation following ABI."
