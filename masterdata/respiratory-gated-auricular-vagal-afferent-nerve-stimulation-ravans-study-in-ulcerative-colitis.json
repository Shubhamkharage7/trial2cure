The goal of the study is to distinguish sham (no stimulation) versus treatment (stimulation) response and to identify treatment responders. The study will last 12 weeks with in-clinic visits at 0 weeks and 12 weeks, and a telehealth-visit at week 6. Additionally, unscheduled visits may occur based on the needs of the subject or at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to treatment or sham, and will stimulate at home twice per day."
