CAR.B7-H3T cells treatment has not been tested in humans and is not an approved treatment by the Food and Drug Administration for glioblastoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1, single center, open-label study aims to determine the safety of escalating doses of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) cells targeting the B7-H3 antigen administered via intraventricular infusion to adult subjects with relapsed or refractory glioblastoma (GBM).\n\nSubjects with GBM who meet procurement eligibility criteria will have cells collected following their initial surgical resection to manufacture CAR.B7-H3T cells, preferably prior to initiation of adjuvant chemoradiation.\n\nAt the time that the subjects have confirmed refractory or recurrent GBM, CAR.B7-H3T cells will be manufactured for subjects who likely to be eligible for cell infusion.\n\nEligible subjects will receive up to 3 weekly infusions of CAR.B7-H3 cells. To receive the additional cycles of CAR.B7-H3 cells, all treatment-related toxicities must have resolved to grade \\< 3, the subject must not have experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the subject must not have progressive disease that has been confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging per Immunotherapy response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria.\n\nThe data from the dose escalation will be used to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), which will be decided on based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and additional factors such as the feasibility of administering infusions."
