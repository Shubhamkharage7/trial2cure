This evaluation will be used to customize the patient exercise program. The exercise program consists of small group training sessions held approximately 3 times per week at the center for 12 weeks (3 months). The fitness evaluation and exercise program are standard of care. Participation in this study will last the duration of the exercise program, about 3 months. All group exercise sessions will be closely monitored by the center staff who are Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists (CSCS)."
