The objectives of the project are as follows:\n\n1. To determine if the intervention leads to increases the frequency and variety of activities.\n2. To determine if the intervention leads to increases in community mobility.\n3. To determine which demographic and environmental factors and mechanisms of action impact the effectiveness of the intervention.\n4. To determine if the the intervention leads to an improvement in overall well-being (e.g., improved quality of life).\n\nParticipants will be asked to attend a 2-hour weekly online session for 10 weeks and then a 1-hour online monthly session for a 3 month maintenance period.\n\nFor data collection, participants will also be asked to:\n\n1. Complete three, approximately 1-hour interviews at baseline, after the 10 week intervention, and again at the end of the maintenance period;\n2. Carry a mobile phone with a global positioning system app to track their movements outside their home for 2 weeks at a time, at three separate times (e.g., baseline, after the intervention, and at the end of the maintenance period); and\n3. Complete a 15 minute weekly interviews for 26 weeks about their daily activities and participation.\n\nThe study will enroll 52 participants split into 4 cohorts of 13. The study will use a multiple baseline design and, as such, all participants will receive the intervention and there is no control group."
