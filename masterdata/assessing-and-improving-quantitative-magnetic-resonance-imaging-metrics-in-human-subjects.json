            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses strong magnets to get images of structures inside the body, is a valuable tool in modern medicine. But researchers are always looking for ways to improve this technology. To better understand how to use MRI to diagnose problems, researchers need to collect more data from scans of healthy people.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo get MRI scans of healthy people to improve the measurements doctors can make from the images.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years or older in good general health.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam focused on their nervous system. They will complete questionnaires.\n\nParticipants will have at least 1 MRI scan. The target of the scan may be the brain, liver, prostate, breast, or other body part. Before the scan, participants will remove any metallic objects. They will lie on a narrow table that moves into a long, narrow tube. They may have special pads placed around them to help them remain still.\n\nParticipants will hear loud noises during the scan. They will get earplugs or earmuffs to wear to muffle the sound. They can communicate with the MRI technician and will have an emergency button to squeeze at any time if they want the scan to stop. The scan will take up to 2 hours.\n\nSome participants may be asked to perform tasks on a computer screen during the scan.\n\nParticipants may return for up to 5 scans in 3 months. Some may have as many as 30 MRI visits per year. They may remain in the study for up to 2 years....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nBiomarkers are of fundamental importance for any clinical endeavor aimed at improving human health. The main objective of this protocol is to discover and investigate quantitative metrics obtained with non-invasive imaging techniques, primarily MRI, that could become potential biomarkers of the anatomical and physiological state of living human tissues, and to improve the experimental design of MRI acquisitions to enable reliable measurement of these quantitative metrics.\n\nObjectives:\n\nWe will develop and optimize novel quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques on normal, healthy volunteers, and investigate the accuracy and reproducibility of these novel techniques across time and across different MRI scanners.\n\nPrimary Objective: To improve the experimental design of MRI acquisitions to enable reliable measurement of quantitative metrics that are candidate biomarkers in human subjects.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To assess the relative contributions of true inter-individual biological differences and experimental noise to the overall variability of the measured qMRI metrics.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Assessing the reproducibility of metrics derived from quantitative MRI data, evaluating the effects of acquisition modalities, such as experimental design, and choice of acquisition sequences and hardware, on the overall variability of these metrics.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Extracting the contributions of experimental design and biological variability to overall variability."
