Participant and their spouse or participant and their family caregiver will have six, 60-minute video-conference sessions which will be scheduled at their convenience. The investigator will loan participants a tablet computer (iPad) to use for videoconferencing and train the participant in its use. Participant and their spouse or participant and their family caregiver will complete three assessments - one before starting the sessions, one after the sixth session, and one after 1 month. Each assessment will include surveys, which the participant will complete separately from their spouse or family caregiver. For most people, it will take upwards of 2 - 4 months to complete this study"
