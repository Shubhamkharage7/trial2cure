The study hopes the proposed intervention will improve symptoms based on preclinical evidence that vitamin D analogues have significant and beneficial effects on pancreatitis cancer by blocking certain signaling proteins to reduce pain.\n\nMedical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory test results will be reviewed at all visits by one of the study physicians. In addition, at the beginning and end of the study period, patients will have an MRI to assess condition and DEXA scan to measure bone mineral density, to compare and determine if those receiving paricalcitol have a clinically significant decrease in bone mineral density compared to those receiving placebo for safety. In addition to scans, routine labs will be obtained to assess for any adverse events or safety concerns. Mechanistic specimens for research purposes will be collected at each of the following in person visits: Screening/Randomization, Month 6, Month 12."
