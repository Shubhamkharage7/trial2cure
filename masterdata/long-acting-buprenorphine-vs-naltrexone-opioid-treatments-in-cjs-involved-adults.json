            "briefSummary": "This study seeks to compare the effectiveness of two medications used to treat opioid use disorder, extended-release buprenorphine (XR-B) vs. extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), among adults currently incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons at 5 distinct trial sites. This open-label, non-inferiority, head-to-head study design will offer providers, correctional and public health authorities, payers and policy makers' timely and relevant data to assess the effectiveness of XR-B (and XR-NTX) as potentially useful re-entry and relapse prevention treatment options. It is hypothesized that XR-B is non-inferior to XR-NTX when comparing retention-in-study-medication treatment options.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants eligible for randomization will be randomized 1:1 to extended-release buprenorphine (XR-B) vs. extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) prior to release from the correctional controlled environment (including jails, prisons, work release and residential treatment, or other correctional facilities) and treated for 24-weeks following release or upon entry into a community CJS-mandated program.\n\nXR-B (SublocadeTM, Indivior) is a partial opioid agonist indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder. Delivered as a pre-filled 2cc subcutaneous monthly injection, typically using two 300mg/1.5 ml initial starting doses followed by 100mg/0.5 ml monthly maintenance doses. The study will provide up to six monthly XR-B doses throughout the study. Prior to an initial injection, the participant must be stable for seven days or longer on sublingual buprenorphine (SLB) at doses of 8mg/day or higher.\n\nDescription of Study Intervention Participants eligible for randomization (n=670) will be randomized 1:1 to extended-release buprenorphine (XR-B) vs. extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) prior to release from the correctional controlled environment (including jails, prisons, work release and residential treatment, or other correctional facilities) and treated for 24-weeks following release or upon entry into a community CJS-mandated program.\n\nXR-B (SublocadeTM, Indivior) is a partial opioid agonist indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder.

A negative opioid urine toxicology, negative self-report of any recent opioid use, and a naloxone challenge. The naloxone challenge consists of 0.4-0.8mg of IV/SC/IM naloxone followed by the observation of no opioid withdrawal symptoms, or the use of oral naltrexone (12.5-25mg) followed by 1-2 hours of observation. XR-NTX is delivered as a 380mg (4cc) intramuscular injection to the upper outer gluteus (buttock) monthly. The study will provide six or more monthly XR-NTX doses."
