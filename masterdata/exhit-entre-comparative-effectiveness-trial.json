Participants will be randomly assigned to XR-BUP or TAU to be received within 72 hours of anticipated hospital discharge. Follow up will occur at approximately 34, 90, and 180 days following hospital discharge.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will randomize approximately 314 hospitalized men and women ages 18 years and older with opioid use disorder (OUD) moderate or severe and who have not been taking prescribed medication for OUD (MOUD) for 14 days or more prior to hospitalization. Eligibility will be determined over one or more assessments during the index hospitalization. Once eligibility has been determined, participants will be randomized 1:1 to either a single injection of extended-release buprenorphine or TAU, which will include methadone, sublingual buprenorphine, or naltrexone. Connection to OUD care and ongoing MOUD following hospitalization will be per community standard. Participants will be assessed for engagement in OUD treatment by the presence of a legitimately prescribed MOUD on day 34 following hospital discharge. Further outcomes will be assessed at 90 and 180 days following hospital discharge."

Approximately 314 hospitalized patients with OUD who were not receiving prescribed MOUD for at least 14 days prior to hospitalization and are willing to start MOUD including buprenorphine will be randomized 1:1 to two different strategies. After baseline assessments are performed, eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to XR-BUP or TAU",
