            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare physical therapy treatments in people with neck pain. The main aim is to compare the short-term effectiveness of physical therapy treatment for neck pain as delivered through Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) as compared to the Cervical Spine Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) in patients with neck pain.\n\nParticipants will be randomly allocated to receive treatment according to MDT or CPG guidelines. Researchers will compare outcomes between the two groups over 1 year.",
            "detailedDescription": "Neck pain is one of the leading musculoskeletal causes of disability, second only to low back pain. A growing number of individuals with spine pathologies are seeking medical care; however, the overall increase in costs for spinal conditions is largely due to the growing cost per individual. The age-standardized rates of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with neck pain in North America are higher when compared globally. Due to these high rates and increases in medical care for individuals with spinal pathologies, further research is essential in developing the most efficacious treatment approach. Current evidence-based interventions to address musculoskeletal conditions of the neck are summarized in the 2017 revision of the Neck Pain Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). The most recent revision includes 4 categories of neck pain: neck pain with mobility deficits, neck pain with headaches, neck pain with radiating pain, and neck pain with movement coordination impairment. These categories differ from the McKenzie Method of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (known clinically as MDT) classifications of Derangement Syndrome, Dysfunction Syndrome, Postural Syndrome, and Spinal other Subgroups.
