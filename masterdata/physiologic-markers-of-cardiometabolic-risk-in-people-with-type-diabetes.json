            "briefSummary": "More than 40% of young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) also have overweight or obesity. Each of these diagnoses increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Investigators aim to obtain reference data for individuals with T1D who do not have overweight obesity, to understand how close GLP-1 analogue obesity treatment in those with overweight/obesity brings physiologic markers of cardiometabolic risk to those with BMI in the normal range. Specifically, investigators will describe how drivers of gluconeogenesis and lipemia (specifically measured as visceral fat ratio, insulin resistance, and postprandial lipemia,) that contribute to cardiometabolic risk in T1D change over time.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective\n\nThe primary objectives of this physiologic study are to:\n\n1. examine how visceral adipose tissue (VAT), measured as VAT/Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue + VAT changes over 1 year in young adults with T1D and body mass index \\<25kg/m2.\n2. determine how hepatic insulin resistance changes over 1 year in young adults with T1D and body mass index \\<25kg/m2.\n3. determine how the area under the curve of triglycerides after a high fat mixed meal tolerance test changes over 1 year in young adults with T1D and body mass index \\<25kg/m2.\n\nSecondary Objective\n\nThe secondary objective\\[s\\] of this study are to determine change in:\n\nAim 1: Weight and % body fat from baseline to 1 year. Aim 2: Suppression of endogenous glucose production (a measure of insulin resistance), expressed as the change in endogenous glucose rate of appearance (mg/kg/min) at baseline and during the low dose (hepatic) phase, and relationship to VAT/(VAT+SAT) from baseline to 1 year. Glucose rate of appearance, glycerol rate of appearance, glucose oxidation, and fat oxidation will be assessed in all clamp phases baseline to 1 year.\n\nAim 3: Postprandial rise in other atherogenic lipoproteins baseline to 1 year. The data obtained from this protocol will serve as reference data for a randomized clinical trial of GLP-1 analogue obesity in young adults with T1D and overweight/obesity.\n\nThe focus of this registration is the primary objective."
