Patients may undergo CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as clinically indicated and may undergo collection of oral and/or rectal swabs on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 13, at 6 months, and then for up to 5 years per institutional standards."
