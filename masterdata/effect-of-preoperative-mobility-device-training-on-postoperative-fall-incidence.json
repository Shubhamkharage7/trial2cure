            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether preoperative mobility device training is beneficial in reducing incidence of postoperative falls in patients undergoing elective foot and ankle surgery requiring a postoperative period of no weight-bearing.",
            "detailedDescription": "Most of the surgeries involving the foot and ankle require non-weight bearing status post operatively. Patients use crutches, walker or knee scooters during that period to avoid weight bearing. However, using any mobility device(s) requires training to avoid falls. Most of the falls happen during early post-operative period after any surgery. The usage of assistive mobility device(s) increases the risk of falls. Some studies have shown physical therapy and training to decrease this risk of falls. Physical training for usage of assistive devices can be done either preoperatively or post operatively. When training is done postoperatively, it may increase the risk of fall due to pain, usage of narcotic drugs, especially in older patients due to lack of muscle power. To prevent these increased risks, the training can be done preoperatively. However, the role of preoperative training regarding usage of assistive devices has not been emphasized in the literature. Hence, the aim of our current study is to evaluate the difference between preoperative training and no training before surgery on the use of mobility device(s).\n\n250 patients will be enrolled in the study. Each participant will be stratified by randomization into either Group 1 or Group 2. Patients in Group 1 will receive training on the mobility device(s) during their standard pre-operative care whereas patients in Group 2 will not receive this training. This training is not a component of routine, standard pre-operative care. Each group will include 125 patients.\n\nWorking in conjunction with University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Foot and Ankle Division of the Orthopaedic department, volunteers meeting inclusion criteria will be identified in the outpatient clinic setting. After thorough discussion of risks and benefits, potential volunteers will be consented for participation in the study. The volunteer's demographic data will be obtained including gender, age, and race. The patient will then undergo the \"pre-operative mobility device(s) training\" during the pre-operative physical therapy visit, if they are randomized to Group 1. Patients in Group 2 will not receive this training. The preoperative training will not incur any additional cost to the patient. Patients in both groups will then undergo standard operative care. During routine 2-week and 6-week follow-up visits, they will be asked questions from a questionnaire that will assess the number and details of any fall(s) they may have experienced."
