            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see how a diet that mimics fasting effects inflammation in patients with mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The diet may allow users to receive the benefits of fasting while also being able to enjoy food (the ingredients of which are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Research on dietary interventions and UC are very limited. Fasting mimicking diets (FMD) have been studied with support of the National Institute of Health and published in leading journals. This research investigates whether markers of inflammation decrease and/or quality of life increases after three cycles of a five-day period of the fasting mimicking diet, and may provide rationale for its use to treat UC."
