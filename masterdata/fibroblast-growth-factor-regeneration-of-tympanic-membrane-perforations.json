The documentation of TM closure will be the main efficacy outcome measure. Pretreatment photographs will document the area of the TM perforation and allow measurement of surface areas of the TMP for comparison of pre- and post-treatment. The study will be divided into two phases, the Randomized Treatment phase (part A), and the Unblinded Crossover phase (part B). In part A of the study, subjects will be randomized 1:1 (using simple randomization) to receive FGF-2 or placebo treatment up to 3 treatments. Subjects that fail three study treatments will move on to part B of the study. Subjects who received placebo in part A and failed three placebo treatments will crossover to receive unblinded FGF-2 for up to 3 treatments. Subjects who received FGF-2 in part A and failed three experimental treatments will not have additional FGF-2 treatment, and will move on to study follow up."
