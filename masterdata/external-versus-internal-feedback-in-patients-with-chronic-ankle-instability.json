            "briefSummary": "Although altered biomechanics has been well documented as an impairment associated with chronic ankle instability (CAI), effective interventions targeting biomechanics with long-term outcomes measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are absent. Evidence suggests that external focus of attention (ExFOCUS), internal focus of attention (InFOCUS) feedback, and auditory feedback during movement training can alter biomechanics in other patient populations, with ExFOCUS and auditory enhancing retention of learned biomechanics. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial will determine if a 4-week (12 session) impairment-based rehabilitation program that includes feedback (ExFOCUS or InFOCUS or Auditory) can (1) decrease ankle inversion kinematics and lateral plantar pressure during walking and (2) improve self-reported function."
