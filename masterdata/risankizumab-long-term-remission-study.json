            "briefSummary": "Although the newly developed biologics (drugs derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory) are highly effective in controlling psoriasis, all the biologics should be continuously injected to suppress recurrence of the disease. In this regard, the observation in the phase II clinical trial conducted by us (Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology at the Rockefeller University) was groundbreaking that just a single dose of anti-IL-23p19 antibody (risankizumab, trade name: Skyrizi, study drug in this clinical trial) administration produced disease clearance up to 66 weeks in 46% (6 of 13) of patients. However, there is a lack of understanding about immune regulation in human skin induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody injection, and there is a need to conduct a psoriasis clinical trial for single-cell sequencing immune cells in human psoriasis skin before and after anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration, and to correlate regulatory immune cell alterations with clinical disease progression. The overall objective of the clinical trial is to study regulatory immune cell alterations induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in psoriasis patients who achieve long-term disease clearance off drugs.",
            "detailedDescription": "Although the newly developed biologics targeting IL-23/Th17 axis are highly effective in controlling psoriasis, all the biologics should be continuously injected to suppress recurrence of the disease. In this regard, the observation in our phase I psoriasis clinical trial was groundbreaking that just a single dose of anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration produced disease clearance up to 66 weeks in 46% (6 of 13) of patients. Since FoxP3 mRNA levels remained high in posttreatment biopsy specimens of these patients, we hypothesized that IL-23p19 inhibition increased regulatory T-cell levels or function in resolved psoriatic skin. However, there is a lack of understanding about regulatory immune cell promotion by IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin.\n\nOur overall objectives of the study, are to (i) identify regulatory immune cell alterations induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in the skin of patients whose psoriasis is cleared without recurrence and (ii) develop pre-treatment predictive models for psoriasis patients that anticipate disease clearance and recurrence after short-term anti-IL-23p19 antibody injection. The rationale for this project is that molecular evidence of immune tolerance induction by IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin is likely to offer a strong clinical framework whereby new strategies to prevent recurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases can be developed. In this study, subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis will receive FDA-approved anti-IL-23p19 antibody (Generic name: Risankizumab, Product name: SKYRIZI\u2122 or risankizumab-rzaa) up to 4 months following the FDA-approved indications, usage, dosage, and administration in the FDA-approved dosage forms and strengths through week 16, after which, dosing stops."
