            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to characterize proprioceptive sensations in the missing limb of upper limb amputees using nerve stimulation, and to develop advanced controllers for moving a prosthesis. Proprioceptive sensations are the sensations that tell individuals where their hand is in space, and if it is moving. The research team uses Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), which involves applying small electric currents to the nerves. These signals are then transferred to the brain just like the information about the individual's intact hand used to be transferred to their brain. This study will test different placements for stimulation and determine which one(s) provide the individual with proprioceptive sensations. The investigators want to know what the participants feel and if the investigators can use proprioceptive sensation to give the participants information about limb movement and position.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hands are the primary means of interacting with the world, and Veterans who have lost a hand must cope with diminished functional and sensory capabilities. While myoelectric prostheses can restore the basic grasping function of the lost hand, many amputees abandon use of prostheses because current prosthetic options do not meet their needs. In addition, many amputees struggle with phantom pain and psychosocial deficits following limb loss that are not fully mitigated by current treatments.\n\nIn the normal sensorimotor system, proprioception, which is the sense of limb position and movement, is critical for informing motor plans and correcting errors in movement. In addition, proprioception plays a key role in body ownership, agency, and phantom pain. Despite its importance, proprioception is absent in current prosthetic options.\n\nThe goal of the proposed project is to make upper limb prosthetic devices more natural and useful for Veterans who have lost a hand by providing proprioceptive feedback about prosthesis postures and movements. The central hypothesis is that effectively closing the loop between a prosthesis user and their device requires that the sensory inputs and control outputs closely mimic the underlying sensorimotor neural processes of the body schema. The investigators will examine integration of artificial proprioception with prosthesis control in three trans-radial and three trans-humeral amputees using the investigators' implanted neural-interfacing system.\n\nAim 1. Characterize proprioceptive sensations elicited by peripheral nerve stimulation. The investigators will test time-varying Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) patterns and examine the impact on the kinematics of the evoked proprioceptive percept using position matching with the contralateral intact limb and multivariate regression analyses. The investigators will investigate paired agonist-antagonist stimulation strategies and compare the discriminability between agonist-only and paired agonist-antagonist strategies using psychometric tests.\n\nAim 2. Investigate the mechanisms of stimulation-evoked proprioception. The neurophysiological basis of proprioception from PNS is unknown. To investigate whether proprioceptive percepts originate from direct afferent activation or indirect recruitment via direct muscle activation, the investigators will perform a motor block of the residual forearm of trans-radial participants and examine changes to the proprioceptive percepts. In trans-humeral participants, Targeted Muscle Reinnervation will be performed at the time of system implant, and percepts will be compared before and after muscle ingrowth.\n\nAim 3. Determine the integration of proprioceptive stimulation with motor control during posture matching. To restore proprioception to Veterans during active prosthesis use, PNS-evoked percepts must be integrated with voluntary limb control. The investigators will determine the impact of proprioception on motor control through a virtual reality posture matching task and compare performance with velocity and position-based prosthetic hand controllers with and without proprioceptive PNS. Second, the investigators will determine the impact of voluntary control on the perception of PNS-evoked proprioception through a psychometric dissimilarity rating task. Third, the investigators will assess the impact of artificial proprioception on embodiment via surveys.\n\nThe project will be the first to investigate the sensorimotor integration of proprioception from PNS in a broad population of upper-limb amputees and with both position and velocity controllers. The study will provide important information about the kinematics of artificial proprioception and the role of direct muscle activation in forming proprioceptive percepts. The investigators expect that knowledge gained in this proposal will improve prosthesis utility and acceptance for Veterans with limb loss and will advance prosthetic hand technology and standard of care in the neurorehabilitation field."
