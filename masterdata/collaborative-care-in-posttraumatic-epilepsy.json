This single-blind study will evaluate effectiveness and implementation of a remotely-delivered, 24-week team-delivered collaborative care intervention, with features adapted from VA Primary Care Mental Health Integration and Whole Health, as well as an existing Family Medicine Collaborative Care Program at AHWFB."
