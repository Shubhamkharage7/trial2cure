            "detailedDescription": "This is a first in human study of Paclitaxel-loaded TPM, suspended in 0.5 L of 0.1% polysorbate 80 in normal saline instilled into the peritoneal cavity.\n\nAn enrolled patient will (a) undergo laparoscopy during which time the hydrostatic pressures at different locations within the peritoneal cavity are measured, pretreatment tumors are biopsied and peritoneal catheter is placed, (b) receive intraperitoneal TPM during index hospital stay, and (c) followed-up to evaluate treatment-related toxicity and response. The pharmacokinetics of TPM and paclitaxel in peritoneal fluid and systemic blood samples will be measured. Second dose of TPM is given in clinic if no disease progression or significant AEs.\n\nThis is a dose escalation study. Dose escalation will proceed using an accelerated titration design (ATD) with intra-patient dose escalation.\n\nIn the event either:\n\n* 1 patient exhibits DLT during the first course of treatment or\n* 2 patients exhibit grade 2 study drug-related (attribution of probable or definite) toxicity during the first course of treatment.\n\nThe design switches to a standard 3+3 design at the dose that triggered the switch-two additional patients are accrued at this dose level. Decisions on when and how to escalate if the design switches to a 3+3 are described in the protocol section 6.3"
