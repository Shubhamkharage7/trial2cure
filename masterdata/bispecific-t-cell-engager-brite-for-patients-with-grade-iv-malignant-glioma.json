The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of BRiTE in such patients.",

After completion of a minimum of 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ), or at first progression, eligible patients will receive a bolus BRiTE injection followed by a 28-day safety monitoring period. Blood will be drawn to assess the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of BRiTE injection, as well as to investigate the immune system response to BRiTE injection and evaluate for cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Following the 28-day monitoring period, patients will be passively followed as part of their standard of care follow-up."
