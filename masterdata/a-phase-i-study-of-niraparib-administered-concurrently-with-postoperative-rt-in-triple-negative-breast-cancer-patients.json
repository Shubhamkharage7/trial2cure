In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells by not allowing the cancer cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage from occurring.\n\nThis trial is studying people who have triple negative breast cancer because this cancer type is shown to have DNA repair mechanisms that may benefit from combined PARP inhibitor and radiation, and may help prevent recurrence of cancers in the chest wall and lymph nodes of the affected side."
