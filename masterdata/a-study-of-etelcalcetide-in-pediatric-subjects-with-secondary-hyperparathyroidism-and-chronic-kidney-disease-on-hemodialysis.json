            "detailedDescription": "SHPT is a common and serious co-morbidity that develops relatively early in the course of CKD, worsens with declining kidney function, and is associated with serious complications in children on dialysis. Children on dialysis experience a wide spectrum of bone abnormalities and growth retardation, in addition to increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that manifests early in their adulthood. Traditional therapies for SHPT (eg, vitamin D sterols) are widely used in the pediatric dialysis population, and have the potential to aggravate complications of the disease by increasing serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus, and serum Ca times serum phosphorus product.\n\nEtelcalcetide has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treating adult CKD patients with SHPT by simultaneously controlling intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), Ca, and phosphorus and has recently been approved for use in adult patients with SHPT treated with hemodialysis in both the United States and Europe. Although no previous studies have been conducted in pediatric patients with etelcalcetide (one single dose pharmacokinetic \\[PK\\] study is currently ongoing),Amgen anticipates minimal to moderate risk with a possibility of direct benefit to the pediatric subjects (age 28 days to 18 years) in this study. The burden of complications of SHPT in the pediatric dialysis population and the limitations of current standard therapy, underscore the need for studies of etelcalcetide in these patients to address this unmet medical need and inform the pediatric nephrology community of the potential use of etelcalcetide in children on hemodialysis with critical safety and efficacy data."

Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
