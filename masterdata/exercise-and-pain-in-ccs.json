Our central hypothesis is that integration of exercise interventions into standard post-cancer directed treatment care will be acceptable and feasible while improving patients' pain, decreasing the cumulative dose of pain medication and improving patients' functional and psychosocial outcomes as compared to patients who only receive standard post-cancer directed treatment care."
