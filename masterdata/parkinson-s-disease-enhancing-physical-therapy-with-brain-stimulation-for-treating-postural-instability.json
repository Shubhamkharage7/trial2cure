The investigators designed a double-blinded, placebo controlled, randomized study to investigate the effects of 2 weeks of TDCS+TUS on postural instability in PD patients receiving PT. (Followed by biweekly sessions for 2 more weeks in Phase II)",
            "detailedDescription": "Current treatments for Parkinson's Disease (PD), including pharmacological (levodopa) and surgical (DBS) methods, have limited impact on postural instability. Physical therapy (PT) for PD is becoming increasingly used as a means to induce benefits on patient balance. However, limits in efficacy and consistency still exist. In this study, the investigators will test the effects of TDCS+TUS combined with PT on postural instability of PD patients."
