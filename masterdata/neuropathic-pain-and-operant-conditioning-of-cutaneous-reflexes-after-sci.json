For this, the researchers are recruiting 15 individuals with neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury to participate in the reflex training procedure. The study involves approximately 50 visits with a total study duration of about 6.5 months (3 months for baseline and training phases followed by 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits).",
            "detailedDescription": "As part of the larger study of the relationship between reflexes in the leg and the presence of neuropathic pain, the researchers are also recruiting 30 individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) total, 15 individuals with neuropathic pain due to SCI and 15 individuals without neuropathic pain. For this portion of the study, there are 2 visits. The first visit will examine cutaneous reflexes in the leg. During the second visit, the study team will assess sensation in the leg and administer questionnaires about pain, functioning, and quality of life. This portion of the study does not involve an intervention.\n\nThe study will then recruit 15 individuals who will participate in reflex training, as described in the brief summary."
