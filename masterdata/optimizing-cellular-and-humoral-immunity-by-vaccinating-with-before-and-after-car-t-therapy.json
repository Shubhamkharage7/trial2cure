All the participants will receive the same treatment. Immunoglobulins (IgG) against pneumococcal serotypes not included in the vaccine will be served as an internal control. Treatment includes the same dose (0.5ml) of PCV13 one time prior to apheresis followed by two times after CAR T cell therapy"
