            "briefSummary": "In this study the investigators will incorporate a wide range of clinical variables associated with aging and cardiovascular disease to determine whether they are associated with mutation status independent of chronologic age. Clinically, aging can be operationalized using geriatric assessment, which entails a comprehensive multi-dimensional assessment of the health of an older adult, including measures of comorbidity, polypharmacy, functional status, cognition, depression, falls, social activities and social support. Given that aging is heterogeneous, geriatric assessment allows greater specificity for aging than chronological age alone."
