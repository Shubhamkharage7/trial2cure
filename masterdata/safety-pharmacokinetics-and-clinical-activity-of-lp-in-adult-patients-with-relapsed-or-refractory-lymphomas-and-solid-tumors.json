The secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LP-284 and to assess clinical activity of LP-284.",
            "detailedDescription": "This FIH study is an open-label Phase 1a/1b dose escalation and dose expansion study in adult patients with R/R lymphoma and solid tumors. Patients who provide informed consent and meet the eligibility criteria for the study will be enrolled and treated with LP-284 administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1, 8, 15 of a 28-day schedule.\n\nThe study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation with MTD and/or RP2D confirmation (Phase 1a) and dose expansion (Phase 1b). Up to 30 evaluable patients will be enrolled in Phase 1a; the total number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels explored. Up to 40 evaluable patients will be enrolled in each of the 2 cohorts of MCL and DLBCL tumors in Phase 1b.\n\nPatients will remain on study treatment for up to a total of one-year OR until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, any study-specific discontinuation criteria are met, or the Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to discontinue study treatment, whichever is shorter."
