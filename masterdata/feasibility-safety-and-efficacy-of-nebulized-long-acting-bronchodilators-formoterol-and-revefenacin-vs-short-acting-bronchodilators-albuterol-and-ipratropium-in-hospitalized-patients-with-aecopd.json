Study medication will be administered by standard jet nebulizers in both groups.\n\nInvestigators will:\n\n* Collect the Borg dyspnea scale twice a day during hospitalization\n* Record the total doses of bronchodilators per day received by each patient\n* Record the number of rescue doses needed per day of hospital stay\n* Record the lowest level of FiO2 employed on days 1, 3 and 7 of hospital stay\n* Record all adverse events and concurrent medications\n\nInvestigators will collect:\n\nPhysical Exam (Day 1, 3, 7, or ET) Serum Chemistry (Day 1, 3, 7, or ET) Hematology (Day 1, 3, 7, or ET) Chest X-Ray (Day 1)."
