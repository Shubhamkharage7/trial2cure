Approximately 54 patients will be enrolled at 5-10 US centers. This study will include 5 age cohorts and patients will be entered in a stepwise approach starting with the older age cohort (12-\\<18 years). The starting dose will be IV oritavancin 15 mg/kg. The safety, tolerability and PK data will be reviewed at the completion of each cohort to ensure safety and determine the appropriate dose for the next age cohort. At least 8 patients will be enrolled in each cohort except for the birth to \\<3 month age cohort which will have at least 16 patients enrolled. Three PK samples will be collected over 14 days. The safety follow-up will complete with a 60-day phone call to the caregiver."
