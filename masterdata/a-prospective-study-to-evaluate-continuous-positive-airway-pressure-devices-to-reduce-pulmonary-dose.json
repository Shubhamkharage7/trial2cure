            "detailedDescription": "Lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a definitive treatment for patients with early-stage lung cancers as well as for patients with limited metastases to the lung. One challenge with the treatment of the lung is the risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly for early-stage lungs cancers that are inoperable (those receiving primary lung SBRT) or those with metastatic cancers receiving systemic therapy that may impact pulmonary function (those receiving lung SBRT for metastatic cancers).\n\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices are commonly utilized for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. However, through the use of continuous pressure, lung volumes are increased. Preliminary data in patients undergoing breast radiation as well as lung radiation has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of such an approach, demonstrating increased lung volumes with decreases in heart dose6-8. Additional potential advantages of CPAP include increased ease of use for patients and the potential for cost savings as compared to traditional respiratory management techniques.\n\nThis prospective study is to allow for the collection and assessment of data on patients with left-sided breast cancer or undergoing lung SBRT utilizing CPAP. This will allow for the assessment of lung doses with and without CPAP as well as cardiac doses. No additional changes to our standard of care breast or lung radiation will occur. With respect to the safety profile, CPAP is commonly used with limited toxicity concerns. The potential benefit of CPAP has reduced lung and heart doses and, consequently, radiation-related toxicities."
