This is followed by a confirmatory phase 1 expansion cohort where an additional approximately 10 patients will be treated with CTX-712 at the RP2D to gain further confidence in the selected dose level. After RP2D is determined, Drug-Drug-Interaction cohorts will be started.\n\nThe phase 2 part of the study will commence after the RP2D has been identified and confirmed and will evaluate therapeutic activity in R/R AML or R/R HR-MDS, in addition to confirmation of the safety profile."
