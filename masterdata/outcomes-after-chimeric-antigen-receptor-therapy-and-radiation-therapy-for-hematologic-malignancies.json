Collecting information from patients before, during, and after receiving chimeric antigen receptor therapy or radiation therapy may help doctors to optimize patient selection, dose, timing, and sequencing of these treatments.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Record clinical outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies receiving standard-of-care chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T) and radiation therapy (RT).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To record patient-specific factors and treatment-related factors in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving standard-of-care CAR-T and RT to ultimately improve patient selection and overall treatment strategy to optimize clinical outcomes.\n\nII. To record and explore the relationship between radiation dose, target, technique, and timing with respect to CAR-T and clinical outcomes in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with standard-of-care CAR-T and RT.\n\nIII. To record and study the relationship between patient-specific factors and treatment-related factors and treatment toxicity in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing standard-of-care CAR-T and RT.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients medical records are reviewed for details about CAR-T and RT treatment and acute and late toxicities, disease outcomes such as any events related to local or distant disease progression, survival, and cause of death if available. Patients' imaging scan data is collected at baseline, within 2 months of the first treatment of RT or CAR-T, and at 3, 6, 12 months, and then annually for 5 years after RT completion."
