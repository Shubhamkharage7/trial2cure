            "briefSummary": "This study is conducted to compare the safety and effectiveness of a novel short 6-week regimen of daily rifapentine (6wP, experimental arm) with a comparator arm of 12-16 weeks of rifamycin-based treatment (standard of care, control arm) of latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI).\n\nThis trial is conducted among persons who are at increased risk of progression to tuberculosis (TB) and require treatment of LTBI. The study will be conducted in low, medium and high TB incidence settings that have treatment of LTBI as their standard of care and offer 12-16 week rifamycin-based therapy as standard of care.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that the safety and effectiveness of the experimental treatment (6wP arm) is non-inferior to a comparator arm of 12-16 weeks of rifamycin-based treatment of LTBI (control arm).\n\nParticipants are enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the two study arms: experimental 6wP or control. The comparator (control) arm's treatment regimens include 12 weeks of once-weekly isoniazid (INH) and rifapentine (3HP), 12 weeks of daily INH and rifampin (3HR), and 16 weeks of daily rifampin (4R). A total of 560 participants per arm (1,120 total) for the evaluation of safety and 1,700 participants per arm (3,400 total) for the evaluation of effectiveness will be enrolled, given treatment as per randomization assignment, and followed for 24 months from the date of enrollment.\n\nAfter completion of data collection, statistical analyses will be conducted to compare proportions of drug discontinuation due to adverse drug reaction (ADR) and proportions of newly diagnosed tuberculosis between 6wP and control arm."
