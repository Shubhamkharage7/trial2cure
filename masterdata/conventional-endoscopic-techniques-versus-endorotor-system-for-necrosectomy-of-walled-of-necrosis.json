            "briefSummary": "In acute pancreatitis, approximately 20% of the cases result in severe necrotizing pancreatitis which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Necrotizing pancreatitis is characterized by the development of an acute necrotic collection and as this collection persists beyond 4 weeks, walled off necrosis (WON) encapsulates the collection. To date, this is treated by the step-up approach, which contains percutaneous drainage and minimally invasive video assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided drainage followed by direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN). Different DEN techniques are available for the treatment of WON, however, there is a lack of effective endoscopic instruments to perform DEN. Recently, the first dedicated alternative to conventional DEN has been cleared for use, namely the EndoRotor\u00ae Resection System. This device is a powered mechanical debridement device intended for use in endoscopic procedures to resect and remove necrotic debris during DEN for WON. Previous (pilot and feasibility) studies showed promising results in terms of the amount of procedures, adverse events and length of hospital stay.\n\nTherefore, aim of this study is to assess the performance of the EndoRotor, as compared to conventional endoscopic techniques, for direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) of walled off necrosis (WON) in a randomized controlled trial."
