            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see if a new treatment could help patients who have osteosarcoma that does not go away with treatment (is refractory) or comes back after treatment (is recurrent).This study is testing a combination of study therapies, UB-TT170 and genetically modified chimeric antigen receptor T lymphocyte (CAR T) cells, which work together in a way that is different from chemotherapy.\n\nIn this study, researchers will take some of your blood and remove the T cells in a process called \"apheresis\". Then the T cells are taken to a lab and changed to CAR T cells that recognize the flags from UB-TT170. Once researchers think they have grown enough CAR T cells, called antiFL(FITC-E2) CAR T cells, to fight your cancer, you may get some chemotherapy to make room in your body for the new cells and then have those cells put back in your body.\n\nA few days after the you get your CAR T cell infusion you will start to get infusions of UB-TT170, with the dose slowly increasing for the first few infusions until you have reached a maximum dose that you will get on a regular schedule. The UB-TT170 will attach to your tumor cells and flag them so that they attract the CAR T cells. When the CAR T cells see the labeled tumor cells they can kill the tumor cells.\n\nThe active part of the study lasts about 8 months, and if you get the CAR T cell infusion you will be in long-term follow-up for 15 years."
