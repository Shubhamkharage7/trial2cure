This is an observational study, to understand the ways in which the immune system may be contributing to the disease process.",
            "detailedDescription": "Genetic studies have linked the number of copies coding for C4 protein to risk for schizophrenia. Studies examining the amount of mRNA, the molecules that point to how much C4 protein is likely being made, found more C4 mRNA in the brains from individuals with schizophrenia. Studies in mice have suggested that expressing more C4 protein in the brain, specifically the A-type of C4, can result in abnormalities in behavior. However, researchers have also found that pathways that involve this protein in the blood to be abnormal in individuals even before they develop schizophrenia and hypothesize these abnormalities change the blood brain barrier. In this work, the researchers are hoping to understand the ways in which C4 protein is abnormal in the peripheral blood and how this may be contributing to the disease process in hopes of finding new ways of helping individuals with schizophrenia and possibly other mental health disorders. A major goal of this study is to collect blood tissue for ongoing translational study of pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia.\n\nInterested participants will be asked a series of questions about their medical and mental health history, be able to provide informed consent, undergo a urine toxicology screen and be willing to provide a blood sample."
