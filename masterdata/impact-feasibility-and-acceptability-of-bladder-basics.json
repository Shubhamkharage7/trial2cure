            "briefSummary": "PLUTS remains a common childhood condition despite effective treatment options. It is important to improve delivery of UT at the clinical level, with future studies that shift pediatric bladder health into a broader community context. This change in contextual setting and scale can impact access to care and disease incidence beyond our current treatment paradigms. Therefore, the overall objective is to measure the early impact and feasibility of a digital health intervention, Bladder Basics. To complete this aim, we will measure clinical and education outcomes pre- and post- intervention and our assessment of acceptability and feasibility will consider framework-based barriers to implementation. Since there is limited existing data with which to build a future intervention, these variables have been carefully considered based on requirements for a future school-based intervention",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will use a longitudinal pre-post intervention study design to pilot test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary educational and clinical outcomes of a novel digital health intervention, Bladder Basics. The dependent variables measured are short- and long-term parental bladder health knowledge and child LUTS before and after exposure to the independent variable, Bladder Basics. The investigators will obtain information on a comprehensive range of secondary outcomes as potential covariates that inform feasibility and will be considered in future design. For this pilot study, no control group will be offered. Benefits of this study design include simplicity and ease of administration. As this intervention is virtual, all screening, consent procedures, and study orientation will be conducted using Zoom. Target recruitment numbers will be weighted towards Q2 and Q3 when children are more likely to be in school. The intervention consists of a 7-video curriculum that can be watched on a tablet device, computer, or phone. The videos will be watched in order at the family's convenience within a 4-week period.\n\nFamilies can pause and restart the course at any time. Their learning progress will be automatically saved and synced across different devices by the online learning platform. The intervention includes 10 activities that include matching, labeling, and revealing hidden information concepts.\n\nTimed surveys with automatic reminders will be administered and stored via a REDCap database. Pre- intervention surveys will be collected prior to obtaining access to the course and will include baseline demographics, knowledge, DVSS, and self-efficacy measures. After watching each lesson, participants will fill out a post-lesson survey to assess their ability to meet the educational objectives which will count as our short- term knowledge measure. After watching the entire course, participants will have up to 4 weeks from the start of the course to complete the first post-intervention survey. This will include a repeat measure of DVSS and self-efficacy, as well as a new assessment of acceptability, education design, and open-ended feedback questions on perceived structural barriers to adopting bladder health practices and areas for program improvement. A second post-intervention survey will be distributed at 3-months from the start of the course (long-term), and will include a repeat measure of DVSS and knowledge of bladder health practices. The time difference in measuring educational and clinical outcomes reflect the theory that the investigators would expect some degree of time to transpire between knowledge acquisition and repeated practices leading to subjective improvement. Screening, consent, study orientation procedures, and RedCap database management will be managed by a research assistant consistent with prior studies. The investigator will conduct the descriptive and quantitative data analysis portion of the study. Quantitative analysis will be performed using SPSS. The primary investigator will lead overall study completion and address any study-related obstacles or concerns. Alternative approaches include qualitative analysis of open-ended feedback questions using an iterative team-based approach to thematic analysis with myself, 1 research assistant, and 1 medical student who have both been previously trained in this method.\n\nExpected outcomes: The investigators hypothesize that this study will demonstrate that Bladder Basics is a feasible and acceptable program for families facing pLUTS. The investigators expect robust study recruitment based on prior community interest and studies. Information obtained for this study will be used to 1) improve our existing intervention to help families awaiting pLUTS care and 2) design a school-based intervention. Data from this proposal will be submitted for presentation at academic conferences and to relevant journals for manuscript publication."

The development of the course has followed the NIH's Clear \\& Simple standards for patient education. The 7 video lesson plan spans 60 minutes total. The course is designed to support families awaiting medical care, which would provide the continued support. In addition, one lesson shares solutions to common home and school-based barriers to behavioral change. The 4 healthy bladder practices that are promoted are- 1) pee every 3 hours 2) drinking water 3) daily poop without straining 4) toilet postures.",
