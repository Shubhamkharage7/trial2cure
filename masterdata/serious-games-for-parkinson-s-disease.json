Patients will be asked to perform two 30-minute sessions per week of training using serious games over a 3-month period in addition to conventional care or undergo only usual care. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, after 12 weeks of treatment, and at 24 weeks. Improvements in cognitive function, depression, quality of life, and mobility will be assessed.\n\nRELEVANCE: Identifying whether self-administered rehabilitation games can lead to clinical improvements could have significant implications for the management of the disease."
