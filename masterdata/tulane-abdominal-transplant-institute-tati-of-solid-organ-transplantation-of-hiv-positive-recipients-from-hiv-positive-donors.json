All such transplants must occur under an institutional review board (IRB) approved research protocol that is compliant with federal regulations governing human subjects research. This is an investigator-initiated, observational prospective study of solid organ transplantation utilizing HIV-positive donors in HIV positive recipients. Stable HIV-infected adults in need of a solid organ transplant (kidney) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ transplantation will be offered enrollment in the study. Deceased donors (kidney) and living donors (kidney) will be utilized in this protocol.\n\nThe goal of this research is to increase knowledge about the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of solid organ transplantation (SOT) utilizing HIV-positive donors in HIV-positive recipients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an observational prospective study of solid organ transplantation utilizing HIV-positive donors in HIV-positive recipients. Stable HIV-infected adults in need of a solid organ transplant (kidney) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ transplantation will be offered enrollment in the study. Deceased donors (kidney) and living donors (kidney) will be utilized in this protocol. 25 stable HIV-infected adults in need of a solid organ transplant (kidney) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ transplantation and 5 living donors (kidney) will be offered enrollment in the study. Living donors will be followed under a separate addendum protocol.\n\nEach HIV-positive recipient and prospective HIV-positive recipient will be provided an independent advocate who is responsible for protecting and promoting the rights and interests of the HIV-positive recipient (or prospective recipient). The purpose of the independent advocate for the HIV-positive recipient is to:\n\n1. Promote and protect the interests of the HIV-positive prospective recipient (including with respect to having access to a suitable HIV-negative organ if it becomes available).\n2. Take steps to ensure that the HIV-positive recipient's decision is informed and free from coercion.\n3. Review whether the potential HIV-positive prospective recipient has received information regarding the results of Solid Organ Transplantation in general and transplantation in HIV positive recipients in particular and the unknown risks associated with HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplant.\n\nAll potential participants who provide informed consent will be enrolled into the pre-transplant phase of the study. In the pre-transplant phase of the study, standard and HIV-specific eligibility will be confirmed. Enrolled participants will consent to the collection of retrospective medical record data including but not limited to clinic notes, laboratory data, diagnostic procedures and reports for all prior HIV therapies.\n\nAs per Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA) and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/Policy 15.6, at the time of transplant listing \"willing to accept an HIV-positive organ\" status will be indicated in the secure database used by both transplant hospitals and organ procurement organizations to coordinate organ recovery and waitlist candidate matching. HIV-positive matches will be run for study participants who have indicated an interest in HIV+ organs. If an HIV+ organ becomes available for a participant, the participant will have an opportunity to accept or defer the organ offer. Participants who accept an HIV+ or HIV suspected false positive organ offer will enter the Post-Transplant Follow-up Phase for HIV D+/R+ participants and participants who accept an HIV- (D) organ offer will enter the Post -Transplant Follow-up Phase for HIV D-/R+ participants.\n\nParticipants will then be followed prospectively for up to 5 years. Demographic and clinical data on the donors and recipients (and outcomes) will be extracted from the United Network for organ Sharing (UNOS) and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) databases. During this prospective follow-up, all medical record data includes but is not limited to records of hospitalization, laboratory reports, clinic notes, medication lists, biopsy results, and documentations of current therapies."

For donors with newly diagnosed/discovered HIV-1 infection, any HIV-1 RNA viral load is allowed assuming the donor meets other criteria and the HIV/Transplant Infectious Diseases team is able to predict a tolerable and effective ART regimen for the recipient.\n8. If there is any history of documented antiretroviral resistance in the donor by medical chart review, the HIV/Transplant Infectious Diseases team is able to predict a tolerable and effective ART regimen for the recipient.\n9. Donors with documented chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV+) co-infection (detectable HCV nucleic acid using any licensed assay in a CLIA certified lab) can be used only for HCV+ participants.\n\nLiving Donor Criteria\n\n1.

Fewer than 50 copies/mL of HIV- 1 RNA detectable by ultrasensitive or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.\n6. No evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection\n7. A kidney biopsy showing no evidence of a disease process that would put the donor at increased risk of progressing to end-stage organ failure after donation, or that would present a risk of poor graft function to the recipient.\n8. A complete history of ART regimens and ART resistance.\n9. The study team must be able to predict a safe, tolerable, and effective regimen to be prescribed for the recipient based on the donor's current ART regimen as well as the donor's history of ART resistance.",
