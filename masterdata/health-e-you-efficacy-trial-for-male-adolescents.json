It will test its efficacy among male patients in clinical settings using a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design.",
            "detailedDescription": "Health-E You is a pre-visit, web-based mobile app designed to support an adolescent male youth and his clinician in discussing SRH topics and care. It is shared with an adolescent patient prior to a clinic visit, and contains initial questions that subsequently provide the patient with individually-tailored health information. In addition, the app provides relevant information to the clinician on patients' SRH to optimize the time together as part of the visit. In total, the app takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Health-E You app among male youth ages 12-21 using a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design. A participant will be considered to have completed the study if the participant has completed the baseline assessment, worked through the app, an immediate follow-up assessment, and a 2-month post-visit follow-up assessment. The end of the study is defined as completion of the 2-month follow-up assessment. Hypotheses include compared to usual care, app users will have greater improvements in male method use behaviors (i.e., condom use) as well as knowledge about pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (ST)I prevention methods, male method use self-efficacy, beliefs about male/female methods, improved knowledge about SRH care, self-efficacy talking with a clinician about SRH, beliefs about SRH promotion, and SRH care receipt."
