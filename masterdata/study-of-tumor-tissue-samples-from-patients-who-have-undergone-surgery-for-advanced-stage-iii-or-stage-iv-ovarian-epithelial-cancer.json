To validate the ability of intratumoral tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with suboptimally debulked advanced stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer.\n\nII. To validate the ability of intratumoral TILs to predict PFS in patients with optimally debulked disease.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To validate the ability of intratumoral TILs to predict overall survival of patients with suboptimally debulked disease.\n\nII. To validate the ability of intratumoral TILs to predict overall survival of patients with optimally debulked disease.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients are stratified according to status of debulked disease (suboptimal vs optimal).\n\nPreviously collected tumor tissue samples are analyzed for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) via immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence assays using standard immunostaining."
