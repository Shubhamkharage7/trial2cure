The ASPEN program is tailored to address social communication and behavioral difficulties that young children with developmental delays may experience in early childhood. The ASPEN Program includes 12 sessions where parents are provided with psychoeducation about self-care, child development, and evidence-based strategies. Coaching is also provided to train parents on using evidence-based strategies within the home setting. The ASPEN program is delivered by a student clinician and a peer leader. We hypothesize that coaching strategies delivered by the clinician will lead to primary family caregivers learning evidence-based strategies and this will result in improved child outcomes. We hypothesize that education and family support delivered by peer leaders will help primary family caregivers learn social support strategies and this will lead to improved parent outcomes."
