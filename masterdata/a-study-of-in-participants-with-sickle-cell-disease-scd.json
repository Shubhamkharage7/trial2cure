Female participants of childbearing potential are required to have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to dosing on Day 1.\n\n   Note: Female participants who become of childbearing potential during the study must be willing to have negative urine pregnancy tests to remain in the study.\n3. If sexually active, female participants of childbearing potential must consistently use highly effective methods of contraception consistently throughout the study and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug. If sexually active, male participants must use barrier methods of contraception until 120 days after the last dose of study drug.\n4. Participant has provided written informed consent/assent. For underage participants, both the consent of the participant's legal representative or legal guardian and the participant's assent (where applicable) must be obtained based on local requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant withdrew consent or was noncompliant from the originating GBT021601 clinical study.\n\nCurrent or recent use of voxelotor.
