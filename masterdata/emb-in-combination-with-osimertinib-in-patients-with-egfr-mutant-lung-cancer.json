            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of EMB-01 when given together with osimertinib in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic) and has progressed on standard treatment. EMB-01 and osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth in this type of cancer. EMB-01 in combination with osimertinib may work better in treating patients with EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of EMB-01 given in combination with osimertinib in patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase Ib)\n\nII. To preliminarily assess efficacy and further evaluate the safety and tolerability of EMB-01 plus osimertinib at the RP2D in advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of EMB-01 and osimertinib.\n\nII. To assess the immunogenicity of EMB-01 and osimertinib.\n\nIII. To evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of EMB-01 and osimertinib. (Phase I)\n\nIV. To continue to evaluate the antitumor activity of EMB-01 and osimertinib such as progression free survival, best overall response, duration of response, and clinical benefit rate. (Phase II)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the relationships between pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, adverse event profiles, and anticancer activity of EMB-01 combined with osimertinib.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of EMB-01 and osimertinib followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive EMB-01 intravenously (IV) weekly. Patients also receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment cycles repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter."
