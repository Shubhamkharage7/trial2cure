            "briefSummary": "This study investigates how well radium-223 works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer than has spread to the bones (bone metastases). Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death. Furthermore, many men with notably advanced disease have been found to have abnormalities in DNA repair. The purpose of this research is to study the role of a DNA repair pathway in prostate cancer, specifically in response to administration of radium-223, an FDA-approved drug known to cause DNA damage to cancerous cells. Understanding how defects in the DNA repair pathway affects radium-223 treatment of prostate, may help doctors help plan effective treatment in future patients.",

Patients undergo collection of blood every 1-3 months during radium Ra 223 dichloride treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5 years from the date of treatment completion."
