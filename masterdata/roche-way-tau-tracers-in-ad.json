The study will directly compare AD and OC with these three next-generation TAU radioligands and compare each of them with historical data of the current most widely used first generation radioligand, 18F-AV1451. Upto38 (30 AD (Amyloid +)and 8 OC (Amyloid -), matched for age and sex with A+ subjects) male and female subjects aged 50-100 will be enrolled in this study protocol: up to 8 for Cohort 1, up to 8 for Cohort 2, and up to 22 for Cohort 3. The study consists of three cohorts: Cohort 1: Up to8 AD subjects (A+; CDR 0.5 and 1)will receive two PET scans in random order, with receiving either18F-RO948 or18F-MK6240 at the first scan. A third scan with 18F-GTP1is possible, depending on timing and radiotracer availability Cohort 2:Up to8 OC (A-; CDR=0)subjects will receive two PET scans in random order, with receiving either18F-RO948or 18F-MK6240 at the first scan. A third scan with 18F-GTP1is possible, depending on timing and radiotracer availability Cohort 3:Up to 22 (A+; CDR = 0, .5 and 1) subjects will receive three PET scans in random order, with receiving 18F-RO94818F-MK6240 or18F-GTP1at the first scan.
