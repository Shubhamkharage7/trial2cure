            "briefSummary": "The LockeT II study is a single center, prospective randomized study. It is intended to study the effectiveness of using LockeT device to gain hemostasis after venous procedures as compared to Manual Compression (MC). Approximately 110 patients will be enrolled.",
            "detailedDescription": "The volume of catheter ablation procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias are on the rise in the United States and worldwide. Despite decrease in complication rates due to refinement in ablation tools and techniques, achieving vascular hemostasis following large-bore sheath femoral access remains a challenge. Thus, MC remains the current standard of care. However, MC requires up to 8 hours of prolonged bedrest, which is associated with longer length of stay and complications from indwelling catheters.\n\nAnother method of vascular closure is the figure-of-eight (FoE) stitch - a subcutaneous suture that has been evaluated to achieve homeostasis following major cardiovascular procedures.\n\nIn recent years, invasive, vascular closure devices have become popular. However, results continue to suggest that the risk versus benefit has not been definitively demonstrated. Instead, the LockeT is a new suture retention device designed to closely mimic manual compression by distributing the tension of a FoE stitch over a larger surface area. In such a way, patients can have the benefits of MC without a healthcare professional to stand bedside."
