            "detailedDescription": "The Central Hypothesis underlying this study is that splenic ultrasound stimulation activates the splenic anti-inflammatory pathway, thereby producing reduction in circulating macrophage cytokine production, reduction of neutrophil invasiveness, or induction of phenotypic transition in circulating immune cells (e.g., M1 to M2 transition in macrophages) in patients with partial thickness wounds that cover \\<20% body surface area.\n\nApproximately 24 subjects will participate in this study. Male and female subjects of all races and ethnicities will be recruited for study from the ethnically diverse patient population of the LAC+USC Burn Center from the surrounding area.\n\nPhase 0\n\nBurn wound subjects will be screened and enrolled at the LAC+USC Burn Center located in Los Angeles, California. No other sites, neither regional nor outside of the United States are going to participate in enrollment of subjects.\n\nA General Electric LOGIQ E10 ultrasound machine with a C1-6-XD clear probe, will be used to selectively deliver pulsed ultrasound to the spleen.\n\n12 months.\n\n28 days or until healed (whichever comes first)"
