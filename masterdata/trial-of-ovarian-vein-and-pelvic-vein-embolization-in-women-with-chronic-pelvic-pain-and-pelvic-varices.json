            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see if a randomized controlled trial of ovarian vein and pelvic vein embolization versus venography alone could determine outcomes for women with chronic pelvic pain and pelvic varicose veins.\n\nThe data gathered will assist in addressing changes in quality of life in patients who have ovarian/pelvic vein embolization versus no embolization.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a randomized research trial of bilateral ovarian vein embolization (OVE) and pelvic vein embolization (PVE) in women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP), dilated and incompetent ovarian veins \u22656mm and pelvic varices (\u22651 veins, \\>5 mm diameter) to assess for change in pain. Pain will be assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) and other relevant, validated quality of life metrics including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Item Bank v.1.0 - Pain Intensity, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Scale v1.2 - Global Health, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and EuroQol five-dimension (EQ 5D). The target population includes women age greater than or equal to 18 years who are pre-menopausal and have symptoms, and clinical and imaging findings corresponding to Pelvic Venous Disease (PeVD). Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to embolization (treatment group) or venography only (control group). Follow-up will be assessed weekly and at 1, and 3 months and 6 months post procedure to assess for changes in quality of life in patients who receive ovarian/pelvic vein embolization versus no embolization."
