The assessments of safety and efficacy in Study COAV101A12308 will continue for 15 years from the date of OAV101 administration in the previous clinical trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is comprised of a Baseline Period and 3 Follow-up Periods. Follow-up Periods 1 and 2 consist of in-person visits and Period 3 consists of tele-visits. Follow-up Periods 1 and 2, which includes Baseline through Year 5 visits, assessments will be performed at the Investigational site. During Follow-up Period 3 (Year 6 to up to Year 15 after OAV101 administration), participants/caregivers will be contacted using tele-visits annually for remote assessments. All patients will enter the study at the baseline visit and continue until 15 years since OAV101 administration is reached. Total duration of participation in the study will be dependent upon time of enrollment relative to OAV101 administration and will vary by participant."
