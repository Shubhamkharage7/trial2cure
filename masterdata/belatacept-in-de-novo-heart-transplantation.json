Belatacept (NULOJIX) is an anti-rejection medication that is available through a prescription from a doctor. In this research study, belatacept is being used in an investigational manner (not for the purpose that it is approved for).",
            "detailedDescription": "Long-term outcomes after heart transplant remain suboptimal with renal failure and cardiac allograft vasculopathy contributing to morbidity and mortality. Belatacept is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in kidney transplant recipients on the basis of two randomized controlled trials, which demonstrated important renal sparing benefits, a reduction in de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and improved long-term outcomes. In this study, ten (10) primary heart transplant recipients will receive belatacept in addition to mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and a tacrolimus tapering regimen."

Potential candidates for whom a calcineurin inhibitor other than tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae) is anticipated after transplant. If during the course of the study, a participant is transitioned to another calcineurin inhibitor due to side effects or inability to achieve stable therapeutic trough levels, they may continue in the study at the discretion of the investigator\n23.
