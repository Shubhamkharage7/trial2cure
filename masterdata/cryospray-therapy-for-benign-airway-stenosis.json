            "briefSummary": "This is a clinical evaluation to assess the effectiveness of cryospray therapy used in addition to current standard of care endoscopic therapies in preventing short term recurrent airway stenosis with a multicentric outcome evaluation. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of SCT to standard endoscopic treatment of benign airway stenosis will result in decreased stenosis recurrence at 6 months as estimated by quantitative radiologic assessment of the stenotic volume.",
            "detailedDescription": "Spray cryo treatment of tracheal stenosis has the potential for long-lasting endoscopic management of BCAS and is used as part of routine clinical care by many physicians, but there is a relative paucity of peer-reviewed data, and no randomized controlled trial has been performed. Thus, the study could potentially show that the use of spray cryo therapy could allow patients to undergo fewer procedures to treat this condition, or lengthen the amount of time required in between these procedures, or play a role in the resolution of this condition."
