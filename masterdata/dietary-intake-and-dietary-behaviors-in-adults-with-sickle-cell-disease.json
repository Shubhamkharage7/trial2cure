            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSickle Cell Disease (SCD) causes blood cells form a crescent shape. It is caused by a genetic mutation in the hemoglobin gene. People with SCD are at increased risk for illnesses like stroke, chronic pain, and heart problems, as well as decreased overall health and well-being. Researchers want to learn more about how nutrition and diet can help relieve or reduce the symptoms of SCD.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo understand how diet, dietary patterns and behaviors, nutrition, and other related factors in adults with SCD affect their overall health.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 and older with SCD.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a review of their medical records. They will take a pregnancy test if needed.\n\nParticipants will have a physical exam and medical history. Their height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will be measured. They can complete this exam (1) via telehealth along with a visit to an outpatient laboratory center or (2) by going to the NIH Clinical Center.\n\nParticipants will complete 2 interviews about their diet. They will talk about the foods they ate in the past 24 hours. They will also complete 1 interview about diet-related behaviors such as food shopping and cooking. They can complete the interviews in person, by phone, or by telehealth visit.\n\nParticipants will complete surveys about their demographics (such as age and gender), SCD pain, mood, stress, diet, and nutrition. It may take about 1 hour to complete all of the surveys.\n\nParticipants will give blood and urine samples. They will need to fast for at least 8 hours overnight before giving blood samples.\n\nParticipation will last for about 2 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study seeks to determine dietary intake and behaviors of adults with Sickle Cell Disease through the use of a cross-sectional design using mixed methods. The premise for the study is based on the potential role of nutritional status in sickle cell disease outcomes in physical health and psychosocial health. The study will recruit outpatient adults with the diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease, and will include patients with multiple clinical phenotypes and genotypes.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary objective is to assess the dietary intake and behaviors of outpatient adults with SCD within the context of social determinants of health.\n\nSecondary Objective 1: Identify associations between dietary intake and behaviors with clinical severity outcomes.\n\nSecondary objective 2: Identify associations between dietary intake and behaviors with psychosocial variables.\n\nSecondary objective 3: Identify associations between food access and dietary intake and behaviors.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Measure dietary intake and behaviors using 24-hour dietary recall data, participant survey responses and diet-related laboratory results\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Identify associations between dietary intake and behaviors with: 1) social determinants of health (related to socioeconomic status, birthplace, neighborhood disadvantage, food environment); 2) clinical variables SCD of genotype, clinical phenotype (SCD related diagnoses and complications), clinical severity (chronic pain severity and frequency), medication use and\n\nhistory of treatments, and SCD related laboratory studies; 3) psychosocial variables of mood, self-esteem, perceived stress, social support, self-mastery, self-compassion, racial identity, and stigmatization as measured by self-reported responses.\n\nStudy Population:\n\nSample size: 80; gender: male and female; age: \\>= 18 years of age; health status: diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease\n\nDescription of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:\n\nThe planned facility is the NIH Clinical Center utilizing in-person and telehealth visits to conduct interviews on personal and medical history, dietary behavior and dietary intake and to measure anthropometrics and weight. Electronic administration of surveys will be used to capture demographic, psychosocial and clinical variables.\n\nStudy Duration:\n\n24 months\n\nParticipant Duration:\n\n2 weeks"
