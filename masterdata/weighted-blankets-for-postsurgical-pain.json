            "briefSummary": "The strongest psychological predictor of persistent pain after surgery is anxiety before surgery. The weight of blanket a person uses overnight may alter both anxiety and pain levels. The proposed study will determine whether a heavier or lighter blanket alters presurgical anxiety or postsurgical pain in individuals undergoing a breast surgery. We will also study whether any blanket-induced changes in postsurgical pain are related to reductions in anxiety before surgery induced by the blanket. Finally, we will examine clinical and psychological factors that might explain differences in how surgical patients respond to blanket weight. This research will improve our understanding of whether blanket weight can alter anxiety before a surgery or pain after a surgery."
