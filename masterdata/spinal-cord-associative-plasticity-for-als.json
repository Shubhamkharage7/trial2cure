            "briefSummary": "Veterans are at higher risk than non-Veterans of falling ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nThe investigators have shown that synchronized stimulation over the brain and cervical spinal cord can temporarily strengthen weakened nerve circuits between the brain and hand muscles in people with ALS.\n\nThe current proposal will take the next step of individualizing this intervention, then applying it repetitively in an attempt to achieve direct clinical benefit on hand strength and function.\n\nFollowing an initial 2-3 month period of optimizing the intervention for each individual, the investigators will compare the effects of two-week programs of paired brain-spinal stimulation with or without hand exercises.",
            "detailedDescription": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is more prevalent in Veterans than civilians, leading to ALS being considered a Service-Connected condition by the VA. ALS features incomplete degeneration of upper and lower motor neuron pathways within the spinal cord, a circumstance resembling that of spinal cord injury (SCI). Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) has demonstrated remarkable potential to activate damaged circuits after SCI to improve motor and autonomic function.\n\nPartly funded by a prior VA award (RX002527), the investigators have preliminary data demonstrating that pairing subthreshold cervical TSCS pulses with suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses can enhance hand muscle motor evoked potentials when the cortical pulse reaches the cervical spinal cord 0-5 milliseconds prior to the spinal pulse. This evidence for immediate facilitation of the response to one pair of pulses suggests that if given repetitively, this approach could mediate spinal cord associative plasticity (SCAP) outlasting the period of paired stimulation. The investigators propose that increasing neural plasticity in this manner could be applied as a method to strengthen volitional (cortical) motor output and/or to 'prime' weakened circuits for improved responses to task-oriented exercise.\n\nBoth exercise and neuromodulation are understudied in ALS. Though not likely to cure the underlying disease mechanism, these approaches have the potential to mediate symptomatic benefit. The investigators strive to find better ways to conduct disease-oriented research that may provide direct clinical benefit to research participants with ALS and simultaneously increase scientific understanding. Additionally, most ALS clinical study entry criteria heavily favor those at earlier stages of disease. Strict entry criteria are understandable from the scientific perspective. However, we have repeatedly observed the frustration and rejection felt by individuals with ALS who cannot enter clinical trials. This proposed study does not restrict entry by time since symptom onset. The investigators thereby hope to produce more generalizable knowledge by performing a phased study:\n\n1. Optimization: SCAP synaptic pairing interval and repetitive frequency pattern will be individually optimized to enhance hand muscle excitability and dexterity. The investigators hypothesize that pairs of stimuli with TMS arriving at the cervical spinal cord up to 2 ms prior to TSCS, delivered in an 'intermittent theta burst' pattern, will produce the strongest facilitation of hand neural circuits.\n2. Consolidation: Two-week programs of SCAP alone versus SCAP plus task-oriented hand exercise will be compared. The investigators hypothesize that the combined intervention will result in greater and longer lasting physiological and clinical benefits than SCAP by itself.\n\nThere are currently no clinical studies in the world involving magnetic brain paired with phasic electrical spinal stimulation for ALS. Therefore, safety needs to be meticulously tracked. Aside from detailed clinical safety measures, the investigators will analyze serum biomarkers drawn at baseline and various stages of the study to better understand whether baseline levels of neurodegenerative, excitotoxic, inflammatory, and neurotropic biomarkers associate with either beneficial or detrimental responses to SCAP and exercise interventions."
