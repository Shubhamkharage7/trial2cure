            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I, first time in human, single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy adult male and female (of non-childbearing potential) participants performed at a single Clinical Unit.\n\nThe study will be carried out in 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Eight participants will participate in each cohort. Within each cohort, 6 participants will be randomized to receive AZD0233, and 2 participants will be randomized to receive placebo.\n\nPart A of the study will be a sequential SAD design. Five dose levels of AZD0233 are planned to be investigated (dose 1 to dose 5), 3 (dose 3, dose 4 and dose 5) of which will also be assessed in participants of Japanese descent.\n\nPart A of the study will comprise:\n\n* A Screening Period of maximum 26 days (Day -28 to Day -2).\n* An inpatient Period of up to 7 days (Day -1 to Day 6):\n* Cohorts 1A, 2A, 3A (including a Japanese sub-Cohort), 4A (including a Japanese sub-Cohort), and 5A (including a Japanese sub-Cohort): participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from Day -1 before study intervention administration until Day 4 (72 hours after administration of the study intervention).\n* Cohort 3A \\[food effect (FE)\\]: Participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from Day -1 before study intervention administration and will check-out on Day 6 (72 hours after administration of the study intervention). The impact of food intake on the PK of AZD0233 will be evaluated in the same participants in Cohort 3A after a 24-hour washout period on Day 2.\n\nNote: Japanese sub-Cohort from Cohort 3A will not be part of the FE study.\n\n\u2022 A Follow-up Period of 7 days after the administration of the study intervention which will consist of 1 Follow-up Visit on Day 8 for Cohorts 1A, 2A, 3A (Japanese sub-Cohort only), 4A, and 5A (including their Japanese sub-Cohorts) and 1 Follow-up Visit on Day 10 for Cohort 3A, for which participants will return to the Clinical Unit for follow-up assessments.\n\nPart B will be a sequential MAD study. Participants will be na\u00efve to AZD0233, i.e., will not have participated in Part A of this study. There will be 3 dose levels in 4 cohorts, including a sub-cohort of participants of Japanese descent at the highest dose.\n\nPart B will consist of:\n\n* A Screening Period of maximum 26 days (Day -28 to Day -2).\n* An Inpatient Period of 14 days (Day -1 to Day 13): Participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from Day -1 before study intervention administration until Day 13 (\\>48 hours after administration of the last dose of study intervention in case of QD (once daily) dosing and \\>36 hours after the last dose for BID (twice a day) in case of dosing).\n* A Follow-up Period of 7 days after the administration of the last dose of study intervention which will consist of 1 Follow-up Visit on Day 17."
