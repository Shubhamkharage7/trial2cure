            "detailedDescription": "The study is a formative qualitative study design with the intention of using findings for the adaptation and evidence-based intervention.\n\nStudy Approach: The process of modifying an evidence-based intervention (EBI) without competing with or contradicting its core elements or internal logic is referred to as ''adaptation''. To effectively implement the intervention, this study will use the ADAPT-ITT. Drs. Wingood and DiClemente have systematically developed a framework for adapting HIV-related evidence-based interventions, known as the ''ADAPT-ITT'' model. The ADAPT-ITT model consists of 8 sequential phases that inform HIV prevention providers and researchers of a prescriptive method for adapting evidence-based interventions. ADAPT-ITT has been applied with diverse populations of adolescents and adults in domestic and international settings. Due to time restrictions on the execution of this study, the first three phases of the ADAPT-ITT will be implemented.\n\nPhase 1: Assessment involves conducting focus groups with member of the target population. For this study, it will be Black girls between the ages of 13-18 years old. The purpose of this step is to gain input from members of the target population on the intervention before it is introduced. Before implementing the adaptation of SIHLE, it is necessary for facilitators to conduct focus groups with girls who are from the target community and age group.\n\nPhase 2: A community advisory board will be created and will involve: leaders of organizations that serve Black adolescent girls in Paterson and Black adolescent girls whom live in Paterson and are a part of the target population. The community advisory board will aid in deciding on the appropriate intervention and modify intervention components to fit the target population. Within the ADAPT-ITT framework, the next phase must include the Decision making phase. Decision phase includes deciding on which HIV intervention to implement on the target population. This stage, the PI has selected SIHLE intervention to be conducted based on a previous needs' assessment on the community. Since there are very limited interventions for Black girls that address HIV/AIDS and drug use, adapting SIHLE to fit the needs of the girls in the community will be implemented.\n\nPhase 3: Adaptation involves using an innovative pretesting methodology known as theater testing to adapt the EBI. Using this methodology, a subset of 5-10 Black adolescent girls from the community will be invited to a central location to respond to a demonstration of the adapted SIHLE intervention.\n\nThe purpose of this registration is for Phase 3 of the study."
