            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates a community-based physical activity program for underserved cancer survivors. Cancer and its treatment significantly influence physical, psychosocial, and cognitive functioning. Historically, community sites (local and national) have not been staffed to offer support services such as physical, and occupational therapies (everyday life activities to promote health and well-being) or nutrition counselling, and do not offer a whole-person model of care. In this study, researchers have partnered with the YMCA to provide tailored home-based exercise programs for underserved cancer patients and survivors. Accessing exercise professionals may allow patients to prevent acute problems from becoming chronic, long-lasting physically weak impairments that directly influence patients' quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a community-based 12-week physical activity intervention.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the effectiveness of a virtual physical activity intervention by evaluating pre-post changes in quality of life (QoL).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE (OPTIONAL):\n\nI. To virtually assess changes in functional performance in a small subgroup.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants participate in virtual exercise classes at least three times a week (TIW) over 20-60 minutes for 12 weeks. Participants are expected to work towards achieving the national physical activity exercise guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic based physical activity and 2-3 strength training sessions each week.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 1 week."
