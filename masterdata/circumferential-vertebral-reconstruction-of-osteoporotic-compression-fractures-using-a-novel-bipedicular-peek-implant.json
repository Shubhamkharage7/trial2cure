            "briefSummary": "The RECONSTRUCT study is a multi-center, prospective, single arm, post-market, pilot study to evaluate clinical and radiologic outcome data regarding the use of the Vertebral Implant PEEK (VIP) implant in the treatment of symptomatic, acute (\\<8week) vertebral compression fractures who have failed conservative care strategies.",
            "detailedDescription": "Vertebral compression fractures affect an estimated 1.4 million patients in the world annually and incidence rates rise exponentially with age, especially in women. Outcomes following non-interventional management of these injuries are generally poor, largely as a consequence of opioid requirements, prolonged immobilization, and bedrest. As a result, interventional techniques such as balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with or without implantable devices are currently regarded as the standard of care for select patients with acute painful osteoporotic compression fractures. These procedures relieve fracture pain by stabilizing the fracture site using cement.\n\nAlternative interventional techniques include percutaneous vertebral augmentation, which combine cement injection with implantable devices, such as the SpineJack\u00ae and KIVA\u00ae devices. The RECONSTRUCT study will build on the outcomes of the SAKOS and KAST clinical trails that evaluated the SpineJack\u00ae and KIVA\u00ae devices, respectively.\n\nThe Vertebral Implant PEEK (VIP) implant (V-STRUT\u00a9 manufactured by Hyprevention) has undergone both clinical and pre-clinical testing. Static and dynamic bending of the implant has been evaluated to demonstrate that the product is capable of supporting in-situ loading, and increase fracture load and energy to fracture.\n\nA total of 30 eligible subjects with a diagnosis of osteoporotic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine, as confirmed by MRI scan, and who are treated with the Vertebral Implant PEEK (VIP) device will be asked to join the study. No placebo or control will be utilized during this study.\n\nRECONSTRUCT has been designed with the intention of achieving two goals: 1) to inform the design of larger controlled clinical trials in the future and 2) to assess the safety of the study device within the patient sample."

A part of the implant is embedded into the pedicle, thus providing posterior support. The other part of the device, located in the vertebral body, presents a central canula and lateral perforations, which allow acrylic bone cement diffusion, filling of the vertebral body, filling and fixing the implant, and supporting of the upper endplate. The combination of the implant and the cement allows the treatment of vertebral fractures.",
