This study will determine if daily oral supplementation (3 months) with a supplement that increases NO in the body, i.e., nitrate-rich beetroot juice, improves vascular, motor and cognitive function in patients with CKD; this study will also provide insight into the biological reasons (mechanisms) by which supplementation with nitrate-rich beetroot juice improves vascular function in these patients. Overall, this research will provide scientific evidence supporting the use of nitrate-rich beetroot juice for preserving physiological function and preventing co-morbid clinical conditions and disability in CKD."
