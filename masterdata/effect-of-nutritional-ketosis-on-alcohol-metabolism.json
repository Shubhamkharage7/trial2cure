The labs visits will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to study the brain, measuring levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), lactate, neurotransmitters glutamate, and Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).",
            "detailedDescription": "The research study is being conducted to better understand the effects of ketosis on brain functioning and the acute effects of alcohol. Healthy participants will undergo three randomly assigned dietary interventions, each lasting three days, followed by a study lab visit day on day 4. The three interventions are: (1) Eat a ketogenic diet for 3 days, (2) eat a control diet for 3 days with a ketone supplement drink, and (3) eat a control diet for 3 days. The dietary interventions will be spaced 1 week apart. The ketone supplement drink (Kenetik, Vitanav inc, Washington DC) is a dietary supplement that has been extensively studied in humans and is designated by the FDA as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). Its use in this study is experimental. On the day of the 3 labs visits days, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to study the brain. Specifically, levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (a coenzyme that is important for energy metabolism), lactate (a metabolite produced during energy metabolism), and neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. Following the scans, participants will be provided a dose of alcohol that will elevate participants breath alcohol levels to approximately 0.08% to measure the acute effects of alcohol."
