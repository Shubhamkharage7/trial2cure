After the 2 month intervention, all participants can continue the study and will all receive the protein supplement for an additional 10-months.",

The main question it aims to answer is if participants who take the protein supplement for 2 months twice daily have less fat in the liver, when compared to participants who take a placebo or \"fake supplement\". Participants will be randomly assigned to the protein supplement or placebo and neither study team nor participants will know which group they are assigned to and will have tests done They will have an MRI to measure fat in the liver, a body x-ray to measure body composition and a blood draw when they start and finish their assigned supplement.\n\nAfter the 2 month intervention, all participants can continue the study and will all receive the protein supplement for an additional 10-months."
