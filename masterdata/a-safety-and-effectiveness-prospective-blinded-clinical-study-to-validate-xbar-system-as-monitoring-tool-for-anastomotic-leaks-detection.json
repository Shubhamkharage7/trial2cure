            "detailedDescription": "Study design: Pivotal, Prospective, Blinded, multi-center study. Study Population: This study will enroll approximately 190 eligible subjects undergoing scheduled colorectal surgery with anastomosis, without concomitant diversion.\n\nxBar is an investigational device intended for post-op monitoring of patients undergoing GI surgery. The device is comprised of a surgical drain with embedded electrodes, connected to a small electronic device that records and relays data from the electrodes. The collected data is processed for early detection of complications.\n\nStudy description: The study is intended to validate the performance of the xBar system's anastomotic leak detection monitoring tool following colorectal resection with drain placement. During the index surgery the xBar device will be placed according to institution standard procedures and data recording will commence for a period of at least 3 days. Safety and complication detection performance will be evaluated retrospectively by comparing the diagnosis on a subject level done by the clinical team, who is blinded to xBar results, and the system."
