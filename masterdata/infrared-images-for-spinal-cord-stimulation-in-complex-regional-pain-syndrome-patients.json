Outcome measures include pain (NRS), CRPS Severity Score (CSS), Quality of Life (SF-36), and neuropathic pain score (painDETECT).\n\nParticipants will have an image of their feet taken perpendicularly with a 1-inch space from all four sides using a FLIR T420 or T62101 camera with 320\\*240 resolution.\n\nParticipants will also complete questionnaires about the average pain, CRPS severity, quality of life, and neuropathic pain.",
