            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests the safety of positron emission tomography (PET) guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and how well it works to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that has up to 5 sites of progression (oligoprogression) compared to standard SBRT. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. A PET scan is an imaging test that looks at your tissues and organs using a small amount of a radioactive substance. It also checks for cancer and may help find cancer remaining in areas already treated. Using a PET scan for SBRT planning may help increase the dose of radiation given to the most resistant part of the cancer in patients with oligoprogressive NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. PET adaptive SBRT is both feasible and safe and allows for a higher total dose of radiation through an inter-fraction simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) based on inter-fraction PET uptake, leading to improved local control outcomes compared to current standard SBRT planning without a SIB.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the duration of local and distant control followed PET adaptive SBRT treatment compared to standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).\n\nII. Evaluate the utility of measuring circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) before, during and after SBRT in conjuction with biological imaging to assess early disease response.\n\nIII. Identify genomic predictors to predict for distant progression. IV. Determine durability of current systemic therapy with SBRT to oligoprogressive sites.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Biomarker changes based on ctDNA before, during and after treatment. II. Changes in fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with SBRT and combined checkpoint inhibitor during and after treatment and correlation with local and distant control.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo 5 SBRT treatments every other day on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) or PET/CT and blood collection throughout study.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo 3 SBRT treatments every other day week 1, undergo PET/CT and replanning one month post SBRT, then undergo 2 additional treatments with SIB on study. Patients also undergo CT or PET/CT and blood collection throughout study."
