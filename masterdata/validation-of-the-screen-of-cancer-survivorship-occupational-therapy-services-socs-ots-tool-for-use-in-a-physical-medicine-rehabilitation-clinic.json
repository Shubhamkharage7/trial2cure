Explore the SOCS-OTS for use in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM\\&R) clinic by means of diagnostic testing including sensitivity and specificity.\n\nSecondary Aims\n\n1. Explore whether the SOCS-OTS identifies the likelihood that the presence or absence of OT referral is correctly predicted. To accomplish this, the likelihood ratios, and predictive values of the SOCS-OTS will be assessed.\n2. Determine associations between the need for OT and demographic factors such as stage of cancer, cancer treatment etc.\n3. Establish test-retest reliability of the SOCS-OTS."
