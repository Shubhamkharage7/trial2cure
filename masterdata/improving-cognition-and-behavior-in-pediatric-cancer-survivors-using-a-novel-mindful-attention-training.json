As such, the primary goal of this project is to examine the outcomes of a novel, mindful attention training in this population and assess the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and adherence. Specifically, PCS will be randomly assigned to one of two adaptive attention training groups ('Engage') and complete tasks on the device for up to 8 weeks. Participants will also complete pre- and post-training assessments of cognition and behavior.\n\nAn additional cohort of no-contact participants will be asked to complete the assessments at baseline and end of study only to assess the feasibility and reliability of the assessment measures. This cohort will be enrolled separately and not randomized.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that completion of 'Engage' training for the randomized cohorts will result in enhanced attentional control beyond the active comparator group that extends to other aspects of cognition in PCS."
