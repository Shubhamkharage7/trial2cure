            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe eyeGENE (Registered Trademark) program is a research resource for inherited eye conditions which includes genotypic and phenotypic data, imaging, and a corresponding biobank of DNA samples from people with a variety of eye diseases. Since 2007 this registry has been helping researchers learn more about the genetic sources for many inherited eye diseases. These findings helped them create better treatments. Now researchers want to expand eyeGENE (Registered Trademark) to include more people for certain eye diseases.\n\nObjective: To collect information and DNA samples for the study of eye diseases.\n\n* Primary objective\n\n  --To expand the current eyeGENE (Registered Trademark) data repository with targeted participant accrual\n* Secondary objectives\n\n  * To enhance recruitment for clinical trials and investigations in inherited eye diseases\n\n    * To establish genotype-phenotype correlations for rare eye diseases\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople of any age with certain eye diseases. These can include aniridia; Best disease; blue-cone monochromacy; corneal dystrophy; and disorders of pigmentation, such as albinism. Relatives unaffected by the eye disease of interest may also be needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nResearchers will select participants based on their diagnosis. The data may include images and test results from eye exams.\n\nParticipants will provide a sample of saliva. They will receive a kit with written instructions. They will spit in a tube and mail it to the NIH.\n\nParticipants may be asked to provide a blood sample. The blood may be drawn at the NIH or at a local clinic.\n\nThe eyeGENE (Registered Trademark) repository will offer researchers data about the participants eye conditions. The data may include pictures of their eyes, results of the genetic testing, and history of other diseases. Researchers will be able to see data such as age and gender, but they will not see names, dates of birth, or contact information.",

Progress in research on inherited eye disease is augmented by the availability of patient DNA coupled to phenotypic information. To expand the current eyeGENE (Registered Trademark) data repository, participants will be accrued from targeted rare and ultra-rare disease populations.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n-To expand the current eyeGENE (Registered Trademark) data repository with targeted participant accrual\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To enhance recruitment for clinical trials and investigations in inherited eye diseases\n* To establish genotype-phenotype correlations for rare eye diseases"
