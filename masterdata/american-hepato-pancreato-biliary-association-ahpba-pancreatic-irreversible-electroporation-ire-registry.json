            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to create a registry to provide insight into treatment selection and treatment outcome of pancreatic IRE in order to develop an evidence base such that physicians can provide the best possible care to patients with pancreatic cancer requiring surgical interventions.\n\nThe investigators seek a better understanding of the uses of ablation in the treatment of unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumors and the limitations, concerns and complications that earlier users have.",
            "detailedDescription": "Rationale:\n\nThe rationale for creating this multi-center clinical database is to optimally collect clinical and pathological data on patients with neoplasms in order to facilitate future clinical observational and outcomes-based research.\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\nPatients will be considered eligible for inclusion into the database if they meet the following eligibility criteria:\n\nEvidence/suspicion of Pancreatic neoplasm \u2265 18 years of age\n\nExclusion Criteria Patients will be considered ineligible for inclusion into the database if they are not able to give consent.\n\nInclusion of Women, Minorities and Vulnerable Subjects This protocol will include women and minority populations. Vulnerable subjects (prisoners, children, mentally disabled persons) will not be included in the study population.\n\nPrimary Study Objective(s):\n\nTo provide insight in treatment selection and treatment outcome of Pancreatic IRE in order to develop an evidence base such that physicians can provide the best possible care to patients with Pancreatic cancer requiring surgical intervention.\n\nSecondary Study Objective(s):\n\nTo provide data on adverse events and complications related to IRE treatment.\n\nThe AHPBA will be responsible for data collection and will periodically audit the data for quality assurance purposes. The AHPBA will review outcomes reported by each participating Research Institution and if outcomes are in the lower percentile, the investigators will be offered support to analyze the reasons for the suboptimal outcomes and may seek support to improve outcomes. The participating Research Institutions will receive a certificate annually that acknowledges their participation in the Research Project.\n\nGoal and Aims of Registry?\n\nThe Specific Aims are:\n\n* Gain a better understanding of the uses of ablation in the treatment of unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumors\n* Understand the limitations, concerns, and complications that earlier users of ablation in the treatment of unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumors have\n\nCreate a multi-institutional group that will both enroll in this registry study, but more importantly enroll in future, prospective ablation in the treatments of unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumors studies. Any patient undergoing a soft tissue ablation may be included in this study. To confirm, you will always own your data and the registry will be used as data storage until you release your data for evaluation on a project-by-project basis.\n\nWhat Patients are Eligible?\n\n\u2022 Any patient to which the treating physician believes that ablation of their soft tissue would be feasible in the care of their disease.\n\nPatients who can be followed and can provide outcome data to achieve the Goals and Aims of the Registry.\n\nTo participate, the only thing we need to obtain from your site is a regulatory approval letter stating that it is acceptable to collaborate with your patients de-identified data (sample data collection protocol is attached) and that you will be consenting your patients to this data collaboration (The Registry).\n\nCase report forms/ data collection sheets are attached The data entry will be web based. All treatments must be entered-not just the first treatment. All follow up-up to 2 years or until death of patient-must be entered. Common follow up is every 3-4 months for first year and every 6 months for second year. In order to ensure data accuracy we require that, for the first 5 patients entered, the data sheets and their supporting documentation (de-identified labs, treatment dictation, etc.) be sent to us so we can make sure the data entry is correct and complete (e.g., lesion dimensions, measures of response or progression, etc.)."
