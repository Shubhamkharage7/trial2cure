Surgery is one of these stressors, and previous research has therefore shown increased rates of morbidity and mortality in frail patients undergoing surgery. Prehabilitation programs can help mitigate the negative outcomes associated with frailty. The investigators hope to implement a newly developed prehabilitation pilot program in the Maine Medical Center Surgical Oncology Clinic to initially evaluate adherence, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life.",

The investigators hope to implement a newly developed prehabilitation pilot program in the Maine Medical Center Surgical Oncology Clinic to initially evaluate adherence, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life.\n\nThe investigators now hope to implement this prehabilitation program in the clinics at Maine Medical Center. Our long term goal is the introduce this program in all surgical specialties; but first, the investigators plan to assess adherence, patient self-efficacy, frailty and health-related quality of life through a pilot study in the surgical oncology clinic."
