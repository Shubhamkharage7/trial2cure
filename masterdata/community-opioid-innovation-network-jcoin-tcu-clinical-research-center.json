            "briefSummary": "There are two study periods for the TCU JCOIN project. The primary aims of Study 1 (approved by the TCU IRB) are (1) to gather information from staff on the current treatment referral process within participating communities and (2) to learn about the existing interrelationships between medical and community behavioral health (CBH) providers. TCU IRB granted approval for Phase 1 on 11/07/19, approval number: 1920-60-AM1. Study 2 (under current review by the TCU IRB) includes recruitment across 18 community collaboration sites across 3 states; these communities will participate in the TCU Opioid-Treatment Linkage Model (O-TLM) protocol. The O-TLM is focused on best practices for improving screening, identifying and linking to MOUD providers, reducing stigma, and addressing other important factors that impact justice-involved individuals returning to their communities. Along with their agency records, information collected from justice-involved individuals within the target communities will be examined to assess O-TLM impact on improving public health and public safety outcomes. Furthermore, stakeholder staff across community organizations, including criminal justice and treatment agencies, will be asked to complete surveys on the O-TLM regarding its acceptability and adoption, as well as on best training strategies."
