This approach is intended to gain a better understanding and insight into identifying new opportunities for drug approvals in this setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will evaluate efficacy of treatment with CPX-351in participants with MDS while using a new stratification tool to predict outcomes of patients following HMA failure in order to gain a better understanding and insight into identifying new opportunities for drug approvals in this setting.\n\nCPX-351is an investigational (experimental) drug for the indication of myelodysplastic syndrome that works by delivering two chemotherapy medications (daunorubicin and cytarabine) together which are then concentrated into the bone marrow (the part of the body that makes blood cells). CPX-351 is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the indication of myelodysplastic syndrome. This drug is approved by theFDA for the indication of acute myeloid leukemia. One or more of the Investigators conducting this study serve as consultants for the company that makes products used in this study. These financial interests are within permissible limits established by the local institutional Conflict of Interest Policy.\n\nPrior to beginning treatment, all eligible participants will be grouped into low risk versus high risk based on a stratification tool used to determine their disease. Group 1 will be low risk participants and group 2 will be high risk participants. All study participants will get the same study drug, CPX-351. Participants will receive the CPX-351 on days 1, 3 and 5 of the first 28 day cycle. After participants finish the first round of treatment and based on their response they may be eligible for another 4 cycles of treatment. The participant's doctor will inform them if this is an available option when the time comes. Once participant have finished treatment, their doctor will continue observe for side effects and follow their condition for 1 year."
