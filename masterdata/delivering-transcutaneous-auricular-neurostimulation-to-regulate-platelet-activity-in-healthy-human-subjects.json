Group 1: Sham taVNS followed by active taVNS\n2. Group 2: Sham tAN followed by active tAN\n\nParticipants will receive 30 minutes of sham stimulation (taVNS or tAN), followed by active stimulation (taVNS or tAN). Blood biomarkers (local and systemic) will be measured before and at several timepoints after stimulation to measure the molecular and cellular effects of the device."
