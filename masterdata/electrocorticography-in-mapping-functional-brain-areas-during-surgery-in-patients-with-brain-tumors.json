Using a larger than the standard mapping grid currently used during brain tumor surgery or a high-definition grid for electrocorticogram brain mapping may help doctors to better identify which areas of the brain are active during specific limb movement and speech during surgery in patients with brain tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To record electrocorticogram (ECoG) data intraoperatively with surface electrode grids during various motor, sensory (tactile) and speech tasks, and identify functional brain areas through the spectral analysis, and compare the preliminary data with our current pre-surgical mapping methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and the gold standard, intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To perform a preliminary assessment of the utility of using ECoG data in these patients to quantify new neurological deficits in the short term (24 hours) and long-term (1 and 3 months), and achieve a safe maximal tumor resection.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo tumor resection. During surgery, patients also undergo electrocorticography with either the CorTec high resolution hybrid grid, the PMT high-resolution grid, or the Ad-Tech grid followed by direct electrocortical stimulation.\n\nFollowing completion of study, patients are followed up within 24 hours from surgery and at 1 and 3 months."

The categorical variables would be preoperative Karnofsky performance status and functional status, tumor location, fMRI, TMS, ECoG, and DES data points. Other variables involved in the analysis would be extent of resection and neurological outcome. The Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests will be used to explore associations between categorical variables. Additional analysis may be performed.",
