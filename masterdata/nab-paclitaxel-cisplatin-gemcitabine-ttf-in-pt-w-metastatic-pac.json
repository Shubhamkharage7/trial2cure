            "detailedDescription": "GCN is predicted to be the front-line therapy for biliary and pancreatic cancer in the future given excellent results of current early clinical trials (ORR \u2265 67% in pancreatic cancer). This will change standard of care for front-line therapy in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. In this cohort of patients' tolerability after 6 cycles of therapy will be a challenge. Investigators hypothesize that developing a maintenance strategy with TTF+G will be cutting edge approach and can potentially transform front-line standard of care therapy in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. If this pilot study proves fruitful then a larger study to confirm findings can be conducted."

Sexually active WCBP and male subjects must agree to use adequate methods to avoid pregnancy (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) throughout the study and for 28 days after the completion of study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Previous front-line therapy for metastatic disease.\n\n1. Patients with known brain metastasis.\n2. Cardiac conduction abnormalities such as 2nd and 3rd heart-block requiring a pacemaker.\n3. Patient with cardiac or abdominal pacemakers or stimulators.\n4. Significant risk of cardiac drug toxicity due to congestive heart failure or history of myocardial infarction.\n5. Any other condition including but not limited to major co-morbidities, which in the opinion of the investigator would render the patient ineligible.\n6.
