IORT works by delivering radiation therapy to the tumor while reducing the amount of healthy tissue exposed to the radiation therapy. The investigators believe that the administration of IORT after 3-6 months of chemotherapy will help to stop the cancer cells from growing.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved IORT for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses."
