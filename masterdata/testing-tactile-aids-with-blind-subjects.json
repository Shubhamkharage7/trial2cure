            "briefSummary": "The objective of this project is to create richer tactile aids by using materials chemistry to create tactile sensations in tactile aids, as an alternative to traditional physical bumps, lines, or textures. These materials are commonly used in household products, but have not yet been used to enrich tactile aids. Successful outcomes are primarily the accuracy with which low vision or blind subjects identify objects made from tactile coatings versus traditional tactile aids. Other outcomes include time to completion of the task, or the number of distinctive categories that participants can identify.",
            "detailedDescription": "Traditional images and graphics, like mathematical plots or charts, are not accessible to low vision and blind people. Instead, for blind and low vision people, tactile aids are traditionally used to convey abstract concepts. However, tactile aids cannot convey as rich or as dense of information as traditional visual graphics, limiting independence and access to gainful employment for low vision and blind professionals.\n\nThe primary reason why tactile aids are inferior to visual graphics is that tactile aids are made from a combination of physical bumps, lines, and labels. Placing too many details on a single tactile aid quickly becomes illegible to the user because the various bumps, lines, and textures blur together, which is known as \"tactile clutter\".\n\nThe objective of this project is to create richer tactile aids by using materials chemistry to create tactile sensations in tactile aids, as an alternative to traditional physical bumps, lines, or textures. These materials are commonly used in household products, but have not yet been used to enrich tactile aids. Successful outcomes include having low vision or blind subjects identify objects made from our tactile materials quicker than traditional tactile aids, or to successfully identify more categories on a mathematical plot than is currently possible with existing tactile aids."

Common material properties such as a friction coefficient or hydrophilicity are insufficiently detailed to accurately predict friction forces-the basis of tactile stimuli. The investigators will use expertise in connecting tactile sensations with chemical structure through mechanical testing, theory, and human testing. The investigators' goal is to identify materials that lead to high tactile contrast without relying on physical features. (Tactile contrast is defined by the investigators as large differences in friction which are easily distinguishable by humans during free tactile exploration.)",

Investigators will determine the optimal design of traditional bumps which yields the highest tactile stimulus in the smallest area. Investigators expect to find that current bumps are larger than necessary, and that the same information could be placed into a smaller area (higher information density). Then, investigators will augment bumps with designer materials to increase the tactile stimulus from a bump, thereby permitting even smaller bumps to increase information density. Beyond optimal design methods, the investigators' quantitative methods, enabled by making the mechanical stimulus the dependent variable, also serve as benchmarks between tactile aids.",
