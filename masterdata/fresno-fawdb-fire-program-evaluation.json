Understanding the ways in which the Fresno FIRE program supports healthy parenting relationships and financial stability is important for those providing services to at-risk fathers.",
            "detailedDescription": "After being informed about the study and giving consent, participants will enroll in a nine-week Fresno Fatherhood program that collects data at enrollment, at the end of the program, and 12 months following the program. Research questions in this study are framed by a descriptive evaluation design to assess whether outcomes improve for low-income fathers who participate in the Fresno FIRE program. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed before and after participants complete core curricula - 24/7 Dads and career readiness workshops (pre to post). Primary outcome measures will indicate whether behavior improved for healthy family relationships (parent, co-parent, and partner) and economic stability (financial, employment). Secondary outcomes will indicate whether improvements were made in the attitudes and expectations that facilitate and reflect behavior for healthy family relationships and economic stability."
