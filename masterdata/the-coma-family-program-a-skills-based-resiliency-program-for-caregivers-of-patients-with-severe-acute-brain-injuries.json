The investigators will deliver an open pilot of the intervention (N=15 caregivers) to evaluate initial feasibility and acceptability using exit interviews and pre-post assessments.\n\nThe open pilot will take place at the Massachusetts General Hospital, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and University of Maryland School of Medicine neurological intensive care units (NICUs) or step-down units using our established methodology successfully implemented during our previous R21 of our Recovering Together study. Study clinicians will deliver 6, 30 minute sessions of the intervention (at bedside or on Zoom, depending on participant preference). All participants will complete measures at baseline, and after completion of program (6 weeks). They will also complete measures of emotional distress weekly. At the completion of the program, participants will engage in a 5-10 minute exit interview where they will provide feedback of the intervention."
