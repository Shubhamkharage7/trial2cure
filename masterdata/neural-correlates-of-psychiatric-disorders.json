The study was expanded to include stimulation and recordings approved under new IRB #211037. The participant data originally acquired from IRB# 202370 will be included in this new record:\n\nThis study seeks to better understand the neural activity underlying neuro cognitive disorders. Resting state local field potential recordings will be collected from medically refractory epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes for seizure localization, and metrics of neural activity will be correlated with psychiatric symptoms as measured from questionnaires. Subjects will also participate in neuro cognitive tasks while neural recordings are performed, and/or receive neural stimulation through implanted depth electrodes. A better understanding of disordered neural activity underlying neuropsychiatric disorders may additionally contribute to novel methods for diagnosing, treating, and preventing these diseases."
