            "briefSummary": "This is an observational study enrolling healthy individuals aged 18-35 and 65y and older to determine the health of immune cells in the blood and how these cells create inflammation and effect health as we age. It is hoped that once the nature of this relationship has been discovered we can more effectively design therapies to reduce this inflammation.\n\nThe enrollment goal is 40 participants. The study will occur over the course of 1 month which will include a screening visit and a second visit where the participants will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test, blood draws and leg strength \\& exercise tests.",
            "detailedDescription": "We will recruit healthy, non-obese (\\<30kg/m2 BMI) younger (N=20; 18-35y) and older (N=20; \\>65y) male and female participants (as determined by sample size calculation) in the Salt Lake City area.\n\n1. VISIT 1 (Screening, visit duration: 1 hour): Once the participant is identified, they will be scheduled for a screening visit at the CTSI (421 Wakara Way) to see if they meet incl/excl criteria and to sign an informed consent document. As part of the visit, Upon arrival, we will gather basic health information such as height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate.\n\n   * Participant will undergo the following procedures: a blood screening (30ml of blood collected)\n   * For older cohort: The clinical frailty scale (CFS) and Mini-Cog\u00a9 cognitive assessment\n2. VISIT 2 (visit duration: 3 hours) Following a 10h fast, participants will arrive in the morning. Upon arrival, we may gather basic health information from the participant such as height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate. The procedures to take place at this visit are as follows:\n\n   * 120 mL serum blood sample collection. Samples will be used to identify the immune cell populations in the blood, regulators of these immune cells and how these cells function.\n   * Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)- participants will be asked to complete a test to determine their blood sugar levels. We will ask them to drink a sugary liquid (glucola) and then rest quietly while we measure changes in their blood sugar levels. We will draw 20 ml of blood during this test (\\~1 tablespoon). OGTT will take approximately 2hours.\n   * Leg strength tests at the SMERF facility. Isometric strength will be assessed in both legs with a maximal voluntary isometric contraction effort developed by the knee extensors (quadriceps) on a isokinetic dynamometer. For lower extremity extension power testing a Nottingham power rig will be used. Total time for these tests will take 45 minutes."
