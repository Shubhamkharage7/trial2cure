            "briefSummary": "Preliminary data have suggested that cannabidiol (CBD) may have a number of clinical benefits, including anti-anxiety and antidepressant properties. This study is a pilot open-label clinical trial assessing a custom-formulated high-CBD product over the course of 4 weeks in patients with bipolar disorder who experience anxiety.",
            "detailedDescription": "This investigation will be the first of its kind to conduct a clinical trial of an industrial hemp-derived high-CBD product in individuals with bipolar disorder who experience anxiety. Despite the recent interest in medical cannabis and cannabinoid-based products, the availability of hemp-derived products in all 50 states, and preliminary and anecdotal evidence suggesting that hemp-derived products may have a profound anxiolytic effect, along with potential antidepressant effects, no studies have conducted a clinical trial of a hemp-derived product in individuals with bipolar disorder who suffer from anxiety.\n\nThis investigation consists of a four-week open-label clinical trial of the custom formulated hemp-derived high-CBD solution. Participants will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility for the study. If approved, potentially eligible participants will come to the hospital for a screening visit, and will complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life questionnaires, a urine screen, and a blood draw. Eligible participants will return for a baseline visit consisting of additional clinical and quality of life questionnaires, a brief cognitive assessment, and a buccal swab for genetic analysis. Participants will be given study product to use for the duration of the study, and will be instructed to self-administer the solution under the tongue twice daily for four weeks. Throughout the treatment period, participants will complete short in-person or remote visits on a weekly basis, where they will complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants will also return to the hospital for a final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires and cognitive assessments."
