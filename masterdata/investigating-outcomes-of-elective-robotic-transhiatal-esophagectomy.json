            "briefSummary": "The primary goal of this study is to collect short-term and long-term health outcomes of a robotic transhiatal esophagectomy procedure. Clinical (or health) outcomes measure the effect of the procedure on your overall health status. During this procedure, the surgeon will remove all or part of your esophagus. We want to identify patients who will have this procedure. We will look at data elements before, during, and after your procedure to understand the impact of this surgery on your post-operative clinical outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Esophagectomy is a complex surgical procedure performed to treat various esophageal disorders. The surgery involves the removal of all or part of the esophagus and reconstruction using other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Different surgical approaches and techniques have been developed, including open (transthoracic or transhiatal), minimally invasive (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or robotic-assisted), and hybrid approaches. These techniques may yield different clinical outcomes, and there is still ongoing debate regarding the optimal approach. Nevertheless, minimally invasive approaches, including robotic esophagectomy, are generally preferred given the lower morbidity. This prospective clinical registry aims to investigate outcomes of elective robotic transhiatal esophagectomy, the preferred approach at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, for adult patients undergoing this procedure. By collecting clinical and demographic data prospectively, we hope to identify factors that contribute to improved outcomes and guide future surgical practice."
