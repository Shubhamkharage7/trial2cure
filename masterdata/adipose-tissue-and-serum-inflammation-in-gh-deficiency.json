            "detailedDescription": "The GH axis has important influences on adipose tissue. Preliminary data from the investigators' study in acromegaly, a state of GH excess, suggests that GH reduces adipose tissue (AT) mass and serum inflammation. However, GH seems to reduce macrophage markers in adipose tissue yet increase adipocyte inflammation. This novel dissociation of macrophage and adipocyte inflammation is hypothesized to be due to GH. In order to examine this hypothesis further this study will examine adipose tissue and serum inflammation in patients with GH deficiency before and after GH therapy. The investigators will obtain subcutaneous adipose tissue by biopsy in patients with active GH deficiency planning to undergo therapy for GH deficiency. Concurrently serum samples will be taken for analysis of levels of inflammatory markers and adipokines. After treatment for 12 months with a normal levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a marker of GH deficiency, patients will have a repeat adipose tissue biopsy. Adipose tissue parameters will be analyzed in each specimen and then compared to each patient over time as well as to body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects."

Have other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.\n14.
