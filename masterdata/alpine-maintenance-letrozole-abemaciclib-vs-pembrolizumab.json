            "briefSummary": "A standard treatment for endometrial cancer is chemotherapy and pembrolizumab together followed by pembrolizumab maintenance for two years. This treatment regimen has shown benefit in terms of delaying cancer progression in prior clinical trials, but the benefit of the pembrolizumab maintenance treatment and whether all participants need it is unclear. This research is being done on the maintenance portion of treatment to compare the efficacy between the combination of letrozole + abemaciclib and pembrolizumab alone following chemotherapy and pembrolizumab.\n\nThe names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Abemaciclib (a type of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor)\n* Letrozole (a type of aromatase inhibitor)\n* Pembrolizumab (a type of monoclonal antibody)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, phase 2 trial of maintenance letrozole + abemaciclib vs. pembrolizumab after carboplatin + paclitaxel + pembrolizumab chemotherapy in participants with advanced or recurrent estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER+), mismatch repair proficient (MMRP), TP53 wild-type endometrial cancer.\n\nParticipants will be randomized in one of two study groups: Abemaciclib + Letrozole vs. Pembrolizumab. Randomization means that a participant is placed into a study group by chance.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved abemaciclib, letrozole or pembrolizumab for endometrial cancer but they have been approved for other uses.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, X-rays, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, blood tests, and electrocardiograms (EKGs).\n\nParticipants will be administered study drugs for up to 2 years and will be followed for 3 years after completing study treatment.\n\nIt is expected that about 76 people will take part in this research study.\n\nEli Lilly is supporting this research study by providing funding and the study drug abemaciclib."

Corticoid therapy is allowed if administered as stable dose for at least 1 month before randomization).\n* Females who are pregnant or lactating. The effects of the study agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically approved contraceptive method during the treatment period and for 3 months following the last dose of study agent. Contraceptive methods may include an intrauterine device (IUD) or barrier method. If condoms are used as a barrier method, a spermicidal agent should be added as a double barrier protection. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for study entry from women of childbearing potential.\n* The patient has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\<30ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).\n* Participants who at the time of study enrollment are known to require concomitant therapy with strong CYP3A4 inducers, or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Due to potential drug interactions, concomitant use of these medications is not permitted for the duration of treatment on trial.
