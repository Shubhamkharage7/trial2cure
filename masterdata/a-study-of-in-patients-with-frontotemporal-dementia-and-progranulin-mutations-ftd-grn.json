This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of this treatment in patients with frontotemporal dementia and mutations in the progranulin gene (FTD-GRN).",
            "detailedDescription": "PBFT02 is an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 1 carrying GRN, the gene encoding for human progranulin, formulated as a solution for injection into the cisterna magna. This is a global interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of PBFT02 delivered as a one-time dose administered into the cisterna magna to patients with FTD-GRN. Subjects aged \u2265 35 and \u2264 75 years with early symptomatic FTD-GRN may be enrolled into the study.\n\nTwo dose levels of PBFT02 will be studied in patients with FTD-GRN. The study will sequentially enroll 2 cohorts. An optional third dose level cohort may be enrolled based on the results of the first two cohorts.\n\nThis is a 5-year study, with a 2-year main study, followed by a 3-year safety extension."

Classification of the GRN mutation as \"not pathogenic,\" \"likely benign variant,\" \"benign variant,\" or \"pathogenic nature unclear\"\n2. Previous treatment with any gene therapy. Any other therapies with the potential to alter PGRN levels must be washed out for at least 5 half-lives prior to entry into this study\n3. Homozygous GRN mutation carrier\n4. Rosen-modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale score \\> 7\n5. Known presence of a structural brain lesion (eg, tumor, cortical infarct) that could reasonably explain symptoms in a symptomatic subject\n6. Known presence of an AD-causing mutation in PSEN1, PSEN2 or APP based on genetic testing history (if performed)\n7. Previous history of Korsakoff encephalopathy, severe alcohol or substance dependence (within 5 years of onset of dementia), except where onset of increased alcohol consumption occurs at the time of FTD disease onset\n8. History of untreated vitamin B12 deficiency\n9. Presence of untreated hypothyroidism (thyroid stimulating hormone \\[TSH\\] \\> ULN and free T4 \\< LLN)\n10. eGFR \u2264 30 ml/min (as calculated using the CKD-EPI equation)\n11. Alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\] or aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] \\> 2 \u00d7 ULN, or total bilirubin \\> ULN)\n12. Respiratory failure that requires supplemental oxygen\n13. Inability to provide full consent or the lack of a legally authorized caregiver with adequate contact who can provide consent\n14. Any contraindication to MRI or lumbar puncture (LP) (eg, local infection, history of thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy)\n15. Any contraindication to the ICM administration procedure\n16. Medical conditions or laboratory or vital sign abnormalities that would increase risk of complications from intra-cisterna magna injection, anesthesia, LP, and/or MRI (e.g., fever, hypoxia, tachycardia, or evidence of active infection)\n17. Immunocompromised status\n18. Peripheral axonal sensory neuropathy\n19. Receipt of a vaccine within 14 days of dosing\n20. A positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1 or type 2, or Hepatitis B or C; a Mycobacterium tuberculosis positive test within 1 year of or determined at screening\n21. Malignant neoplasia (except localized skin cancer) or a documented history of hereditary cancer syndrome\n22. Any concurrent disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may cause cognitive impairment unrelated to GRN mutations, including other causes of dementia, neurosyphilis, hydrocephalus, stroke, small vessel ischemic disease, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, or vitamin deficiency\n23. Current or recent history of clinically significant suicidal ideation within the past 6 months\n24. For females of childbearing potential, a positive serum pregnancy test at the screening visit, a positive serum result on Day 1 prior to administration of the investigational product, or unwillingness to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of birth control or engage in abstinence until 90 days postdose\n25. Women who are breastfeeding\n26. For sexually active men, unwillingness to use a medically accepted method of double-barrier contraception (such as a condom/diaphragm used with spermicide) or engage in abstinence from the date of screening until 90 days postdose\n27. Any condition (eg, history of any disease, evidence of any current disease, any finding upon physical examination, or any laboratory abnormality) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at undue risk or would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results\n28. Any acute illness requiring hospitalization within 30 days of enrollment\n29. Failure to meet the protocol-specified coagulation test criteria:\n\n    * Platelet count over 100,000 per uL\n    * INR less than 1.5\n    * aPTT less than 40 seconds\n30. Use of anticoagulants in the 2 weeks prior to screening, or anticipated use of anticoagulants during the study. Antiplatelet therapies may be acceptable\n31. Hypersensitivity or contraindications to corticosteroid use\n32. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to PBFT02 or any of its ingredients or to closely related compounds",
