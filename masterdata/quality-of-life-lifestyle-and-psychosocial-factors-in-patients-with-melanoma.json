Knowledge gained from this study may be used to guide the design of prospective clinical trials of lifestyle interventions to improve the outcomes of melanoma patients and assist doctors in counseling their patients.",

Collect systematic data on mental health, quality of life (QOL), social support, diet, and exercise behaviors in melanoma patients.\n\nII. Examine whether psychosocial factors and lifestyle are associated with clinical outcomes in melanoma patients.\n\nIII. Examine the association between lifestyle and psychosocial factors and tissue and blood biomarkers in melanoma patients.\n\nIV. Examine whether psychosocial factors and lifestyle are associated with QOL adjustment in melanoma patients.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete a maximum of 3 paper or electronic questionnaires over 30 minutes within 2 weeks of presentation to MD Anderson, new diagnosis of melanoma, and/or initiating a new treatment, within 2 weeks of first restaging, and within 2 weeks of the end of treatment. Patients may complete an additional paper or electronic dietary questionnaire over 10 minutes for 3 days (30 minutes total) or a phone-based dietary recall. Patients who start a new treatment of interest may repeat the questionnaires at the same time points. Patients' medical records are also reviewed."
