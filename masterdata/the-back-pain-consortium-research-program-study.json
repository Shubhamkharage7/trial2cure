            "briefSummary": "This study is being completed to better understand who benefits from different chronic pain treatments and how these treatments work.\n\nThis study will include a four week run-in period for all cLBP participants. After completing the PainGuide (online or smart phone accessible website) run-in period, participants will be assessed using either the light or light plus deep phenotyping assessment battery and those who minimal or modest improvement in their pain (based on PGIC) will be randomized to one of four 8-week treatments (mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), physical therapy (PT) and exercise, acupressure self-management, or duloxetine).\n\nIn addition, participants will complete study visits including physical exams, complete surveys, provide samples (blood,saliva, etc.), wear an electronic wrist device at certain times, and have Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) during the study.\n\nFollowing one of the 4 treatments (8 weeks) if participants have a certain level of pain (that meets eligibility for more treatment) they will be then randomized to complete one of the 3 treatments that was not already assigned to them.\n\nThe study hypothesizes the following:\n\nthat this interventional response phenotyping can identify individuals with different underlying mechanisms for their pain who thus respond differentially to evidence-based interventions for chronic lower back pain (cLBP).",
            "detailedDescription": "In addition, the following mechanistic hypothesis and Aims are included:\n\nMindfulness-Based Stress Reduction:\n\nAim 2: the study predicts that patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) will preferentially respond to this therapy if PROs indicate higher levels of pain catastrophizing, as measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, or lower scores on the Experiences Questionnaire.\n\nAim 3: the study hypothesizes that cLBP patients with decreased activation in response to pain in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and Prefrontal Cortex and increased activation in somatosensory cortex (S1) and thalamus will respond preferentially to MBSR.\n\nPhysical Therapy (PT) and Exercise\n\nAim 2: The primary hypothesis for the light phenotyping protocol is those individuals with the highest scores on the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and lowest scores for PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms will be most likely to improve from PT/Exercise program.\n\nAim 3: the study hypothesis that low vagal tone and high basal inflammation will predict responsiveness to the PT/Exercise program.\n\nAcupressure:\n\nAim 2: The study hypothesizes that females with cLBP will respond better to acupressure than men, as will those with higher scores on the 2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire.\n\nAim 3: The study predicts that cLBP patients with higher posterior insula glutamate and/or greater insula - Default Mode Network (DMN) connectivity (as well as increased DMN-S1 connectivity\n\nDuloxetine:\n\nAim 2: the study hypothesizes that it will replicate previous studies suggesting that participants with cLBP will preferentially respond to this therapy if patient reported outcomes indicate stronger elements of either neuropathic pain (indicated by a high PainDETECT score) or centralized/nociplastic pain (indicated by more widespread pain on the 2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire).\n\nAim 3: the study anticipates then that deficient pain inhibition on quantitative sensory testing, decreased periaqueductal gray (PAG)-insula connectivity, and elevated stimulated inflammatory responses will be associated with a positive response to centrally-acting duloxetine.\n\nAdditionally, a subset of individuals (n=160) from these groups will be asked to participate in an expanded phenotyping study that will include structural and functional brain neuroimaging, quantitative sensory testing (QST), plasma measures of inflammation, and digital measurement of autonomic tone."
