Positive beta- human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in female of childbearing potential.\n2. Confirmed active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or C infection.\n3.

Presence of \u2265grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities as per CTCAE version 5.0 from any previous treatment unless it is felt to be due to underlying disease.\n5. Concurrent use of investigational therapeutic agents or enrollment on another therapeutic clinical trial at any institution. Minimum of 14 days or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is shorter) washout prior to apheresis.\n6. Refusal to participate in the long-term follow-up protocol\n7. Patients with active CNS involvement by malignancy on MRI or by lumbar puncture (Not applicable to Arm E cohort.)\n\n   a. Patients with prior CNS disease that has been effectively treated will be eligible providing treatment was \\>4 weeks before enrollment and a remission documented within 8 weeks of planned CAR-T cell infusion by MRI brain and CSF analysis.\n8. Previous recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT) are excluded if they are \\<100 days' post-transplant, have evidence of active graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of any grade, or are currently on immunosuppression.\n9. Prior allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy\n10. Previous recipients of autologous CAR-T cell therapy directed at either CD19 or CD20 are excluded if they are \\<100 days post prior CAR-T cell treatment (does not include re-enrollment) or have \\>5% residual circulating CAR-T as measured by flow cytometry using a CD19 CAR detection reagent (Miltenyi Biotec)\n\n    a. Patients with prior CAR-T treatment against CD19 or CD20 must have repeat biopsy post-CAR-T cell therapy confirming a minimum of 5% CD19 or CD20 positivity by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry\n11. Anti-CD20 antibody treatment within 4 weeks of cell infusion\n12. Anti-CD19 antibody treatment within 4 weeks of cell infusion\n13. Cytotoxic chemotherapy other than lymphodepletion within 14 days of CAR-T cell infusion\n14. Cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment within 14 days or steroid treatment (other than replacement dose steroids) within 7 days prior to apheresis collection for CAR-T cells\n15. Oral chemotherapeutic agents or antibody directed treatment within 7 days of apheresis\n\n    a. BTK inhibitors are allowed until 1-day prior to apheresis and can re-start until 1-day prior to lymphodepletion\n16. Patients post solid organ transplant who develop high grade lymphomas or leukemias\n17. Concurrent active malignancy other than basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (underlying low-grade lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia/follicular lymphoma (FL)/marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is allowable in patients with transformed large cell lymphoma)\n\nSPECIAL CRITERIA REGARDING FERTILITY AND CONTRACEPTION\n\nFemale subjects of reproductive potential (women who have reached menarche or women who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone a sterilization procedure \\[hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\\]) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed as part of eligibility criteria Due to the high-risk level of this study, while enrolled, all subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). Additionally, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study subject must agree to use reliable and double barrier methods of contraception during the follow-up period of the protocol.\n\nAcceptable birth control includes a combination of two of the following methods:\n\n* Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent.\n* Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide\n* Intrauterine device (IUD)\n* Hormonal-based contraception Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (women who are premenarche or have been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy tubal ligation, salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy or men who have documented azoospermia) are eligible without requiring the use of contraception",
