            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effects of a specialized swimming and water-safety program (Sensory Enhanced Aquatics) and standard swimming lessons for autistic children. The main question\\[s\\]it aims to answer are:\n\n* Do Sensory Enhanced Aquatics and standard swimming lessons improve swimming and water-safety skills of autistic children?\n* Which participant characteristics are associated with the highest post-intervention swim skills and water safety across both groups?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Complete questionnaires, motor, and swim tests before the intervention.\n* participate in 16, 30-minute Sensory Enhanced Aquatics lessons.\n* Complete a swim test after the intervention.\n* Complete an interview. Researchers will compare with participation in standard swim lessons to see if which bests teaches swimming and water-safety to autistic children.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will conduct a single blind, randomized controlled pilot trial to test the differential effects of an eight-week (16 lesson) Sensory Enhanced Aquatics intervention and standard swim lessons on attainment of swimming and water safety skills of autistic children. Investigators will enroll 50 autistic children aged 5-9 years who will be randomized 1:1 by minimization to either the Sensory Enhanced Aquatics intervention or standard swim lessons to minimize imbalanced group allocation by autism severity and baseline swim skill. Aim 1 will compare the effects of Sensory Enhanced Aquatics to standard swimming lessons on swimming and water safety skills of autistic children with a swim test based on Red Cross water competency guidelines. Aim 2 will assess which participant characteristics (e.g., age, motor ability, autism severity) are associated with the highest post-intervention swim skills and water safety across both groups to inform who benefits most from swim instruction. Child sex and co-occurring motor impairment will be considered as potential covariates. Data will be collected before swim lessons and after 8 weeks of Sensory Enhanced Aquatics or standard lessons. The investigators hypothesize children in both groups will demonstrate improvement in swimming and water safety skills with greater improvements in the Sensory Enhanced Aquatics group; autism severity and motor ability will have the greatest associations with swim skill in both groups. Our exploratory aim will employ post-intervention semi-structured interviews to explore child, parent, and instructor perspectives about instructional methods most effective for developing swimming and water-safety among autistic children. The information obtained from this study will improve our understanding of the best strategies for swim instruction for autistic children and support our long-term goal to make Sensory Enhanced Aquatics scalable on the national level to prevent drowning of autistic children."

Lessons will be 1:1 with social opportunities at the beginning and end of each lesson. Like standard swim lessons, skills are taught in progression from water orientation (e.g., blowing bubbles, submerging different body parts) to advanced swimming (e.g., swimming 15 or more yards of different swim strokes). All lessons include instruction of water safety skills. Each skill has been task analyzed by therapists so instruction can be graded according to children's ability. A social story is provided to transition children to lessons. SEA curriculum was reviewed by USA Swimming Foundation and is included as a Swim Lesson Network Provider.",
