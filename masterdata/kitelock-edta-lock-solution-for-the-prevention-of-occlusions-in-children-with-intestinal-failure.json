            "detailedDescription": "A total of 124 (62 per arm) will be enrolled into the study. Screening and informed consent (and assent if applicable) will be obtained prior to study procedures. The baseline assessment will be completed at recruitment to the study. Once the baseline assessment is complete and eligible subjects are randomized, the study drug will be dispensed per protocol. The study follow-up period will be 52 weeks. Four follow-up clinical in-person visits will occur at 2,12, 28, 40 and 52 weeks. Visits will be conducted by physicians or nurse practitioners. The study visits will assess general status, study bloodwork, adverse events, catheter patency, alteplase use, infection assessment, catheter integrity, and provide investigational product. Telephone follow up will occur on day-3 of intervention, and once per 4 weeks, as well as in the event of outpatient care/hospital admission, or safety event. Subject daily diaries will be utilized for detailed monitoring. Diary recordings will include adverse events, including occlusive events, and any subject specific details (e.g. dwell times, heparin flushing vs. aspiration) or issues in the delivery of the study locking solutions."
