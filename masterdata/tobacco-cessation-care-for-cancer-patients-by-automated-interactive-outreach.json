To evaluate patients' acceptance of referrals.\n\nII. To evaluate the acceptability of CareConnect.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. In-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews of 20 randomly selected participants who completed the 3-month follow-up call (10 from each group).\n\nII. Smoking cessation with verification.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nEligible participants, identified through the Cancer Center Tobacco Registry will be randomized to either the Intervention or Control arm on a 1:1 ratio. Participants who complete the first call of CareConnect or AutoReach will be considered enrolled. Participants will complete a baseline assessment, a 3-month assessment, and have option to provide a saliva sample.\n\nFor those who are selected to participate in an in-depth interview, this will take place within 1 month after the 3-month assessment. Data from the participants medical record may be accessed at 6 months post follow-up."
