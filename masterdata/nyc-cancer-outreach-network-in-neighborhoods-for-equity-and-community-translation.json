The RCT will compare the effectiveness of using a combination of 1) culturally and linguistically tailored cancer education materials and 2) community health workers (CHWs) to provide navigation services for cancer screening (the \"patient navigation\" \\[PN\\] arm) versus providing culturally and linguistically tailored cancer education only (the \"less intensive\" \\[LI\\] arm). The study population will include individuals who are due for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening. All individuals recruited to the study will be provided navigation for unmet social determinants of health (SDH) needs."
