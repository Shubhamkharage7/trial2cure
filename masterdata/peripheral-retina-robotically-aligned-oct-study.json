            "briefSummary": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a 3D imaging technology that has seen wide adoption within ophthalmology. However, optical access to the retinal periphery remains a challenge for conventional OCT systems. The study team plans to innovate peripheral retinal OCT imaging technology by first developing the first robotic OCT system capable of autonomously assisting the operator during imaging of the human peripheral retina using 3D active tracking and compensation and then by developing of the first OCT system designed for treatment of the retinal periphery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Purpose and Objectives:\n\nThe long-term goal is to develop a system that provides 360\u00b0 visualization of the peripheral retina replacing the current standard of care for evaluation of the retinal periphery for breaks: indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression, a procedure requiring the examiner to mechanically indent the eye at multiple locations and use an indirect ophthalmoscope and condensing lens to attempt to visualize the retina peripherally and over360\u00b0. The rationale for this project is that in addition to being extremely uncomfortable for the patient, this technique requires considerable skill with specialized training.\n\nFurthermore, the exam does not create a direct record of the findings - the examiner must illustrate a guide map from memory for subsequent laser photocoagulation (LP) therapy utilizing this same manual technique. These objectives will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Adapt a custom conical mirror contact lens and robotically aligning platform to optically access the peripheral retina with OCT and laser photocoagulation therapy; and 2) Validate peripheral retina robotically aligning OCT against scleral depressed exam in eyes with and without peripheral retinal breaks requiring treatment.\n\nTo validate our imaging technique, the investigators will conduct a powered study in eyes with and without known peripheral retina breaks comparing total number of detected peripheral retinal breaks per eye by Peripheral Retina Robotically Aligned OCT (PR-RAOCT) versus clinical exam. As a secondary outcome, the investigators will evaluate subject comfort level following each method. The investigators will recruit patients presenting at the Duke Eye Center with complaints of \"flashers and floaters\" and have undergone indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression as part of their standard of care."
