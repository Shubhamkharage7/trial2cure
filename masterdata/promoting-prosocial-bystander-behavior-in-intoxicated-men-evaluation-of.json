            "briefSummary": "Sexual violence (SV) is a significant public health problem particularly among 18-24 year old populations. A major risk factor for SV is alcohol use, which via its negative impact on cognitive abilities and decision-making acts as a barrier to intervening in situations at-risk for a SV. This study has two main goals: (1) to determine the effects of proximal alcohol use on young (age 21 to 25) men's prosocial bystander behavior in situations considered at-risk for SV, and (2) to determine the efficacy of an evidence-based, web-based program called RealConsent, which has been augmented to include alcohol-specific content within the context of bystander SV (\"RealConsent2.0\"), on men's prosocial bystander behavior. The primary study endpoint is prosocial bystander behavior and will be assessed via two modes: (1) a virtual reality (VR) environment (\"B-SAVE\") and (2) a validated self-report measure of bystander behavior that has been modified to include assessment of proximal alcohol use and presence of alcohol within the context."
