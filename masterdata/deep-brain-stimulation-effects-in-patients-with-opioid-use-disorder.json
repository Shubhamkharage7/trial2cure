This study will include 3 individuals with opioid use disorder and relapsing opioid use despite active participation in a drug addiction treatment program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Three (N = 3) subjects with treatment refractory opioid use disorder will receive bilateral DBS implants in the NAc using the Abbott Medical Infinity DBS system. The primary outcome of this study is to demonstrate the safety of bilateral NAc DBS in patients with treatment-refractory opioid use disorder. Secondary outcomes include time to relapse, remission of opioid use, and change in opioid craving scores. Other secondary outcomes will include the following: Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS), neurophysiological tests, body weight and biochemical markers of health and nutrition. If effective, DBS may reduce opioid use and opioid relapse in people with opioid use disorder who may continue to display relapse despite ongoing multidisciplinary standard of care. DBS brain electrode implantation and implantation of the IPGs and extension wires will be done in the operating room and will require the subject to be admitted post-operatively for an overnight stay. Two weeks after the DBS operation, subjects will undergo systematic testing each of the quadripolar contacts and formal programming. Subsequent parameter settings will be changed at routine outpatient visits based on clinical effects. Standard of care can consist of methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment provided by an addiction specialist."
