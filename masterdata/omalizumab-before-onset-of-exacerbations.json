OBOE will recruit and randomize participants over 3 years (3 annual cohorts of participants). Recruitment for each of the yearly cohorts of OBOE will begin in February. Each cohort will be followed for a 2-6-month run-in period with the objective to gain control of each participant's asthma and to stabilize the required controller medication step level. Participants will receive routine asthma care every 1-2 months (a total of 2-4 times) during run-in using a previously described algorithm developed by the Inner-city Asthma Consortium and successfully employed in the PROSE study. The primary outcome is the change in the amount of nasal IFN-\u03b1 recovered by nasal fluid absorption between two time points, within 72 hours of onset of a URI as defined by onset of (or substantial worsening of) rhinorrhea, nasal congestion or sneezing (single or multiple symptoms) and 3-6 days after study drug injection."
