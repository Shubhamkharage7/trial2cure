Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) \u2264 2\n5. Hepatic function and adequate renal function, as per protocol standard\n6. Adequate bone marrow function as per protocol standard\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Unable or not willing to provide tumour tissue sample (from archival tissue or de-novo biopsy) unless if there is a significant risk for the patient to undergo biopsy\n2. Has received investigational or anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to starting study drug\n3. Is receiving any concomitant anti-cancer therapy\n4. Known severe hypersensitivity to E coli-derived products or filgrastim or peg-filgrastim and have significant allergies to such biological products\n5. Has clinically active brain metastases\n6. Has received prior radiation therapy\n7. Has received prophylactic administration of haematopoietic colony stimulating factors within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to starting study drug\n8.
