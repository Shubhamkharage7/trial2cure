Each couple will be asked to use five synthetic nitrile condoms, and five latex control male condoms in a randomised order. Couples will complete a Condom Use Report after each condom use. Function, safety, and acceptability will be assessed at each of two follow-up visits conducted after using each set of five condoms. The trial will enrol up to 300 couples, anticipating that at least 255 couples will complete the study. Half of the couples (150) will be enrolled in Durban, South Africa and half (150) enrolled in California USA."
