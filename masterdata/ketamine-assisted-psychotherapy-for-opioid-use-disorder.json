Here we will add Ketamine to MORE (MORE+KAP) and test the MORE+KAP intervention versus the standard MORE intervention in a sample of patients receiving medications for OUD (MOUD; e.g, buprenorphine). The primary aim to is evaluate the extent to which MORE+KAP improves OUD treatment relative to MORE. The secondary aim is to identify the psychobiological mediators of MORE+KAP."
