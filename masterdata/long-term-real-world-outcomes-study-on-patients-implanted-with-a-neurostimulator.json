            "detailedDescription": "This study has broad inclusion criteria and minimal exclusion criteria to ensure the results are representative of the real-world use of these devices. Enrollment caps will be implemented to ensure patients from approved indications are represented. Individuals who are scheduled to receive an implantable Abbott neurostimulation system are eligible for study consideration. The study will enroll up to 2,000 subjects from up to 100 participating centers. Subject enrollment is expected to be completed within 7 years; subjects will be followed for 5 years. The total duration of the study is expected to be 13 years, including enrollment, data collection from all subjects, and study close out."
