            "detailedDescription": "Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common type of arthritis, affects more than 32.5 million adults in the United States. It is also among the most expensive condition to treat when joint replacement surgery is required. Future projections of the prevalence of OA predict an increase in prevalence, mainly due to the aging of the population and obesity.\n\nTotal knee replacement (TKR) is the end-stage solution for patients with knee OA. The total annual cost of arthritis in the U.S. in 2013 reached over $300 billion. Expenditure is expected to grow significantly in response to the increase in prevalence and the projected number of TKRs.\n\nSuccessful and beneficial non-invasive treatment options for knee OA are limited. More specifically, although biomechanics plays an important role in OA disease, the non-surgical treatment options addressing biomechanics are scarce with limited effect.
