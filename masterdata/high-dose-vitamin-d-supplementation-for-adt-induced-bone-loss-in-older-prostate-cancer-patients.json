            "briefSummary": "This phase III trial tests whether high-dose vitamin D works in treating androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)-induced bone loss in patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy. Vitamins are substances that the body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets. This trial may help researcher determine if high-dose vitamin D helps keep bones strong, lowers number of falls, and lessens fatigue in men getting androgen-deprivation therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the effect of high-dose vitamin D (HDVD) supplementation in prostate cancer patients on ADT-induced bone mineral density loss in the total hip over 52 weeks as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).\n\nII. To evaluate the effect of HDVD supplementation in prostate cancer patients on ADT-induced bone mineral density loss in the femoral neck, distal radius, and lumbar spine (L1-L4) over 52 weeks as measured by DXA.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the effect of HDVD supplementation on falls over 52 weeks as measured by the Falls History questionnaire.\n\nII. To evaluate the effect of HDVD supplementation on fractures over 52 weeks as determined by the Clinical Record Information - Follow-up Form.\n\nIII. To evaluate the effect of HDVD supplementation on quality of life over 52 weeks as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Prostate (FACT-P).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the effect of HDVD supplementation on skeletal muscle mass as measured by DXA.\n\nII. To explore the effect of HDVD supplementation on bone biomarkers measured by Millipore Luminex/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays from serum.\n\nIII. To evaluate the effect of HDVD supplementation on pain, fatigue, sleep, and activities of daily living over 52 weeks as measured by patient-reported outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE: After undergoing collection of blood and DXA scan, patents are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive HDVD orally (PO) throughout the study. Patients also undergo collection of blood and DXA scan on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO throughout the study. Patients also undergo collection of blood and DXA scan on study."
