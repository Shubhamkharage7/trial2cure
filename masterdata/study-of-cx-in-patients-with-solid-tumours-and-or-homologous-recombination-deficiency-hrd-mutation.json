The safety and tolerability of CX-5461, preliminary evidence of antitumor effect and the effect of CX-5461 on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will also be evaluated. The study will also evaluate the predictive value of mutational signatures and explore the significance of dynamic changes in ctDNA levels and plasma DNA methylome profiling in this study's exploratory cohort.",

Early phase 1 studies suggest CX-5461 has activity and warrants further investigation in HR-deficient tumors. This study aims to determine the tolerable dose of CX-5461 for phase II studies, amongst an expansion cohorts of BRCA1/2, PALB2 or HRD mutant tumors."

Any continuation on study treatment must be discussed with and approved by study sponsor.\n11. Patients may be potentially eligible where the current tissue diagnosis is confirmed histologically from biopsy of a target lesion, and the patient has had no evidence of active second malignancy which requires treatment or would confound interpretation of safety, tolerability and efficacy of CX-5461.
