The investigators will use a secure, web-based platform, iCardia, to support continuous real-time remote monitoring of activity data from Fitbit devices and personalized communication via SMS based on incoming data. The investigators will set up the Fitbit networking settings on participants' phones to give notifications when there are posts to this group. Individual goals and a weekly team goal of steps will be set up by the research team. Each member will be awarded a badge upon reaching each individual's weekly goal.
