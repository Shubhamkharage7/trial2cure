            "briefSummary": "The Hyper IgE Syndromes (HIES) are primary immunodeficiencies resulting in eczema and recurrent skin and lung infections. Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIIES; Job's syndrome) is caused by STAT3 mutations, and is a multi-system disorder with skeletal, vascular, and connective tissue manifestations. Understanding how STAT3 mutations cause these diverse clinical manifestations is critical to our complete understanding of bone metabolism, bronchiectasis, dental maturation, and atherosclerosis. Bi-allelic mutations in DOCK8 cause a combined immunodeficiency previously described as autosomal-recessive Hyper IgE syndrome. These individuals suffer from extensive viral infections as well as have a high incidence of malignancy and mortality. The pathogenesis of this disease and long-term natural history is being investigated. Therefore, we seek to enroll patients and families with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of HIES syndrome for extensive phenotypic and genotypic study as well as disease management. Patients will be carefully examined by a multidisciplinary team and followed longitudinally. Through these studies we hope to better characterize the clinical presentation of STAT3-mutated HIES, DOCK8 deficiency and other causes of the hyper IgE phenotype, and to be able to identify further genetic etiologies, as well as understand the pathogenesis of HIES. We seek to enroll 300 patients and 300 relatives....",
