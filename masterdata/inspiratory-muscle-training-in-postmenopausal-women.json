            "briefSummary": "This study is being conducted by the Department of Kinesiology within the School of Public Health at Indiana University Bloomington. The purpose of this study is to better understand how inspiratory muscle strength training affects cardiovascular health and mood disturbance in postmenopausal women.",
            "detailedDescription": "Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) works by strengthening the respiratory muscles through resistive airflow breathing using a handheld device. The goal being to elicit an adaptive response akin to resistance exercise for locomotor muscles. Labored breathing due to respiratory muscle weakness can detract from physical performance with attendant consequences on independent living. This may trigger a maladaptive cycle that worsens physiological and psychosocial outcomes. IMT from 6-10 weeks has been shown to increase maximal inspiratory pressure, functional capacity, and perceived breathlessness across disease states. To inform an appropriately powered randomized controlled trial, the present work proposes a 2-arm single-blind, randomized pilot study to evaluate outcomes of interest."
