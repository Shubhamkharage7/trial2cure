            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bosentan and how well it works when given together with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Bosentan may block the hormone endothelin and prevent the growth and spread of pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving bosentan with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer compared to chemotherapy alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the safety, toxicity and feasibility of administering bosentan with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the response rate associated with this combination therapy in first line pancreatic cancer patients.\n\nII. To assess the progression-free survival and overall survival of all patients who start protocol therapy, and describe the outcomes based on measures of compliance during the lead-in week, and compliance with supplement during chemotherapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the impact of bosentan on the mass transport in the tumor (surrogate of alterations in tumor stroma and blood flow). (Pharmacodynamic Investigations) II. To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of nab-paclitaxel and bosentan and compare to historic single-agent profile. (Pharmacokinetic Investigations) III. To explore the association between hepatotoxicity to study agents and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) polymorphisms. (Pharmacogenomic Investigations) IV. To explore biomarkers on pre-treatment biopsy samples and peripheral blood samples for correlations of predictive of response.\n\nV. To describe quality of life utilizing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General (FACT-G) questionnaire.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive bosentan orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -7 to 21 or 8-21 of cycle 1 and days 1-21 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days. Patients who complete study treatment without disease progression are followed up every 2 months until disease progression and then biannually thereafter. Patients who complete study treatment with disease progression are followed up biannually."
