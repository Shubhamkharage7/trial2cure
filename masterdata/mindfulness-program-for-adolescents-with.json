Consent, permission, and/or assent will be sought prior to participation in the study. Participant pairs will be randomized into one of two study arms: intervention and wait-list control. All participants will complete a web-based pre-test questionnaire. Adolescents and parents in the intervention group will then receive access to the Aware Program for four weeks. Approximately 4-5 weeks after completing the pre-test questionnaire, all participants will complete a web-based post-test questionnaire (the post-test for the intervention group will include Consumer Satisfaction questions about the program). Adolescents and parents in the wait-list control group will then have the option of reviewing the Aware Program and will receive access for four weeks. After approximately four weeks, they will have the opportunity to complete the Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire about the program."
