To determine the efficacy of the combination of ATRA and Cemiplimab in patients with metastatic/locally advanced -unresectable LMS by assessing objective response (ORR), based on modified RECIST version 1.1 and iRECIST\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n\nI. To study the efficacy of the combination of ATRA and Cemiplimab in patients with advanced LMS, including progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) based on modified RECIST version 1.1 and iRECIST.\n\nII. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of ATRA and Cemiplimab in patients with metastatic/locally advanced -unresectable LMS based upon the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 criteria.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES\n\nI. To study the effect of ATRA on the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the peripheral blood of study patients."
