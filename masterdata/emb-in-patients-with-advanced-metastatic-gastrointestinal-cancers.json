All patients will be prescreened for cMET and EGFR genetic alterations and protein expression. Only those who met the molecular pre-screening criteria will proceed to clinical screening to determine the eligibility. The study will consist of Phase Ib part and Phase II part, both phases will consist of a molecular prescreening period, screening period, treatment period, safety follow-up period, and disease progression follow-up."
