A disposable cartridge, a medication container supplied to participants pre-loaded with pills/capsules. The cartridge includes an integral mouthpiece, which dispenses the pill into the participant's mouth following application of an inhalation.\n2. ReX Remote Digital Nurse (ReX) is a portable medication dispenser with a touchscreen and communicates with the ReX Treatment Manager via the cellular network.\n3. ReX Treatment Manager (RTM) is a web application used for the collection and management of data collected by the ReX.\n4. Reminders dispatched to participants and caregivers according to a predefined logic: email, SMS or via support team call.\n5. Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePROs) questions, tips, reminders, and groups of questions are presented to participants according to a defined logic and are collated in the ReX Treatment Manager.\n6. Thresholds in cases that participant reports exceed a predefined threshold notifications via email and/or text messages will be dispatched to the specified party."
