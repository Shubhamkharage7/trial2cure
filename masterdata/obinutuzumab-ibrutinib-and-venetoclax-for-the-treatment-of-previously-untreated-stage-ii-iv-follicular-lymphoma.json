            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab, ibrutinib, and venetoclax work in treating patients with previously untreated stage II-IV follicular lymphoma. Immunotherapy with obinutuzumab may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib and venetoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving obinutuzumab, ibrutinib, and venetoclax together may work better in treating follicular lymphoma compared to each drug alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab combined with venetoclax and ibrutinib in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) (determined by a positron emission tomography \\[PET\\]/computed tomography \\[CT\\] complete response \\[CR\\] rate at 12 months as per International Workshop Lymphoma Response Criteria, Cheson 2014).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of obinutuzumab in combination with venetoclax and ibrutinib in patients with untreated FL as assessed by frequency, severity, and relatedness of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) as well as frequency of treatment-emergent AEs requiring discontinuation or dose reduction of study drug.\n\nII. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with venetoclax and ibrutinib in subjects with untreated FL as assessed by CR at 30 months, overall response rate (ORR) (CR + partial response \\[PR\\]), duration of response (DOR), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, day 1 of cycles 2-6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24. Patients also receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 (days 4-28 of cycle 1) and ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years."

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are ineligible for this study\n* Sign (or their legally-acceptable representatives must sign) an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study, including biomarkers, and are willing to participate in the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known active central nervous system lymphoma or leptomeningeal disease\n* Follicular lymphoma with evidence of diffuse large B-cell transformation\n* Grade 3b follicular lymphoma\n* Any prior history of other malignancy besides follicular lymphoma, unless the patient has been free of disease for \\>= 5 years and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by the treating physician, except:\n\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\n  * Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease\n* Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue risk\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., patients in whom dosing with obinutuzumab would be contraindicated for safety reasons)\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis C virus, active hepatitis B virus infection, or known bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic active systemic infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization within 4 weeks prior to the start of cycle 1\n\n  * Patients with inactive hepatitis B infection must adhere to hepatitis B reactivation prophylaxis unless contraindicated\n* Patients with a history of confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), positive test results for human T-lymphotropic 1 virus, or suspected active or latent tuberculosis\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any class 3 (moderate) or class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification\n* Significant screening electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities including left bundle branch block, 2nd degree atrioventricular (AV) block, type II AV block, or 3rd degree block. QT prolongation is not a significant ECG abnormality that would warrant exclusion\n* Female subjects who are pregnant, or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study or within 90 days of last dose of study drug. Male subjects who plan to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 90 days after the last dose of study drug\n* Administration of any investigational agent within 28 days of first dose of study drug\n* Patients who have undergone major surgery within 14 days\n* Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug\n* Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease or hemophilia)\n* History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment\n* Subjects with chronic liver disease and hepatic impairment meeting Child-Pugh class C\n* Subjects who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor within 7 days prior to the first dose of ibrutinib or subjects who require continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer\n* Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures\n* Unable to understand the purpose and risks of the study and to provide a signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations)",
