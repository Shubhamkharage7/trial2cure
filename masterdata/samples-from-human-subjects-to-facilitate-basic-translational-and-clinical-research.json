Blood samples may also be collected to make special cells. These are called induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. Pluripotent stem cells are cells that can be converted into any type of cell. Researchers want to study in the lab iPSCs that are derived from blood samples.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo collect samples to help study genes, proteins, sugars, fats, vitamins, and other metabolites found in blood or urine.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy volunteers and patients ages 18 and older\n\nDesign:\n\nFirst-time research study participants at NIH will have an initial visit for this study that should last no more than 1 hour. All other visits should last 20 30 minutes.\n\nParticipants will undergo a limited history and physical exam.\n\nParticipants may have routine blood and urine tests.\n\nIf participants are giving a blood sample, they must have a hemoglobin level checked in the past 12 months to make sure it is safe for them to give a blood sample for research.\n\nParticipants may have a venous blood collection. They may do this at several visits. They will lie on a recliner or couch or sit in a chair. A needle will be placed into a vein in the hand or arm, using sterile techniques. Blood will be withdrawn into multiple syringes or tubes.\n\nParticipants may be asked to provide urine in an appropriate container...",
            "detailedDescription": "Our department is evaluating various aspects of the cardiovascular system and/or endothelial dysfunction and/or inflammation in disease states, such as, but not limited to, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and other pulmonary vascular diseases, arteriosclerosis, transplantation, inflammatory processes and sepsis. The collection of human blood and urine from both research subjects and healthy volunteers is necessary for the development of relevant laboratory assays and protocols, and to further research studies requiring such evaluations. In research subjects undergoing renal replacement therapy who produce limited urine we may also sample ultrafiltrate as a surrogate for urine. This protocol defines in general terms the purposes for which blood, urine and ultrafiltrate will be collected by members of the NIH s Clinical Center (CC), Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD) and collaborating institutions and establishes general conditions under which sampling will be performed."
