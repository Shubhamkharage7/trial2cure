A washout period of 3 weeks will occur between the AB-LT intervention and traditional therapy."

The age-appropriate item cards instruct the rater to begin at a designated \"start phase\" indicated by a bold box around the phase within the 12 phases on each card. If the child cannot perform the movement as listed in the start phase (which may be midway through the card), the rater starts at the beginning of the item card and assesses the child's performance at the first phase for that item. The rater continues sequentially through the 12 phases on the card until the child is unable to perform a phase. The rater scores the highest phase achieved by the child and moves on to the next item card, through all 13 items. Items are then summed into a summary Peds NRS score using an algorithm.",

Typically, T-scores between 30 and 70 (i.e. mean \u00b1 2 standard deviations) are considered within the expected range for age.
