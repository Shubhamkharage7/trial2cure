            "briefSummary": "This phase II study assesses the efficacy of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab, selumetinib, or capivasertib or ceralasertib alone in the treatment of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Olaparib may stop growth of tumor cells by inhibiting some of the enzymes (ADP ribose polymerase \\[PARP\\]) needed for cell growth. Durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits the growth and spread of tumors by stimulating the patient's antitumor immune response. Selumetinib, capivasertib, and ceralasertib are inhibitor drugs that may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes (MEK, AKT, ATR) needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib together with durvalumab, selumetinib, or capivasertib or giving ceralasertib alone may provide an effective method to treat patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess overall response to treatment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess participant benefit from treatment. II. Determine the time to disease progression following response to study therapy.\n\nIII. Determine time to first disease progression or death of participants enrolled on the study.\n\nIV. Determine survival of participants enrolled on the study. V. Assess safety and tolerability of the proposed therapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess a change in quality of life (QOL) as measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) in each treatment arm.\n\nII. To assess a change in QOL as measured by Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-BR23) in each treatment arm.\n\nIII. Examine response rates depending on tumor characteristics. IV. Identify predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. V. Identify emerging mechanism of resistance to therapy. VI. Determine changes in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment induced by PARP inhibitors.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an open-label, multi-arm phase II study of olaparib in combination with durvalumab, selumetinib, or capivasertib, or ceralasertib monotherapy.\n\nLEAD IN: Patients with biopsy proven TNBC undergo a pre-treatment biopsy. At the 2 week mark, patients then undergo a repeat on-treatment biopsy. Patients also receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 for one cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are then assigned to 1 of 4 arms based on predefined molecular tumor characteristics.\n\nARM I: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 of each cycle and durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients deriving clinical benefit from treatment may, at the investigator's discretion and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, continue on therapy beyond the planned 13 cycles.\n\nARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 of each cycle and selumetinib PO BID on days 1-28 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients deriving clinical benefit from treatment may, at the investigator's discretion and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, continue on therapy beyond the planned 13 cycles.\n\nARM III: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 of each cycle and capivasertib PO BID 4 days on and 3 days off of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients deriving clinical benefit from treatment may, at the investigator's discretion and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, continue on therapy beyond the planned 13 cycles.\n\nARM IV: Patients receive ceralasertib PO BID on days 1-14 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients deriving clinical benefit from treatment may, at the investigator's discretion and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, continue on therapy beyond the planned 13 cycles.\n\nAt the completion of all on-study procedures, patients are followed up every 6 months for disease and survival outcomes up to 1 year. Patients will be asked to submit an optional tumor biopsy in the event of disease progression."
