            "briefSummary": "In this research study we want to learn more about the character of neutrophils that are present in the blood of children with sepsis. Sepsis is a severe type of infection, affecting various parts of the body. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that are part of the body's immune system. Even though neutrophils are important in getting rid of germs, they also may be harmful to parts of the body by causing injury in organs in patients with sepsis. Neutrophils can change their character in sepsis. Because of this, it is important for doctors to know what kind of neutrophils are in the blood of children with sepsis so that they can work to develop therapies to prevent these cells from being harmful."
