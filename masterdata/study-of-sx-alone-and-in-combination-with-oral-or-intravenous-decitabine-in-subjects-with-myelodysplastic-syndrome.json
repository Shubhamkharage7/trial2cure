The first participants will be administered 25 mg orally twice daily. Unless dose limiting toxicities occur, participants will enroll and receive the following increasing twice daily doses of SX-682: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg.\n\nAfter establishing the maximum tolerated dose 140 additional participants will be enrolled at the recommended phase 2 dose. Participants will receive continuous SX-682 twice daily oral therapy in 28-day cycles for a total of 6 cycles. The expansion dose cohort will be stratified into IPSS (a) low and intermediate-1 (N=20 SX-682 alone in HMA naive, N=20 SX-682 alone in HMA failure, N=20 SX-682 + DEC-C in HMA-na\u00efve, N=20 SX-682 + DEC-C in HMA-failure) and (b) intermediate-2 and high risk (N=20 SX-682 alone in HMA failure, N=20 SX-682 + DEC-C in HMA-naive, N=20 SX-682 + DEC-C in HMA-failure) MDS. For patients responding well at the end of 6 cycles treatment may continue until disease progression or an adverse event leads to SX-682 discontinuation. Except for blood product transfusions, concurrent therapy for Myelodysplastic Syndromes is not permitted."
