Patients may receive standard of care systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy). Radiotherapy will be directed at high-risk disease (primary cancer, nodal metastases, and metastases) in the thorax. Treatment of other sites of extrathoracic metastases would be allowed as per standard of care. Standard chest radiation dosing and normal tissue exposures (based on published or ongoing studies) will be applied. There is no plan to escalate the chest radiation dose (i.e., no Phase I component) as palliative regimens for NSCLC have been routinely used for many decades."

Subjects must be enrolled within 6 months of first cycle of systemic therapy for Stage IV disease.\n* Systemic therapy following the thoracic radiotherapy (on protocol) is allowed.\n* Prior palliative surgical treatment (including airway debridement) is allowed.\n* Concurrent chemotherapy (chemotherapy delivered from \u22642 days of before through \u22642 days after radiotherapy) is NOT allowed.\n* Concurrent immunotherapy therapy is allowed.\n* Subjects may undergo (or may have undergone) standard extrathoracic radiotherapy off protocol, including (but not limited to): Palliation of symptomatic bone metastases, prophylactic palliation of high-risk bone metastases, cranial radiosurgery (with controlled intracranial metastases if performed prior to enrollment), Ablative or non-ablative definitive radiotherapy for oligometastases.\n* Subjects may undergo concurrent palliative thoracic radiotherapy (per study) and palliative radiotherapy for thoracic bone metastases (i.e., painful spine or rib metastases). It is anticipated that the study will be open at multiple sites within the Wilmot Cancer Institute network. Among these sites, subjects may be consulted and consented at any site, simulated and planned at any site, and treated at any site (even if different from the site(s) at which the subject was consulted and simulated).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior radiation therapy to the thoracic region.\n* Active systemic lupus or Sjogren's disease.\n* NSCLC (primary, nodal sites or metastases) causing severe symptoms requiring thoracic palliative radiotherapy for indications other than bone pain. These symptoms include superior vena cava syndrome, active and large volume (\\>100 ml per day) hemoptysis, airway obstruction (stridor, post-obstructive pneumonia, progressive dyspnea not attributed to other causes), compression of the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots, vertebral compression fracture, brachial plexopathy (from compression).\n* Baseline ECOG performance status of 3-4. For the purposes of eligibility, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) will be converted to ECOG/Zubrod performance score, per ECOG guidelines.\n* Brain metastases not amenable to immunotherapy alone, resection or stereotactic radiosurgery (i.e., brain metastases requiring whole brain radiotherapy).\n* Malignant pleural effusion attributable to grossly apparent pleural disease. Subjects with malignant pleural effusion amenable to therapeutic thoracenteses and without radiographic evidence of pleural disease (i.e., studding or masses) are potentially eligible.",
