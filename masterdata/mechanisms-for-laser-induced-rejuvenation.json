The purpose of this study is to determine the origin of cells called fibroblasts which are present after treatment with Fractionated Laser Resurfacing (FLR). These cells restore a youth-like ultraviolet B (UVB) response, but where they come from is currently unknown. The study recruits subjects who are scheduled to undergo abdominoplasties to investigate the origin of those cells stimulated by laser treatment."

This is defined as a subject who needs high doses of insulin, recent history of hospitalization for diabetes-related complications, or poor wound health as evidenced by diabetic ulcers. Subjects who have been deemed healthy enough for abdominoplasty surgery would tend to suggest that their diabetes should not be an issue. However, if the subjects have diabetic complications as outlined above, they could affect the wound healing which is the object of this protocol so they would be excluded.\n* Pregnant or nursing\n* History of pathologically abnormal wound healing such as keloidal scars\n* Existing tattoos on the abdomen that are so extensive that they could interfere with the study",
