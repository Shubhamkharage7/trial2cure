We are looking to recruit 60 Black men with type 2 diabetes (need to have diagnosis for at least 6 months) that are over the age of 21. Interested participants need to be under the care of a physician for their diabetes, have access to reliable transportation for study activities, and be willing to participate in 4 health assessments where they will get their A1C, blood pressure, height, and weight measured and they will complete a survey. All participants will receive 10 hours of diabetes self-management education with a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will also be offered 6 months of monthly diabetes self-management support (DSMS) sessions with trained Peer Leaders who are also Black men with type 2 diabetes. After the 6 months of support, this group will transition into 6 months of ongoing support where they can continue DSMS and/or other diabetes related initiatives that are important to the group and chosen by the group. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, DSME and DSMS sessions will likely be held via Zoom, ongoing support sessions have potential to be in person. The 4 health assessments will take place at baseline, 3-months, 9-months, and 15-months."
