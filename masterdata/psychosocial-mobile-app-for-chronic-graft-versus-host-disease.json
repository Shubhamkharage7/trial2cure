            "detailedDescription": "Frequently patients living with chronic GVHD experience physical and emotional symptoms during the course of illness that impacts their quality of life. Patients also often report difficulty managing many of the tasks they need to do to manage their chronic GVHD. They also frequently have a lot of questions about chronic GVHD and the expected trajectory of this illness.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to see whether a psychosocial mobile app called Horizons is effective at improving quality of life, symptom burden, and psychological distress in patients with chronic GVHD\n\n* This study will randomly assign participants to either receiving Horizons plus usual care or usual care alone.\n* Enrolled participants will be on the research study for up to sixteen weeks and it is expected that about 120 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe Leukemia and Lymphoma Society is supporting this research by providing funding."
