In this project, the investigators will adapt and test an evidence-based multilevel intervention entitled PILI '\u0100ina to improve the self-management of prevalent cardiometabolic diseases and reduce risk factors for developing new diet-related illnesses and implement and evaluate the impact and sustainability of community-wide cooking demonstrations. The objectives of this project are to optimize the effectiveness and sustainability of PILI '\u0100ina, improve diet quality, cardiometabolic markers, promote traditional Native Hawaiian diets, and improve social cohesion.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will conduct a group-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of PILI Aina for improving diet and health at the individual and household levels compared to a Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention only group. The investigators will enroll 180 Native Hawaiian adults with overweight or obesity and at least 1 other diet-related cardiometabolic condition (Type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, hypertension, pre-hypertension, dyslipidemia). These index participants will receive the 3-month educational program and then be randomized at the household level to the 6-month PILI Aina intervention or to a control group. Data collection will occur at baseline and 3, 9, and 12 months. Other adult household members will be invited to participate in data collection at the same time to evaluate household-level effects."
