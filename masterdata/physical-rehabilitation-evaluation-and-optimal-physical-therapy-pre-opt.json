(n=200) Phase 2: This is a randomized controlled trial to 1) quantify the effects of (i) physical therapy compared to (ii) a control group in individuals with AWS following breast cancer surgery related to physical activity and physical impairments such as lymphedema, shoulder motion, function, and pain (n=44, 22 in each group). Funding to progress to Phase 2 of this trial has been obtained. It is anticipated 120 subjects participating in Phase 1 will be screened for eligibility for Phase 2 (separate consent and eligibility from Phase 1)."
