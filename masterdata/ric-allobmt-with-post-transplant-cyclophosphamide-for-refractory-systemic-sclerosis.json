            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase I, single arm, open label, single center pilot study to assess a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, bone marrow transplantation with high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in recipients with refractory systemic sclerosis. This study expects to enroll 15 donor/recipient pairs for a total of 30 participants.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of using a reduced intensity condition (RIC) preparative regimen bone marrow transplant (BMT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for graft vs host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis as treatment for patients with scleroderma. Safety events are grade III-IV GVHD and treatment related mortality within 1 year.\n\nEligibility includes patients \\>18 years who are eligible for transplantation according to the BMT Policy Manual, meet the 2013 ACR/EULAR Criteria for Systemic Sclerosis and display active diffuse cutaneous disease.\n\nThe trial also includes analyses of the effects of BMT on skeletal and cardiac muscle using systemic scleroderma serum biomarkers of CK, aldolase, and troponin as well as periodic monitoring of circulating scleroderma auto-antibody titers, autoreactive T cells, and flow cytometric signatures over the one-year study period to correlate with response.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug cyclophosphamide given after bone marrow transplantation is safe and effective in patients with systemic sclerosis that have not responded to other standard treatments.\n\nSystemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is a systemic autoimmune disease associated with high morbidity and mortality, with an estimated prevalence of 50-300 per million persons/year and incidence of 2.3-22.9 per million persons/year. Currently there exists no cure for scleroderma, and medical management is entirely off-label, with no FDA approved drugs for this condition. Treatment is based on symptom management focused on the specific organ system affected such as the lung, skin, musculoskeletal, cardiac, renal, or gastrointestinal systems.\n\nInterest in improving response rates and decreasing relapse has turned attention toward allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-BMT). The possibility of maintaining control of autoimmunity by means of mixed chimerism in these autoimmune diseases is quite important. These patients may not need full engraftment to have disease modification. There is still concern about the morbidity GVHD for these patients in the allogeneic setting as well as a potentially limited number of available donors. Towards this end, the study was developed with an approach to BMT using post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) that allows safe performance of allogeneic BMT from matched, mismatched, unrelated or haploidentical donors.\n\nGiven that there are responses of refractory systemic sclerosis (SSc) to immunosuppressive therapy in some form, eligible patients will be required to have experienced disease progression despite at least one course of immunosuppressive therapy. In general, this will be defined as progression of skin or lung disease despite optimal courses of therapy or failure to tolerate therapeutic doses of immunosuppressive therapy. Potential donors will be excluded if the donors report a history of autoimmunity. The rationale for this comes from the knowledge that gender, a genetically controlled factor, plays a role in the incidence of autoimmune disease.\n\nThe study regimen includes several days of chemotherapy, immunosuppressant, and a single dose of radiation followed by the bone marrow transplant. After the transplant, recipient patients will receive two doses of the intravenous (IV, through a vein) chemotherapy cyclophosphamide and two oral medications to prevent graft versus host disease and to aid in bone marrow engraftment. After a while, the anti-rejection medications are stopped.\n\nDuring this time, a chimerism assay that defines how much of the blood comes from donor cells and how much of the blood comes from the recipient will be performed at four weeks, eight weeks, six months, one year after the transplant. This test will tell if the donor's transplanted cells are surviving long term in the recipient.\n\nIf a recipient participant is eligible, the study regimen will begin about 30 days before bone marrow transplantation and participation will continue for up to 1 year after transplant."

Renal: estimated creatinine clearance \u2265 40 mL/minute (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and actual body weight).\n\n   Cockcroft-Gault formula, based on ideal body weight (IBW):\n\n   Creatinine clearance (CrCl) = (140 - age) x IBW (kg) x 0.85 for females/polymerase chain reaction (PCr) x 72 d. Pulmonary: DLCO (corrected/adjusted for hemoglobin) \\> 40% and forced expiratory volume (FEV1) \\> 50% predicted (without administration of bronchodilator) and FVC \\> 50% predicted.\n   * Patients not meeting eligibility for adequate organ function may still be eligible for the study if deemed reasonably safe and clinically appropriate by the investigator following consultation with the appropriate specialist (e.g., cardiology, nephrology, or pulmonology).\n9. Karnofsky performance score\\>70%\n10. Patients with a history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must be on suppressive therapy, if indicated, with undetectable HBV viral load within 6 months.\n11. Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have received prior treatment or must be receiving treatment currently with undetectable HCV viral load within 6 months.\n\nDonor inclusion criteria:\n\n1. HLA-matched or -haploidentical, parent, child, sibling, or half-sibling of the recipient\n2. Eligible as per donor selection in FDA 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1271\n3. Meets all requirements for bone marrow donor selection criteria as described in the standard Johns Hopkins BMT Policies and Procedures.Donors who do not meet one or more of the donor screening requirements may donate under urgent medical need as determined by the principal investigators. Medically healthy with no clinically significant findings in the physical examination, medical history, vital signs which, in the judgment of the investigator, would inappropriately jeopardize the safety of the subject, interfere with study assessments, or impact the validity of the study results;\n4. No history of any clinically significant immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease including hematologic malignancy or history of solid organ or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation;\n5. Ability to understand and provide informed consent for all study procedures including bone marrow harvest.\n\nRecipient Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnant, breast feeding, or considering becoming pregnant during the course of the study;\n2. Requiring IV antimicrobial treatment or hospitalization within 7 days prior to study enrollment for known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds);\n3. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection;\n4. Active or unresolved gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) syndrome;\n5. Active or unresolved scleroderma renal crisis;\n6. Clinically significant pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, or other cardiopulmonary disease with inadequate organ function as defined above\\*\\*;\n7. Any illness or condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would inappropriately jeopardize the safety of the subject, interfere with study assessments, or impact the validity of the study results;\n8. Known malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer;\n9. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntary incarceration) for treatment of either a physical or psychiatric illness;\n10. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements or assessment of immunologic endpoints;\n11. History of significant allergic reactions, hypersensitivity, or intolerance attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cyclophosphamide or other agents used in the study.\n\n    * Patients not meeting eligibility for adequate organ function may still be eligible for the study if deemed reasonably safe and clinically appropriate by the investigator following consultation with the appropriate specialist (e.g., cardiology, nephrology, or pulmonology).",
