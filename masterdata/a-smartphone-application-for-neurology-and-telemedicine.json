            "briefSummary": "This observational research study is designed to assess the feasibility of developing a new software application that can be used in the home using a commercially available camera to measure abnormal body movements associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal of this study is to validate the motor outcomes derived from a consumer camera observing a sub-set of standardized assessment tasks with respect to the reference motion capture system.",
            "detailedDescription": "The long-term goal of this project is to develop a new software application (NeuroVision App) for a smartphone or tablet that can be used in the home to measure abnormal body movements associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). The outcomes are intended to enhance PD symptom monitoring in the context of telehealth videoconferences with a clinician. Typical abnormal body movements that can be assessed with the proposed solution include uncontrolled shaking of hands and limbs (tremor) or spastic movements (dyskinesia) while at rest; abnormally slow movements when reaching or walking (bradykinesia); or inability to initiate a movement (akinesia) using 5 standardized motor assessment tasks (sitting at rest, walking, finger tapping, foot tapping, and foot stomping) derived from the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The proposed solution will make it easier for the doctor to periodically assess the motor signs of PD during remote telehealth appointments which may be more convenient and safer for the patient. Current reliance on videoconferencing apps make it difficult to record and measure such symptoms accurately in a telehealth setting."
