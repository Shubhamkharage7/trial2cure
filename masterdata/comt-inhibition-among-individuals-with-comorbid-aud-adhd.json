            "detailedDescription": "This study evaluates the effects of an FDA-approved medication called tolcapone in people who have both Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The study involves seven visits over a three to four week period, including an assessment visit and two eight-day medication periods during which participants will be assigned to take, in a double-blinded fashion, both tolcapone and a placebo (three visits during each period). During two of these visits, participants will undergo a one-hour MRI scan. Participants must not be seeking treatment for AUD or ADHD and must not be currently taking any psychotropic medications, including stimulant medications for ADHD."
