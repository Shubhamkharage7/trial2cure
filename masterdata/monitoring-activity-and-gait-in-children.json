            "briefSummary": "COHORT A: To study whether a digital health tool called Actigraph can be used to collect information on gait and physical activity in healthy children aged 3-17. The study will be conducted at the Pfizer Innovation Research Laboratory (PfIRe Lab) in Cambridge MA. In the lab at the first visit, we will ask participants to do activities such as walking on different surfaces as well as to roll a dice and move between different activity stations. Children will wear 2 Actigraph devices, one as a watch and one as a belt. They will then go home and do usual daily activities while answering a brief daily activity diary for approximately 2 weeks. The conclusion of the study will be over the telephone and include questions on the comfort and wearability of the device. The analysis of gait and physical activity as well as adherence and wearability will be looked across three different age groups 3-5, 6-11, and 12-17.\n\nCOHORT B: Cohort B of the study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the Panoramic Bracelet and associated algorithms such as SleepPy and GaitPy compared to the GENEActiv device and to evaluate the comfort and wearability of the Panoramic Bracelet. The results of this study will enable the use of novel devices in future clinical trials measuring scratch and sleep. . In the lab at the first visit, we will ask participants to do activities such as walking on different surfaces as well as to roll a dice and move between different activity stations. They will then go home and do usual daily activities while wearing both devices in the same wrist at different times stipulated in the protocol, answering a brief daily activity and sleep diary for approximately 2 weeks. Cohort B includes questions on the comfort and wearability of the Panoramic device on Day 7 approximately. The conclusion of the study will be over the telephone.The analysis will be looked across three different age groups 3-5, 6-11, and 12-17"
