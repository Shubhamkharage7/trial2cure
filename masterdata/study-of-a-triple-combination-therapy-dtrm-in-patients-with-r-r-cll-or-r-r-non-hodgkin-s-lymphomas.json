            "briefSummary": "Targeted drug therapies have greatly improved outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, single drug therapies have limitations, therefore, the current study is evaluating a novel oral combination of targeted drugs as a way of overcoming these limitations. This study will determine the efficacy of the triple combination therapy, DTRM-555, in patients with R/R CLL or R/R non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is being conducted in three parts: Phase Ia, Phase Ib and Phase II, disease-specific expansion cohorts. Phase Ia explored escalating doses of a monotherapy of a novel Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor, DTRMWXHS-12. Phase Ib explored two combination therapies, DTRM-505 (DTRMWXHS-12 and everolimus) and DTRM-555 (DTRMWXHS-12, everolimus and pomalidomide).\n\nThe current Phase II study will further examine the investigational triple combination treatment, DTRM-555 for efficacy and safety. The study is being conducted in five disease-specific cohorts: Activated B-Cell (ABC) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Germinal Center B-Cell (GCB) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Richter's Transformation, transformed Follicular Lymphoma, and relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.\n\nThe Primary Objective of the Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of the triple combination therapy, DTRM-555, in the five disease-specific cohorts. The Secondary Objectives are (1) to determine the safety of DTRM-555 in the cohorts and (2) to obtain the pharmacokinetics of DTRM-555 (i.e., DTRMWXHS-12, everolimus and pomalidomide)."
