            "briefSummary": "This study hopes to provide significant technical improvement in a Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) quantification technique to address challenges and technical limitations for MBF CMR. By developing and validating novel techniques to improve first-pass perfusion (FPP) cardiac MR, we propose to increase diagnostic accuracy by minimizing false positives and false negatives, allow for better evaluation and accurate quantification of total ischemic burden and reduce image and motion-induced artifacts.\n\nThe broad, long-term objective of the proposed project is to improve the prognosis of patients with myocardial ischemia caused by coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD).",
            "detailedDescription": "All subjects will receive cardiac MRI scans to diagnose CAD or CMD. MR perfusion scans will be performed twice per subject: once at rest, and once after administration of a pharmacologic stress agent. There will be a \\>15 minute delay between the two scans. A gadolinium-based contrast agent will be administered during each scan to allow measurement of myocardial blood flow. Once myocardial blood flow is quantified, the measurements will be compared to previous reference measurements (when available) from PET myocardial perfusion imaging in the CAD patient cohort and coronary reactivity testing (CRT) in the CMD patient cohort."
