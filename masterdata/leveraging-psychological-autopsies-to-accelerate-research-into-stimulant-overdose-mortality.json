            "briefSummary": "In the LASSO study, the investigators will identify 100 stimulant overdose decedents (divided among stimulant-only, and stimulant with fentanyl), conduct informant interviews (including scales and qualitative data), and gather data from the postmortem investigation (e.g., vital records, toxicology, autopsy, case narrative, death scene photographs) and medical record abstraction. Subsequently, study staff will conduct qualitative interviews with 40-60 living people who use stimulants (aiming for half methamphetamine, half cocaine) to explore elements of resilience and risk reduction strategies. This study aims to contribute to the eventual design of interventions to reduce stimulant overdose mortality.",
            "detailedDescription": "Death from acute stimulant toxicity (\"overdose\") is rapidly rising across the United States. While there are decades of research and program development undergirding opioid overdose prevention, there is minimal understanding of the nature of stimulant overdose mortality. Psychological autopsies have been shown to be immensely valuable in understanding opioid overdose deaths, identifying many of the key elements of overdose that still drive overdose prevention efforts today, and the investigators propose to leverage that mechanism to accelerate our understanding of and response to stimulant overdose mortality, as well as the role of fentanyl in fatal stimulant overdose.\n\nThe investigators will identify 100 stimulant overdose decedents (divided among stimulant-only, and stimulant with fentanyl), conduct informant interviews (including scales and qualitative data), and gather data from the postmortem investigation (e.g., vital records, toxicology, autopsy, case narrative, death scene photographs) and medical record abstraction. Subsequently, the study team will conduct qualitative interviews with 40-60 living people who use stimulants (aiming for half methamphetamine, half cocaine) to explore elements of resilience and risk reduction strategies.
