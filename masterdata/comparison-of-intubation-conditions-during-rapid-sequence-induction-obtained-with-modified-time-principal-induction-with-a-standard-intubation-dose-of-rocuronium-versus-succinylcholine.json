Specifically, the investigators will be evaluating ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord view, vocal cord opening, and movement of limbs and coughing during tracheal intubation in order to assess intubation conditions, to compare efficiency and success rate of tracheal intubation between two induction agents and to determine the rate of patient awareness during induction and post-operative recall of paralysis."
