In this study, only individuals who have NSCLC that is advanced (Stage IV), or has come back (recurred), will be able to participate.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II open-label trial of pembrolizumab sequentially following upfront non-ablative focal therapy to up to five distinct metastatic subsites in de novo stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The primary goal of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy defined by time to progression or death with upfront non-ablative focal radiation (RT) to index lesions as a way of enhancing the anti-tumor immune response to pembrolizumab. Adult patients with metastatic NSCLC, with at least 2 measurable lesions and those Patients with metastatic NSCLC who are previously untreated are eligible for the study if they meet all inclusion criteria, and do not satisfy any exclusion criteria. Participants will receive standard of care immunotherapy of Pembrolizumab in addition to non-ablative radiation. The intervention is the low dose fractionation, 4Gy x 5, in the upfront treatment of de novo stage IV NSCLC in up to five distinct subsites of metastatic NSCLC."

Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n14.
