Investigators will provide 6 months of a group program (PBT-A or HE) and will follow participants for 12-months post-treatment (total time = 18 months). Investigators will recruit parents of children diagnosed with autism and overweight or obesity. Assessments will occur at 5 timepoints: baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Assessments will include anthropometry for both parent and child. Parent will also provide information regarding autism diagnosis and characteristics, eating behaviors, and parenting relationship measures. This program of research has the potential to advance the standard of practice for children with autism and overweight or obesity by developing tailored interventions which can be easily disseminated."
