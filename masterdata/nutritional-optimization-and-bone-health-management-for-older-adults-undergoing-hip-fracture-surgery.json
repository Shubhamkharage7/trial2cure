            "detailedDescription": "This collaborative pilot study is led by a PI who is a board-certified orthopaedic surgeon with extensive experience in the care of older adults with hip fractures. In addition, the multidisciplinary study team includes a research health scientist with vast experience in nutrition, preventive health, and gerontology. The study team will also be supported by a physical therapist and researcher in the field of rehabilitation of older adults with musculoskeletal disorders. Furthermore, an occupational therapist with expertise in rehabilitation science, conduct of pilot studies, and analysis of interview data will play an important role in this study. Moreover, the statistical analyses will be performed by an expert statistical consultant from our institution, who will be reimbursed on a fee for service basis."
