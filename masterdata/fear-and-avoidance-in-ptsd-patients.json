            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to study how the brain learn to avoid certain stimuli or situations using an experimental paradigm. The big goal is to measure brain responses and subject's feelings and expectations when they are learning to actively avoid experimental stimuli, and how fear extinction learning and monetary cost can change how and when subjects are to avoid.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to study the neural correlates of avoidance learning using a recently validated conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP). The overarching objective is to measure the neural correlates of active avoidance, and how fear extinction learning and monetary cost modulate these avoidance responses. Participants will include trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHC), and participants with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Avoidance is common and often hinders the progression and success of extinction-based exposure therapy in PTSD. The data to be gathered in this study will enable us to probe neural mechanisms of avoidance, extinction, and decision-making to avoid or not, in addition to understanding the impact of cost on avoidance decision-making. These data will provide a more integrated platform for the understanding of the mechanisms of avoidance in both trauma-exposed healthy controls and PTSD psychopathology, which has important implications for treatment."
