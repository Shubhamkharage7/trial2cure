There are several reasons that suggest that surgical resection will likely enhance the activity of immunotherapy in glioblastoma.This includes 1) direct impact on tumor cells; 2) impact on immune cells; and 3) impact on immune infiltration. The combination of the evidence that neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab has a positive effect on GBM survival, the evidence in lung cancer that chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapies are synergistic and the clinical utility of surgery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma has suggested that the neoadjuvant administration of Pembrolizumab and temozolomide prior to and following maximal surgical resection represents a very attractive experimental combination for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.",
