            "briefSummary": "This study aims to obtain data on the potential influence of Vine to Bar product(s) containing Chardonnay marc on cardiometabolic health. These initial studies will inform the design and timing of data collection for future dietary intervention trials that will examine the influence of Chardonnay marc intake on outcomes/biomarkers of both cardiometabolic health and the gut microbiome. This includes collecting data on the potential differences in response to the products based on the unique food matrix for each of the products that will be tested. Moreover, as there is a paucity of data on the influence of cocoa flavanol intake on vascular function beyond 4 hours post intake, the response of the selected outcomes will be assessed after 6 hours of flavanol intake. This is a time point that captures the increased circulating presence of microbial derived flavanol metabolites.",
            "detailedDescription": "The current set of trials will be of an acute (single intake, followed over 6 hours) that examines the postprandial response of individuals to the products. These preclinical trials will be conducted in the same individuals in an crossover design in order to limit individual variability, and keep the numbers small (5 individuals maximum), but still be able to assess the response to the different products."
