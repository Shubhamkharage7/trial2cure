            "briefSummary": "Keloids are common, benign cutaneous overgrowths that manifest clinically as raised, hypertrophic, often hyperpigmented lesions which are formed in response to dermal injury or idiopathic stimuli. Although keloids are a common disease, it's exact incidence and prevalence is not known. Despite the debilitating nature of keloids, current treatment modalities are limited in efficacy; there is no universally effective therapy available to patients. The research team hypothesize that ritlecitinib as a JAK3/TEC inhibitor will be able to reverse both the systemic and local keloid disease process by re-establishing immune homeostasis.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective, two-arm, open-label clinical trial to investigate efficacy and safety of ritlecitinib in patients with keloid. The study will take place at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The study will consist of 2 arms: a total of 20 patients receiving keloidectomy and a total of 10 patients with no keloidectomy during the study and with at least one keloid measuring \u22653 cm or multiple keloids, measuring \u22651 cm in length each. Patients will be treated with ritlecitinib 50 mg QD for 36 weeks starting at Day 1. Participants will attend clinic visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 36 for assessments, questionnaires and safety laboratory tests. The follow-up period will be 6 months, with clinic visits at Weeks 48 and 60."

This includes the following:\n\n  * Patient on concomitant medications that are substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic index where small concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions\n  * Patient on concomitant medications that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 as this might cause loss of efficacy of ritlecitinib\n* Use of an oral JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, ritlecitinib) within 3 months prior to the Baseline visit.\n* Patient has used topical corticosteroids, and/or tacrolimus, and/or pimecrolimus, and/or topical chemotherapy on any keloid lesions within 2 weeks prior to the Baseline visit.
