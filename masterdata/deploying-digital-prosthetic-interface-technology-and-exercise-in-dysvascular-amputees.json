The technology-based intervention will be combined with an exercise program designed to improve the health status of dysvascular amputees.",

This hypothesis will be tested by recruiting a group of dysvascular amputees (herein meant to refer to individuals who lost a lower limb secondary diabetes mellitus type II) and by randomizing them to either receiving a digital prosthetic interface technology or a traditional socket and liner system. Furthermore, the study will assess if the digital prosthetic interface technology improves adherence to an exercise program and results in better clinical outcomes. To test this hypothesis, an exercise intervention will be deployed by relying on coaching and mobile health technology to encourage adherence to a walking program targeting dysvascular transtibial amputees. This exercise intervention is an extension of pilot work that demonstrated the suitability of mobile health technology to implement an exercise-based intervention program in dysvascular amputees."
