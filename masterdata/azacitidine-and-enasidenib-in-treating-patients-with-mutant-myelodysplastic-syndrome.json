Azacitidine and enasidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of enasidenib alone, and enasidenib in combination with azacitidine (AZA), for patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n\nII. To assess the efficacy of the combination of enasidenib + azacitidine in hypomethylating agent (HMA) naive subjects with IDH2-mutated MDS, and to assess the efficacy of enasidenib single-agent in subjects with IDH2-mutated MDS who are relapsed/refractory to HMA therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate molecular and cellular markers that may be predictive of antitumor activity and/or resistance including evaluation of IDH2 variant allele fraction (VAF) levels during treatment and presence of co-occurring mutations.\n\nII. To assess overall survival, event-free survival and duration of response of enasidenib alone, and enasidenib in combination with azacitidine.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess changes in cellular differentiation and changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation profiles in IDH2-mutated MDS treated with enasidenib alone and with enasidenib + azacitidine.\n\nII. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) using an MDS-specific measure.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients who are HMA-naive receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and azacitidine intravenously (IV) oveer 30-60 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients relapsed and/or refractory to HMA therapy receive enasidenib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years."
