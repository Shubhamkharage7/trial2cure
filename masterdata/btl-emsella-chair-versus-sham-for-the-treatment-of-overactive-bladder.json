            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the Emsella Chair therapy to Sham and to determine whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Currently there are no other studies utilizing the Emsella Chair for the treatment of OAB. Eligible subjects will receive 2 treatments per week for a total of 4 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common and often debilitating condition in both men and women. OAB symptoms including urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge incontinence (UI), have been found to negatively impact quality of life. Due to side effects and the lack of patient compliance to pharmacologic treatments for OAB, non-pharmacologic treatments are in high demand for this condition. Neuromodulation therapies have become increasingly popular for the treatment of overactive bladder in men and women. These neuromodulation therapies work in treating OAB by stimulating the pudendal nerve. The BTL EmsellaTM (Emsella Chair) is a conservative neuromodulation therapy that may have a role for patients who are not surgical candidates or who desire a noninvasive treatment option. The ideal treatment for OAB is still lacking. Many patients are interested in pursuing conservative treatment options. The Emsella chair may have a role for patient who do not desire surgery found with SNM or desire a noninvasive treatment option.\n\nThe Emsella chair is approved as a treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Overactive bladder patients may benefit from treatment. The Emsella chair generates electromagnetic stimulation which is able to penetrate deep into the pelvic floor muscles inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation for weak pelvic floor muscles. The Emsella chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders. HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over 28 minutes."
