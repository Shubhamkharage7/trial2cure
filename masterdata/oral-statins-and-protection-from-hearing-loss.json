Will the addition of an oral statin to the standard treatment (oral methylprednesolone and the salvage therapy of intratympanic dexamethasone) improve the treatment outcome for patients with ISSNHL? This study will compare the two treatments and quantitatively evaluate hearing and speech discrimination and have the patients subjectively evaluate tinnitus.",
            "detailedDescription": "After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients diagnosed with idopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss who do not meet the exclusion criteria and do meet the inclusion criteria, and who give written informed consent will be enrolled in the trial. A standard treatment for ISSNHL (oral methyprednisolone) will be given to half of the patients and the other half of the patients will receive the standard treatment plus either a placebo or a 7-day course of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a statin). Patients will return for follow up, the timing and further treatment of which will be determined by the response to the drugs. At each appointment, the patients will see the medical professional, have a hearing test, a speech in noise test, and self evaluate for tinnitus. If there is no improvement after 2 weeks, patient will be offered up to two intratympanic doses of dexamethasone, 10 days apart. This is a randomized, double-blind prospective study. Randomization of males will be separate from that of females."
