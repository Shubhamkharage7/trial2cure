Sixty male and female patients with HIV who have depression, anhedonia and high inflammation and are stable on effective treatment for their HIV will be randomized to receive either the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib or a placebo for 10 weeks. Participants will complete lab tests, medical and psychiatric assessments, neurocognitive testing, functional MRI (fMRI) scans, and optional spinal taps as part of the study. The total length of participation is about 5 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Risk of depression is substantially higher in people with HIV (PWH) than the general population, and depression in PWH confers worse outcomes regarding treatment adherence, morbidity and mortality. Increased inflammation is one biological pathway that is linked to greater risk for depression in PWH and limits options for effective antidepressant therapy. Chronically elevated inflammation is associated with impairments within reward and motor neural circuits that contribute to symptoms of anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure) and psychomotor slowing, which are overrepresented in PWH. The purpose of this 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to provide mechanistic information on whether inflammation impacts corticostriatal reward and motor circuitry to contribute to anhedonia and psychomotor slowing in PWH with depression using the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib.\n\nThis study will utilize an FDA-approved medication, baricitinib, to establish whether the effects of inflammation on reward and motor circuits are a mechanism of anhedonia and motor slowing in PWH with depression, while advancing avenues for new therapies.\n\nSixty male and female patients with HIV who have depression and high inflammation and are stable on effective treatment for their HIV will be randomized to receive either baricitinib or a placebo for 10 weeks. Participants will complete lab tests, medical and psychiatric assessments, neurocognitive testing, functional MRI (fMRI) scans, and optional spinal taps as part of the study. The total length of participation is about 3.5 months."
