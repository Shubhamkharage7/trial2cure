We anticipate the anti-inflammatory diet, when compared with the usual diet, to produce favorable changes in these multi-omics profiles. These findings will provide insight into the interactions between diet and host biology, while providing clues on the mechanisms of diet therapy's effect and CD pathogenesis.",
            "detailedDescription": "A randomized controlled trial of the anti-inflammatory whole food diet versus usual diet for the induction of remission in 104 adults with mild-to-moderate Crohn's Disease (CD). The anti-inflammatory whole food diet will be compared to participants usual diet for understanding its effects on achieving clinical remission, clinical response, reduction in serological and fecal markers of inflammation, and improvement in patient-reported outcomes, such as physical activity, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, social satisfaction, and quality of life. The study will involve collection of blood and fecal specimens to evaluate the effects of the anti-inflammatory diet on the gut microbiome, bacterial metabolome, innate immune markers, and fecal microRNA profiles. The participants will be placed on anti-inflammatory diet for 8 weeks and assessed every 2 weeks for adherence."
