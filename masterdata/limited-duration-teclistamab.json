            "briefSummary": "This is a single-arm, non-inferiority study in which patients who have achieved a very good partial response (VGPR) or better, according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria, following 6 to 9 months of treatment with teclistamab, a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed T-cell engager (anti-BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody), will be offered monitored drug discontinuation. Teclistamab is typically dosed on a regular schedule (every 1-4 weeks) indefinitely until disease progression (\"continuous therapy\"). Here, a limited-duration regimen will be studied in which patients achieving \u2265VGPR after 6-9 months of standard teclistamab dosing will discontinue therapy and resume if laboratory or clinical parameters suggest early disease progression (\"limited-duration therapy\"). Patients will enter the clinical trial protocol after completing 6-9 months of standard teclistamab monotherapy and achieving \u2265VGPR. The study's hypothesis is that the failure probability six months after stopping teclistamab in this patient population will be non-inferior compared to that of historical controls treated with continuous therapy. Reducing drug exposure may be beneficial by reducing risk of infection and reducing anti-BCMA selective pressure toward generation of BCMA-negative relapses. Analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD), tumor features, and bone marrow microenvironment parameters, which will be pursued as exploratory correlative analyses in this study, may identify factors that predict durable response to limited-duration therapy and thereby enable more precise selection of patients likely to benefit from this approach. A subset of patients will be enrolled on a biomarker study for analysis of these exploratory endpoints."
