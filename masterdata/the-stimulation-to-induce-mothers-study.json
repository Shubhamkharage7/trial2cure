            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose a parallel group randomized clinical trial of intrapartum nipple stimulation versus exogenous oxytocin infusion for nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor near term. The central hypothesis is that intrapartum nipple stimulation to induce labor increases spontaneous vaginal delivery, improves patient-centered outcomes such as childbirth satisfaction, labor agentry, and pain scores, and reduces adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes in nulliparous women. The investigators will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess the effectiveness of intrapartum nipple stimulation on the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery in nulliparous women, 2) Breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition at time of maternal hospital discharge (Primary Aims); 3) Maximal percent newborn weight loss during the birth hospitalization within 72 hours of life, 4) Determine the effect of intrapartum nipple stimulation on the rate of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, 5) Determine the impact of intrapartum nipple stimulation on patient-centered outcomes and 6) In a sub-cohort of women who are enrolled in the trial, investigators will measure the change in oxytocin concentration from baseline to time at which patient achieves a regular contraction pattern.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objectives\n\n1. To determine whether intrapartum nipple stimulation therapy with or without synthetic oxytocin changes the likelihood of achieving a spontaneous vaginal delivery compared to receipt of synthetic oxytocin infusion without nipple stimulation to induce labor.\n2. Breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition at time of maternal hospital discharge\n\nSecondary Objectives (if applicable)\n\nThe secondary objectives are as follows:\n\n1. Determine whether intrapartum nipple stimulation therapy with or without synthetic oxytocin changes the likelihood of achieving a spontaneous vaginal delivery compared to receipt of synthetic oxytocin infusion without nipple stimulation to induce labor.\n2. Determine if women who perform intrapartum nipple stimulation to induce labor have differences in other obstetric and maternal outcomes\n3. Determine if women who perform intrapartum nipple stimulation report differences in pain scores during labor, labor agentry and satisfaction scores, postpartum depression scores, and breastfeeding success compared to women who receive only intrapartum exogenous oxytocin infusion.\n4. Determine if women who perform intrapartum nipple stimulation to induce labor have similar fetal and neonatal outcomes compared to women who receive only intrapartum exogenous oxytocin infusion.\n5. Maximal percent newborn weight loss during the birth hospitalization within 72 hours of life\n6. At Yale, to measure the change in oxytocin concentration from baseline over the course of labor induction in patients undergoing induction of labor via intrapartum nipple stimulation versus continuous exogenous oxytocin infusion.\n7. At Yale, to measure circulating plasma and urine concentrations of proteins, microRNA, and small molecules using unbiased \"omics\" approaches, comparing patients undergoing induction of labor via intrapartum nipple stimulation versus continuous exogenous oxytocin infusion, un-ripened/unlabored control patients, and patients in spontaneous labor."
