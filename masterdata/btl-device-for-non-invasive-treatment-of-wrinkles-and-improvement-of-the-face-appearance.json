The subjects will be required to complete four (4) treatment visits and two follow-up visits.\n\nAt the baseline visit health status will be assessed and, if needed, additional tests will be performed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified and informed consent will be signed.\n\nThe treatment administration phase consists of four (4) treatment visits, delivered 5-10 days apart.\n\nSafety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) including the subject's experience of pain or discomfort after the procedure. Occurence of AE's will be checked immediately after the first treatment visit, prior/post to the every other procedure and at the follow-ups."
