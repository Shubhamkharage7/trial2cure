The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Do at least 50% of participants assigned to the affect-based exercise prescription engage in \u226590 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity by the end of 12-weeks follow-up?\n2. What level of satisfaction do breast cancer survivors who receive the affect-based exercise prescription report relative to breast cancer survivors who receive an effort-based exercise prescription.\n3. What proportion of participants assigned to the affect-based exercise prescription stay enrolled in the study relative to the number of participants who stay enrolled in the effort-based exercise prescription.\n\nAll participants will:\n\n* Be assigned to either the Affect-based exercise prescription or the Effort-based exercise prescription.\n* Participate in two meetings with a member of the study team meant to help them get started increasing weekly exercise. These meetings are the same for all participants.\n* Be asked to wear an activity monitor and respond to brief surveys for 10 straight days at 4 points in time: Baseline, 2weeks, 6weeks, and 12weeks."
