The intervention, called Nurturing Healthy Teachers, combines strategies from two evidence-based programs - Create Healthy Futures (CHF) and Brighter Bites (BB).",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the impact of the Nurturing Healthy Teachers program on food insecurity, dietary behaviors, mental health, and cardiometabolic health among early care and education (ECE) professionals who teach Pre-Kindergarten or Kindergarten. Nurturing Healthy Teachers is a novel, comprehensive program that combines strategies from two evidence-based programs - Brighter Bites (implemented by Brighter Bites 501c3 non-profit) and Create Healthy Futures (implemented by Penn State Better Kid Care).\n\n1. Brighter Bites (BB) is a 501c3 non-profit organization that implements an evidence-based coordinated school health program that combines access to fresh produce and nutrition education proven to improve dietary intake among preschool and elementary school teachers, low-income children, and their families. For 16 weeks in the school year, Brighter Bites teachers and families receive a weekly distribution of about 20 lbs (50 servings) of primarily donated fresh vegetables, plus weekly healthy recipe tastings, and nutrition education. The program has proven effectiveness at engaging teachers, parents, increasing healthy dietary behaviors and improving the school and home nutrition environment of low-income elementary school children in the short-term.\n2. Developed and implemented by Penn State Extension Better Kid Care (BKC), Create Healthy Futures (CHF) is a web-based nutrition education program that targets nutrition knowledge, self-efficacy, mindfulness, and social support to create healthy habits among teachers. CHF also includes facilitated group meetings to reinforce information from the online modules.\n\nThe trial will be conducted in 30 elementary schools that have pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten classes that serve predominantly low-income families in Houston. Schools in the intervention arm (n=15) will receive Brighter Bites plus the complete Create Healthy Futures program including online modules and in-person meetings, and they will be drawn from schools that are already scheduled to receive Brighter Bites during the 2022-2023 school year. Schools in the control arm (n=15) will only receive passive access to the online modules of the Create Healthy Futures program, and they will be drawn from remaining schools across the district, as long as they have not participated in Brighter Bites in the previous two years. The intervention and control programs will be implemented over one school year (9months). Brighter Bites non-profit organization and Penn State Better Kid Care will implement the Nurturing Healthy Teachers program, while UTHealth School of Public Health investigators will conduct the evaluation of the program."
