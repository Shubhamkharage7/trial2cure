The investigators propose examining the feasibility and acceptability of the 12-week RN-CHeFRx (Real Nourishment and Cooking Healthy Food is Rx) intervention\n\n- grocery delivery, cooking classes, and nutrition education - for Black women with hypertension and obesity to improve nutritious eating habits and blood pressure control.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to conduct the RN-CHeFRx (Real Nourishment and Cooking Healthy Food is Rx) for 12 weeks among Black women who are obese and hypertensive living Chicago. We propose to 1) Pilot the RN-CHEFRx intervention and measures that will be used to assess blood pressure, BMI status, and sodium intake with 20 Black women diagnosed with hypertension and BMI \u2265 30. We will assess the efficacy of the evaluation tools to be used in a future clinical trial at three-time points (baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months); and 2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the RN-CHeFRx intervention using interviews, surveys, and documentary analysis. Findings from this study will inform a larger efficacy trial of RN-CHeFRx to improve dietary behaviors and blood pressure control among Black women with hypertension and obesity"
