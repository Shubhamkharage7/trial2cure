            "briefSummary": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic respiratory diseases in the Veteran population. OSA co-occurring with COPD, known as Overlap Syndrome (OVS), is a complex chronic medical condition associated with grave consequences. OVS is highly prevalent in Veterans. Veterans with OVS may be at increased risk for cognitive deficits, poor sleep quality as well as a reduced quality of life (QoL). The overall objective is to study the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with OVS.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are no studies regarding the impact of PAP therapy on sleep disturbance, cognitive function and quality of life in patients with OVS. The investigators' rationale is that in patients with moderate-severe OVS, PAP therapy will effectively alleviate sleepiness, sleep disturbances and cognitive deficits, and, thereby, improve QoL. 'PAP' includes either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nObjectives:\n\nSpecifically, the investigators will study the effectiveness of PAP therapy vs. conservative care in reducing daytime sleepiness and in improving sleep quality and QoL in older Veterans with OVS.\n\nThe investigators will also explore whether CPAP is non-inferior to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in reducing daytime sleepiness, sleep disturbances and neurocognitive dysfunction, and in improving QoL in older Veterans with OVS."
