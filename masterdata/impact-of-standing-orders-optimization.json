The recruitment goal for the trial is 34 clinics in healthcare systems, including 9 rural-serving clinics. The researchers will randomize clinics using simple randomization (1:1). Some clinics will receive a communication training. Other clinics will receive a communication training and tools for optimizing the use of their standing orders. The researchers will use medical record data to compare changes in HPV vaccination among children ages 9-12. Clinics will be followed for 24 months. The researchers will also use survey data to compare HPV vaccine communication and implementation of standing orders among clinical staff. The study will engage clinical staff. Researchers will not have direct contact with children or their families."
