In this 5-year RCMI project, the investigators propose 3 aims. Aim 1) Engage a stakeholder committee of patients, providers, and experts (COPE) to adapt a TVIC intervention for Black women and their healthcare providers at Meharry. \\[Years 1-2\\]. Aim 2) Implement and prospectively evaluate the adapted TVIC intervention at the healthcare provider-level, measuring changes in Meharry healthcare provider's self-efficacy for TVIC implementation and alignment with TIC knowledge, attitudes, and practices. \\[Years 2-3\\] Aim 3) Implement the adapted TVIC intervention at the patient-level to provide trauma-informed IPV screening, brief interventions, and referrals to treatment (SBIRT), and rigorously evaluate this TVIC intervention's impact on the primary outcome of patient-perceived usefulness of intervention and reported linkage to IPV services, and the secondary outcome of changes at the clinic-level relative to climate and culture, through a non-randomized pragmatic trial design. \\[Year 4-5\\]."
