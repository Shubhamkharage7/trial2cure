We also hope to further our understanding of family stress and expand the idea for a need of mental health services in pediatric oncology. We aim to further understand intervention strategies for domains of family stress, reducing levels of caregiver anxiety, and promoting resilience for caregivers. This is important because these symptoms can affect the quality of life of caregivers and affect their ability to adhere to their children's treatments."
