To address the epidemic of Veteran suicide in the United States, this study tests the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a five day transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) augmented executive functioning training intervention. This intervention is delivered to high suicide risk inpatients. The ultimate goal is to reduce future suicide events (ideation, attempts, deaths) and improve quality of life (e.g. social relationships, health resource utilization)."

Training/tDCS sessions will occur twice a day for five days, for a total of 10 sessions. tDCS (2mA current), with anode over left prefrontal cortex and cathode over right prefrontal cortex, will be applied concurrently with cognitive training. Training/tDCS sessions last approx. 45 min, with tDCS applied during the first 20 min of training.",
