This study will investigate if eating almonds everyday for 12 weeks can affect gut health and inflammation in persons with metabolic syndrome. Investigators will measure changes in metabolism, heart health, and the levels of vitamins and other compounds from almonds.",
            "detailedDescription": "Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) affects over a billion people world-wide. MetS progression and further health complications are driven by chronic inflammation. Major causes of inflammation in MetS are gut barrier breakdown and the absorption of harmful bacteria. What causes the gut barrier breakdown is not clear, but a poor diet, especially low micronutrient intakes like vitamin E, is implicated by propagating a vicious cycle that promotes oxidative stress, inflammation and further gut barrier damage. This study will assess the impact of daily consumption of 2 ounces of almonds for 12 weeks on gut health, markers of inflammation and cardiometabolic health, and micronutrient status in persons with MetS."
