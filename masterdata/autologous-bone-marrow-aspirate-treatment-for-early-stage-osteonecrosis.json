            "briefSummary": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a debilitating musculoskeletal disease that is characterized by localized death of bone cells and associated cellular elements within the subchondral bone. If it progresses, it results in the collapse of the femoral head (ball part of the hip) giving rise to secondary arthritis. This condition is associated with marked pain and loss of function, often necessitating a joint replacement. Due to the relatively young age of onset of ONFH (often in 20s and 30s), there is great interest in utilizing joint-preserving procedures prior to the need for joint replacement. Joint-preserving procedures include core decompression (CD) with and without bone grafts or cells, vascularized and non-vascularized bone grafting, as well as osteotomies. Inconsistent results for each of these procedures have been reported and there are no Clinical Practice Guidelines or medical community consensus opinions regarding the treatment of early-stage ONFH. The hypothesis to be tested is \"Participants who have early-stage ONFH undergoing CD augmented with autogenous bone marrow aspirate concentrate will have better clinical and radiological outcomes than CD alone.\" This multi-center randomized controlled trial for early-stage ONFH is prospective and controlled for participant stage (only early-stage pre-collapse individuals) and surgical technique. Participants will be evaluated as per routine surgical follow-up, and at 6 months (telemedicine), 1- and 2- years using radiographs, MRIs, and questionnaires. This project will also explore the scientific basis for success vs. failure in individuals who have osteonecrosis, and have different demographics and bone marrow aspirate cell profiles.",
            "detailedDescription": "Rationale. It is estimated that there are 10,000 to 20,000 new cases of osteonecrosis of the femoral head diagnosed each year in the United States. Several approaches to treatment have been undertaken including nonsurgical (e.g., pharmaceuticals, hyperbaric oxygen) and surgical (e.g., core decompression, bone grafting (both non-vascularized and vascularized), osteotomies, total joint replacement). Total joint replacement is performed to treat end-stage disease (when the joint goes \"out-of-round\", and cartilage damage has occurred). There has been increasing interest in using cell-based treatment with core decompression (CD) to treat early-stage osteonecrosis. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injected into the CD is being evaluated in this study as it contains progenitor cells and other elements that have been shown to facilitate the development of bone and blood vessels. There is a need for rigorous, randomized controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of this cell-based treatment for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).\n\nObjectives. The goal of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological results of core decompression with autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrate to core decompression alone (CD). The results will be based on: 1) evidence of radiological progression of ONFH, 2) time to radiological progression of ONFH to ARCO Stage III or IV, Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARC)), the international society for the study of osteonecrosis and other disorders of bone circulation\\] or 3) pain requiring surgical intervention. Success will be based on survivorship of the femoral head over the course of the study. Failure of the procedure is based upon evidence of radiographic progression to ARCO Stage III or pain requiring a surgical intervention.\n\nOverall Design. This is a prospective, multi-center, interventional clinical trial being conducted to evaluate two treatments for early stage ONFH. Participants will be 1:1 randomized to one of two arms: 1) BMAC: Core decompression augmented with autogenous bone marrow aspirate concentrate; 2) CD: Core decompression alone. The core decompression and bone marrow aspiration and concentration will be performed according to a standardized protocol. The CD group will also undergo a sham procedure consisting of a small incision and placing the needle up to the iliac bone without marrow aspiration. In the BMAC group, a sample of the bone marrow aspirate concentrate will be submitted for laboratory assessments to identify the constituent cells and major biological pathways involved. Clinical Research Forms (pre-operatively; 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-operatively), radiographs, and MRIs (pre-operatively; 12- and 24-months post-operatively) will be performed."
