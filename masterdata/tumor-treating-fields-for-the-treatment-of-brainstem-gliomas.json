Optune is a wearable, portable, treatment that creates low-intensity, wave-like electric fields called tumor treating fields (TTFields), which interfere with cancer cell division. TTFields may prevent growth or decrease size of gliomas in patients",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tumor treating fields in combination with standard of care radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with brainstem gliomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tumor treating fields by assessing progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate, and overall survival (OS).\n\nTERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the effects of the tumor treating fields on neurocognitive function.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nBeginning after start of standard of care radiation therapy, patients wear the Optune device for at least 18 hours per day for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nDuring study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. After study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months."
