            "briefSummary": "The goal of the current pilot clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pirfenidone in patients with predicted moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis. Pirfenidone is currently approved by FDA for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Now, over 5 years of data has accumulated demonstrating safety of its use in humans. The investigators' preclinical data suggest that pirfenidone is very effective in reducing the severity of acute pancreatitis in animal models. Following are the objectives of the proposed clinical trial:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pirfenidone, compared to placebo, in patients predicted to have moderately severe or severe AP.\n* To evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone in reducing the laboratory markers of inflammation and improving patient reported outcome measures.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\n- To evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone in reducing the severity of acute pancreatitis, as measured by well-defined endpoints.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a Randomized Pilot clinical trial evaluating safety and tolerability of pirfenidone in patients with predicted moderately severe to severe acute pancreatitis. There are built in secondary end-points for efficacy. The patients with acute pancreatitis, who present within 48h of establishment of the diagnosis, will be screened for exclusion and inclusion criteria and consented for the clinical trial. Patients with be randomized into placebo or pirfenidone arm and followed daily in-person, while in hospital, and by telephone once discharged from the hospital (weekly for 4 weeks, then monthly for up to 6 months) for study end points."
