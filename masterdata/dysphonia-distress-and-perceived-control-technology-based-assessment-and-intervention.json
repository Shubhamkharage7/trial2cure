            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to pilot test a version of the intervention that has been tailored for participants with dysphonia. The study seeks to determine if the adapted intervention: a) increases perceived control over voice-related stressors and b) decreases stress and distress resulting from voice problems. The study will also explore the usability and acceptability of the program. The goal is to help people with voice problems achieve better voice and quality of life outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "In the investigator's voice clinic, a high prevalence of severe distress has been identified. Distress and voice handicap were positively correlated, and perceived control moderated the relationship. Perceived control is associated with less distress in a variety of medical conditions, has an impact beyond that of coping and personality, and can be increased via targeted intervention.\n\nThis is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Both groups involve completing surveys and receiving information online about voice problem.\n\nParticipants complete an initial baseline assessment focused on voice function and emotions, including items from the Perceived Control Scale, Voice Handicap Index-10, Perceived Stress Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory-18. Finally, the participants will complete some brief feedback questions about the material.\n\nNext, twice a week for up to three weeks participants will complete check-ins from the online program. Participants in the intervention arm will complete self-guided exercises and brief assessment questions. Participants in the information-only arm will complete mini knowledge quizzes.\n\nAll participants will complete brief a post-intervention assessment parallel to the baseline assessment. Lastly, they will have an opportunity to provide final feedback on their experience.\n\nFollow-up with each participant will occur one and three months after finishing the program. Questionnaires will be sent via email including Voice Handicap Index-10, Present Perceived Control-8, and questions regarding treatment adherence and voice outcomes."
