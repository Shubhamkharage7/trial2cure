This study aims to learn how women consider whether or not to try to have a baby after surviving cancer. The advice gathered from this survey may be shared with patients and survivors in the future, so that they have information to inform their decisions about cancer treatment and family planning.",

To administer the tailored survey and evaluate if utilization of infertility clinics and treatments is associated with pregnancies leading to live births after gynecological or breast cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate whether potential covariates are associated with utilization of infertility clinics and live births after gynecological and breast cancers (e.g. socio-demographic, clinical, psychological, lifestyle, and decision-making characteristics).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nFOCUS GROUP: Patients attend an audiotaped focus group over 90 minutes to provide feedback for survey development.\n\nSURVEY VALIDATION: Patients complete an online survey over 15-30 minutes at baseline and 2 days later.\n\nTELEPHONE SURVEY: Patients complete a telephone survey."
