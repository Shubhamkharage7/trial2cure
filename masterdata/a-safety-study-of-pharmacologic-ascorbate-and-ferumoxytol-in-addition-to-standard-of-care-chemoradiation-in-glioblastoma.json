This is done through short surveys as well as discussing with the study team."

Pharmacologic ascorbic acid may affect urine acidification and, as a result, may affect clearance rates of these drugs.\n* Current use of antiretroviral drugs (e.g., nelfinavir, abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, zidovudine). Pharmacologic ascorbate acid is a known CYP450 3A4 inducer, which results in lower serum levels of antiretroviral drugs.\n* Insulin requirement\n* Requires blood glucose monitoring using finger-stick glucose checks.\n* Medical requirement or indication for iron supplementation (including ferumoxytol, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous sulfate). NOTE: Over the counter, patient-elective supplementation is acceptable.\n* Inability to undergo MR imaging.\n* Pregnancy or lactation (note: potential participants should not engage in 'pump \\& dump' strategy; lactation must be discontinued).\n* Known allergic reactions to ferumoxytol.\n* History of Steven's Johnson Syndrome\n* History of hemochromatosis.\n* Prior radiation treatment that would result in field overlap. For potential participants who have undergone nuclear medicine therapy, including PRRT, the study's radiation oncologist must approve study entry.\n* G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency\n* Platelet count \\< 100,000 /mm3 within 21 days of first treatment\n* Creatinine \u2265 1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal within 21 days of the first treatment or if creatinine is elevated a creatinine clearance of \\< 60 mL/(min 1.73 m2)\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (requiring inpatient admission or a delay to start of therapy), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Treatment with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to study treatment day 1. Imaging trials (including investigational PET or NM tracers) as well as observational trials are acceptable.\n* Clinical trials with an endpoint of treating the patient's cancer, including behavioral, nutritional and/or device human subject studies.",
