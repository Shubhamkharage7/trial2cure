The target population for this study will be 25 adult participants scheduled for an IUD insertion at a UW Family Medicine residency clinic. Participants will be followed for 1 appointment visit.",

The descriptive data from this study will be used to offer guidance for how to implement a larger scale study in the future.\n\nPrimary endpoint: Assess preliminary differences in pain and anxiety scores pre-IUD insertion and post-IUD insertion using a Mann-Whitney U test. Participants will score their anxiety and pain levels pre-procedure and post-procedure using a 10cm visual analogue scale. This will be a one arm trial where all subjects will receive 1mg lorazepam and 800mg ibuprofen prior to the procedure.\n\nSecondary endpoints\n\n* Discuss if there was a difference in pain and anxiety scores among nulliparous (no previous childbirths) and multiparous (one or more previous childbirths) participants.\n* Summarize recruitment rates, adherence to lorazepam prescription, completion rates of questionnaires and scales\n* Discuss participant's experiences with taking lorazepam and participating in the study\n* Assess investigator's experience with the trial via a focus group"
