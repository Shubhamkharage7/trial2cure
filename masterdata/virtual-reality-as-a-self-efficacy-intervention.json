            "briefSummary": "The goal is to explore the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as an intervention to increase self-efficacy in a healthcare setting. The investigators would like to determine if an educational VR intervention in the course of healthcare could increase pediatric patient self-efficacy compared to standard of care (i.e no VR).",
            "detailedDescription": "While virtual reality has gained momentum as a therapeutic supplement to distract from pain perception and to reduce anxiety, it has received less attention as an intervention to promote more holistic psychological self-efficacy in the course of in-patient care. Child and adolescent self-reported measures of self-efficacy have also been looked over in favor of parent or practitioner measures of a child's self-efficacy.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality on child and adolescent self-efficacy while undergoing hospital care, the investigators will determine the effect of virtual reality to 1) increase pediatric patient self-efficacy compared to standard of care using educational virtual reality, 2) establish a comprehensive profile of short-term psychological well-being in school-aged children and adolescents following admission to a hospital. Participants will serve as their own control to either receive intervention on the first day or second day of the in-patient care and no intervention will be given on the other day."
