            "briefSummary": "In this protocol, the investigators propose to evaluate the biochemical effects of imatinib on sickle red blood cells (RBCs). Patients will be administered imatinib mesylate orally following the guidelines previously established for use of imatinib in other disorders. The biochemical effects of imatinib on sickle RBCs will be examined, including changes in their levels of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and the abundances of RBC-derived microparticles in their blood. In addition, the patients will be monitored for symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD). The investigators expect band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation to decrease dramatically in patients treated with imatinib. The investigators also anticipate a reduction in the numbers of RBC-derived microparticles in circulation (quantitated by assaying the number of glycophorin A positive microparticles in peripheral blood samples by flow cytometry. Most importantly, the investigators expect to see a reduction in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, and possibly acute chest syndrome and utilization of opioids. The study duration is planned as 6 months in order to provide adequate time for potential change in the primary endpoints (e.g. percent irreversibly sickled cells)."
