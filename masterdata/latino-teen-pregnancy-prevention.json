            "briefSummary": "The study will utilize an exploratory study design, applying formative research methods to inform the development and pilot testing of an unintended teen pregnancy prevention intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study uses questionnaires and interviews with youth and community members, to co-develop and pilot test an unintended teen pregnancy prevention intervention in an emerging immigrant Latino rural community, aiming to decrease reproductive health disparities in marginalized communities across the country. To achieve this objective, the team will conduct interviews and co-development sessions, to ensure input from key stakeholders in the community, when developing an intervention.\n\nDelineation of Activities:\n\nResearch Activities\n\n\u2022 Aim 1: Through stakeholder-engaged research, the team will identify key factors (at multiple levels of influence as defined by NIMHD) needed for the co-development of an acceptable and effective teen pregnancy prevention intervention for rural Latino teens: The team will conduct up to 60 key informant interviews to identify barriers to and facilitators of teen pregnancy prevention programming, such as cultural and social norms. Participants will complete a survey to collect demographic data before participating in the interview. Interviews will last 45 to 60 minutes, in either Spanish or English depending on participants' preference, and will be done using video conference tools at the interviewee's location and times of preference to accommodate participants' schedules.\n\n\u2022 Aim 2: Using the transcreation framework, co-develop with community partners a teen pregnancy prevention intervention that best fits the community's unique needs and context: Up to 50 key stakeholders will participate in approximately 8 co-development hybrid sessions to discuss, draft, and redraft each module of the Cuidate intervention syllabus, interactive course materials, and activities. The goal of the workgroup is to discuss recommendations and unique needs of local Latino teens (Specific Aim 1) and modify Cuidate in response to local insights. These sessions will be facilitated by the study research team in either Spanish or English depending on the participants' preference. The sessions will be done using a hybrid method that could include in-person interactions and/or video conference tools at the interviewee's location and times of preference to accommodate participants' schedules. Virtual co-development sessions will be conducted via Microsoft Teams. University of Kansas (KU) will utilize Zoom as an alternative option for virtual meetings. In that instance, KU will initiate the Zoom call. In-person, interviews may be conducted at a local church, and/or at a location managed by a Juntos Community Health Specialists.\n\n\u2022 Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a co-created teen pregnancy prevention intervention in target Latino rural communities: The co-developed intervention will be delivered in a workshop format by facilitators, over two consecutive days for 3.5 hours each day. Feedback on delivery mode (virtual, in-person, or hybrid) will be elicited during the co-development sessions. If in-person/hybrid is suggested, information will be collected about preferred location (e.g., a local community center, sports club, etc.). Five groups of 10 participants each, stratified by gender and age (14-15 years old and 16-18 years old; females and males) will complete sessions, in either Spanish or English depending on participants' preference, using video conference tools. After the delivery of the intervention, facilitators will take field notes and complete a debriefing questionnaire to assess practicality and fidelity. Teens will complete a 15-minute survey pre-intervention, immediately after the 2-day intervention, and three-month post-intervention (computer-assisted, self-administered, online via Research Electronic Data Capture - REDCap). Surveys will assess acceptability and risk behaviors. As in the published Cuidate trials, previously used measures will be used to document validity and comparability. Surveys will be de-identified; participants will create a code to match surveys without using identifying data.\n\nThose currently enrolled are only from non-trial aims in this module."
