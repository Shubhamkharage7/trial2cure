The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of sacituzumab tirumotecan versus treatment of physician's choice as second-line treatment for participants with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in the Phase 3 portion.\n\nThe primary study hypotheses are that, in the Phase 3 portion, sacituzumab tirumotecan results in a superior overall survival compared to TPC in participants with high trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) expression level and in all participants."
