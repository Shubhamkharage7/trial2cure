            "briefSummary": "To establish the relationship in the five critical X-ray time points during multilevel posterior column osteotomies (MPCO) spinal deformity realignment in patients with adult spinal deformity and to follow the participants longitudinally to examine any follow-up X-rays and clinical data to compare to the post-operative standing scan and pre-operative data.",
            "detailedDescription": "Studies in adult spinal deformity (ASD) have found that the presence of sagittal imbalance directly correlates with worsening quality of life. Multilevel posterior column osteotomies (MPCOs) is a technique that can provide correction to adult spinal deformity. MPCOs can be utilized for revision surgery as an alternative to 3-column osteotomies and have the ability to aggregate large amount of lordosis segmentally. The success of the MPCO technique largely depends on radiographs taken during these surgeries to aid the surgeon in establishing the best screw and rod placement and making intraoperative adjustments. Imaging plays a vital role in evaluating hardware positioning and assessing hardware integrity as well as evaluating potential complication. The investigator plans to evaluate and establish the relationship in the five critical X-ray time points (preoperative standing and supine, intraoperative pre- and post-correction, and postoperative standing films) during MPCO spinal deformity realignment and measure pre- to post-operative outcome longitudinally. The investigator will investigate lumbar lordosis and sagittal and coronal alignment at those 5 time points and examine the relationship between pre-op, intra-op, and post-op images to understand impact of the MPCO technique and examine expected outcome to final outcome. Additionally, if the O-Arm 2D long film scanner is utilized during the surgery, the investigator will analyze that film and compare it to the other X-rays taken."
