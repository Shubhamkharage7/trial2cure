            "detailedDescription": "Combining fasting with chemotherapy is known to cause complete tumor regression and long-term survival in animal models. According to the Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS) theory, acute fasting sensitizes tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation, while protecting healthy cells by increasing stress resistance. These effects are believed to be largely mediated via the Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) pathway. However, extended fasting can be challenging for patients and poses undue health risks. A number of alternative intermittent fasting regimens have been proposed to overcome the challenges of prolonged caloric restriction. One promising approach is time-restricted eating (TRE), which involves eating within a period of 10 hours or less, followed by fasting for at least 14 hours daily. TRE does not involve extended caloric restriction, and because of its simplicity, it may be more sustainable than other fasting regimens. TRE improves several cardiometabolic endpoints independent of calorie restriction in both animals and humans, including insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, fat oxidation, and hunger. Our team's pilot and feasibility trials suggest that TRE may also have anti-cancer effects: it decreases IGF-1 levels, reduces oxidative stress, upregulates antioxidant defenses, and enhances autophagy. Moreover, our data suggest TRE is sustainable, as participants were adherent 6.0 plus or minus 0.8 days/week over a 14-week period. These findings lead to the following provocative question: Can TRE reduce treatment-related toxicity, induce tumor regression, and improve both patient-reported and clinical outcomes? We propose to conduct the largest randomized controlled trial of any form of intermittent fasting in patients undergoing cancer treatment. We focus on patients with localized rectal or breast cancer because it is one of the few treatment paradigms in which tumor characteristics can be measured before and after chemoradiation therapy."
