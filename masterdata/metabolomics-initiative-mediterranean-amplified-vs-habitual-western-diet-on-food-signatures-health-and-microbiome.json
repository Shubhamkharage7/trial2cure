            "briefSummary": "This study plans to learn more about how consuming a diet with foods typical to a Mediterranean Diet such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables in a Western-style diet compares to eating a typical Western-style diet. This study will look at how diet affects overall health including risk factors for heart disease, gut health and inflammation as well as underlying mechanisms linking whole food to health. Findings from this study will potentially inform effective dietary recommendations and interventions, thereby reducing chronic disease in humans.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose to conduct a 16-week randomized, cross-over, semi-controlled feeding study of two isocaloric dietary interventions: 1. Mediterranean-amplified habitual/Western (mini-MED) diet, containing 500 kcal/day from Mediterranean target foods (such as raspberries, avocado, red bell pepper, basil, walnuts, chickpeas, oats, salmon); and 2. Habitual/Western (Western) diet, containing 500 kcal/day from non-Mediterranean target foods (such as potato, beef, sour cream, refined grain bread, chocolate dessert); among individuals who are not already consuming a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern. Participants will have overweight or obesity and meet criteria for Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), and therefore be at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease (CMD).\n\nThe primary goal is to validate results from metabolomics analyses of foods and biospecimens from a completed Mediterranean-style dietary intervention in a prospective feeding trial. Secondary aims are to evaluate impacts of incremental changes in diet on cardiometabolic health and microbiome structure/function. The primary hypothesis is that pre-defined metabolomics signatures in participant biospecimens will be responsive to dietary intakes and reproducible within individuals over time. The secondary hypotheses are that a Mediterranean-amplified diet will lead to improvements in cardiometabolic health and changes in microbiome structure/function over time and compared to a habitual Western diet.\n\nAim 1: Test reproducibility of pre-defined signatures from Mediterranean target foods provided in mini-MED in biospecimens (blood/urine) within individuals over time. Participants will complete a 16-week randomized cross-over dietary intervention of mini-MED vs Western diet. The investigators hypothesize that: (1) novel food-specific compounds will increase in participant biospecimens after consumption of mini-MED and decrease during Western diet, and (2) established biomarkers of fruit/vegetable intake (e.g., plasma and skin carotenoids, urine polyphenols) and other target foods (e.g., plasma alkylresorcinols, astaxanthin) will increase after consumption of mini-MED.\n\nAim 2: Determine the impact of mini-MED on cardiometabolic health. Cardiometabolic health indicators (e.g., blood pressure, lipid panel, inflammatory cytokines, indicators of subclinical inflammation) will be assessed pre- and post- each intervention. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of mini-MED will lead to improvements in cardiometabolic health indicators (e.g., reductions in blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, bioactive lipids; increases in HDL cholesterol) over time and compared to Western diet.\n\nAim 3: Evaluate changes in microbiota community structure/function in response to mini-MED. Microbiome structure (taxonomy) and function (metagenomics) will be assessed pre- and post- each intervention. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of mini-MED will lead to increases in microbiome diversity and enrichment in taxa associated with increased production of health-promoting compounds (e.g., short chain fatty acids) over time and compared to Western diet."
