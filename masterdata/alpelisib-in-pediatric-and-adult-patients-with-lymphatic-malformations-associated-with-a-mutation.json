            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II/III multi-center study with two stages:\n\n* Stage 1 is designed to select the dose(s) for the confirmatory phase (DSCP) for alpelisib in Stage 2 and will comprise a 24-week open-label core phase in adult (\u226518 years of age) and pediatric participants (6-17 years of age) with PIK3CA-mutated LyM, followed by an extension. After eligibility has been confirmed at screening, participants will be randomized to the different alpelisib doses according to their age. Depending on the results at the end of Stage 1 core phase, the Stage 2 will be opened to adult and/or pediatric participants or the study may be stopped.\n* Stage 2 is designed to confirm the efficacy and assess safety of alpelisib at the DSCP in participants with PIK3CA-mutated LyM and will comprise a 24-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory phase in adult (\u226518 years of age) and pediatric participants 6-17 years of age followed by an open-label extension. After eligibility has been confirmed at screening participants will be randomized to alpelisib or placebo.\n\nAdditionally, in parallel, Stage 2 will include a 24-week open-label core phase in pediatric participants 2-5 years of age followed by an extension, if pediatric participants will be enrolling in Stage 2.\n\nBased on the results of the 24-week open-label core phase of Stage 1, the dose(s) for Stage 2 will be selected by Novartis in consultation with the Steering Committee (SC). During the 24-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled core phase of Stage 2, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will conduct periodic safety reviews."
