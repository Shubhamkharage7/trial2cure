A 60 minute TES stimulation sequence consisting of a SO frequency stimulation (TES SO) using the NeuroConn DC Stimulator PLUS or a sham stimulation will be administered during the second hour of a two hour nocturnal sleep period. During wake period subjects will be tested using various cognitive, subjective and objective sleepiness and mood measures. Vital signs measurements will be taken to monitor general health issues. Up to 4 subjects will be enrolled per study session. Due to logistical reasons, no more then 2 subjects per session can be assigned to the TES SO group.\n\nScreening visit = approx. 2 hours At-home component = 7 days In-laboratory study period = 138 hours Total in-laboratory period = approx. 138 hours per subject Total participation time (at home + in-laboratory components) = 15 days"

The appropriately licensed study investigator reviewing the laboratory values may opt to repeat any clinically significant tests and include volunteers whose repeat test values are not clinically significant.\n* Positive urine nicotine/cotinine result during screening visit (NicCheck\u2122 I test strip results)\n* Positive urine drug result during screening visit\n* Any use of sleep aids during the 1 year prior to screening\n* Inability to read and sign consent\n* Lack of access to a quiet, dark environment conducive to sleep from 2100 until 0700 during a seven night period at the beginning of the study\n* Participation in any ongoing clinical trials.\n* The preceding exclusionary criteria are known to alter sleep (e.g., epilepsy; some neurological disorders), substantially increase inter-subject variability, and/or the disease or condition puts the subject outside the range of what is considered healthy. The PI also maintains the prerogative to disqualify a volunteer if it is deemed that the volunteer's participation would be unsafe for the volunteer or staff or would be disruptive to study conduct or their inclusion could compromise data integrity.\n* Volunteers meeting the Beck cut-off (a score of at least 14) and who carry health insurance will be instructed to call their health insurance Mental Health / Substance Abuse referral number.\n* Volunteers meeting the first cut-off (score of at least 14 who are not insured will be provided with a community mental health referral contact specific to their county of residence.\n* The review of the medical history with the volunteer and the physical examination itself will be performed by an appropriately licensed study investigator. Results of screening urine and blood tests will be reviewed by an appropriately licensed study investigator. The Post-consent Checklist will be administered by a trained research technician and reviewed by the study principal investigator or an appropriately licensed study investigator. If an appropriately licensed study investigator deems it medically advisable, the investigator will share abnormal results with the volunteer, who will be referred to his/her personal physician for follow-up.\n* A volunteer who has been cleared for participation may participate in a session if the first day of the session is within 90 days of the screening date.
