            "detailedDescription": "Contemporary walk test endpoints in IPF trials may under-represent patient functional gains with antifibrotic therapy, which may be more effectively captured with long-term activity monitoring. Traditional pulmonary rehabilitation centers create a barrier to patient exercise accessibility and compliance, which is eliminated in a mobile health (mHealth) exercise training approach. In this study, 30 patients with IPF will be randomized into one of two arms. The exercise arm will receive a 12-week home exercise intervention using an mHealth platform plus pre- and post-intervention monitoring (4 weeks each). The non-exercise arm will be monitored for the same study duration. The primary end point is change from baseline in daily physical activity as a number of weekly exercise minutes qualifying as moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), METS\\*minutes of exercise per week, and sedentary time minutes. Assessments will be performed primarily via in-person study visits at week 4 and week 16, as well as via daily recordings from mHealth monitoring devices."
