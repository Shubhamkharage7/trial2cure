Patients will be treated until disease progression.\n\nStudy regimen is Abemaciclib with Bicalutamide\n\nPrimary objective is to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase II dose for abemaciclib when administered in combination with bicalutamide and to determine the efficacy of the treatment secondary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability along with progression free survival.\n\nGiven the suggestive pre-clinical data and the unique properties of abemaciclib, the researchers believe that abemaciclib is an ideal partner for bicalutamide in treatment of AR+ metastatic breast cancer. The study team hypothesize that the combination will demonstrate a further improved clinical benefit rate than either agent alone, including in those patients who have already been treated with prior endocrine therapies. Additionally, the study team believe that the convenience of an all-oral, continuous daily dosing schedule and the favorable side effect profile of both therapies with minimal overlapping or serious toxicities further supports this investigation."
