            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this investigation is to field-test a physical function assessment paradigm, designed to inform people of their physical function relative to peers of similar demographic characteristics (e.g., similar age, sex, height, etc.), to promote recommended preventive health behaviors. The physical function assessment paradigm is known as Cafe Move. Our primary research hypothesis is that people will advance along the stages of behavior change (i.e., more likely to participate in recommended preventive healthcare for physical function), after accessing Cafe Move assessments. This study is a single cohort (n=36 participants), double-baseline design, intended primarily to collect pilot data. The results will inform the design of a larger controlled trial.\n\nThis study will examine the safety, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Caf\u00e9 Move. Briefly, we will make Caf\u00e9 Move available to at-risk populations (i.e., independent-living older adults) via the following approach. First, during a 3-month control phase, we will monitor participants' health behaviors and engagement with preventive health offerings via periodic phone surveys. We will then make Caf\u00e9 Move available and subsequently monitor health behaviors and engagement with preventive health offerings. This design will allow us to examine feasibility of the Caf\u00e9 Move intervention, to better understand the reach of the program within and across communities, and to determine variance and covariance for the outcome measures of interest."
