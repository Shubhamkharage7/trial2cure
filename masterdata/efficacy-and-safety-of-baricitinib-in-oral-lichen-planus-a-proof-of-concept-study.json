During visits, participants will be:\n\n* Evaluated for the extent of their disease\n* Asked to fill out a questionnaire about their quality of life\n* Given baricitinib for them to take at home for six months\n* Evaluated for any potential side experienced while on treatment\n* Asked to return 1 month after completing treatment"
