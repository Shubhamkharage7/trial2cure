After randomization on Day 1, study drug will be administered followed by the collection of safety, tolerability, and PK data.\n\nAll dose cohorts will have lumbar punctures (LPs) for PK analysis performed on Day 3 and Day 29. Primary PK and CSF data will be obtained from Day 1 to Day 29. Safety and tolerability will be collected at all visits. The study is an 85-day study with one optional follow up assessment at Day 120."
