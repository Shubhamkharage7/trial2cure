The novel bioactive sleeve (Reparel Leg Sleeve) will be compared to a regular black sleeve with a similar feel/compression. The main hypothesis for this study is that postoperative use of a novel bioactive sleeve after partial arthroscopic meniscectomy/meniscus repair will decrease pain and improve patient reported outcome scores faster and more reliably than the control non-bioactive sleeve. In order to test this hypothesis, approximately 100 patients scheduled for meniscectomy/meniscus repair will be randomized to one of the two arms in order to minimize bias. The following variables will be assessed: patient reported outcomes (VAS, KOOS JR, VR12, and KSS Satisfaction), physical therapy time, motor testing. Each patient will fill out a series of PROMs preoperatively, and post operatively at the 1-week, 2-week, 6-week, 3-month, 6-month, 1 year, and 2-year mark."

The BRMS allows for multi-center, stratified, and single/double blinded RCTs, using permuted blocks. Randomization notifications (respectful of blinding status) are automatically sent to the PI and other authorized personnel.

The indication is that due to its technology, the Reparel sleeve will allow for the ability to reflect energy using a blend of semi-conductors grounded to nanoparticles interwoven between fibers of the sleeve. Thermal energy is then absorbed from the patient thus activating electrons on the nanoparticles and releasing photonic energy directed at tissues within the surrounding area7. This photostimulation is expected to alleviate pain and inflammation while promoting wound healing as well as tissue regeneration.",
