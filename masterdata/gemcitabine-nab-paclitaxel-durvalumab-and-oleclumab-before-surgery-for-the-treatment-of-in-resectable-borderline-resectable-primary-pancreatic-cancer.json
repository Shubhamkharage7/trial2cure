            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effects of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and oleclumab in treating patients with primary pancreatic cancer that may be able to be removed by surgery (resectable/borderline resectable). Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and oleclumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and oleclumab may help control the disease in patients with resectable/borderline resectable primary pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Estimation of major pathological response (MPR) rate (=\\< 5% viable tumor cells).\n\nII. Assess the safety of combining immunotherapy (durvalumab and oleclumab) with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Explore the changes in various immune parameters, including PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in the tumor, during treatment and correlate with efficacy outcomes with the goal of biomarker discovery.\n\nII. Radiographic response rate and CA19-9 response to neoadjuvant therapy. III. Estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in enrolled subjects who undergo surgical resection.\n\nIV. Estimate the frequency of intraoperative and postoperative complications in these patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nV. Impact of adjuvant durvalumab/oleclumab +/- gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel on circulating tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) kinetics.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, oleclumab IV over 1 hour, nab-paclitaxel IV, and gemcitabine IV over 1 hour over 30-40 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-6 cycles. Within 4-8 weeks after completion of last cycle of treatment, patients undergo surgical resection. After surgical resection, patient may receive adjuvant therapy with durvalumab and oleclumab, durvalumab, oleclumab, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel, other chemotherapy, or observation only at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 28 days and then every 3 months for up to 2 years."

Patients positive for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\]) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)\n* Is currently using or previously used immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab. The following medications are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\n  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., computed tomography \\[CT\\] scan premedication)\n* Has received live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note: patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine while receiving IP or during the 30 days after the last dose of IP\n* Is a female and pregnant or breastfeeding; or is a male or female of reproductive potential who is not willing to employ effective birth control from time of screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab and oleclumab monotherapy\n* Has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients\n* Previously received clinical-trial treatment with durvalumab or oleclumab regardless of treatment arm assignment\n* Has laboratory evidence of hypercalcemia (\\>= 11 mg/dL \\[in presence of normal albumin\\]) and/or hyperphosphatemia (\\>= 5.5 mg/dL)\n* Has a history of venous thrombosis within the past 3 months prior to scheduled first dose of study treatment and is not receiving fully dosed anticoagulation; or has symptomatic venous thrombosis and symptoms have not improved\n* Has a prior history of myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or stroke within the past 3 months prior to the scheduled first dose of study treatment\n* Is unsuitable to participate in the study or is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements (per judgment by the investigator)",
