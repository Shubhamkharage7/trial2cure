This study is aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of D-PLEX in prevention of post abdominal surgery incisional infection.\n\nThe study population includes male and female, 18 years old and above at screening, undergoing an elective colorectal surgery involving colon or rectal resection, with or without a stoma formation, that includes at least 1 incision that is \\> 20cm (target incision).\n\nEligible and willing subjects will be randomly allocated into 2 blinded study arms, either to the investigational arm (D-PLEX + SoC) or to the control arm (SoC only) in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will be stratified by type of prophylactic SoC (IV antibiotic only, IV antibiotic with mechanical bowel preparation or IV antibiotic with oral antibiotics combined with mechanical bowel preparation) and by region (US versus Europe + Israel).\n\nD-PLEX will be applied during the surgery at the final stage of incision closure. All patients will be followed up for additional 5 visits over 2 months, for safety and incisional wound assessment. This will include blood tests for hematology and chemistry as well as physician's assessment of the incisional wound."
