            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial assesses the acceptability and efficacy of Empowered, Queer, Quitting, and Living--New Mexico (EQQUAL-NM), a smoking cessation intervention for sexual and gender minority young adults in New Mexico. Smoking prevalence among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults in New Mexico is more than twice as high as non-SGM adults. Helping young adult tobacco users to quit is critical, yet there have been few efforts to develop tailored treatments specifically for this population. EQQUAL-NM is a digital smoking cessation intervention designed specifically for SGM young adult smokers in New Mexico and may help them quit smoking.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nParticipants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Participants receive access to a self-guided, smartphone app-delivered quit smoking program, called EQQUAL-NM (Program A) that helps explore personal values and teaches participants about smoking triggers and skills to help them manage cravings and accept thoughts and feelings related to smoking. Participants receive text message reminders and prompts on study. Some participants also undergo collection of a saliva sample during follow-up.\n\nGROUP II: Participants receive access to a self-guided, smartphone app-delivered quit smoking program, called EQQUAL-NM (Program B) that is based on current clinical practice guidelines for tobacco cessation to help them quit smoking. This program helps with quit advice, tracking progress on quitting smoking, and managing cravings. Participants receive text message reminders and prompts on study. Some participants also undergo collection of a saliva sample during follow-up.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 months."
