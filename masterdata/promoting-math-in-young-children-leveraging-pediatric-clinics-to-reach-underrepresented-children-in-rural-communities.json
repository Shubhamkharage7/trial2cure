The main question it aims to answer is: What is the impact of the text intervention on early math skills in preschool-aged children using the Research-based Early Math Assessment (REMA-Brief)? Two secondary questions of the study are: What is the impact on child literacy using the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening Tool (PALS-PreK) and parent confidence using the Development and Research in Early Math Education (DREME)? Participants will be randomized to receive intervention (the early math text intervention) or control (no texts). Researchers will compare pre-and-post math performance on the REMA-Brief (primary outcome), PALS-PreK (secondary child outcome) and DREME (secondary parent outcome) between the intervention and control group."
