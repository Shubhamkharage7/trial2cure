This data will be used to determine if clinical recommendations can be made for the use of the studied supplements in increasing milk supply.",

All participants will receive a supplement or placebo for consumption throughout the 20-day trial period, and all participants will receive support from a lactation consultant once per week to receive appropriate guidance for increasing milk supply. 24-hour milk output will be recorded on day 1, 10, and 20 using either pre- and post-feeding weights, 24-hour pump output, or a combination of both. Additionally, blood samples will be taken on day 1, 10, and 20 and serum will be isolated for later analysis of serum prolactin levels."
