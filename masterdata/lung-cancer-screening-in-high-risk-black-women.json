However, the majority of Black women at high-risk for lunch cancer are currently ineligible for lung cancer screening.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility, completion of questionnaires, and a LDCT screening test.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last up to 3 months.\n\nIt is expected about 900 people will participate in this study."
