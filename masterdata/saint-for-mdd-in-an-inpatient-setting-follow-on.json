            "briefSummary": "Randomized, multi-site, sham-controlled, double-blinded study",
            "detailedDescription": "This multi-site, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled mechanistic trial aims to test the effects of Magnus Neuromodulation System (MNS) with Stanford Accelerated Intermittent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT) Technology for the treatment of depression and suicidal cognitions in psychiatrically hospitalized patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and active suicidal ideation (SI). This will be accomplished by applying the MNS with SAINT protocol (10 applications per day to a customized target within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) identified with fMRI for five consecutive days) and measuring changes in depressive symptoms and suicidality at baseline and immediate-post visit.\n\nTh clinical hypothesis is that participants receiving per-protocol active SAINT stimulation will demonstrate a significant difference in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores/remission rates at the immediate post treatment visit, compared to those who receive per protocol sham SAINT stimulation.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of active SAINT vs. sham SAINT in reducing symptoms of depression as measured by the MADRS.\n\nThe study will enroll approximately 100 participants and employ a two-arm design with 50 subjects per arm. The target population is adults of all genders and ethnicities who are between 18 and 75 years of age with a diagnosis of treatment-resistant MDD experiencing a current Major Depressive Episode, with active suicidal ideation, and who are otherwise in good general health. Participants must be without contraindications to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and must be able to attend all study visits.\n\nThis study will deliver both active and sham SAINT via a MagPro X100 edition (MagVenture, Skovlunde, Denmark) TMS device equipped with a Cool-B65 A/P coil. The stimulation paradigm consists of 10 daily sessions (50 total over 5-days) of MNS with SAINT stimulation (3-pulse 50-Hz bursts at 5-Hz for 2-second trains, with trains every 10 seconds), delivered with 50-minute inter-session intervals (10-minute sessions, 50-minutes in between sessions). Stimulation will be delivered at 90% of the resting motor threshold (with depth correction to account for the distance between the scalp and cortex). An operator entered code (derived from the study EDC) will instruct the device to deliver active or sham magnetic stimulation."
