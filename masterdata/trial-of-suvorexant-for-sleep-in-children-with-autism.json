Suvorexant is a selective, dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) used for the treatment of sleep onset difficulties and/or sleep maintenance. To accomplish this, the investigators will use a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover 8-week study design to examine the effect of suvorexant on sleep physiology as assessed by polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, circadian rhythm, and clinical measures."
