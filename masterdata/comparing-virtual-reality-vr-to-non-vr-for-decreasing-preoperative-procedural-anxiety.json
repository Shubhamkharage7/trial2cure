            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of the study is to utilize the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety scale (mYPAS), a validated preoperative/procedural anxiety score, to measure preoperative anxiety via distraction in pediatric oncology patients undergoing port access.\n\nThe hypothesis is that using Virtual Reality (VR) will objectively decrease anxiety scores measured by mYPAS by five percent (primary outcome).\n\nThe secondary outcome will be the parents or the legally authorized representative (LAR) subjective reports of anxiety with the use of VR.\n\nThe Kind VR device is used in house at Children's Health in the Dallas and Plano campuses. The VR device used in this study qualifies as exempt from FDA IDE regulations. It is a non-significant risk, non-invasive, interactive video device the user wears like goggles. The study carries minimal risks to the subjects and is designed to minimize patient discomfort from placement or motion sickness. Furthermore, the device has disposable covers for protection against infection and can be sanitized between uses, once the disposable covers are removed. Children's Health System of Texas (CHST) and this research group are not partnering entities with the Kind VR, and the Kind VR device is not being studied. The effect of virtual reality (VR) on preprocedural anxiety as measured by questionnaires and the observations of the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) is being studied\n\nMost patients coming to the Clinic of Cancer and Blood Disorders (CCBD) are under chronic care for their ongoing disease and are likely to be coming to the CCBD at least twice in a 6-month period. The CCBD schedule will be reviewed by the researchers for patients age 5-12, requiring port access at least twice during the next six-month period. Patient families whose child meets the basic screening criteria, and have no exclusion criteria, will be approached privately as possible participants in the study. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled over a 2-year period. Once the subject/parent or LAR agrees to participate, study staff will randomize the subjects into which standard of care distraction method for anxiety management they will receive first in this study."
