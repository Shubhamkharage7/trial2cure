Infants fit with optimally programmed amplification will perform similarly to the infants with typical hearing on speech discrimination tasks."

Scores are given in d' (or equivalent) and are calculated from both true and false responses. Scores can range from 0.97 and 3.00. Scores above 1.28 are considered significantly above chance indicating successful perception of speech contrasts. To separate issues such as speech discrimination abilities versus proper conditioning, if a child is unable to discriminate a speech contrast (e.g., /ba-da/ or /sa-sha/) testing will transition to the 'easier' speech contrast /a-i/. If the child can discriminate between /a-i/, the investigators will repeat the previously tested contrast. Upon completion of this contrast the next contrast in will be assessed based on randomization ordering. If either contrast was not assessed/the child did not reach criterion, the participant will be rescheduled within 1 month, pending subject factors.",
