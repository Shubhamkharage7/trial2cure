Safety and tolerability evaluation is a secondary endpoint.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants in stable health will be randomly assigned into one of four groups based on their age to receive either 6 \u00b5g of BBV152 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Each participant will receive 2 doses of the study vaccine by 0.5 mL intramuscular injection, the first on Day 0 and the second on Day 28. Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner.\n\nSafety will be monitored by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will convene to perform safety reviews at 2 and 6 months and for immediate concerns regarding safety observations as needed.\n\nSafety assessment will include monitoring solicited, unsolicited, serious, medically attended adverse events and potentially immune medicated medical conditions.\n\nSince this is a bridging study, the maximum sample size of the data from the previous study will be 31 samples from the \\<65 years population and 358 with samples from the 18 to \\<65 years population."

Receipt of treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone \u2265 10mg/day for the duration of \u2265 two weeks), e.g., for cancer or an autoimmune disease, or planned receipt throughout the study period. If systemic corticosteroids have been administered short-term (\\<14 days) for treatment of an acute illness, participants should not be enrolled in the study until corticosteroid therapy has been discontinued for at least 28 days (about 4 weeks) before study intervention administration.\n10. Receipt of blood/plasma products, immunoglobulin, or monoclonal antibodies, from 60 days (about 2 months) before study intervention administration, or receipt of any passive antibody therapy specific to COVID-19 from 90 days (about 3 months) before study intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study.\n11. Has participated in an interventional clinical trial within the 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n12. Known sensitivity to any components of the study vaccine.\n13. The participant has received the influenza vaccine within 14 days prior to enrollment and any other vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization.\n14. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IP.\n15. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Participants who have been effectively treated for hepatitis C, as evidenced by a negative hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) confirmation test and who no longer require antiviral therapy, are eligible for participation.\n16. Known or suspected history of alcohol or Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Schedule 1 (including for cannabis, even where legal) or excessive intake of alcohol as judged by the Investigator. Benzodiazepines for anxiety disorders and stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are not exclusionary if the participant has been on a stable dose for more than 3 months prior to Screening and each study dosing and if the participant can produce a valid, current prescription for the medication. Propoxyphene, opioids, or combinations containing these medications (including as used for opioid addiction) are not permitted regardless of prescription status. Note: A positive Screening urine drug screen may not be repeated.\n17. Donated blood products within the 4 weeks prior to randomization.",
