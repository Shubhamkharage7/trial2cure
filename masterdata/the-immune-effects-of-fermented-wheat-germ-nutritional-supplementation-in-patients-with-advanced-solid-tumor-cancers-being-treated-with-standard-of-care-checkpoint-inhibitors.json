            "briefSummary": "This phase I clinical trial tests the immune effects of fermented wheat germ in patients with advanced solid tumor cancers who are being treated with standard of care checkpoint inhibitors. Fermented wheat germ is a nutritional supplement that some claim is a \"dietary food for special medical purposes for cancer patients\" to support them in treatment. There have also been claims that fermented wheat germ is \"clinically proven\" and \"recognized by medical experts\" to \"enhance oncological treatment\" and boost immune response to cancer; however, there are currently no documented therapeutic effects of fermented wheat germ as a nutritional supplement. Checkpoint inhibitors, given as part of standard of care for advanced solid tumors, are a type of immunotherapy that may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The information gained from this trial may allow researchers to determine if there is any value of giving fermented wheat germ with standard of care checkpoint inhibitors for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To assess the effect of fermented wheat germ (FWG) nutritional supplementation on natural killer (NK) cell killing activity in peripheral blood of cancer patients being treated with standard of care (SOC) immunotherapy who have voluntarily decided to take the FWG nutritional supplement.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess immunologic effects of FWG in subjects with cancer treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPi)-based therapy.\n\nII. To archive stool specimens of subjects with cancer treated with CPi-based therapy for future non-interventional studies for subsequent analysis at completion of study.\n\nIII. To evaluate toxicities of FWG in subjects with cancer treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPi)-based therapy.\n\nIV. To assess immunologic effects of FWG in patients with cancer treated with CPi immune-oncology-based therapy (Immune Correlates)."
