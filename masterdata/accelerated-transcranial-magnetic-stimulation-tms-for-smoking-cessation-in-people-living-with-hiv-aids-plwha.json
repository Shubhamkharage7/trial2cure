            "briefSummary": "To demonstrate whether four sessions of TBS improves attentional bias and craving in PLWHA smokers compared to four sessions of sham stimulation. We hypothesize 4 sessions of TBS to the left DLPFC will significantly improve attentional bias and craving for smoking cues compared to neutral cues in a population of subjects who are smokers with HIV/AIDS compared to sham stimulation.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed pilot study seeks to explore modulation of attentional bias and tobacco craving in PLWHA with one session of adequately dosed theta burst stimulation (TBS). Results of this trial will spur clinical research to further investigate the use of TBS as an adjunctive smoking cessation aid for PLWHA and could have broad implications for smoking cessation programs. Data obtained from this pilot study will also facilitate resubmission of a grant application examining adjunctive theta burst stimulation (TBS) combined with varenicline for smoking cessation in PLWHA. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) smoke at nearly three times the rate of the general population. These extraordinary smoking rates are associated with greater AIDS-related morbidity, non-AIDS related morbidity including non-AIDS-defining cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and mortality. Smoking significantly impacts the progression and outcome of HIV disease and has been identified as the leading contributor to premature mortality in PLWHA. One study estimated PLWHA lose more years from smoking than from HIV infection. In our view, shared by others in the field, the single greatest health behavior change that could improve mortality is to assist smokers living with HIV/AIDS to quit smoking."
