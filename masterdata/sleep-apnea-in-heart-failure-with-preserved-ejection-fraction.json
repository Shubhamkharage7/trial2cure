The prevalence of OSA will be determined in all HFpEF patients at baseline using home sleep apnea testing and all patients will complete the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire. Patients with known OSA at baseline will also be included only for the baseline assessment to accurately estimate prevalence of OSA in gold standard diagnosed HFpEF. The subset of initially recruited patients with HFpEF who have newly diagnosed OSA will be offered and initiated on CPAP therapy to treat their underlying OSA. Repeat evaluation after 3 months of CPAP therapy for end point assessment with remote accelerometry (2 weeks prior to study completion), ESS and KCCQ, which will all be identical to baseline measurements."
