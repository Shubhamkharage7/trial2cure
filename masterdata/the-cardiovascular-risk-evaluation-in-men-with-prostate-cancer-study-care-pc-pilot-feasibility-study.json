Patients will be given access to a web-based quality improvement tool to educate patients of cardiovascular risks in prostate cancer and to inform them of their individualized, estimated cardiovascular risk and guideline-based risk mitigation recommendations.\n\nThe study will assess the feasibility of this web-based application as a cardiovascular education tool for patients with prostate cancer.\n\nThe study will also evaluate if completion of the web-based tool improves cardiovascular care access and risk mitigation for patients with prostate cancer."
