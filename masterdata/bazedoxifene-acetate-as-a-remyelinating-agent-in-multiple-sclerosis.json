            "briefSummary": "The primary goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of bazedoxifene (BZA) as remyelinating agent in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).\n\nThe investigators will utilize electrophysiologic techniques and magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the effect of treatment in 50 women over the course of 6 months.\n\nParticipants may remain on their standard disease modifying treatment during the course of the trial but may not concurrently participate in any other investigational new drug research study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by the loss of myelin, which results in disruption of nerve signal, damage to axons, and, ultimately, neurodegeneration. In order to treat MS, new methods for promoting repair (remyelination) are sorely needed.\n\nThere is a strong preclinical (including EAE) and epidemiologic rationale for investigating the remyelinating potential of estrogenic compounds, including evidence of endogenous (puberty, postpartum periods) and exogenous hormonal influences on MS risk and course. MS affects 3 times more women than men, and disease course in women appears overall less aggressive (on MRI, fewer T2-hyperintense demyelinated lesions develop into axonal destruction visualized as hypointense T1 \"black holes\").\n\nBazedoxifene (BZA), a third-generation SERM with extensive safety data in humans, was identified in a novel high-throughput screen (BIMA screen) for compounds capable of promoting remyelination. Subsequent analysis validated BZA's remyelinating effect in vitro and in vivo following demyelinating insult. Given strong pre-clinical support for BZA's remyelinating potential, and the clinical success of other compounds identified using the BIMA screen (Green et al., 2017), the investigators will investigate the use of BZA as a remyelinating therapy in patients with MS."
