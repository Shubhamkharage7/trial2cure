The pretest treatment plan will be documented on the Case Report Form (CRF) prior to performing the WCBS test. After receiving the test result the clinician will document the post-test treatment plan. The healing outcome at 12 weeks following the test will be recorded on the CRF. The study will evaluate the healing outcomes compared to when test results are not used to assist in treatment decisions with study success defined as a higher healing rate and/or mean wound size reduction for WCBS positive wounds than obtained in the study PROT-2023-001. Also, the healing rate of wounds with a negative test result will be compared to the pretest rate to ensure that clinicians do not neglect and under treat this cohort with success criteria being that the WCBS negative wound healing rate is not worse than the pre-test healing rate. Additionally, the study will establish whether there are any device related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)."
