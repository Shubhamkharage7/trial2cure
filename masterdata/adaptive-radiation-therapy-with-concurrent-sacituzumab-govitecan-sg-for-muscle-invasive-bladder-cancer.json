            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of treatment with concurrent Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) and adaptive radiation therapy. The main objective is to establish the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of bladder preservation therapy treatment with concurrent SG and adaptive image-guided radiation therapy for participants with localized MIBC. Participants will receive the study drug, SG, through an IV once weekly on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day treatment cycle. The first cycle of SG will begin 21 days prior to the scheduled start of radiation therapy. The second and third cycles of SG will be given while the participant is receiving radiation therapy. Participants will be asked to undergo computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre-and post-treatment. Participation in the research will last up to 5 years, depending on treatment outcomes, with a treatment period of 8 weeks and a study follow-up period of up to 2-5 years thereafter, and a survival follow-up, with only phone call communication from years 3-5.",
            "detailedDescription": "Treatment patterns in the community demonstrate that a substantial proportion of participants with bladder cancer do not receive curative intent therapy, especially if unfit for or refuse radical cystectomy. Concurrent chemoradiation is an accepted alternative to radical cystectomy, however systemic radio sensitizing chemotherapy may have significant off target side effects. This study is investigating the concurrent administration of a bladder cancer targeted antibody drug conjugate with radiotherapy. Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), or IMMU-132 is an investigational new drug that utilizes an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to target and kill epithelial bladder cancer cells. SG is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in this setting. The aim for this study is to establish the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of bladder preservation therapy treatment with concurrent SG and adaptive image-guided radiation therapy for platinum ineligible participants with localized MIBC."

Calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula: Creatinine Clearance = \\[\\[140 - age(yr)\\] multiplied by body weight(kg)\\]/ \\[72 multiplied by serum Cr(mg/dL)\\] (multiply total by 0.85 for women).\n* Participants must have adequate baseline bladder function to warrant bladder preservation as assessed by the treating provider, including absence of bilateral hydronephrosis or acute obstruction related to bladder tumor after TURBT. Unilateral hydronephrosis is permitted.\n* Participants must undergo a TURBT within \u2264 60 days prior to treatment start. In a situation where a participant is referred from an outside site to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, participant must have a repeat cystoscopy by the urologist who will be following the participant on the clinical trial to assess the adequacy of the prior TURBT. Participant may then undergo repeat TURBT if deemed necessary as standard of care by the treating urologist.\n* Participants may have either completely or partially resected tumors as long as the treating urologist attempted maximal resection.\n* Participant must undergo radiological staging within 60 days prior to treatment start. Imaging of chest, abdomen, and pelvis must be performed using CT or MRI. Participants must not have evidence of T4b and/or N1-3 dT4bN1-3 disease. Eligibility is based on review by Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) radiology department and/or PI.\n* Participants must not have had urothelial carcinoma or any histological variant at any site outside of the urinary bladder within the previous 24 months except Ta/T1/Carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the upper urinary tract including renal, pelvis, and ureter if the participant had undergone complete nephroureterectomy.\n* Participants must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants receiving or utilizing any other investigational agents or devices.\n* Has received prior pelvic / local radiation therapy for MIBC or any other cancer type.\n* Has received any prior systemic treatment, chemoradiation, and / or radiation therapy for MIBC or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Note: Prior treatment for NMIBC with intravesical instillation therapy such as BCG or intravesical chemotherapy is permitted.\n* Has diagnosed Bilateral hydronephrosis.\n* Has limited bladder function as noted by a provider, with frequency of small amounts of urine, urinary incontinence including stress/urge, requires self-catheterization or a permanent indwelling catheter.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to SG or any of its' components.\n* Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because SG and radiation effects during pregnancy have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with SG, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Sacituzumab Govitecan.\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n\nNote: Participants who have entered the Follow-up Phase of an investigational study may participate if it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.",
