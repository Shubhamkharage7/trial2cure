The tools include an expanded medication calendar in English and the patients' preferred language, pictographics to illustrate return precautions (what signs/symptoms require further evaluation), an audio recording of the nurse reviewing the After Visit Summary (composed by providers) to allow for review by patients and caretakers after discharge.\n\nThe investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the package of discharge teaching tools on patients' understanding/recall, key implementation outcomes, and secondary clinical outcomes via a structured interview 1-2 weeks after discharge and chart review 30 days after discharge.\n\nThe objectives of this research study are:\n\n1. test the effectiveness of a linguistically appropriate toolkit for improving patient understanding of discharge instruction content\n2. Assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention in anticipation of a multi-site implementation trial\n3. assess the feasibility and appropriateness of the linguistically appropriate toolkit to nurses and in-person interpreters\n4. to assess the acceptability of the intervention to patients and their satisfaction with it\n5. to collect data on implementation context in anticipation for a multi-site trial\n6. to collect preliminary data on the toolkit's impact on clinical outcomes including medication adherence and hospital re-utilization."
