The study will evaluate RLY-2608 as a single agent for patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors, RLY-2608 + fulvestrant and RLY-2608 + fulvestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib or ribociclib) combination arms for patients with HR+ HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The RLY-2608 single agent arm, RLY-2608 + fulvestrant combination arm, and triple combination arms will have 2 parts: a dose escalation (Part 1) and a dose expansion (Part 2)."
