            "detailedDescription": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating and perplexing chronic pain condition that produces incalculable suffering to millions of individuals worldwide. The enigmatic nature of CRPS has left it difficult to treat. CRPS is characterized by a constellation of pain, sensory, autonomic, and motor symptoms that is difficult to pinpoint the source of injury/inflammation. Although unclear, a common cause of CRPS are radial fractures that demonstrate aberrant processing 4-6 weeks after injury.\n\nThe aim of this trial is to determine the potential effects and mechanisms of cannabinoid-induced pain relief in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Multiple psychophysical approaches will be conducted in conjunction with psychological and inflammatory marker testing to determine if and how cannabinoids produce stabilized improvement in CRPS-related pain and comorbidities.\n\nThe trial consisted of a pre-treatment screening period, six-week treatment period and a two-week follow-up."
