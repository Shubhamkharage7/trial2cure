Sexual desire, sexual enjoyment, and mood are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 0 to 7, with 0 indicating none and 7 indicating high. Activity is assessed using a checklist. Subjects record whether they had sexual daydreams; anticipation of sex; flirting; sexual interactions; and erection, masturbation, intercourse, orgasm, and ejaculation on each of the 7 days. The value is recorded as 0 (none) or 1 (any) for analysis. Weekly value is the sum of \"any\" responses for the week. The sexual activity score is the average of the weekly values. The score is 0 if no activity has taken place. Higher values indicate more activity and lower values indicate lower activity.",
