Although the clinical benefit of Eribulin when given together with Irinotecan and Temozolamide has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief. Outcomes for disease response include Best Overall Response (BOR), Duration of Response (DOR), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS)."
