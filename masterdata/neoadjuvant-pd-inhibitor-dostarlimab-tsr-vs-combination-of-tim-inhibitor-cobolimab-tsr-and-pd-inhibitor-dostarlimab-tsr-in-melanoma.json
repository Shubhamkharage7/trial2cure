Patients will undergo screening evaluation consisting of systemic/CNS staging scans, tumor biopsy, blood studies to confirm suitability. Subjects will receive neoadjuvant therapy (Dostarlimab (TSR-042) or Dostarlimab (TSR-042)/TSR-022 combination for 6 weeks prior to planned surgery (pre-operative phase). Surgery will occur 1-4 weeks after completion of pre-operative therapy.
