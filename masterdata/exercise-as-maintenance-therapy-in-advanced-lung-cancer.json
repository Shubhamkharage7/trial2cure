            "detailedDescription": "This study is a randomized control trial at a single institution comparing advanced lung cancer patients undergoing supervised home-based exercise program versus usual care. The intervention is a supervised home-based exercise program that will be coordinated by the MOVE program. The regimen will be 12 weeks in duration, three times a week, and administered by a trained professional virtually.\n\nParticipants will be randomized 1:1 to the exercise or usual care arm. Participants will be stratified on baseline frailty by the SPPB.\n\nPrimary Objective To compare changes patient-reported fatigue (by FACT-F survey) from baseline to post-intervention in patients with locally advanced and advanced lung cancer receiving maintenance immunotherapy undergoing a supervised home-based exercise program versus usual care.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n1. To compare changes in cardiorespiratory fitness measured by VO2peak, estimated as time on the treadmill during ramp treadmill test, from baseline to post-intervention in patients with locally advanced/advanced lung cancer receiving maintenance immunotherapy undergoing a supervised home-based exercise program versus usual care.\n2. To compare changes in physical function measured by the short physical performance battery from baseline to post-intervention in patients with locally advanced/advanced lung cancer receiving maintenance immunotherapy undergoing a supervised home-based exercise program versus usual care.\n3. To compare changes in muscle mass and muscle density measured on CT scans for disease monitoring and bioimpedance analysis from baseline to post-intervention in patients with locally advanced/advanced lung cancer receiving maintenance immunotherapy undergoing a supervised home-based exercise program versus usual care.\n4. To compare changes in depression scores by HADS survey from baseline to post-intervention in patients with locally advanced and/or advanced lung cancer receiving maintenance immunotherapy undergoing a supervised home-based exercise program versus usual care.\n5. To compare the proportion of patients who are \"fatigued,\" defined as a FACT-F score of \\<43 at post-intervention between the exercise and usual care arms.\n6. To evaluate uptake and adherence of supervised home-based exercise program in patients with locally advanced and/or advanced lung cancer receiving maintenance immunotherapy or targeted therapy, measured by the percentage of patients who consented to the study and percentage of training sessions attended by patients in the exercise arm."
