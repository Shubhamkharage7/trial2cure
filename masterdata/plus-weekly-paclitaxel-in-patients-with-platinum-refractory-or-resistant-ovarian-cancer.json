            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the side effects of ONC201 and paclitaxel and how well they work in treating patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent), or that does not respond to treatment (refractory). ONC201 is the first in its class of drugs that antagonize some specific cell receptors on cancer cells, leading to their destruction. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ONC201 and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer compared to paclitaxel alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC 201 (ONC201) and paclitaxel in patients with platinum refractory or resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. (Part 1) II. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum refractory or resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. (Part 2) III. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) of ONC201 in combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with platinum refractory or resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. (Part 2)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the durability/duration of response (DOR) of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety and patient reported tolerability of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel. (Part 2) III. To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel.\n\nIV. To evaluate the cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and/or human epididymis factor 4 (HE-4) response of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel in those patients with one or both of these tumor markers upregulated.\n\nV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel.\n\nVI. To obtain preliminary estimates of overall survival (OS) of ONC201 in combination with weekly paclitaxel.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the immune response (specifically natural killer \\[NK\\] cell and cytokine profile) of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum refractory or resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ONC201 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, and paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 2, 9, and 16. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If paclitaxel must be stopped for any reason, patients may continue on ONC201 alone.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year."

No waiting required following port-a-cath placement, ureteral stent placement, percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.\n* No other (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal anti-cancer therapy, radiotherapy \\[except for palliative local radiotherapy\\]), biological therapy or other novel agent is to be permitted while the patient is receiving study medications\n* Grade \\>1 toxicity from prior therapy (except alopecia or anorexia or above hematologic criteria) unless controlled by medications.\n* Inability to swallow oral medication. Note: Patient may not have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or be receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on this trial.\n* Known malignant central nervous system disease other than neurologically stable, treated brain metastases - defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression after treatment for at least 4 weeks (including brain radiotherapy). Must be off any systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of brain metastases for at least 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* Patient has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products (i.e. grapefruit juice) known to be moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, which cannot be discontinued 1 week prior to Day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study until 1 weeks after the last dose of study drug.\n* Any known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the components of study treatment\n* Pregnant or lactating\n* Serious active infection at the time of enrollment, or another serious underlying medical condition at discretion of the enrolling physician that would impair the ability of the patient to receive study treatment. HIV or other immunodeficiency disease that is well controlled and that does not impact baseline lab values (i.e. outside of above noted parameters for inclusion) are NOT considered exclusion criteria.\n* Presence of other active cancers other than ovarian cancer except those that do not require active therapy (i.e. on surveillance) and known non-invasive cancers and in situ cancers (e.g. non-melanoma skin cancers).\n* Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol.",
