This study consists of 2 parts, Part A: Dose Escalation and Part B: Dose Expansion.\n\nPart A may evaluate up to 7 dose levels of PRO1107 on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle by IV infusion.\n\nPart B will be initiated at a dose level based on a comprehensive analysis of safety, tolerability, clinical PK, PD and activity data from Part A in up to 4 different cohorts of up to 40 patients per cohort.\n\nPatients will continue to receive study treatment until the first instance of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal, study termination by the Sponsor, pregnancy, or death."
