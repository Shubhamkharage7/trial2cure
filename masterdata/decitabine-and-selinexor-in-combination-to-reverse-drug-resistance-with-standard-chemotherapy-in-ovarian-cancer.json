            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the side effects and effectiveness of this novel four-drug combination of chemotherapy (decitabine, selinexor, carboplatin and paclitaxel) on patients with relapsed ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal carcinoma.\n\nRecently the investigators have found that the combination of decitabine and selinexor, two Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved chemotherapy agents, may prevent or reverse the development of drug resistance and further the remissions and duration of remissions with standard ovarian cancer chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. As decitabine and selinexor are not FDA approved for the participant's cancer, these agents are investigational.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants enrolled in this study protocol will receive therapy with decitabine followed by usual doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel for one cycle. If the participant tolerates this well, the selinexor will be added to the second and subsequent cycles of therapy given at 4-week intervals, in the out-patient setting. The participant will be asked to complete 9 study visits during their active therapy during each cycle: Days 1-5 of each cycle the participant will receive decitabine treatments over 1 hour, with carboplatin and paclitaxel given on day 6. Paclitaxel alone will continue weekly for 3 weeks on days 13, 20 and 27 of the 28-day cycle. The 5 days of daily decitabine therapy lasts about 1 hour and the carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment last 4 hours, with single agent paclitaxel being only 1 hour.\n\nSelinexor is not added until cycle 2 and is given orally weekly on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the 28-day cycle. Weekly clinic visits are required for the first two cycles at the time paclitaxel is administered.\n\nThe participant's progress will be assessed and if a remission is achieved the participant would continue the therapy for up to 6 cycles."
