We will study if MRI can reflect different levels of kidney function. The investigators will also evaluate if MRI can differentiate causes for declining kidney function. Finally, the investigators will explore how MRI measures changes before and after medical treatment for worsening kidney function.\n\nYou may be invited for MRI exams with different exam options. An MRI exam may use either of two types of MRI machines at the center for magnetic resonance research (CMRR): the 3 Tesla (3T) scanner and the 7 Tesla (7T) scanner. You may also be invited for a multi-session exam. A description of the MRI exam types with different exam options and the types of multi-session exams is provided later in this document.",
