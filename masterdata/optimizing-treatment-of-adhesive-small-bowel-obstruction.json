            "briefSummary": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is one of the most common causes of serious gastrointestinal disease in the US. Adhesion-related SBO (aSBO) is usually treated by the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) to decompress the stomach, administration of intravenous (IV) fluids and observation by a surgical team.\n\nThe purpose of this feasibility study is to determine the potential for implementation of treatment protocols for aSBO and determine the feasibility of randomizing patients with aSBO to receive or not receive NGTs or water-soluble contrast (WSC). The investigators will also determine the ability to measure HRQOL as a main outcome for the treatment of aSBO. The studies outlined in this research program intend to address gaps in knowledge about how to determine who benefits from NGT placement, who can be managed without them, how to objectively determine when a bowel obstruction has resolved, how to reintroduce feeding to patients with aSBO, what criteria should be used for hospital discharge and what role cathartics such as WSC contrast have in the management of aSBO.\n\nThis feasibility study will enroll a limited number of patients (n=40) who will be followed for up to 30 days."
