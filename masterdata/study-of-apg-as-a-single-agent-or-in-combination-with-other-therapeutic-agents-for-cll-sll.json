            "detailedDescription": "The study will be conducted in two (2) parts and each part will consist of a ramp-up period, dose escalation and dose expansion portions. The duration of the ramp-up period will depend on the dose schedule being tested and will be conducted for both monotherapy and combination therapy. The ramp-up will consist of treatment with APG-2575 given once a day starting at 20 mg on Day 1, 50 mg on Day 2, 100 mg on Day 3, 200 mg on Day 4, 400 mg on Day 5\u00b8 600 mg on Day 6, 800 mg on Day 7, 1000 mg on Day 8 and 1200 mg on Day 9. Scheduled maximum cohort doses for evaluation will start at 200 mg of APG-2575 to a maximum of 1200 mg of APG-2575. Consequently, patients with a scheduled maximum dose of 200 mg will have a 3-day ramp-up period, those scheduled at 400 mg, a 4-day ramp-up, and those scheduled at 600 mg, a 5-day ramp-up, etc, see Figure 1. Part 1 will study APG-2575 at different dose levels as monotherapy using a 3+3 dose escalation design with dose expansion at RP2D. Part 2 will be combination of APG-2575 with rituximab or acalabrutinib or voruciclib Part 2 will be a 3+3 dose escalation of combination APG-2575 plus rituximab or acalabrutinib or voruciclib. Expansion cohorts at RP2D for the respective combinations will be conducted to further evaluate safety and anticancer activity"
