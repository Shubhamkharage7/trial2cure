            "briefSummary": "In this study, researchers will use Photovoice to learn about how bereaved parents felt and thought about hope when their children were on hospice. 'Photovoice' is a research method that uses participants' photographs as a springboard for discussion.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* To explore reflections, emotions, and experiences evoked in bereaved parents when reviewing photographs from their child's time on hospice, with photos selected by parents based on a prompt related to their thoughts about hope during that time.",
            "detailedDescription": "Using a prospective qualitative design, we will enroll parents of children who died on hospice 6-24 months prior. Parents who opt to participate in the study will be asked to review photographs they have from when their child was on hospice and to select 1-5 photographs that communicate what hope meant to them at that time. Their photograph selection will be guided by a brief conversation with the researcher and a written guide that encourages the participant to think about hope broadly and invites an open interpretation of what it means for a photograph to represent hope.\n\nParents will bring their selected photograph(s) to a one-on-one semi-structured interview. The interview will take place either in person or over a virtual meeting platform. During the interview, the participant will share the photographs with the researcher, discuss why they were chosen, and share any other reflections they have about their experience. It is anticipated that the interview will last about 60 minutes. The audio for the meeting will be recorded. Video will not be recorded."
