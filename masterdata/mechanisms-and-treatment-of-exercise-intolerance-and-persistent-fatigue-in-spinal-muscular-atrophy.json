            "briefSummary": "This study will focus on the pathophysiological underpinnings of reduced exercise capacity and fatigue in ambulatory patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). There has been laboratory evidence to suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial biogenesis may be vulnerable to survival motor neuron (SMN) protein deficiency. This is an observational, single visit study including 34 ambulatory SMA patients treated with SMN repletion therapies (risdiplam or nusinersen) for at least 6 months at enrollment.",
            "detailedDescription": "SMN depletion affects muscle mitochondria and thus muscle function as a result. The relationship between these and their effect(s) on fatigue in the context of SMN repletion treatment has not been evaluated. If muscle function is vulnerable to SMN insufficiency, treatment strategies targeting muscle in addition to the central nervous system (motor neurons) may ameliorate fatigue and improve exercise capacity, thereby improving quality of life and bringing SMA treatments closer to a cure. This project explores such an idea by comparing the effects of the two different SMN repletion modalities in patients. This is an observational cross-sectional study involving ambulatory SMA children and adults treated for at least 6 months with SMN repletion therapy, either (1) systemically with risdiplam, or (2) intrathecally (central nervous system-only), with nusinersen."
