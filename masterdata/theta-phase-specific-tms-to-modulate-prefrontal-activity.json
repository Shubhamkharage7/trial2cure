            "detailedDescription": "Approach/avoidance (Ap/Av) behavior is a reliable marker of the emotional processes in the human brain and a robust predictor of mood disorders. Although existing scientific studies found a correlation between the approach/avoidance behavior and ongoing theta activity (3-7 Hz) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the causal evidence of the phase-dependent role and strength of association between the prefrontal theta oscillations and approach/avoidance behavior are still unclear. Here, we will monitor brain oscillations in real-time non-invasively using electroencephalography during the approach/avoidance test and modulate theta peaks or troughs with transcranial magnetic stimulation. These data will provide novel understanding of the mechanisms of emotional processing in human brain."
