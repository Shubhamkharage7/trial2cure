Follow-up will consist of a larger sample including 4,000 patients.\n\nPatients will be treated for Osteoarthritis (OA) of the shoulder due to degeneration or chronic injury. They will be treated with autologous Stromed obtained by the Adipose Ultrasonic Cell Recovery Unit (AUCRU) and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) processed by the RegenLab (RegenKit BCT-3) PRP product each as direct injections to the affected joints. Patient outcomes will be tracked with laboratory tests for inflammation markers, the DASH and SPADI questionnaires and a follow up MRI at various endpoints to 6 months. SF-36 forms (a quality of life measure) and numerical ratings scales (NRS) will also be used to assess safety and efficacy of treatment, as well as any reduction in patient medication and/or delay in pending shoulder planning/replacement therapy."
