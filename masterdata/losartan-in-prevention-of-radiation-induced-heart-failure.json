            "detailedDescription": "This is a pilot study examining whether losartan prevents radiation therapy-induced myocardial fibrosis (thickening of the heart tissue), which can cause heart failure, in breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.\n\nLosartan is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart failure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved losartan for use in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\nThe FDA has approved radiation therapy as a treatment option for breast cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits. It is expected participants will be on the study for 1 year.\n\nIt is expected that about 10 people will take part in this research study."
