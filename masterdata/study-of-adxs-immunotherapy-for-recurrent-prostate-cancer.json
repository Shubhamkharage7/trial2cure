            "detailedDescription": "ADXS-504 is a novel Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) - based immunotherapy, bioengineered to elicit T cell responses against 24 tumor antigens that include 1) 14 peptide antigens derived from frequently occurring and commonly shared hotspot mutations in patients with prostate cancer and 2) 10 peptide antigens derived from sequence-optimized tumor associated antigens (TAAs) that are differentially expressed or overexpressed in prostate cancer. ADXS-504 is designed to express multiple tumor antigen targets to which patients may generate a broad set of effector T cells for tumor control.\n\nThis is a phase 1 open-label study of ADXS-504 monotherapy in subjects with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer previously treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy) who are not currently receiving androgen ablation therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical and immune responses following treatment with ADXS-504 monotherapy."

Histologically documented prostatic adenocarcinoma confirmed by a pathology report from prostate biopsy or a radical prostatectomy specimen.\n2. Age \u226518 years\n3. Previously undergone primary therapy for prostate cancer. Salvage XRT or cryotherapy following primary therapy \u2265 6 months prior to randomization is allowed.\n4. A rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) defined as the following\n\n   * If the subject's primary therapy was radical prostatectomy (RP) (with or without adjuvant or salvage XRT), rising PSA is defined as 2 consecutive rising values above 0.1 ng/mL, each taken \u2265 3 weeks apart, and the last value \u2265 0.3 ng/mL\n   * If the subject received other primary therapies (e.g. XRT, cryosurgery, brachytherapy), rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) is defined per the Phoenix definition, i.e., 2 consecutive rising values above the PSA nadir plus 2.0 ng/mL.\n5. PSA \u22650.3 in addition to prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT)\u22654 months. PSADT will be determined from all non-zero PSA values within 12 months prior to registration. To calculate PSADT, there must be at least THREE PSA values, with at least 3 weeks between each measurement. The PSADT will be computed from the formula: PSADT = (loge2)/k, with k being the estimated slope of the logarithm of PSA over time.\n\n   The following web site may also be used:\n\n   http://www.mskcc.org/applications/nomograms/prostate/PsaDoublingTime.aspx\n6.

Subject has known brain metastasis. Subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a CT scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastasis;\n3. Subject has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months, a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a disorder that requires systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo, psoriasis, alopecia or resolved childhood asthma/atopy not requiring systemic treatment would be an exception to this rule. Subjects with hypothyroidism who are stable on hormone replacement (\\>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study;\n4.

Subject has had a major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury \u22646 weeks of registration;\n14. Subject has any other serious or uncontrolled physical or mental condition/disease that, as judged by the Investigator, could place the subject at higher risk derived from their participation in the study, could confound results of the study, or would be likely to prevent compliance with the requirements of the study.\n15. Subject has a second primary malignancy with greater than minimal metastatic potential that has not been in remission for greater than 3 years. Examples of tumors that do not require a 3-year remission: non-melanoma skin cancer, resected melanoma in situ, or non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma.\n\nPrior/Concomitant Therapy\n\n1.
