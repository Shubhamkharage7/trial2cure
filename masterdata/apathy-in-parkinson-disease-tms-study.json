Does transcranial magnetic stimulation change effort task performance in Parkinson's Disease patients?\n2. Is there a link between brain signals and apathy?\n\nParticipants will\n\n* complete questionnaires and assessments\n* perform an effort task\n* have their brain activity recorded (EEG)\n* receive non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS)\n\nResearchers will compare two stimulation locations (experimental site and control site) to see if TMS of the experimental site has an effect on apathy. Participants will receive stimulation of both sites (during separate visits).",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be asked to come for 3 study visits.\n\nDuring visit 1, after being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a brief cognitive assessment, a movement examination, and answer questionnaires. Additionally, the individual motor threshold will be determined for each participant. Visit 1 will take 2-3 hours.\n\nVisits 2 and 3 will involve:\n\n* completing questionnaires,\n* performing a task where fictitious rewards can be earned by squeezing a dynamometer,\n* recording brain activity with an electroencephalogram (EEG), and\n* receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Visits 2 and 3 will take approximately 3 hours each and will be separated from each other by at least 3 weeks."
