            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to learn about the relationship between environmental structural racism and discrimination and chronic pain risk in Native American adults. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. How does environmental structural racism and discrimination affect chronic pain-promoting mechanisms in Native Americans?\n2. What psychosocial factors buffer the negative effects of environmental structural racism and discrimination on chronic pain-promoting mechanisms?",
            "detailedDescription": "Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic pain than the general U.S. population, and previous research has shown that pain-free Native Americans transition to chronic pain at almost three times the rate of non-Hispanic Whites. Yet, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to this pain disparity.\n\nThis study aims to better understand the role of environmental and society-wide stressors, like structural racism and discrimination, in contributing to this pain disparity. It is believed that these environmental and social stressors may contribute to chronic pain risk by increasing an individual's mental and physical stress levels. In turn, increased stress may alter how an individual responds to pain, both physically and emotionally, which may place them at greater risk for developing chronic pain in the future."
