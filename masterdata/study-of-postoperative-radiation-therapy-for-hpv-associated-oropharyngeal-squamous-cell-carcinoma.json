In general, these cancers have better cure rates than other types of head and neck cancers. Therefore, the investigators are studying whether we can safely reduce the amount of treatment after surgery, such as surveillance (instead of using radiation) or less radiation or less chemotherapy, while maintaining good cure rates. The investigators hope that by reducing the intensity of treatment, this will lead to less side effects during and after cancer treatment."

Note: that HIV positive patients will be eligible.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the teratogenic risks of radiation exposure to the developing fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radiation therapy and supportive care medications required for symptomatic management of head and neck cancer side effects as well as general anesthesia required for oncologic head and neck surgery, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled in the study.
