Utilizing educational and promotional materials and electronic health record reminders, may improve the uptake of the HPV vaccine in children and young adults, ultimately preventing the development of cervical cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Test the effectiveness of a multi-level intervention (MLI) directed at clinics, providers, and patients (parents of children aged 11-12) to improve HPV vaccine initiation and completion in health systems in four Appalachian states (Kentucky \\[KY\\], Ohio \\[OH\\], West Virginia \\[WV,\\] and Virginia \\[VA\\]) among children aged 11-12 and assess the effectiveness of the intervention program among subgroups, e.g., females versus (vs) males.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess sustainability of the intervention. II. Assess cost impacts of the intervention III. Assess changes in clinic practices that occur as a result of the intervention in terms of staff responsibilities for the vaccination process and reducing missed opportunities for vaccination.\n\nIV. Assess whether interventions focused on 13-26 year olds increases catch-up vaccination.\n\nV. Examine changes in knowledge and attitudes of providers via educational session pre-post surveys.\n\nVI. Satisfaction with the intervention at the multiple levels.\n\nOUTLINE: Health systems are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (EARLY INTERVENTION): Health systems receive educational materials consisting of posters, brochures and table tents. Providers complete survey about HPV knowledge, participate in educational session over 1 hour and receive educational handouts on the HPV vaccine. Patients receive educational materials about HPV vaccine and reminder letters for HPV vaccination.\n\nARM II (DELAYED INTERVENTION): Health systems, providers, and patients receive usual care for 12 months, then receive multi-level intervention as in Arm I."
