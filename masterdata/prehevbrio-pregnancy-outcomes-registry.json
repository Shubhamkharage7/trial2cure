            "briefSummary": "The registry is an observational surveillance program designed to recruit and encourage participation of women who were exposed to PREHEVBRIO\u00ae hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy and to collect and analyze information related to post-exposure pregnancy and fetal and neonatal outcomes.\n\nThe objective of the Registry is to monitor and evaluate all received reports of PREHEVBRIO\u00ae vaccine exposure within 28 days prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy and delivery, as well as maternal, obstetrical, pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes. This registry is primarily descriptive and designed to detect potential safety signals rather than test hypotheses.",
            "detailedDescription": "VBI Vaccines was granted a Biologic License by the FDA on 30 November 2021, to introduce PREHEVBRIO\u00ae in the United States for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in adults 18 years of age and older. The vaccine has also been approved in the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada, and Israel, and is currently marketed in the United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Israel.\n\nAccording to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, pregnant women who are negative for hepatitis B virus infection and who are at risk for hepatitis B virus infection should be specifically targeted for hepatitis B vaccination. However, more data is required to make such a recommendation for PREHEVBRIO\u00ae. The rationale to conduct this study, include: (1) PREHEVBRIO\u00ae, as a newly licensed vaccine in the U.S., is not indicated for pregnant women; (2) pregnant women were actively excluded from trials during clinical development of PREHEVBRIO\u00ae; and (3) there have only been limited human data to inform the safety of PREHEVBRIO\u00ae administered during pregnancy. Since PREHEVBRIO\u00ae vaccination is not indicated in pregnancy, exposure to PREHEVBRIO\u00ae in pregnancy is likely to be inadvertent and to occur in early pregnancy.\n\nThe purpose of the registry is to detect, describe, and evaluate adverse pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to PREHEVBRIO\u00ae within 28 days prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy and to detect adverse fetal and/or neonatal outcomes at delivery or early termination.\n\nThe registry is strictly observational; schedule of office visits and all treatment regimens will be determined by the treating health care provider; no additional laboratory tests or assessments are required as part of this registry; only data noted as part of routine care will be collected. Subjects will be followed from enrollment until 3 months post-delivery or early termination of pregnancy.\n\nPregnant women will be enrolled in the registry prospectively (after exposure to the product but before the conduct of any prenatal tests that could provide knowledge of the outcome of pregnancy). If the condition of the fetus has already been assessed through prenatal testing (e.g., targeted ultrasound, amniocentesis, etc.), such reports will be considered retrospective reports. Retrospective reports are also eligible for the registry, but they will be analyzed separately from prospective reports. The analyses of study data will primarily use descriptive and inferential statistical methods designed to detect potential safety signals, rather than test hypotheses."
