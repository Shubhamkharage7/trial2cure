This will enable longitudinal data collection of complications in this disease, specifically defining the epidemiology of end-organ complications of HPT that are related to high calcification propensity. It will also determine relationships between calcification burden and end-organ disease severity and progression risk and assess the utility of traditional and novel biomarkers of mineral and bone metabolism on disease diagnosis and monitoring. These data will inform future investigations on the development, study, and implementation of HPT end-organ disease modifying strategies and impact clinical practice in hypoparathyroidism.The study objectives are to:\n\n1. Build a prospective cohort of patients to study HPT-associated end-organ damage.\n2. Determine end-organ physiologic consequences of HPT.\n3. Elucidate determinants of HPT-associated end-organ damage."
