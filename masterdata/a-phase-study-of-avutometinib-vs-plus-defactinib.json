Subjects with other malignancies associated with very low risk of metastasis or death may be included upon discussion with the PI.\n5.

These subjects should preferentially receive surgery prior to consideration of trial therapy.\n6. Major surgery within 4 weeks (excluding placement of vascular access), minor surgery within 2 weeks, or palliative radiotherapy within 1 week (7 days) of the first dose of study therapy.\n7. Treatment with warfarin. Subjects on warfarin for DVT/PE can be converted to low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).\n8.

These metastases may manifest as altered mental status, persistent headaches, persistent nausea, focal weakness or numbness, and seizures. Subjects with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to study entry, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study therapy, and are neurologically stable, with no evidence of interim progression. Subjects with new asymptomatic CNS metastases detected during the screening period must receive radiation therapy and/or surgery for CNS metastases. Following treatment, these subjects may then be eligible if all other criteria are met.\n11. Known SARS-Cov2 infection (clinical symptoms) \u226428 days prior to first dose of study therapy.\n12. Known hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that is active and/or requires therapy.\n13.

Subjects with history of glaucoma, history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes.\n    2. Subject with history of retinal pathology or evidence of visible retinal pathology that is considered a risk factor for RVO, intraocular pressure \\> 21 mm Hg as measured by tonometry, or other significant ocular pathology, such as anatomical abnormalities that increase the risk for RVO.\n    3. Subjects with a history of corneal erosion (instability of corneal epithelium), corneal degeneration, active or recurrent keratitis, and other forms of serious ocular surface inflammatory conditions.\n16. Concurrent congestive heart failure, prior history of class III/ IV cardiac disease (New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\]), myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, unstable angina, or severe obstructive pulmonary disease.\n17.
