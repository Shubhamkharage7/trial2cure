            "briefSummary": "Parents of children from impoverished communities are disproportionately more likely to engage in harsh physical discipline, which can lead to serious clinical outcomes, including suicidal ideation and attempts. One mechanism linking low resource environments and maladaptive parenting strategies is maternal delay discounting, or the tendency to value smaller, immediate rewards (such as stopping children's misbehavior via physical means) relative to larger, but delayed rewards (like improving the parent-child relationship). This study will examine the efficacy of implementing a low-cost, brief intervention targeting the reduction of maternal delay discounting to inform broader public health efforts aimed at improving adolescent mental health outcomes in traditionally underserved communities.",
            "detailedDescription": "Harsh parenting is associated with serious and costly mental health problems among youth, including substance use, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation and behaviors. Of concern, these parenting practices are most common among families from impoverished communities; however, many behaviorally-based parenting interventions do not take into account the unique mechanisms linking environmental disadvantage to parenting approaches. While the causes of harsh parenting are complex and varied, one such mechanism may be parents' tendencies to prioritize immediate rewards (such as stopping a child's misbehavior via physical punishment like spanking and hitting) relative to larger, but delayed rewards (including improved parent-child relationship quality), known as delay discounting.\n\nThe aims of the current study are to conduct a Stage 1 parent-child dyad randomized control trial (RCT) (n = 72) examining the effectiveness of a brief, episodic future thinking (EFT) intervention in a community setting serving low-income mothers and additional implementation data. Participants will be randomized to receive either Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) or Episodic Recent Thinking (ERT) intervention arms. This case series will examine the efficacy of episodic future thinking (EFT) compared to episodic recent thinking (ERT) to target reduction of parenting-related delay discounting. Outcomes will evaluate the effect of EFT on reducing maternal delay discounting and harsh parenting and improving child clinical outcomes."

The measure is scored to derive a discounting rate k, with larger values reflecting more problematic rates of discounting. Because k distributions are typically skewed, post-hoc natural logarithmic transformations will be performed, which have been shown to approximate normal distributions.
