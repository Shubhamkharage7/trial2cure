Escalation will be based on a modified toxicity probability interval design \\[mTPI-2\\] until MTD is identified or the pre-specified rules are met.\n\nA lead-in dosimetry sub-study will be conducted during the dose escalation period in which all subjects in the first two dose cohorts will undergo dosimetric evaluation prior to receiving the therapeutic agent."
