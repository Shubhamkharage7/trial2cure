            "briefSummary": "We propose to pilot test an adapted version of the Teen Marijuana Check Up (TMCU) for persistent cannabis users with first episode psychosis (FEP) in Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC). The adapted version of the TMCU will include tailoring to risks of persistent cannabis use in FEP, providing education on lower risk cannabis use, and adding a session to address collaborative planning to maintain CSC engagement and antipsychotic adherence and to reduce harm associated with cannabis use.",
            "detailedDescription": "We propose to adapt the Teen Marijuana Check Up for persistent cannabis users with FEP in CSC. Dr. Walker, the developer of the TMCU, will be a consultant. Adaptations will include tailoring content of assessment and feedback to risks of persistent cannabis use in FEP, providing education on lower risk cannabis use, and adding a session to address collaborative planning to maintain CSC engagement and antipsychotic adherence and to reduce harm associated with cannabis use. We will also develop guidelines for integrating continued collaborative, harm-reduction focused discussion of cannabis use into CSC, consider adding booster or check-in sessions, and specify how family members can be brought into the check-up process. To inform these adaptations, we will collect quantitative data from cannabis-using FEP patients (n of 40) and conduct qualitative interviews with cannabis-using patients, family members, and CSC clinicians (15 of each) about their perspectives on cannabis use and CSC participation (Aim 1). We will use these data as part of an iterative process to specify the adapted intervention that will integrate information gathered from team discussion and focus groups with FEP patients and family members and vetting of intervention components by key stakeholders (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a pilot of the adapted intervention (n of 40 cannabis-using FEP patients compared to matched controls) to examine feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and preliminary impact on intervention targets and outcomes (Aim 3). If results are promising, the intervention can be tested in a large RCT across the EPINET."
