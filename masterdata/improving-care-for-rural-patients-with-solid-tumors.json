All participants will complete surveys to assess Quality of Care and Patient Reported outcomes at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The CARES intervention will include a maximum of 10 navigation and 10 counseling sessions delivered over approximately a 6- month period delivered by oncology nurse navigators and master's level counselors. Sessions will be scheduled to correspond with key transition points during treatment and may be held in person, virtually, or by phone. Patients enrolled to the usual care arm will receive a standardized list of resources. Participation will last 6 months."
