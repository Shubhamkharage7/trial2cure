Using stakeholder input (community advisory board (CAB)), the study team will adapt the SMART program to incorporate education and self-management support for use of Rescue Medication (RM) to manage seizure occurrence among Persons With Epilepsy (PWE) who have repetitive seizures. Additional content/support materials, pending input stakeholder might include posters/hand-outs that present information on the use of RM in a way that is engaging and salient to PWE. It is expected that participants will be in Phase 1 for about 3 months and participate in the CAB 2 or 3 times via zoom for 60-90 minutes/meeting. The advisory board will provide input on needed refinement of an adapted version of SMART based on their individual experiences. It is anticipate the total time commitment to be no more than 6 hours over 3 months, spread out over 2-3 meetings with review of materials possible in between meetings.\n\nPhase 2: The investigators will use a 6-month prospective trial design to test engagement with and effects of SMART-RM among approximately 35 adult (\u2265 18 years) PWE who have repetitive seizures."
