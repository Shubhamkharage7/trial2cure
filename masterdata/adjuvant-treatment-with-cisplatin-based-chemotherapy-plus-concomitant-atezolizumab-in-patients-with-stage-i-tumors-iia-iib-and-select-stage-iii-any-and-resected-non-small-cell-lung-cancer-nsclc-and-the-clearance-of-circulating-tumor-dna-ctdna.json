            "briefSummary": "The vast majority of patients with stage I (tumors \u2265 4cm), IIA, IIB (and select stage III) NSCLC are managed with upfront surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, relapse rates remain high and are primarily due to distant, metastatic disease. Previous meta-analysis evaluating the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate a similar impact on improved disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The role of checkpoint inhibitors has been proven to be effective in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of histology and PD-L1 expression. Results from trials evaluating the use of checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for early stage disease are promising. However, there are no trials evaluating the role of concomitant chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting. In addition, emerging data supports the use of ctDNA as a promising biomarker for early detection of minimal residual disease and have indicated that the presence of detectable ctDNA after surgery for localized lung cancer is correlated with a 90-100% chance for disease recurrence. Therefore, we propose this current study assessing concomitant chemotherapy plus Atezolizumab in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage I (tumors \u2265 4cm), IIA, IIB (and select stage III) NSCLC who have detectable ctDNA after surgery. The clearance of ctDNA will serve as a surrogate for long term DFS and OS in this patient population."

Note: If Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C status is unknown, testing is required:\n\n  * Subject must have negative total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at screening, or positive total HBcAb test followed by a negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA test at screening. The HBV DNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive total HBcAb test.\n  * Subject must have negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test. A positive HCV RNA test is sufficient to diagnose active HCV infection in the absence of an HCV antibody test.\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 5 months after the last dose of study drug.",
