            "briefSummary": "This phase I/Ib trial identifies the side effects and best dose of abemaciclib when given together with olaparib in treating patients with ovarian cancer that responds at first to treatment with drugs that contain the metal platinum but then comes back within a certain period (recurrent platinum-resistant). Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Adding abemaciclib to olaparib may work better to treat recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the safety of abemaciclib plus olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer by determining the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity using overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) with abemaciclib and olaparib, given in combination, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess proof of mechanism (RB, phosphoRB, cleaved caspase 3, Ki67, geminin, gamma-H2AX, RAD51 nuclear foci, pNBS multiplex, Myc transcriptional targets ODC1 and LDHA, homologous recombination genes BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, serum thymidine kinase), plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics, and subgroups of response (immunohistochemistry \\[IHC\\] for Myc, cyclin E; next generation sequencing \\[NGS\\]/whole exome sequencing \\[WES\\] for DCAF, hormone receptor \\[HR\\] repair gene alterations, Myc, and CCNE1; ribonucleic acid sequencing \\[RNAseq\\] for Myc and CCNE1).\n\nII. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.\n\nIII. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (EET) Biobank at Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of abemaciclib.\n\nPatients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and abemaciclib PO BID on days 8-28 of cycle 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo collection of blood and undergo tumor biopsy on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."

The patient will not be excluded from other aspects of the study\n* Patients may not have received prior CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Previous PARP inhibitor use is allowed in front-line treatment but not for recurrent disease\n* Patients who received chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] grade =\\< 1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except for residual alopecia or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to randomization. A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and randomization (provided the patient did not receive radiotherapy)\n* Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 28 days is required between end of radiotherapy and randomization\n* For agents other than chemotherapy, a 4 week washout period is required.

Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reaction or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to abemaciclib, olaparib or any of the excipients of these products\n* Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting study treatment is 2 weeks. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because abemaciclib is a CDK-inhibiting agent and olaparib is a PARP inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with abemaciclib and olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with abemaciclib and olaparib\n* Other malignancy unless curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \\>= 5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma\n* Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, corrected QT \\[QTcF\\] prolongation \\> 500 ms, electrolyte disturbances, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest, etc.), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML)\n* Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\< 30 ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea)\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery\n* Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT)\n* Patients with an active systemic fungal infection\n* Patients with suspected or history of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis\n* Patients with active thromboembolism. Active thromboembolism is defined as a diagnosis of a thromboembolic within the last 6 months or continued evidence of thromboembolism on imaging despite stable anti-coagulation for 6 months. Patients with a history of thromboembolism \\> 6 months ago on anti-coagulation as continued prevention are eligible",
