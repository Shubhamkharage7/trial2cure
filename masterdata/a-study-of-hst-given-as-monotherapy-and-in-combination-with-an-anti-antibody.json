Upon completion of Part A1, an HST-1011 monotherapy dose optimization will commence (Part A2).\n\nPart B is a dose escalation of HST-1011 given in combination with the standard dose/regimen of cemiplimab. Dosing in Part B may commence prior to the completion of Part A1.\n\nPhase 2 will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of HST-1011 in combination with anti-PD(L)1 antibody or other standard of care therapies."
