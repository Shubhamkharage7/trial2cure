The Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation Community Registry will offer an online portal where participants can self-enroll and directly contribute information about their experience with PF to be compiled into a longitudinal data set for use by researchers.",

Patients with PF, including those who are post lung transplant\n2. Caregivers of patients with PF\n3. Family members of patients with PF\n\nThis is an online registry open to individuals affected by PF in the US. It is not associated with a physical location or institution. Individuals may self-enroll online and contribute data to the Community Registry by answering a series of surveys at regular intervals.\n\nParticipants may also elect to be contacted about future research projects through the PFF Community Registry portal. However, this is not required to participate in the Community Registry itself."
