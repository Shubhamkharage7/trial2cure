Specifically, PREPARED will leverage electronic health record (EHR) technology at clinic visits to: \\[1\\] promote medication reconciliation and safety, \\[2\\] prompt patient-provider preconception counseling and reproductive planning, and \\[3\\] deliver low literacy print tools to reinforce counseling and promote goal-setting for diabetes self-care activities. Post-visit, a widely-available text messaging platforms will be used to: \\[4\\] encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors through goal-setting and daily reminders. Our randomized trial will assess the effectiveness and fidelity of a technology-based strategy to promote preconception care and diabetes self-management among women with type 2 diabetes in primary care.\n\nAim 1: Test the effectiveness of PREPARED, compared to usual care, to improve patient: a) knowledge of reproductive risks associated with T2DM and recommended self-care activities b) engagement in self-care behaviors, including: i) diet, ii) physical activity, iii) adherence to diabetes medications; and use of iv) folic acid, and v) most or moderately effective contraception, when indicated; and c) clinical measures, including hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.\n\nAim 2: Assess whether PREPARED reduces disparities in the above outcomes versus usual care.\n\nAim 3: Evaluate the fidelity of PREPARED to prompt medication reconciliation and preconception counseling, and to deliver patient education and post-visit support of diabetes self-care behaviors."
