            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the validity of the Neural Sleeve gait metrics compared to gait parameters assessed with a Protokinetics Zeno pressure sensitive walkway. The spatiotemporal gait parameters obtained from the Zeno walkway have been rigorously validated and will represent the \"gold standard\" ground truth measurements in the proposed protocol. Confirming the validity of the Neural Sleeve metrics offers benefit to individuals who utilize the device by providing confidence that calculated gait reports are accurate and can be used to inform usage of the device and associated gait changes over time. Findings of innaccuracy would still offer benefit in the form of knowing that the Neural Sleeve metrics need to be used with caution and/or updated to provide correct outcomes to users.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study aims to validate the gait metrics of the Neural Sleeve in healthy adult volunteers. All participants will wear a Neural Sleeve on their dominant leg. The Zeno pressure gait mat will be laid flat on the ground and used for all walking conditions. Overall, participants will perform three, 5 minute walking bouts without electrical stimulation. Two walking conditions will be performed while wearing the Neural Sleeve, however, no electrical stimulation will be utilized. The movement sensors on the Neural Sleeve will collect motion data that permits the comparison of gait metrics from the Sleeve to those measured by the gait mat. During the walking trials participants will be told that they can take a break if needed. Condition order will be randomized and participants will be offered 5 minutes of rest between consecutive trials. Validity of gait metrics of the Neural Sleeve will be compared against the Zeno walkway."

Simultaneously, the Zeno walkway will be operated according to manufacturers instructions. Condition descriptions are as follows:\n\nCondition 1 (normal walking speed): During this condition, participants will be asked to walk at their \"normal, comfortable pace\" for 5 minutes. They will walk back and forth along a 12-meter course with the gait mat in the center of the course.\n\nCondition 2 (fast walking speed): During this condition, participants will be asked to walk, covering as much distance as possible for 5 minutes.
