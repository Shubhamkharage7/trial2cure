            "briefSummary": "About 13% of US adults, some 30 million people, suffer from nasal sinus disease. Although nasal obstruction and smell loss are two of the major symptoms of the disease that are crucial to disease management, currently there is a lack of clinical tools to effectively evaluate the mechanisms contributing to these symptoms. The proposed study aims to develop novel clinical tools to better evaluate and relieve patients' nasal obstructive symptoms and to enable patients and clinicians to make more informed, personalized decisions regarding treatment strategy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nasal sinus disease is one of the most common medical conditions in the US, affecting an estimated 13% of adults, or some 30 million people, and responsible for $5.8 billion in health care expenditures annually (National Health Interview Survey 2009, CDC). Nasal obstruction and smell loss are two of the major symptoms of the disease; however, the field currently lacks a clear, objective understanding of the mechanisms causing these symptoms, which thwarts effective treatment. For example, patients' complaints of nasal obstruction correlate poorly or inconsistently with objective measurements of actual physical obstruction. Without validated clinical tools, the current treatment of these symptoms relies primarily on the patient's subjective feedback and the doctor's personal training and experience, which can lead to inconsistent and unsatisfactory outcomes.\n\nThrough a series of preliminary studies, the investigators demonstrated that the symptom of nasal obstruction may be caused not by obstruction per se but by poor sensing of airflow during breathing or sensing may be worsened by impaired trigeminal function. However, which trigeminal sensory regions and what nasal airflow anomalies are most critical in disrupting the sensing of airflow are still unknown. In Aim 2, the investigators will investigate the efficacy of a novel patent-pending \"nasal aid\" to improve patients' symptoms by modulating nasal airflow and trigeminal sensory feedback and to improve future treatment outcomes based on what the investigators have learned and will continue to learn about the airflow trigeminal perception mechanisms.\n\nThe outcomes from this research may potentially validate several novel clinical tools to better identify factors that most affect patients' obstructive symptoms and to relieve symptoms by modulating nasal airflow patterns. The ultimate goal is to assist patients and clinicians in planning effective, well-informed, personalized treatment strategies, potentially saving millions of healthcare dollars annually while improving patient satisfaction."
