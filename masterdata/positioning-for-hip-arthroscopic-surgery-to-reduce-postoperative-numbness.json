            "briefSummary": "Compared to the knee and shoulder, the hip joint leaves relatively little space to maneuver arthroscopic instruments and camera. To expand the potential space in the hip joint, traction is commonly applied to the operative leg through a perineal post. This is an effective technique to improve the working space for arthroscopy, however it has been associated with complications, including perineal numbness. Traction pads, used alone or with a perineal post, can reduce pressure on the perineal area, thus reducing numbness. The investigators hypothesize that positioning hip arthroscopy patients using a traction pad on a standard traction table with a perineal post will reduce the incidence and duration of postoperative perineal numbness."
