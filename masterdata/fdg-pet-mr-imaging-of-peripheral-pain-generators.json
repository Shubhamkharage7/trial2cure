Identifying the source of pain may help doctors treat chronic pain more effectively. Approximately 128 participants will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for up to 12 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators aim to precisely localize sites of increased inflammation and potentially pain generation and improve understanding of nociception and inflammation using a unique, hybrid PET/MRI approach in conjunction with intravenously, administered fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which has been shown with PET imaging to be an sensitive surrogate marker of inflammation.\n\nThe Primary Objective of this pilot prospective, observational research is to determine whether this approach, which combines PET/MRI and an FDA-approved radiotracer, 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), can accurately localize the sites of painful inflammation in individuals with persistent pain.\n\n* Determine if increased FDG uptake on PET as measured by standard uptake value (SUV) or target-to-background (TTB) measurements is increased in area of pain symptoms when compared to same corresponding areas in healthy, asymptomatic volunteers.\n* Determine whether amount of FDG uptake as measured on PET is able to localize to abnormalities when compared to MR imaging (T2 signal intensity, morphologic aberrations)\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* Verify that the standard administered adult dose of FDG (0.14 mCi/kg/patient) used currently in the clinics can also be used to detect peripheral pain generators.\n* Verify that FDG uptake in asymptomatic, healthy controls will be significantly less than their chronic pain cohorts at the same anatomic location.\n* Determine whether longitudinal FDG PET/MR imaging findings in individual patients directly correlate with symptoms as they evolve over time in joint arthroplasty subjects with PPSP.\n* Determine if FDG PET/MR imaging findings spatially differ between different pain types."
