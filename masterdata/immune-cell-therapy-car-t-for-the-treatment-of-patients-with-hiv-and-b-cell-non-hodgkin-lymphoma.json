            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial evaluates the side effects and usefulness of axicabtagene clioleucel (a CAR-T therapy) and find out what effect, if any, it has on treating patients with HIV-associated aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or not responded to treatment (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. Axicabtagene ciloleucel consists of genetically modified T cells, modified to recognize CD-19, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CD-19-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill CD-19-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To demonstrate safety and feasibility of axicabtagene ciloleucel for relapsed/refractory (R/R) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in participants with well-controlled HIV.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in HIV-associated B-NHL as measured by complete response rate, event-free survival, and duration of response.\n\nII. To assess the relationship between T-cell subset profile and clinical response in R/R HIV-associated B-NHL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the relationship between immune-mediated response and clinical response and toxicity in HIV-associated B-NHL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel.\n\nII. To define burden of HIV integration in the final chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product versus the pheresis product through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5, -4, and -3. Patients then receive axicabtagene ciloleucel IV over 30 minutes on day 0.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up once weekly for month 1, once a month for months 2-6, and then at 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months."

NOTE: Women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before starting conditioning chemotherapy. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because axicabtagene ciloleucel has not been studied in pregnant women. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with axicabtagene ciloleucel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Use of the following:\n\n  * Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids (defined as \\> 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) within 7 days before leukapheresis or 72 hours before axicabtagene ciloleucel administration.

Subjects must have progressive disease in irradiated lesions or have additional non-irradiated, PET-positive lesions to be eligible. However, palliative radiation to a single lesion, if additional non-irradiated PET-positive lesions are present, is allowed up to 2 weeks before leukapheresis\n  * Prior receipt of CAR T-cell therapy\n* Participants with signs or symptoms indicative of active CNS involvement are excluded from the protocol, with the following exceptions: The following patients are included in the protocol:\n\n  * Participants with previously treated CNS involvement by lymphoma or leukemia, who and have no neurologic symptoms and no evidence of active lymphoma or leukemia in the CNS by total spine and brain gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2 weeks before leukapheresis and no neurologic progression prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) infusion\n  * Participants with active CNS involvement and stable neurologic symptoms for at least 3 weeks before leukapheresis and without neurologic progression prior to axi-cel infusion. These patients should have assessment by a total spine and brain gadolinium enhanced MRI within 5 days before axi-cel infusion to document the extent of CNS disease prior to axi-cel infusion. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling for cell count, cytology and cell markers by flow cytometry should also be included within 5 days of axi-cel infusion if previously positive\n* Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =\\< 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Participants are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, including if \\>= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. Use of anabolic steroids is permitted\n* The participant has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE =\\< grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except =\\< grade 2 alopecia, neuropathy, and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs), provided that all other eligibility criteria are met\n* Opportunistic infection within the last 3 months, with the exception of oropharyngeal candidiasis\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to axicabtagene ciloleucel or other agents used in study\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric illness with potential to limit compliance with study requirements",
