After a minimum 28 day washout, they will undergo locoregional therapy per institutional standards. Eventually, after a minimum 72-day washout from the end of immunotherapy, they will undergo liver transplant.\n\nThe primary endpoint is proportion of patients experiencing post-transplant rejection (within 30 days of transplant). A total of 30 patients are to be enrolled, to allow at least 20 transplants for adequate primary endpoint analysis. An interim analysis after 10 patients will be performed to ensure safety. If there are untoward safety signals, study modification/discontinuation will be discussed."
