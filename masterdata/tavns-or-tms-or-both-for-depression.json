            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the research is to test out a combined treatment for depression where the investigators stimulate a nerve in the ear while at the same time stimulate the brain with magnets. These treatments are called transcutaneous (through the skin) auricular (ear) vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) and transcranial (through the skull) magnetic stimulation (TMS). For participants who already have a cervical VNS device, the investigators will not change their treatment and will use this in place of the taVNS. The investigators think this combined method might treat depressive symptoms better than either alone. This study is in person at the Institute of Psychiatry in downtown Charleston on the MUSC campus. First, participants will have a screening session and then will have 6 treatment days total where participants will receive either VNS treatment alone, TMS treatment alone, or both at the same time. The treatment that participants start with will be randomized, and they will have 2 treatment days of each combination."
