Participants will be monitored for changes in ctDNA in the blood over time received during capecitabine treatment. Results of ctDNA analysis will be correlated to genetic characteristics of individual tumors. This may inform future clinical trials in which patients could receive a different treatment than capecitabine to reduce their risk of breast cancer relapse.",
