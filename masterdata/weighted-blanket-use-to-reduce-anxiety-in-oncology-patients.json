            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial compares the effect of using weighted blankets versus regular blankets during first time infusions (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted therapy etc.) to decrease adverse side effects such as anxiety and distress in cancer (oncology) patients. Feeling safe, comforted, and grounded in the world are some of the benefits noted by individuals who use weighted blankets. Deep touch pressure (DTP) has been found to reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety and is defined as a sensation one feels when being hugged, squeezed, or held. DTP affects the nervous system by creating a calming effect which may lower stress and increase feelings of well-being. The use of weighted blankets may help to manage anxiety and distress during chemotherapy or immunotherapy infusions.",

To assess the efficacy of weighted blankets on distress in patients receiving infusion therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients use a weighted blanket for 30 minutes during the infusion appointment.\n\nARM II: Patients use a regular blanket for 30 minutes per standard of care during the infusion appointment."
