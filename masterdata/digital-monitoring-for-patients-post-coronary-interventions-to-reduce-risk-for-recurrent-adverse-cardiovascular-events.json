            "briefSummary": "The study aims to support patients immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by implementing a telemonitoring program. Eligible patients have coronary heart disease and undergo PCI. The intervention group receives remote monitoring and text-based follow-up, with established health goals and education on using the telemonitoring application, along with necessary devices. The control group gets standard care. Outcomes measured include blood pressure, LDL levels, patient satisfaction, revascularization, and mortality. The study findings will enhance patient care after PCI and contribute evidence for widespread telemonitoring implementation in healthcare systems, aiding medical therapy and lifestyle modifications.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study involves 200 participants divided into intervention and control groups, all diagnosed with coronary heart disease and treated with PCI. Upon discharge, the intervention group receives remote monitoring, text messages, and devices for self-management. Control group receives standard care. Recruitment is from cardiology and primary care clinics, with interpreters available. Study coordinator guides device setup during enrollment. Intervention group receives daily messages for a week, then weekly reminders and counseling. Messages are in English or Spanish as per preference. Patient data is collected, including demographics, medications, and outcomes such as blood pressure and readmission rates. Satisfaction is evaluated through surveys and interviews."
