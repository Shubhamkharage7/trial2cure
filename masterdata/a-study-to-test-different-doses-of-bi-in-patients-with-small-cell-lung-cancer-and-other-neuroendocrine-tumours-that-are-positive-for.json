The study is in people with advanced cancer for whom previous treatment was not successful or no standard treatment exists.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 764532 and the best treatment schedule that people can tolerate. BI 764532 is an antibody-like molecule (DLL3/CD3 bispecific) that may help the immune system fight cancer. In this study, BI 764532 is given to people for the first time. That means no clinical data are available for BI 764532.\n\nParticipants get BI 764532 either weekly or once every 3 weeks. If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given for a maximum of 3 years. During this time, participants visit the study site about 20 times depending on the response to the treatment. Doctors record any unwanted effects and regularly check the general health of the participants."
