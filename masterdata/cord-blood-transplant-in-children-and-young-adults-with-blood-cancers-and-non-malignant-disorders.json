Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) at high-risk of relapse or progression if not in remission:\n\n* Eligible patients with aggressive histology (such as, but not limited to, diffuse large B-cell NHL, mantle cell NHL, and T-cell histology) in CR.\n* Eligible patients with indolent B cell NHL (such as, but not limited to, follicular, small cell or marginal zone NHL) will have 2nd or subsequent progression with stable disease/ CR/ PR with no single lesion equal to or more than 5 cm.\n* Eligible patients with HL will be those without progression of disease (POD) after salvage chemotherapy with no single lesion \u2265 5 cm.\n\nVI.

If serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then CrCl \\> 50 mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated or estimated) or GFR (mL/min/1.72m2) \\>30% of predicted normal for age.\n\nNormal GFR in Children and Young Adults (Age) : Mean GFR +- SD (mL/min/1.73 m2)\n\n1 week: 40.6 + / - 14.8 2-8 weeks: 65.8 + / - 24.8 \\>8 weeks: 95.7 + / - 21.7 2-12 years: 133.0 + / - 27.0 13-21 years (males): 140.0 + / - 30.0 13-21 years (females: 126.0 + / - 22.0\n\nGFR, glomerular filtration rate; SD, standard deviation greater than 2 years old: Normal GFR is 100 mL/ min. Infants: GFR must be corrected for body surf ace area.\n\nFor metabolic diseases: disease status to be evaluated according to EBMT Handbook \\[45\\].\n\nGraft Criteria\n\nCB units will be selected according to the current MSKCC unit selection algorithm. High resolution 8 allele HLA typing and recipient HLA antibody profile will be performed. Cord unit selection will occur based on HLA-match, total nucleated cell (TNC) and CD34+ cell dose adjusted per patient body weight. The cord bank of origin will also be considered. Donor specific HLA antibodies, if present, will also be taken into consideration and may influence the selection of the graft. CB graft will consist of one or two CB units (CBU) based on MSKCC selection algorithm.\n\n* Each CB unit must be at least 3/8 HLA-matched to the patient considering high-resolution 8-allele HLA typing.\n* For malignant diseases follow MSKCC CBU selection algorithm\n* For non-malignant diseases, CBU will be required to have \\> 5 x 107 TNC/kg; high HLA allele level match is preferable\n\nParticipant Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inadequate performance status/ organ function.\n* Advanced metabolic disease (EBMT handbook).\n* Active CNS leukemic involvement.\n* Indolent NHL or Hodgkin lymphoma with progression of disease after most recent salvage chemotherapy.\n* Diagnosis of myelofibrosis or other malignancy with moderate-severe bone marrow fibrosis.\n* Autologous stem cell transplant within the preceding 6 months.\n* Any prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n* Active and uncontrolled infection (bacterial/fungal/viral) at time of transplantation.\n* HIV infection.\n* Seropositivity for HTLV-1.\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding.\n* Patient or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the treatment protocol including appropriate supportive care, long-term follow-up, and research tests.",
