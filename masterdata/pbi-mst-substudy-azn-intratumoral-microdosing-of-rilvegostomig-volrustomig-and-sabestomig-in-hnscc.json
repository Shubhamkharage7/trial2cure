PD effects due to injected investigational agents will be compared to those elicited by pembrolizumab alone, which will also be injected in microdose quantities via the CIVO device.",
            "detailedDescription": "The CIVO Microdose Injection Device (MID) simultaneously delivers multiple drugs and drug combinations (Up to 8), each in microdose amounts, into a single patient tumor and enables comparisons of the resulting biomarker responses that occurred while that tumor was still in the native microenvironment. AstraZeneca is developing three novel assets: rilvegostomig, volrustomig, and sabestomig, all of which are bispecific monoclonal antibodies designed to stimulate antitumor immunity. In this Phase 0 clinical trial, the PD effects of these investigational assets in the TME of patients presenting with HNSCC will be evaluated. These investigational assets will be injected alone in microdose quantities at tumor sites in HNSCC patients. Pembrolizumab, also used therapeutically in this patient population, will be included in the CIVO injection array administered as a single agent. The CIVO-injected portion of the tissue will be analyzed for localized response at sites of drug exposure in the TME."

Female patients who:\n\n   * Are postmenopausal for at least one year before the screening visit, OR\n   * Are surgically sterile, OR\n   * Are of childbearing potential who agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) until 150 days after the CIVO injection OR agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\n   * Agree to refrain from donating, or retrieving for their own use, ova until 150 days after the CIVO injection.\n   * Agree to refrain from breastfeeding until 150 days after the CIVO injection.\n8. Male patients, even if surgically sterile (i.e., status post-vasectomy), who:\n\n   * Agree to practice effective barrier contraception from the time of signing the ICF until 150 days after the CIVO injection OR agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\n   * Agree to refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm until 150 days after the CIVO injection.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Tumors and/or effaced nodes that are anticipated by the Investigator to lack a sufficient volume of viable tumor tissue (Based on available pre-operative imaging, pre-injection ultrasound imaging, or pathology reports) for CIVO microdose injection due to necrosis, cysts, excessive stroma, fibrosis, or treatment-induced tissue changes.\n2. Tumors near or involving critical structures for which, in the opinion of the treating clinician, injection would pose undue risk to the patient.\n3. Prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy including, but not limited to, other anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-PD-L2 antibodies within the last 5 years.\n4. Patients with concurrent cancer, immune disease or active infection requiring systemic or radiotherapy.\n5. Female patients who:\n\n   * Intend to become pregnant during the study,\n   * Are both lactating and breastfeeding, OR\n   * Have a positive beta-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at screening verified by the Investigator.\n6. Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness, condition, serious medical or psychiatric illness, or circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with adherence to the study's procedures or requirements, or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.\n7. History of organ transplant.\n8. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to injection: subject must have adequate wound healing and have recovered from any prior surgery.",
