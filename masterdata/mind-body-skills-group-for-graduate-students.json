This group incorporates a holistic approach to wellness through meditation and mindfulness practices, guided imagery, breath and body awareness, and relaxation techniques. Mind-body approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing stress mood symptoms and improving quality of life. The study hypothesis is that the Mind-Body Skills taught in the group will reduce mood symptoms in graduate and medical students.",

This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial; participants will be randomized to the intervention or control group. The control group will receive Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) and mind-body skills reading materials.\n\nPrimary Objective: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of an I-MBS-G intervention for medical graduate students using the MBSG Feedback Program Questionnaire.\n\nSecondary Objectives: Assess preliminary effectiveness of I-MBS-G on anxiety symptoms (i.e., improvements on anxiety symptoms)\n\nExploratory Objectives: Assess preliminary effectiveness of I-MBS-G on depression symptoms (i.e., improvements on depression symptoms)"
