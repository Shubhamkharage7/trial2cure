            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates earlier symptom management through remote electronic symptom monitoring (such as through an app on patient's phone), and accessibility of palliative care self-referral by patients with thoracic cancer and caregivers by proxy (legal representative). Thoracic cancer occurs in the chest and often causes symptoms for patients. Patients and/or their caregivers are often unable to attend in-person clinic visits for various reasons. The most frequently reported symptom by patients at initial palliative care consultations is pain, and caregivers' most common concerns are pain management for the patient, stress reduction, and fears about patient decline. Earlier palliative care referral can help control these symptoms before they worsen, providing a better quality of life for patients and caregivers. improve physical and emotional functioning for patients and caregivers in cancer care. This study may help researchers learn how an electronic symptom monitoring program may provide an earlier and more accessible way for patients with thoracic cancer to receive palliative care.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Develop and assess feasibility of a remote electronic symptom monitoring program with a prompted option for palliative care self-referral for patients or caregivers by proxy after diagnosis of a thoracic malignancy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate palliative care referral patterns after implementation of a remote electronic symptom monitoring program.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients and their caregivers use the electronic symptom monitoring program to log symptoms once a week (QW) for 24 weeks. Patients and their caregivers also watch a video and review education materials prior to starting the remote symptom monitoring program.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, participants are followed up to 2 years."
