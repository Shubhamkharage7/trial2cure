By collecting, organizing, and analyzing data for a group of participants over time, researchers will use information to learn more about these topics. This study will collect long-term information about study participants, developing a lean, participant-centric approach to curating meaningful longitudinal data that incorporate participant perspectives including quality of life and personal beauty health preferences. This should allow researchers to understand how participant skin health changes over time and what factors can in\ufb02uence those changes with a speci\ufb01c focus on participant-centric learning.\n\nAdditionally, this study will look for ways to develop and/or improve data handling approaches to increase the depth, generalizability, and/or longitudinality of skin health and beauty data based on approaches that decrease burden, as appropriate, over time (eg, for study participants, investigators, clinical research stakeholders)"
