            "briefSummary": "Early atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents an important time window in the course of so far untreatable atrophic AMD, as patients typically experience only some degree of visual dysfunction, while being at significant risk for marked further loss of vision. To allow the precise evaluation of upcoming therapeutic interventions, a better understanding of the manifestation and variable disease progression is needed. This project aims to investigate refined tools to detect and monitor early atrophic AMD more accurately, including the impact on visual dysfunction and quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will focus on a previously largely under-explored but highly relevant time window in progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), i.e., 'early atrophic AMD'. We postulate that a therapeutic effect in early atrophic AMD would probably save a large proportion of patients from progressive visual function loss and that it seems more justifiable to risk interventions in this time window than in earlier AMD stages. Against this background, a comprehensive knowledge of the natural disease progression in this potential therapeutic margin is essential. We will implement innovative multimodal high-resolution retinal imaging, comprehensive functional testing, and assessment of vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) combined with standardized and exploratory analysis strategies in a prospective, longitudinal study. This will enable the investigators to characterize and quantify the microstructural changes and associated functional and VRQoL deficits in eyes with early atrophic lesions with unprecedented accuracy. Knowledge of the strongest risk factors for accelerated disease progression will allow identification of patients at highest risk for visual function loss. Moreover, the investigator's hypothesis on disease-stage specific risk-factors may guide selection of therapeutic targets that are particularly susceptible in early atrophic AMD. Tailoring therapeutics to specific phenotypes and disease stages may be key to prevent irreversible vision loss and the associated reduced quality of life in patients with AMD."
