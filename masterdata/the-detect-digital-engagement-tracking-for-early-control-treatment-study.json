This app-based platform will allow people to:\n\n* Provide informed consent electronically\n* Donate robust smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported data.\n* Sensor-collected data, which will vary between devices, but what is shared will always be entirely up to the participant. Investigators anticipate a minimum to include heart rate and activity, plus sleep duration when available.\n\n  * This can include historical data collected by a sensor prior to the participants date of joining the study.\n* Occasional survey-based participant-reported outcomes (PROs).\n* Participant-entered physiologic data such as oral temperature\n* Passively share environmental data such as air quality and weather that will be captured from external sources based on participants' \"home\" zip code. Optionally, if the participant consents to enable location/GPS services on their smartphone, higher grain environmental data will be enabled.\n* Optionally connect to and share their electronic health record (EHR) data in the event they have an event that requires interaction with a health care provider"
