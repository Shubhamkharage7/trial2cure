            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the immediate use of steroids after surgery for accelerated discharge in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and neuromuscular scoliosis after a posterior spinal fusion.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer are:\n\n* What are the effects of using steroids immediately after surgery in decreasing opioid use and helping early mobilization(movement)?\n* Does post-operative steroid use affect the incidence of wound complications and are there any long-term impacts on scar formation?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Fill out a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) survey specifically for pain interference and physical activity observing health related quality of life at enrollment, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years\n* Have clinical photos of their incision at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years\n\n  * Their photos will be assessed using the stony book scar evaluation scale\n* For treatment of their scoliosis, patients will undergo a posterior spinal fusion (PSF) per standard of care, however whether the participant receives or does not receive steroids is what the investigators are trying to understand.\n* Researchers will compare no immediate postoperative steroid (NS) to the group with immediate postoperative steroid (WS) group to see if there are changes in opioid use, wound complications, scar formation, and facilitation in early mobilization.",
            "detailedDescription": "Children remain a vulnerable population historically known to be undertreated and underrecognized for their pain, only perpetuating the complexity of managing pain control in this cohort. Children's Hospital of Los Angeles conducted a study observing patient and family's perioperative perception regarding their posterior spinal fusion and found that pain control is a primary concern, however, surgeons did not share the sentiment. Opioids were primarily the medication of choice with dentists and surgeons accounting for approximately two-thirds of opioid prescriptions. However, with the rise of the national opioid crisis and its adverse effects not limited to addiction, providers are gravitating towards alternative multidisciplinary use of medication to manage pain.\n\nThough steroids were formerly used for surgical patients, concerns regarding increased surgical site infection and wound healing complications were of major concern. However, to the investigators knowledge, these issues have only been documented with chronic steroid use. The impact of immediate use of steroids postoperatively for accelerated discharge has gained momentum in the literature with its demonstration in facilitating earlier mobility, decreased pain scores, and decreased narcotic usage. A retrospective study suggested that post-operative dexamethasone administration can have the positive effect of reducing opioid use in pediatric PSF patients without increasing wound complications.\n\nThe proposed study aims to rigorously observe the effects of post operative steroid use in its facilitation in early mobilization in adolescent PSF patients, while also understanding the incidence of wound complications and long-term scar formation. Should the randomized controlled trial align with the literature, the implementation of post-operative steroids could potentially alter standard of care for adolescent PSF patients."
