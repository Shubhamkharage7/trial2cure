Each year the entering 1st year medical residents at Hershey Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center will be taught to perform these procedures using the DHRT or the DHRT+ devices. The resident's performance will be measured and evaluated by these devices during the training. The technique of the training does not differ from what is currently taught at either of these institutions. In addition the residents will be required to pass the same skills assessment currently required at their institution. Upon successfully passing the skills assessment the residents will perform CVC interventions on under supervision. During this supervision the attending will fill out a short survey about the residents performance. After the procedure the investigators will examine patient files to determine any changes in central line related complications and infection rates due to new clinical educational practices."
