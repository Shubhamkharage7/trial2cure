CT/Imaging or Transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) follow-up will occur at 45 days and TEE at 1-year.\n\nThe LAmbre PlusTM Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure System is intended to reduce the risk of thromboembolism from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who:\n\n* Are at increased risk for stroke and systemic embolism based on CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores and are recommended for oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy; AND\n* Are deemed by their physician to be suitable for OAC; AND\n* Have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacological alternative to OAC, taking into account the safety and effectiveness of the device compared to OAC"

Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to index procedure per site standard test\n2. Patients with atrial fibrillation that is defined by a single occurrence, or that is transient or reversible (e.g., secondary to CABG, an interventional procedure, pneumonia, or hyperthyroidism)\n3. Patients who require long-term anticoagulation/DAPT for a condition other than atrial fibrillation\n4. Patients not suitable for short term oral anti-coagulation (including due to bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or absolute contraindication to OAC or DAPT ) or who will refuse transfusion\n5. Patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease, known severe aortic stenosis requiring surgical or percutaneous valve replacement, or existing mechanical valve prosthesis\n6. Active infection with bacteremia\n7.
