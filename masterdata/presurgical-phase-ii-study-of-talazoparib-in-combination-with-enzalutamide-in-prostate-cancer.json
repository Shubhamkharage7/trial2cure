Patients with active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease.\n11. Patients with active pneumonitis or extensive bilateral lung disease of non-malignant etiology.\n12. Patients with seizures or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizures (e.g., prior stroke or transient ischemic attack within 1 year to randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation, Schwannoma, meningioma, or other benign CNS or meningeal disease which may require treatment with surgery or radiation therapy).\n13. Patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina or myocardial infarction, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft or repair, clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the 6 months prior to randomization.\n14. Persistently uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or HIV infection.\n15. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure \\>160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure \\>95 mmHg) despite antihypertensive medication, or prior history of hypertensive encephalopathy.\n16. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation).\n17. Anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than as outlined by the protocol.\n18.
