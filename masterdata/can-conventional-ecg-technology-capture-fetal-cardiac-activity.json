            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to determine if it is feasible to capture a fetal ECG signal using a Holter ECG device. As comparison we will use a standard Doppler Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) device. To obtain the raw FHR data from this standard device we will use the currently approved \"fetal EEG\" monitor. The important distinction is that \"fetal EEG\" monitor will not be connected to fetal scalp electrode, but, rather, get the data from the regular, more routinely used and non-invasive Doppler FHR monitor. We expect that we will be able to validate our algorithm with our maternal and fetal ECG channels to derive the FHR.\n\nWe will attach a Holter ECG device (4 electrodes) and a standard Doppler FHR device to a pregnant woman who is between 32 weeks gestation and full term. ECG leads will be placed in four corners of the abdomen. The targeted length of the recording will be 30 minutes. The subject will remain supine and resting while the device is recording. Additionally, the recently approved fetal EEG monitor will be connected to the Doppler FHR device to allow us to obtain a \"digital copy\" of the standard FHR recording. We will do that in order to have the comparison during the offline processing of the abdominal ECG with regard to the location of the fetal R peaks. This procedure will be done after the subject's routine antepartum testing. No women in active labor will be recruited."

Frasch, Hau-tieng Wu (Submitted on 7 Feb 2017) There is a need for affordable, widely deployable maternal-fetal ECG monitors to improve maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and delivery. Based on the diffusion-based channel selection, here we present the mathematical formalism and clinical validation of an algorithm capable of accurate separation of maternal and fetal ECG from a two channel signal acquired over maternal abdomen.
