During this clinical study, the single-use, disposable Endolumik Gastric Calibration Tube will be used during twenty sleeve gastrectomy operations and gastric bypass operations.",
            "detailedDescription": "Endolumik Inc. has developed a fluorescence-guided calibration device, the Endolumik Gastric Calibration Tube, to improve visualization during bariatric operations. The present pilot study will be a First In Human Clinical Trial to evaluate the Endolumik Gastric Calibration Tube and associated methods in a human clinical cohort of 20-30 bariatric patients at two high-volume bariatric programs. During this clinical study, the single-use, disposable Endolumik Gastric Calibration Tube will be used during twenty sleeve gastrectomy operations and gastric bypass operations. The goal of the present study is to confirm that the Endolumik Gastric Calibration Tube performs similar to predicate devices currently on the market, as well as to get end-user feedback prior to submitting a 510(k) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nIn this multicenter trial, both study sites are certified as Bariatric Centers of Excellence through the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. The first clinical site is Ruby Memorial Hospital, part of West Virginia University; the second clinical site is Durham Regional Hospital, part of Duke University.\n\nTo date, using funding from a West Virginia Clinical \\& Translational Science Institute Launch Pilot Grant, our team has validated the device and associated methods of fluorescence-guided sleeve gastrectomy and fluorescence-guided gastric bypass in ex-vivo and in-vivo porcine models, as well as human cadaveric tissue models. Based on FDA criteria, this investigational device meets the definition of a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) device; the risk classification document is included with submission materials.\n\nThe investigational device provided will have met design controls per FDA code of federal regulation (CFR): 21 CFR 820.30. Endolumik Inc. will serve as the industry sponsor for this study and will donate the devices being used for the protocol to the two participating study sites. Development of the technology in this research is supported by the West Virginia University Department of Surgery."
