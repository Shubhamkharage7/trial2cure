The gut microbiome plays an important role in autoimmunity, including MS. However, the identity of gut microbes modulating neuroinflammation in MS and their mechanisms of action remain obscure. Hence, here the research team proposes to investigate the effects of vancomycin on the gut microbiota composition, peripheral immune function, and brain MRI lesions in MS patients."
