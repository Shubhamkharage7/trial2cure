            "briefSummary": "Community mobility is critical for living independently and engaging in one's community. It is especially important for people in their early adult years, as this is often a time of transition to employment and living independently. Community mobility can be particularly challenging for adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (henceforth referred to as autistic adults based on the preferred identity-first language of our autistic partners). Some autistic adults are unable to meet the demands of driving. Public transportation is an option for autistic adults; and autistic adults are more likely to use public transportation than their non-autistic counterparts. However, using public transportation may be just as challenging as driving for the autistic population. Rideshare (also called ride-hailing) is a relatively new form of transportation in which passengers get from point A to point B in private vehicles driven by their owners. A digital app, usually accessed on a smartphone, matches passengers and drivers, coordinates routes using a GPS system, and facilitates payment through a linked financial account. Rideshare has the potential to address many of the issues autistic adults have accessing the community. It is faster and more direct than the public train or bus, there is limited social interaction required, and rides can be scheduled at any time. Despite it's potential to increase transportation in autistic adults, there are no evidence-based training programs to support Rideshare use in this population.",
            "detailedDescription": "Rideshare services are widely adopted across the globe and provide a safer, more flexible, and less taxing transportation option for many individuals. Rideshare can help people to get to more places they want to go and allows for spontaneity since a ride can be arranged in the moment, at any time of day. Rideshare picks passengers up and drops them off at their specific destination, eliminating the need to walk to bus stops, wait at stations, or transfer to more than one bus or train. Not only does this save time, it may increase safety especially at night or during inclement weather. Rideshare may also be more reliable for getting to work on time. Finally, while communicating with the driver may be a challenge, there is only one person with which to interact versus potentially many people waiting at stations or on the bus or train.\n\nWhile the use of Rideshare has the potential to improve community access and expand occupational engagement for autistic adults, few training resources exist to introduce clients to this mode of transportation, assess readiness, or build confidence. Our Rideshare training program has proven feasible to conduct with autistic adults living in an urban-based semi-structured independent housing residence. This study will test the effectiveness and implementation of the SRP program in a wider range of autistic adults living in the central Virginia region"
