            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to use non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with active listening therapy to treat tinnitus and hyperacusis and related conditions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Tinnitus is characterized by the subjective perception of sound in the ears or in the brain without external stimulus. In about 30-50% of patients, tinnitus co-occurs with hyperacusis, which is abnormal sensitivity to sounds even at low levels. Chronic tinnitus and hyperacusis can be devastating since a significant proportion of sufferers develop sleep disturbances, psychiatric conditions, and a small fraction commit suicide. Tinnitus is often accompanied by difficulty concentrating and impairment on tasks that require sustained attention and executive control. Currently there is no satisfactory treatment for tinnitus and hyperacusis, contributing to patients' distress. Thus, there is an urgent need for interventions that would suppress the symptoms and possibly cure the disorder. Although, the pathophysiology of tinnitus and hyperacusis is not well understood, neurobiological research suggests that tinnitus and hyperacusis can be attributed to maladaptive neuroplasticity triggered by damage in the auditory system. Most symptoms of tinnitus have been attributed to the hyperactivity and reorganization in the auditory cortex (AC) and dorsolateral prefrontal brain regions (DLPFC). This suggests that electrical stimulation to the abnormally activated regions might modulate these overactive regions and reduce tinnitus and hyperacusis. TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique that uses weak electric currents (1-2 mA) applied to the scalp to modulate brain responsiveness by temporarily altering neuronal resting membrane potentials. It is proposed that this approach has a potential therapeutic value in treating tinnitus and hyperacusis.\n\nOur proposed project examines whether application of tDCS to AC and DLPFC combined with active listening therapy serves to promote adaptive neuroplasticity and reduce subjective perception of sound and emotional distress.\n\nThe Aims are to: (1) Determine whether tDCS can lead to significant improvement in tinnitus and hyperacusis symptoms pre- versus post-stimulation and\n\n(2) Examine electrophysiological responses and functional connectivity in the fronto-temporal-parietal network of brain regions in response to tDCS vs. sham.\n\nThe expected outcomes from this research will provide evidence to support the design and implementation of individualized tDCS protocols to potentiate treatment protocols that address the core deficits in tinnitus and hyperacusis. Our data will contribute to a more detailed understanding of the neurobiology of tinnitus and the mechanisms that contribute to the subjective, emotional and cognitive symptoms. The results of our study have a potential to develop effective treatment for the rehabilitation of tinnitus and contribute to the clinical practice.\n\nSummary of study sequence and procedures:\n\nWeek 1: Baseline screening, hearing assessment, tinnitus assessment (2 hours), one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (45minutes), one electrophysiology recording (EEG-ERP)( 1 hour) Weeks 2-4: tDCS with active listening therapy Part 1\n\n* 2 weeks of 1-hour sessions using non-invasive brain stimulation paired with active listening therapy\n\nWeeks 5 and 6: rest-period, post-treatment assessment, one MRI scan (45 min), one EEG-ERP session (1hour)\n\nWeeks 7 to 9: tDCS with active listening therapy Part 2 (1 hour each sessions)\n\n* 2 weeks of 1-hour sessions using non-invasive brain stimulation paired with active listening therapy\n\nWeeks 10 and 12: rest period and post-treatment assessment one MRI scan (45 min), one EEG-ERP session (1hour)\n\nWeek 18: 2-month follow-up, tinnitus assessment, one MRI scan (45 min), one EEG-ERP session (1 hour)"
