Researchers will compare those receiving the usual treatment to those receiving the usual treatment plus hand mobility and grip strengthening exercises.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of simple hand mobility and grip strengthening exercises to the usual care for upper extremity lymphedema will reduce limb volume and improve the quality of life, hand dexterity, and grip strength for those experiencing early, moderate, or late stage breast cancer-related lymphedema.\n\nThis study is an experimental clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of hand mobility and grip exercises on limb volume, quality of life, hand dexterity, and grip strength in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema. The two independent variables are group, a between-subject factor, and time, a within subject factor. There are two levels of the independent variable of group: (1)usual care plus hand exercises and (2) usual care alone. The independent variable of time will be assessed at three timepoints: initial to 4 weeks, 4 to 8 weeks, and initial to 8 weeks of intervention. The four dependent variables are: (1) upper limb volume, (2) quality of life, (3) hand dexterity, and (4) grip strength. If a relationship (r\\>0.5) is found between any of the dependent variables, MANOVA will used for analysis. If no relationship is found, a 2x3 mixed ANOVA will be used to analyze each dependent variable without a significant relationship to the others. The comparison group will receive the usual physical or occupational therapy treatment, including compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage, shoulder and scapular muscle exercises, and education regarding skin hygiene and monitoring. The experimental group will receive the usual treatment plus additional hand mobility and grip strengthening exercises."
