Participants who will be treated or are currently being treated with CBCT-guided photon therapy for prostate or prostate-bed, abdomen head and neck, or pelvic cancers, or with CBCT-guided proton therapy for prostate or prostate bed cancer.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Metallic implants in the CBCT scan volume, such as hip prostheses or spine stabilization hardware. Dental implants, filings, or fiducial markers may be acceptable, and the decision for inclusion/exclusion will be on a case-by-case basis, by reviewing prior CT images of the study candidate. Patient's prior CT images will be reviewed by the PI.\n2. Patients who do not have the ability to lie still for the duration of his/her CBCT imaging and treatment should be excluded. If image artifacts in prior scans are deemed excessive, the patient will be excluded from the study.\n3. Known pregnancy. (Per SOC, a pregnancy test will be performed prior to CBCT scan on Day 1. At this time, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) will receive a pregnancy test to re-confirm eligibility).\n\n   * Women of child-bearing potential are described as:\n\nAge 55 or younger who have not had a negative pregnancy test within 3 days.
