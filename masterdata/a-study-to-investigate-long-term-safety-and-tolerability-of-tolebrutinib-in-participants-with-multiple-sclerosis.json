If on teriflunomide, and benefiting and recommended by the Investigator, the participant may opt to continue teriflunomide outside of the LTS17043 study, if clinically appropriate. If on tolebrutinib, the participant will continue tolebrutinib.\n* All participants from one of the Phase 3 progressive MS studies will start OL tolebrutinib.\n* If a participant already started OL tolebrutinib in the Phase 3 parent study this will be continued.\n* RMS participants who are not eligible for OL tolebrutinib per Health Authority and/or ethics committee decisions on the study conduct (ie, partial hold on initiation of tolebrutinib) will continue their parent study treatment assignment as per their randomization from the parent study.\n\nThe treatment duration per participant will be approximately 3 years of OL tolebrutinib."
