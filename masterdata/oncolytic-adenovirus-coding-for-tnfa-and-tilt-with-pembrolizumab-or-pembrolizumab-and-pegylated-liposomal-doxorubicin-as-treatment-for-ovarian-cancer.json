Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT): \u22642.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u22645 \u00d7 ULN for participants with liver metastases)\n* Patients must be willing to use adequate forms of contraception from screening, during the trial, and for a minimum of 120 days after end of treatment, in accordance with the following:\n\n  i. Women of childbearing potential: Barrier contraceptive method (i.e. condom) must be used in addition to one of the following methods: Intrauterine devices or hormonal contraception (oral contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, vaginal rings or long-acting injections). ii.

Both phase I and phase Ib parts: Treated with any anti-cancer therapy within 30 days prior to the first virus injection. Anti-cancer therapy is defined as anti cancer agents (e.g. surgery, chemotherapy, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, biological therapies, hormonal therapies, radiation, etc.). Continuation of hormonal therapy or use of bone modifying agents (e.g. bisphosphonate or denosumab) is allowed if started at least 3 months before.\n  2. Phase Ib part: Prior oncolytic viruses, immune checkpoint inhibitors or anthracyclines (eg. doxorubicin, liposomal doxorubicin, epirubicin or any other anthracycline formulations).\n* Participants must have recovered from all Adverse Events (AE)s due to previous therapies to \u2264Grade 1or baseline.

If the participant had major surgery, the participant must have recovered adequately from the procedure and/or any complications from the surgery prior to starting study intervention.\n* Treated with a prior radiotherapy, including for palliative purposes, within 2 weeks of start of study treatment (before or after). Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u22642 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-Central Nervous System (CNS) disease.

An investigational agent is any drug or therapy that is currently not approved for use in humans. Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n* Uncontrolled cardiac or vascular diseases.\n* History of myocardial infarction or cerebral stroke within the previous 12 months before screening or is not sufficiently recovered from an older infarction or cerebral stroke.\n* History of severe hepatic dysfunction.\n* History of hepatitis B (defined as HBsAg reactive), Hepatitis C (defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) and/or HIV.

Women of childbearing potential who has a positive urine pregnancy test (within 72 hours) prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 5 years. Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n* Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 3 months by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n* Allergy to ingredients present in the investigational medicinal products (ingredients are listed in the protocol) ie. severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n* Known contraindications to pembrolizumab.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.
