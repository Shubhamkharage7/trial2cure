The secondary objective of the investigation is to evaluate the feasibility of continuous measurement of heart rate and arrhythmia using an implantable loop recorder (LUX-Dx\u2122) during the interstage period.\n\nAn implantable loop recorder will be placed at the time of chest closure following stage 1 palliation (either at the time of index surgery or delayed). The device will be placed in a subclavicular pouch through the existing sternotomy incision. Participants will be in the study for 6 months to 3 years."
