            "briefSummary": "At the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) World Trade Center Health Program, 36% of participants in the low dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening program are current smokers, despite referral to the free FDNY Tobacco Cessation Program (Standard Care). Investigators propose testing an Enhanced Care program which includes opt-out enrollment; tobacco cessation counseling will be individually tailored to spirometry/LDCT results and treatment with varenicline starting 4 weeks prior to their target quit date. This randomized trial will compare enrollment and cessation outcomes in Standard Care vs. Enhanced Care groups of challenging-to-treat, high-risk smokers.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal of this Randomized Controlled trial is to develop and test an effective, scalable intervention with potential to reach high-risk smokers undergoing CT lung cancer screening who have not engaged in or succeeded with traditional tobacco treatment approaches. The investigators will test an Enhanced Care intervention specifically designed to address multiple challenges to tobacco treatment engagement and success. First, the researchers will test opt-out enrollment in cessation treatment. The current tobacco treatment default, in which patients must opt-in to cessation treatment and are only offered counseling and pharmacotherapy when deemed ready to quit, results in missed opportunities to engage smokers into treatment. Previous studies of opt-out enrollment in cessation treatment suggest that an opt-out tobacco treatment strategy substantially increases engagement and cessation rates compared with traditional opt-in approaches. Second, proactive counseling will leverage the \"reachable, teachable moment\" of CT screening to motivate cessation through individually tailored messaging tied to CT results and lung function spirometry. Using CT results as a motivational tool has shown promise in pilot studies. The optimal approach and success of using CT coupled with spirometry results to motivate tobacco cessation remains unknown. Third, investigators will offer varenicline pre-loading to all enrollees, regardless of study arm, in which varenicline is initiated 4 weeks prior to target quit date. This approach is associated with decreased pre-quit tobacco-associated reward and double the rate of abstinence compared with standard varenicline treatment.\n\nThe investigators thus propose a randomized trial among retired FDNY World Trade Center Health Program responders eligible for the FDNY World Trade Center Health Program CT screening program to test the effects of Enhanced Care (opt-out enrollment, tailored counseling based on CT and spirometry results, and varenicline with preloading) against Standard Care (opt-in enrollment, standard cessation counseling without spirometry/CT tailoring, and varenicline with preloading) in the engagement of high-risk smokers in cessation treatment and the achievement of tobacco abstinence."
