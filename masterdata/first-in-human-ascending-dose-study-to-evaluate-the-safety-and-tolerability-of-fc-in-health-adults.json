The clinical trial will be conducted in two parts, initially a SAD study in 3-sequential cohorts of healthy adult participants (PartA), and then follows another SAD study in 4-6-sequential cohorts of patients with ALS (Part B). Dose escalation in the SAD cohorts will be determined after having reviewed of the interim safety data as well as all available PK and/or PD data from the preceding dose level(s)."
