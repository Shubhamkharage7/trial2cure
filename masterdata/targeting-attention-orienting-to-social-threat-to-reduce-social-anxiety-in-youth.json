One-half of participants will receive 8 sessions of computer administered ABMT and the other half of participants will receive 8 sessions of computer administered Neutral Control Task (NCT). The investigators hypothesize that a biomarker of attention to social threat measured using electroencephalography (EEG) and ratings of social anxiety severity will be lower in participants who receive ABMT compared to participants who receive NCT."
