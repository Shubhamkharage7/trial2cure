We plan to enroll 144 clinic staff participants from 48 primary care practices\n\nSpecific aim 1 (primary aim) will compare the effect of learning collaborative (LC) participation, performance incentives (PI), or their combination, with practice facilitation (PF) only, on implementation of evidence-based screening for SUDs.\n\nSpecific aim 2 (secondary aim) will compare the effect of LC participation, PI, or their combination, with PF only, on implementation of evidence-based interventions for SUDs, including (a) brief counseling, (b) medications (e.g., buprenorphine, naltrexone) and adherence to them, and (c) referral to specialty care.\n\nSpecific aims 1 and 2 will produce fundamentally important evidence about the comparative effectiveness of PF, PF+LC, PF+PI, and PF+LC+PI strategies on uptake of evidence-based screening and interventions for SUD when delivered to primary care practices.\n\nSpecific aim 3 (exploratory aim) will use a longitudinal mixed-methods evaluation to assess the association between implementation effectiveness and putative moderators (e.g., organizational readiness for change) and mediators (e.g., implementation climate). Aim 3 will generate scientific knowledge about mechanisms of change (why and how the various strategies work) in primary care settings."

We will use a stratified block randomization strategy with a block size of 12 practices to ensure a high degree of balance between study arms. The implementation phase will last for 12 months, and we will conduct 12-month post-implementation assessments to assess sustainment. The 2x2 design will allow us to assess the improvement in rates of screening and delivery of evidence-based interventions for SUDs in primary care with PF alone and the incremental benefit of LC, PI, or their combination, to inform primary care practices and health systems about optimal implementation strategies.",
