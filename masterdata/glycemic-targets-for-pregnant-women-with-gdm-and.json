Eligible pregnant women with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes or Type 2 diabetes will be randomized into either routine care with glycemic targets as currently recommended by ADA and ACOG (control arm), or more aggressive care with lower glycemic targets that more closely resemble normoglycemia in pregnancy (intervention arm). The glycemic targets for the control arm will be defined as follows: fasting \u226495 mg/dL, pre-prandial \u226495 mg/dL, and 1-hour postprandial \u2264140 mg/dL. The glycemic targets for the intervention arm will be defined as follows: fasting \u226480 mg/dL, pre-prandial \u226480 mg/dL, and 1-hour postprandial \u2264110 mg/dL. The primary outcome will be a 250-gram difference in birth weight between the two study arms. Secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes of interest will also be compared between the two study arms."

A primary randomization model assigning patients to the \"New Target\" versus the \"Standard Target\" will be created for the one center (LAC+USC), and permuted-block randomization with random allocation will be used. The investigators will be blinded to the block size. The generation of randomization codes will be performed using SAS statistical software, v. 9.3, Cary, NC. A validation test will be performed to assure that treatment balance is achieved within the entire study.",
