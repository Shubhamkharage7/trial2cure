The development of novel cancer biomarkers for liver cancer may help in clinical decision making and lead to improvements in patient outcomes by facilitating prediction of the response to specific treatments, improved monitoring of patients on treatment, and better prognostication of patient outcomes, thus improving stratification for clinical trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To isolate plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation panel from the peripheral blood of treated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma that will correlate with disease progression or measurable residual disease.\n\nII. To correlate the mutations/ DNA methylation in peripheral blood with those identified in parallel tumor samples from the same patients with hepatocellular (HCC).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood samples at 4-6 weeks prior to surgery/ablation and at 12 weeks, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery/ablation. Patients' previously collected tissue samples are analyzed. Patients' medical records are also reviewed at baseline, 4-6 weeks prior to surgery/ablation, 12 weeks, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery/ablation, and then every 6 months for 3 years."
