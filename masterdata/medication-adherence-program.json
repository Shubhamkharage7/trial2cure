Participants (n=402) \\>=50 years old with a diagnosis of hypertension, uncontrolled blood pressure, and low antihypertensive medication adherence will be recruited through a statewide health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, and randomized to receive either interactive health coaching sessions with medication reminder tools (intervention) or medication reminder tools only (control) over one year. Data will be collected from participants at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months using questionnaires, physical measurement (height, weight, blood pressure), a computer-based single-category implicit association test, and laboratory analysis of antihypertensive medication urinary metabolites."
