Adolescents and children will be studied in a staged approach involving established favorable pharmacodynamic and safety profiles of aficamten in adolescents followed by further pharmacokinetic modeling to inform the dosing regimen in children.\n\nThe trial will consist of 2 periods:\n\n1. Period 1 is the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period that will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of aficamten in pediatric participants. Duration: approximately 12 weeks.\n2. Period 2 is the open-label extension trial that will assess the long-term safety of aficamten in pediatric participants, and further assess efficacy and tolerability. Duration: approximately 52 weeks."
