Participants will complete the training modules and complete pre- and post-tests to assess these outcomes.",

Interested providers will be screened; if eligible, the will complete informed consent. Providers who complete the online consent and agree to enroll in the training study will be individually randomized to one of 2 conditions: The Black Health Block Culturally Tailored + the HDLCS or Black Health Block Culturally Tailored control condition alone. After randomization, providers will complete a pre-test assessing their knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions related to provider advice to quit smoking and referrals for low dose computed tomography. Providers will then complete an online training. Providers will then complete a post-test assessing their 1) knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions related to provider advice to quit smoking and referrals for low dose computed tomography and 2) preferences for the online materials and satisfaction with the training. Feasibility will be assessed using data on provider interest in the training and training reach."
