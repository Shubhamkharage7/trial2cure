Cutaneous lymphomas are a rare type of blood cancers (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) that present in the skin. The information gained from this study, may help researchers improve quality of life in cutaneous lymphoma patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To prospectively assess quality of life (QoL) in adult patients with cutaneous lymphoma (CL) via use of a validated questionnaire (Skindex-29) and identify the psychosocial needs of our patient population.\n\nII. To prospectively evaluate the burden of pruritus in patients with CL via use of 10-point pruritus scale and compare to QoL.\n\nIII. To evaluate QoL for any correlation with demographic and clinical information, specifically, age, gender, race/ethnicity, type of CL, stage of mycosis fungoides (MF)/Sezary syndrome (SS), treatment regimen, and social work involvement.\n\nIV. To track changes in QoL and burden of pruritus as they relate to therapeutic strategies used to manage disease, including social work involvement.\n\nV. To prospectively assess patients' knowledge and understanding of their cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and overall survival; and to track changes in their knowledge and understanding, and assess for any correlation to QoL.\n\nVI. To prospectively evaluate our patients' need for resources, and our ability to meet those needs; and to assess for any correlation to demographic or clinical category, or QoL.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete quality of life questionnaires over 10-20 minutes about symptoms, emotions, and functioning related to diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma."
