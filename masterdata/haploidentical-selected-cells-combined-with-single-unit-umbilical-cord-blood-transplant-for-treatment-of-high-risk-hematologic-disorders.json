The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G-CSF and undergo one apheresis to collect CD34+ stem cells. The products will be cryopreserved until the time of transplantation. Recipients with hematologic disorders who require transplant will receive a standard conditioning regimen and will receive an allograft on day 0 containing donor CD34+ cells that have been positively selected and T-cell depleted following G-CSF mobilization combined with a single UCB unit."
