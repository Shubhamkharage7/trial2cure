Patients must have tumors in which adjuvant breast radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery is indicated, as determined by the treating physician.\n6. Patients must be female. Note: Male patients are excluded due to the rarity of male breast cancer and difficulty in pursuing breast conserving surgery for male patients.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
