            "briefSummary": "This study is a Phase I/II, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study of BT8009 given as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors associated with Nectin-4 expression or in participants with advanced solid tumor malignancies having renal insufficiency. The primary endpoints are: Dose limiting toxicities (Parts A-1 and A-2), Overall response rate per RECIST v1.1 (Part B), Safety and tolerability (Part C), and characterization of the pharmacokinetics (Part D).",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will assess the safety and tolerability of BT8009 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with select advanced solid tumors. BT8009 will be given as a single agent in 3 different dosing schedules- weekly (28 day cycle), biweekly (28 day cycle) or dosing on day 1 and day 8 of a 3-weekly (21 day cycle) and in combination with pembrolizumab. There are three parts to this study. Part A is a dose escalation in patients with select advanced solid tumors primarily designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of BT8009 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab and to determine a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Following a selection of an RP2D, Part B, a dose expansion portion, will be initiated with the primary objective of clinical activity of BT8009 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with select advanced solid tumors. Part C will evaluate safety and tolerability of RP2D in patients with renal insufficiency. Part D will further characterize the pharmacokinetics of BT8009 and MMAE."
