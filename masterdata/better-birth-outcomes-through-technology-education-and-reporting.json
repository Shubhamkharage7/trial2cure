            "briefSummary": "This is a pragmatic randomized control trial to evaluate the BETTER intervention compared to standard obstetrical care (control) to determine whether it helps to reduce maternal anemia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The BETTER intervention includes one motivational interviewing session and bi-weekly text messages to encourage patients to connect with resources that address their social needs, including housing, food, and transportation. Quantitative data will be used to study participant outcomes, including surveys, and electronic health record data.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are more than 3.5 million births per year in the United States. A substantial portion of these births (approximately 25-30%) occur in the context of significant adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) including preterm birth (PTB), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), small-for-gestational-age birth (SGA), and intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). Moreover, these complications significantly increase the risk of both maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with adverse health consequences throughout the life course of both individuals. Anemia in pregnancy has been consistently cited as an important factor in and upstream of APOs such as PTB and HDP, severe maternal morbidity, and maternal mortality, and for disparities in these outcomes as well.\n\nThis study will expand our understanding of addressing SDoH, including linkage to services that mitigate SDoH. This information can inform future interventions that address SDoH. Creating new tools to address the needs and strengths of obstetric patients, and encouraging their use, will improve the management of patient care during and after pregnancy.\n\nThe patient sample will include obstetric patients receiving care at the OSUWMC McCampbell OB/GYN clinic or the OSUWMC Outpatient Care East OB/GYN clinic. A total of 550 patients will participate in the study and be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. We will collect maternal and child health outcome data using patient electronic health records and surveys.\n\nAt the time of randomization at the patient's prenatal appointment, a researcher will use a survey to collect participant baseline data, including patient demographics and patient-reported outcomes. This information will be collected again during a study visit during the patient's prenatal appointment when the patient is 28-32 weeks gestation.\n\nFinal data collection from patient records will occur after delivery (for both intervention and control groups). Research staff will extract information from patients' and their baby's medical records, including maternal and perinatal outcomes.\n\nThe intervention includes one motivational interviewing session that encourages the patient to address their social needs. Following the intervention, patients will receive bi-weekly text messages with links to help them address social needs; these links are: (1) to a patient portal to enable them connect with their care team, (2) to Health Impact Ohio, a local organization that can help patients address social needs; and (3) to \"findhelp.org,\" a site that can provide a list of resources based on zip code."
