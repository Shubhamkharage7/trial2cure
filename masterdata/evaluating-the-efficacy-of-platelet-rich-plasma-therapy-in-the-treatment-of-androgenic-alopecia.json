            "briefSummary": "The study team will assess the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma therapy, a special blood product which is from the participant's own body, in the treatment of androgenic alopecia (also known as male pattern hair loss) in females.",
            "detailedDescription": "Androgenic alopecia, or male-pattern hair loss affects both men and women. This hair loss pattern is typically characterized by thinning at the crown of scalp and/or M-shaped hair line in males or diffuse thinning throughout in females. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy has recently been studied as a hair rejuvenation therapy in patients with non-inflammatory alopecia. Though the mechanism of action is not well understood, PRP is thought to promote angiogenesis and enhance blood flow around hair follicles via platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The primary objective of the study is to determine whether PRP, administered once monthly for 3 months improves clinical outcomes and quality of life in females with androgenic alopecia. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, half-head, single center clinical study where sixteen subjects with androgenic alopecia will be recruited. Dermatology Life Quality Index will be assessed at several time points. Disease severity will be measured using the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT), Alopecia Density and Extent Score (ALODEX); Trichoscan images will be captured to document participants' clinical progress. Adverse events will be recorded at each visit, treatment will be discontinued if any subject experience a serious adverse event. Treatment visits will take place at baseline, 4 weeks (1 month), 8 weeks (2 months), and 12 weeks (3 month). A follow-up, non-treatment visit will take place at 24 weeks (6 months). The study team hypothesizes that PRP will improve DLQI, SALT, ALODEX, hair count (number of hairs/0.65 cm2), hair density (number of hairs/cm2), hair diameter, anagen to telogen ratio, and vellus hair to terminal hair ratio in female subjects with androgenic alopecia."

Left profile of scalp: 18% (0.18) of scalp surface area. Posterior aspect of scalp: 24% (0.24) of scalp surface area. Percentage of hair loss in any of these areas is the percentage hair loss multiplied by percent surface area of the scalp in that area.\n\nSALT score is the sum of percentage of hair loss in all the above-mentioned areas. For e.g., if the percentage hair loss in vertex, right profile, left profile and posterior aspect is 20, 30, 40 and 50% respecively; then, SALT score = (20 \u00b4 0.4) = (30 \u00b4 0.18) + (40 \u00b4 0.18) + (50 \u00b4 0.24) = 8+5.4+7.2+12 = 32.6 Lower score denote better outcomes.",
