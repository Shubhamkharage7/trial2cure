It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.\n\nPURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue and blood samples from women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer",

Tumor markers are assessed using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study."

Also, ionizing radiation from CT-guided biopsies may pose a risk to the unborn fetus.\n\nCardiac disease making it unsafe to biopsy in the opinion of the treating physician.\n\nIf patients receiving bevacizumab or other angiogenesis inhibitors are less than 6 weeks from last dose of the angiogenesis inhibitor, they should not undergo research core biopsies of vital organs (lung, liver, etc.) on this protocol because of the concern for the possibility of increased bleeding risk and delayed healing. Patients receiving bevacizumab or other angiogenesis inhibitors who are undergoing a research biopsy of the breast, peripheral lymph node or a skin punch biopsy must be two weeks from the last dose of the angiogenesis inhibitor.",
