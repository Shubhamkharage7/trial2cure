Greater palliative care and hospice\n\nOUTLINE: Sites are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive educational materials to assist with advance care planning and symptom management through a technology-based supportive cancer care weekly during months 1-4 and every other week during months 5-12.\n\nARM B: Patients are paired with a lay health worker who will discuss the same educational materials from ARM A either in person or by telephone discussions weekly during months 1-4 and every other week during months 5-12.\n\nAll participants complete a baseline interview upon enrollment during the initial consent phone contact and then a survey at 3-, 6-and 12-months post enrollment."
