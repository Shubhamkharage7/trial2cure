Consent for the enrollment may be obtained upon scheduling the MRI examination. For non-English speakers, a language interpreter will assist in translation.\n* Written consent will be obtained from all participants to obtain MBI of the breasts and biopsy as indicated, based on findings. All participants will be asked to provide a post examination survey of their experience with both tests.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects who are pregnant will be excluded as MBI exam involves injection of radioactive tracer\n* contrast enhanced MRI involves gadolinium injection, both of which are contraindicated during pregnancy.",
