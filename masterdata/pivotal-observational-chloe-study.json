All data will be presented to Panelists as full cohorts of embryos for each mother. Then they will provide their prediction on blastocyst status of each embryo twice: once the prediction will be based on morphology only and once on morphology plus CHLOE\u2122 assigned score (\"High\", \"Medium+\", \"Medium-\", or \"Low\"). The two assessments will be done with a washout period of at least 2 weeks and no information will be provided to link the two assessments.",
