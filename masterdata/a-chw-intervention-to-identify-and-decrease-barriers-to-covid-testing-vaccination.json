            "detailedDescription": "This study represents the third aim of a grant with three aims. The study used unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to develop a CHW intervention for this aim. The aim will compare and evaluate a Community Health Worker-led curriculum aimed to identify and address barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccination among LACDHS safety-net patients.\n\nFor the study, the investigators will recruit 66 eligible safety-net patients for a COVID-19 specific curriculum, provided by Community Health Workers at Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. The study will take place remotely over the course of 6-weeks. Utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients, will assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing and vaccination.\n\nThe remote CHW intervention that the study participants will participate in and be compensated for is a pilot program intended to provide additional CHW training. Monthly calls from LACDHS to remind them of COVID-19 vaccination are standard of care for all empaneled LACDHS patients."
