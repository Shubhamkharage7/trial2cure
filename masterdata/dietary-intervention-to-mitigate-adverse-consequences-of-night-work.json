As shift work is not foreseen to disappear, the development of individually-targeted therapies for metabolic health in these vulnerable shift workers is urgently needed. This research will determine whether our dietary intervention can mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of circadian misalignment, which may help in the design of evidence-based dietary interventions to improve the metabolic health in shift workers."
