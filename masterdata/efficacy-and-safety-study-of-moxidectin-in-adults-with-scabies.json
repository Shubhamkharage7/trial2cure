Abnormal and clinically relevant findings in hematology or biochemistry assessments at Screening, or in vital signs, 12-lead ECG, or physical examination at Screening and/or Baseline, that in the opinion of the Investigator would put the subjects at increased risk from participating in the study, confound study evaluations, or may interfere with study conduct.\n8. Presence of any other clinically relevant condition, including infection, immunological disorder, malignant disease, and/or other underlying condition or circumstance at Screening or Baseline that in the opinion of the Investigator would put the subjects at increased risk from participating in the study, confound study evaluations, or interfere with the study conduct.\n9.

Received an investigational agent within 28 days of Screening (or 5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer).\n12. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to macrocyclic lactones or excipients used in the formulation of moxidectin or ivermectin.\n13. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the components in permethrin 5% cream, to any synthetic pyrethroid or pyrethrin, or to the components of spinosad 0.9% topical suspension.\n14.
