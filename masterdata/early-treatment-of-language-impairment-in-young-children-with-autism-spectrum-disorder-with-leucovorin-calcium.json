            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the cognitive and behavioral effects of liquid leucovorin calcium on young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and determine whether it improves language as well as the core and associated symptoms of ASD. The investigators will enroll 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known language delays or impairments. Participation will last approximately 26 weeks from screening to end of treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with life-long consequences that affects young children during critical times in their development. ASD is defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin calcium on language impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into the trial will have delayed social and communication abilities known to be associated with ASD. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve language as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD. The investigators further hypothesize that a combination of baseline cellular and genetic biomarkers will predict cognitive and behavioral response to the intervention.\n\nTo assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, with confirmed ASD and known language delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12 weeks. Language skills, as well as specimen biomarkers, will be measured at screening and after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences language ability."

Has at least 4 month old expressive language ability as assessed by the MSEL Expressive Language Scale (i.e., Parent answers \"yes\" to \" Voluntary babbling (such as 'bu, bu, bu\")\" Question #7 on the MSEL Expressive Language Scale.\n5. English included in the languages in which the child is being raised\n6. Autism severity of moderate or higher (\u22654) under the 7-item clinical global impression-severity scale. Moderate level of autism severity (4) is defined by the diagnosis of ASD with language impairment, so fulfilling #1 and #4 fulfills this requirement.\n\n6. Ability to maintain all ongoing complementary, dietary, traditional, and behavioral treatments constant for the study period 7. Unchanged complementary, dietary, traditional, and behavioral treatments for two months prior to study entry\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known FRAA status by clinically validated test performed outside of research studies.\n2. Mineral or vitamin supplementation that exceeds the Tolerable Upper Daily Intake Levels set by the Institute of Medicine (See Table 5 below)\n3.

Severe prematurity (\\<34 weeks gestation) as determined by medical history\n6. Current uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux\n7. Current or history of liver or kidney disease as determined by medical history and safety labs\n8. Genetic syndromes\n9. Congenital brain malformations\n10. Epilepsy\n11. Any medical condition that the PI determines could jeopardize the safety of the study subject or compromise the integrity of the data\n12. Significant negative reaction (i.e. fainting, vomiting, etc.) because of a previous blood draw.\n13.
