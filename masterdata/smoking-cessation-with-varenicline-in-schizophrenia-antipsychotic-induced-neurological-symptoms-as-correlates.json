            "briefSummary": "To test the feasibility of studying effects of smoking cessation with varenicline on antipsychotic drug-induced neurological side effects, we propose a 12 week pilot study of smoking cessation treatment with varenicline in 10 schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients who are actively smoking and have pre-existing TD while receiving stable doses of antipsychotics. Subjects will be followed after a 2 week baseline period to assess changes in smoking status and neurological symptoms using standardized rating scales. The aim is to examine clinically significant effects on antipsychotic-induced neurological side effects that may warrant further investigation.",
            "detailedDescription": "1. Objectives(s): To study whether smoking cessation with varenicline treatment will be associated with a significant reduction in symptoms of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia without worsening acute extrapyramidal symptoms.\n2. Research Design: To test the feasibility of studying effects of smoking cessation with varenicline on antipsychotic drug-induced neurological side effects, we propose a 12 week exploratory, open-label, proof-of-concept, pilot study of smoking cessation treatment with varenicline in 10 schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients who are actively smoking and have pre-existing TD while receiving stable doses of antipsychotics. Subjects will be followed after a 2 week baseline period to assess changes in smoking status and neurological symptoms using standardized rating scales. The aim is to examine clinically significant effects on antipsychotic-induced neurological side effects that may warrant further investigation.\n3. Methodology: Patients will be evaluated at a Screening Visit 1 (Week 0) and at a Baseline Visit 2 (Week 2) two weeks apart. After the Baseline Visit, subjects will be asked to cease smoking completely by the target date four weeks after the baseline visit (Week 6) and will attend a clinic Cessation Visit 4 (Week 6) for medication check and resupply. Treatment with varenicline will start at Baseline Visit 2 (Week 2) with 0.5mg hs x 3 days, 0.5mg bid x 4 days, then start 1mg bid at Visit 3 (Week 3) for the remaining 9 weeks of the study.\n\nAt the Screening and Baseline Visits, and at study visits thereafter (Visit 3-7), subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety, and changes in smoking or other tobacco use since the last visit. The following measures will be taken; Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) at screening only; Cigarette smoking will be assessed by a structured questionnaire of time-line follow-back (TLFB) usage; Expired carbon using a hand-held carbon monoxide monitor; Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS); Global Clinical Impression Scale (CGI-S at baseline, CGI-I at final visit) for TD; C-SSRS; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline and the final visit only; Brief smoking cessation counseling; Laboratory measures; Urine toxicology sample at the screening and final visits only, serum pregnancy test (women) at screening visit only; Changes in psychotropic medications; Varenicline compliance by pill counts; Adverse events."
