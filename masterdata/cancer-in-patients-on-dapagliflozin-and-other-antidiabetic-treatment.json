Secondary objectives will compare, by insulin use at cohort entry, frequency of several measures of health care use, baseline characteristics, and incidence of selected other cancers in males and females between the two exposure cohorts.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multinational cohort database study to estimate the incidence of female breast cancer and bladder cancer, by insulin use at cohort entry, in patients who are prescribed dapagliflozin compared to patients prescribed other specific oral antidiabetic drugs. Dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because of the mechanism of action for dapagliflozin and results from small safety monitoring studies, there is interest in further evaluating the safety of dapagliflozin in a large populations.\n\nThe study will be implemented in four administrative health care data sources in three countries: in the United Kingdom, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare databases and the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM); and, in the Netherlands, the PHARMO Database Network. Individuals in the databases will be included in the study if they meet the following age criteria; 40 years or older (CPRD and PHARMO), 40 to 64 years (HIRD) or 65 years or older (Medicare); and if they did not have type 1 diabetes, were treated with one of the study drugs and meet the criteria of at least 180 days of electronic data before their first prescription of the study drug. The study period starts November 13, 2012 in CPRD, November 1, 2013 in PHARMO and January 9, 2014 in the United States data sources, and will end at the latest available data at each database at the time of analysis"
