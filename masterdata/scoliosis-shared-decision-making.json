This video will then be sent to the shared decision making group at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota to run analysis of the data (Shared Decision Making National Resource Center, Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic). Investigators will follow the patient's electronic medical records for 2 years after their decision of treatment option. No outcome forms will be specifically collected as part of the study, as outcomes forms are currently being collected clinically on all scoliosis patients.\n\nBased off of the initial video recordings, the first visual prototype of the shared decision making tool for scoliosis has been developed. This prototype of the shared decision making tool will be now be used to help test it's efficiency."
