Timing-based interventions, such as early time-restricted eating (eTRE), show significant improvements in cardiometabolic endpoints in non-postpartum cohorts. The purpose of the Time4Mom study is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a postpartum-adapted eTRE intervention to test feasibility and acceptability of the eTRE intervention and trial protocol. We will also compare changes in clinical outcomes of interest and patient-reported outcomes between eTRE (intervention) and control groups.\n\nThis 2-arm trial will randomize 60 postpartum women to either Control or eTRE for 12 weeks (n=30/group)."
