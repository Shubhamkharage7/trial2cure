Known active hepatitis C infections. (Note: Patients who are hepatitis C surface antigen-positive are eligible if they have an undetectable hepatitis C viral load.)\n\nL. Females of child-bearing potential who refuse to either practice 2 effective methods of contraception at the same time or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing the informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\nM.
