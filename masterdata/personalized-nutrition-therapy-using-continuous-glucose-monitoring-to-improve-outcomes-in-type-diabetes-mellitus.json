            "briefSummary": "Nutrition guidelines state that multiple eating patterns are effective for type 2 diabetes and that therapy should be individualized. Yet many nutrition plans fail to account for interpersonal variability in blood glucose response to meals. This diminishes the ability of dietary interventions to optimize glycemic control and may lessen patient satisfaction, self--efficacy, and adherence. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can facilitate behavior change in type 2 diabetes and has been associated with improved outcomes in nutrition intervention studies; this literature is limited by small study sample sizes and heterogeneity of study design and outcomes, and more data are needed. CGM could be a powerful tool for adapting a nutrition plan based on blood glucose response at an individual level. This study will test the use of CGM to personalize nutrition therapy compared to nutrition therapy alone (without CGM) for participants with type 2 diabetes who are not meeting glycemic treatment goals."
