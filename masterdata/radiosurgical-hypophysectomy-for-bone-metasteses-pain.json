            "detailedDescription": "Although not currently standard of care, small series suggest both safety and efficacy of radiosurgical hypophysectomy in reducing cancer pain from bone metastases. In spite of the demonstrated feasibility in meeting normal tissue constraints and preliminary data suggestive of both safety and efficacy, radiosurgical hypophysectomy is rarely performed in clinical practice, and many radiation oncologists are not even aware of its potential to reduce intractable cancer pain. This is likely because, to date, well-designed prospective studies have not been performed to further explore both the safety and efficacy of the intervention. This single arm pilot study is designed to fill that void. If successful, the investigators plan to utilize the data to support the proposal of a larger scale follow-up clinical trial."
