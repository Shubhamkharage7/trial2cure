            "briefSummary": "The investigators are looking to conduct a study looking at the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) in patients with endometriosis. It is believed that CBD will improve both pain and quality of life. The study will last a total of 12 weeks and involve several onsite visits in addition to daily pain assessments.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposal is to conduct a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of cannabidiol on the management of endometriosis-related pain.\n\nSubjects will be pre-screened from new and existing patients as well as from referral sites for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Potential subjects will be pre-screened for moderate to severe endometriosis associated pain (VAS \\> 3) greater than 6 months. Those meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria that who are willing to participate will receive a detailed history and physical exam, appropriate bloodwork and undergo informed consented at the Screening Visit. Baseline survey data will be collected. During Screening, the patient's will be asked to complete their daily electronic diaries and screened for daily reporting adherence.\n\nRandomized subjects will receive either (1) placebo (2) low dose CBD (3) high dose CBD. This study will include an 8-week intervention period during which subjects will be asked to record daily electronic VAS scores, pain medication use and a number of other parameters. Subjects will return at week 12 for a 4 week post-treatment visit, where they can also chose to enroll in an optional pharmacokinetic study. Participants will complete the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30), Patient Global Assessments (PGAs), the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) surveys and, if partnered and sexually active, the Female Sexual Function Index at various time points. Patients will also have bloodwork done to assess for circulating markers of inflammation, circulating CBD concentration levels and liver dysfunction throughout the study duration. Subjects will be screened for side effects and asked to record pain medication use throughout the duration of the study. Study drug compliance will be assessed.\n\nAt the completion of the study, all subjects will be offered the opportunity to do pharmacokinetic testing with sublingual CBD until a maximum number of 4 patients are enrolled. The testing will include 24 hours of monitoring with sequential blood draws to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of sublingual CBD after administration and one salivary pH. They will be discharged at 24 hours and asked to return to the clinic at 48 hours for one final lab draw."

The most widely studied is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC), which is the major psychoactive component of Cannabis, but Cannabidiol (CBD) has been increasingly favored for its reduced side effect profile and potential health benefits. CBD was first isolated from Cannabis in the 1940s. CBD, unlike 9-THC, does not bind to CB1 and CB2 receptors, which accounts for its lack of typical psychotropic effects, but is still appears to work via alternative mechanisms via the endocannabinoid system.",
