            "detailedDescription": "The majority of adults with cerebral palsy have chronic pain. The investigators have found that communicative adults with cerebral palsy reporting the most pain-related impairment had clinically-elevated catastrophizing thought-patterns. Because of this, a treatment targeting pain-related catastrophizing thought patterns may help reduce pain-related impairment. One potential treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP).\n\nTo investigate the efficacy of CBT-CP on reducing pain-related impairment and catastrophizing thought patterns in communicative adults with cerebral palsy, investigators will conduct and compare evaluations before and after participants receive a combination of CBT-CP and pain education. CBT-CP involves weekly group-therapy sessions for 12 weeks. Pain education is comprised of 12 weeks of usual medical care in addition to being given an educational booklet on chronic pain.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive either pain education followed by CBT-CP (group 1; Education-CBT), or the reverse order (group 2; CBT-Education). Participants in both groups will be assessed at the beginning of the study (at baseline; prior to group assignment), and then once every 3 months during the 12-month duration of the study. After baseline, assessments two and three will occur immediately after the 12 week pain education/CBT intervention periods (3 and 6 months into study), while assessments four and five are follow-up questionnaires to assess post-treatment effects (9 and 12 months into study).\n\nThis study will be conducted at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. 40 participants who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited. Participants must endorse the ability and willingness to participate in all assessment and group sessions regardless of randomization outcome."
