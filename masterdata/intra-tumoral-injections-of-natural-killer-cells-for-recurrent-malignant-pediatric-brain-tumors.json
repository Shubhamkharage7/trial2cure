            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of ex vivo expanded natural killer cells in treating patients with cancerous (malignant) tumors affecting the upper part of the brain (supratentorial) that have come back (recurrent) or that are growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive). Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that recognize and get rid of abnormal cells in the body, including tumor cells and cells infected by viruses. NK cells have been shown to kill different types of cancer, including brain tumors in laboratory settings. Giving NK cells from unrelated donors who are screened for optimal cell qualities and determined to be safe and healthy may be effective in treating supratentorial malignant brain tumors in children and young adults.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of natural killer (NK) cells that have been propagated ex vivo with genetically-modified feeder cells and administered intra-tumoral via an Ommaya reservoir in patients with recurrent or progressive supratentorial malignant brain tumors.\n\nII. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for natural killer (NK) cells that have been propagated ex vivo with genetically-modified feeder cells and administered intra-tumoral via an Ommaya reservoir in patients with recurrent or progressive supratentorial malignant brain tumors.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the 6 months overall survival (OS), defined as the percentage of patients in the study who are alive at 6 months following start of treatment.\n\nII. To determine the persistence, immuno-phenotype and function of adoptively-transferred expanded NK cells and correlate the findings with the overall response.\n\nIII. To determine the immune signature-based profile of each patient's tumor. IV. To determine changes in the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity before and after Transforming growth factor beta imprinted (TGF\u03b2i) NK cell treatment.\n\nV. To evaluate the effect of systemic steroids on the persistence and efficacy of TGF\u03b2i NK cells.\n\nVI. To assess Quality of Life (QOL) and cognitive measures in children and young adults with recurrent or progressive supratentorial malignant brain tumors.\n\nVII. To assess patient and/or proxy satisfaction with study participation via patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in the context of race ethnicity and other health related social risks.\n\nVIII. To assess on therapy toxicity in the context of race, ethnicity and other health related social risks.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nParticipants undergo placement of an Ommaya reservoir and receive universal donor expanded TGF-beta-imprinted NK cells (TGFBi NK cells) intratumorally over 5 minutes via Ommaya reservoir on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain during screening and on study and collection of tumor-associated fluid via Ommaya reservoir on study. Participants may also undergo MRI of the spine and lumbar puncture as clinically indicated."

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n9.

If the medication can be discontinued \\>1 week prior to NK cell infusion then the subject may be eligible following consultation with the Study Chairs.\n11. Participants with significant systemic or major illnesses including but not limited to: congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, kidney disease or renal failure, organ transplantation, or significant psychiatric disorder.\n12. History or current diagnosis of any medical or psychological condition that in the Investigator's opinion, might interfere with the participants ability to participate or inability to obtain informed consent because of psychiatric or complicating medical problems.\n\nImportant note: The eligibility criteria listed above are interpreted literally and cannot be waived.",
