            "detailedDescription": "Health-related quality of life is an important outcome of cancer treatment which encompasses physical, psychological, social, and functional well-being. In addition, quality of life includes one's overall ability to become a productive member of society and achieve personal fulfillment. Treatment of pediatric cancer is a highly stressful experience which can be challenging and disruptive to the lives of children and their families. Pediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy often experience a decline in quality of life due to decreased activity, fatigue, and psychological distress such as depression or anxiety when compared to healthy individuals. Preliminary data suggests that there is an association between physical activity and quality of life. Exercise has been show to improve mood, increase energy levels, and reduce stress. Although more research and clinical resources have been given to the effects of exercise on quality of life among adult cancer patients, there is a lack of research in these areas among children with cancer. The investigators know little about whether children with cancer would benefit from exercise.\n\nThe investigators have added a blood sample for biomarkers. Research in adult cancer patients have shown an association between different biomarkers and sleep quality which suggests that regulation of certain biomarkers may be affected through exercise in adults. Measures of biomarkers may provide insight into potential mediators between PA, sleep quality, or fatigue levels."
