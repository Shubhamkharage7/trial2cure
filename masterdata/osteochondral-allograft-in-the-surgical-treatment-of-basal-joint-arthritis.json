            "detailedDescription": "Basal joint arthritis of the thumb is a common condition associated with considerable morbidity. Many non-operative and operative treatments have been described, but few multicenter prospective evidence based trials exist comparing standard treatments. This continuing search for consensus and improvement of best clinical practice has been reviewed in a thorough meta-analysis of operative treatments for basal joint arthritis. Operative treatments range from osteotomy, partial or complete trapeziectomy with or without reconstruction of the ligaments, tendon interposition to arthrodesis, however the functional outcome varies. Allograft has been previously described in joint replacement / prosthetic implantation surgery in other areas of the body, however not in the thumb. The purpose of this study is to investigate using osteochondral allograft in the surgical intervention phase of treatment for patients with basal joint arthritis."
