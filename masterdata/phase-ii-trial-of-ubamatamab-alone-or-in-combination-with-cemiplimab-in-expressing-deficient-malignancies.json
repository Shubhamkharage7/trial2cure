            "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participants with locally advanced or metastatic RMC (RMC cohort) or ES (ES cohort) histologically confirmed by expert pathology review and loss of SMARCB1 staining by IHC. Participants with advanced or metastatic unclassified renal cell carcinoma with medullary phenotype (a rare SMARCB1 negative RMC variant occurring in individuals without sickle hemoglobinopathies) are also eligible for the RMC cohort.\n2. Eligible participants should either demonstrate serum CA-125 levels \u2265 70 units/ml during screening or positive H score of \\>25 for MUC16 (CA-125) by IHC in tumor tissues collected within 12 months from screening as noted in participant EMR:\n\n   1. The H score is calculated using the standard formula commonly used in IHC: H score = \\[(0 x % negative cells) + (1 x % weak positive cells) + (2 x % moderate positive cells) + (3 x % strong positive cells). For instance, if 50% of tumor cells show weak staining, 30% of tumor cells show moderate staining, and 20% of cells show strong staining, the H-score would be: (50\u00d71)+(30\u00d72)+(20\u00d73)=50+60+60=170.\n   2. If serum CA-125 \u2265 70 units/ml then participants will be enrolled without delay. IHC for MUC16 will be used as a correlative biomarker but not for trial eligibility.\n   3. If serum CA-125 \\< 70 units/ml then for trial eligibility, MUC16 expression should be checked by IHC in tumor tissues collected within 12 months from screening:\n\n   i. If H score is \\< 25 then the patient will not be eligible for the trial ii. If H score \u2265 25 then the patient will be eligible for the trial\n3. Participants will be eligible in the RMC cohort regardless of whether they have had prior nephrectomy or still have their primary tumor in-situ.\n4. Participants must have at least one measurable site of disease, defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) and measures \u2265 15 mm with conventional techniques or \u2265 10 mm with more sensitive techniques such as MRI or CT scan. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation.\n5. Participants must have progressed on at least one line of prior therapy.\n6. There must be evidence of progression on or after last treatment regimen received.\n7. ECOG performance status 0-1\n\n   a. NOTE: If participant is unable to walk due to paralysis, but is mobile in a wheelchair, participant is considered to be ambulatory for the purpose of assessing their performance status.\n8. Age (at the time of consent/assent): \u2265 18 years\n\n   a. RMC is the third most common renal cell carcinoma in children and young adults in the United States21 and while we will initially enroll participants aged \u226518 years old, we will in coordination with Regeneron consider allowing pediatric participants \u226512 years old if no trial limiting toxicities (TOX), as defined in Section 9.1.2., after the interim analysis of the first 10 participants enrolled and based on the accumulated pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic data of ubamatamab in this population at that time. If these criteria are fulfilled, then adolescent participants age 12 years and older will be allowed with signed assent and parental consent according to institutional guidelines and requirements, as long as their weight is \\>40 kg given that this is the lower weight limit for which safety following ubamatamab with or without cemiplimab exposure has been ascertained.\n9. Consent to MD Anderson companion laboratory protocol 2014-0938\n10. Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n    Hemoglobina \u2265 9 g/dl (treatment allowed) Absolute neutrophil countb \u2265 1,000/\u00b5L Platelets \u2265 75,000/\u00b5L Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 mg/dl AST(SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) \u2264 2.5 X institutional ULN, except in known hepatic metastasis, wherein may be \u2264 5 x ULN Serum Creatininec \u2264 1.5 x ULN by gender (as long as patient does not require dialysis)\n\n    a May receive transfusion within the screening period b Without growth factor support (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) for at least 14 days c If creatinine is not \\<1.5\u00d7ULN, then calculate by Cockcroft-Gault methods or local institutional standard and CrCl must be \\>30 mL/kg/1.73 m2\n11. Participants with controlled brain metastases are allowed on protocol if the brain metastases were surgically resected or treated with radiosurgery or Gamma knife, without recurrence or edema for 1 month (4 weeks). Participants actively requiring glucocorticoids for uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases are not eligible.\n12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of the study drug.\n13. Women must not be breastfeeding.\n14. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception from the time of registration for treatment for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 5 months post treatment completion. Men must agree to effective contraception from the time of registration for treatment to 7 months post last protocol treatment.\n\n    Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male participants who are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male participants who are sexually active with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of \\< 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.\n\n    Approved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), Intrauterine device (IUD), Tubal Ligation or hysterectomy, Patient/Partner post vasectomy, Implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n    Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 7 months after completion of ubamatamab/cemiplimab administration.\n\n    The effects of ubamatamab/cemiplimab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because immunotherapy agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. (Refer to Pregnancy Assessment Policy MD Anderson Institutional Policy # CLN1114). This includes all female participants, between the onset of menses (as early as 8 years of age) and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following:\n    * Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months).\n    * History of hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\n    * Ovarian failure (Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Estradiol in menopausal range, who have received Whole Pelvic Radiation Therapy).\n    * History of bilateral tubal ligation or another surgical sterilization procedure.\n15.

Participants previously treated with T-cell-redirecting bispecific antibodies or MUC16-targeted therapies (including vaccines) are excluded. Participants who received CAR-T therapies within 30 days of first dose of study drug are also excluded. However, participants previously treated with immune checkpoint therapies such as anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, or anti-LAG-3 immune checkpoint inhibitors are eligible, as long as they have been off these therapies for at least 60 days (\\~3 half-lives) prior to initiation of study treatment with ubamatamab.\n3. Participants currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies (including chemotherapy and targeted therapies such as tazemetostat) within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to study Day 1 are excluded. Participants who have completed palliative radiation therapy more than 14 days prior to the first dose of the combination immunotherapy are eligible.\n4. Participants with persistent grade \u22652 adverse events from prior systemic therapies that would confound timely detection of immune-related adverse events due to ubamatamab and/or cemiplimab or otherwise hinder patient participation in the clinical trial.\n5. Participants, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury (injury requiring \\> 4 weeks (28 days) to heal) within 4 weeks (28 days) of start of study drug, participants who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia).\n6. Participants who have organ allografts.\n7. Known or suspected autoimmune disease.

Participants with HIV who have controlled infection (undetectable viral load with the exception of clinically insignificant blips and CD4 count above 350 either spontaneously or on a stable antiviral regimen) are permitted.\n   2. Participants with hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HepBsAg+) who have controlled infection (serum hepatitis B virus DNA PCR that is below the limit of detection AND receiving antiviral therapy for hepatitis B) are permitted.\n   3. Participants with HBsAg negative but total HBV core antibody positive (HBc Ab+) are permitted with the following requirements: Serum HBV DNA PCR should be tested and if it is above the limit of detection at screening then antiviral therapy for HBV must be initiated prior to study entry. If serum HBV DNA PCR is below the limit of detection periodic monitoring of HBsAg must be performed every 12 months +/- 3 months.\n   4. Participants who are Hepatitis C virus antibody positive (HCV Ab +) who have controlled infection (undetectable HCV RNA by PCR either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior course of anti-HCV therapy) are permitted.\n9. Any underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea, uncontrolled nausea or vomiting. Patients with active COVID-19 disease as indicated by a positive polymerase reaction (PCR) test are excluded. Participants with previous COVID-19 disease are allowed if \u226530 days from last positive test, and COVID-19 symptoms have resolved and/or PCR test is now negative.\n10. Participants must not be scheduled to receive another experimental drug while on this study.\n11.
