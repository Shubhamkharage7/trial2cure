The word \"Idiopathic\" refers to \"unknown cause\", and as such the study participants have/had short stature with no identifiable medical cause. The purpose of the study is to identify differences in the genetic characteristics of participants who responded well or poorly to growth hormone therapy. No medications or other treatments are provided to the participants by Novo Nordisk as part of this study. The study will last for up to 1 year. The participants will attend their usual doctor's appointments. If the participants are not usually visiting the clinic, they will need to do it only once as part of this study. If the participant agrees to take part in the study, they will be asked to read and sign the 'Agreement to take part form'."
