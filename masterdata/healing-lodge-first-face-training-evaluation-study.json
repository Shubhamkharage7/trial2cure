This program will train community members in how to recognize and respond to youth and adults experiencing mental health crises and ways to serve as a bridge between these individuals and the help they need. All Healing Lodge staff are being asked to complete First Face training.\n\nTo evaluate First Face, the investigators will ask all trainees to complete surveys before and after training, and again 3 months later. These surveys will measure knowledge about mental health and addiction, as well as the ability and confidence to respond appropriately to mental health crises. The study will help the investigators understand whether the First Face training program influences mental health and attitudes, as well as responses to mental health crisis situations.",
            "detailedDescription": "With funding from the National Institutes for Health, the investigators created First Face for Mental Health. First Face is a culturally-appropriate community-based mental health training that prepares trainees to provide assistance to someone having a mental health crisis. The more community members within Tribal nations who are trained in a culturally sensitive program to provide support to youth in recovery and members struggling with mental health problems or crises, the better positioned that community is to create a supportive recovery environment for its youth. The investigators are in the process of launching First Face trainings and evaluations among several Tribal communities. Additionally, they will be training staff from the Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations (HL) in the First Face program. This particular application concerns the evaluation of First Face training among HL staff. The investigators will measure primary and secondary outcomes at pre-training, post-training, and 3-month follow-up."
