Amyloid is a protein related to dementia of Alzheimer's disease. 11C-PIB PET imaging and MRI of the brain will also be completed in the same participants and the data will be compared with 18F-Fluselenmayl. 11C-PIB and 18F-Fluselenamyl both bind to beta-amyloid plaques.\n\nFinally, a comparison of the normal control participants to patients with Alzheimer's disease will be completed."
