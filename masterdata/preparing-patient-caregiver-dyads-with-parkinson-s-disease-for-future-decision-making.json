Earlier conversations about future medical decisions between persons with Parkinson's disease and family care partners are needed before communication and cognitive difficulties become severe. In this study, the investigators will pilot test a novel dyadic intervention to help persons with Parkinson's disease and family care partners make future medical decisions. The investigators hypothesize the intervention will be feasible and acceptable among persons with Parkinson's disease and family care partners.",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators are looking for pairs of participants consisting of a person with a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, and a family care partner who is most likely to help make medical decisions in the future.\n\nFor this study, pairs will complete a survey to understand how engaged participants are in discussing future medical decisions, demographics, and the severity of Parkinson's disease. This survey will take about half an hour. Then, participants will work through a medical decision making support intervention together. Completing the intervention in-person, on the phone, or via video conferencing is acceptable. The resources will provide information on future medical decisions participants may need to make. The intervention is completely online and will take about 30 minutes to complete. Participants will have 2 weeks to complete the intervention.\n\nThe investigators will call participants a week after enrollment to ask about technical difficulties completing the intervention, provide assistance with intervention material navigation as needed, and answer questions about the intervention. Participants will receive another online survey 2 weeks after enrollment to understand engagement in discussing future medical decisions, and acceptability of the intervention. The 2 week survey will take about 15 minutes to complete."
