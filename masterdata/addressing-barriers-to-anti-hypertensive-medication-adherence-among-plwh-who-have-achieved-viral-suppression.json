            "briefSummary": "Among those with hypertension, persons living with HIV (PWH) have a 50% higher risk of incident myocardial infarction compared to the general population, and they often fail to meet evidence-based treatment goals for hypertension. An important contributing factor for insufficient blood pressure control is non-adherence to antihypertensive medications. Research on medication adherence for PWH has largely focused on antiretroviral therapy adherence with limited focus on adherence to other non-AIDS condition medications.\n\nWith a large proportion of PWH in the U.S. achieving viral suppression, providers may now have an opportunity to focus on the management of non-AIDS conditions like hypertension. However, because PWH who have achieved suppression have reduced clinic encounters (once or twice a year) there is potential loss of opportunity to effectively monitor and intensify hypertension treatment as needed an important opportunity to focus on preventing cardiovascular disease. CVD and other non-AIDS comorbidities.\n\nThe study's overarching goal is to improve the hypertension outcomes for PWH on suppressive ART to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. In this study, we will identify and evaluate healthcare and patient-level factors that must be addressed in an intervention to increase hypertension medication adherence for PWH who have achieved viral suppression. We will use these factors to tailor an intervention and assess the feasibility and acceptability at the Duke ID clinic.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is divided into 5 separate groups, Aim 1A, Aim 1B, Aim 2, Aim 3A and Aim 3B. Aims 1A and 1B will identify and evaluate patient-level factors that must be addressed in an intervention to increase hypertension medication adherence for (persons living with HIV) PWH who have achieved viral suppression. Aim 2 will identify HIV providers' practice norms after their patients achieve viral suppression and explore barriers faced in monitoring and managing patient adherence to antihypertensive medications to inform an intervention aimed at increasing antihypertensive medication adherence. Aim 3A will adapt the health care delivery intervention components to the Duke ID clinic context with key stakeholder input and data from Aims 1 and 2. Aim 3B will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted health care delivery intervention to improve anti-hypertensive medication adherence and BP control in PWH at 24 weeks."
