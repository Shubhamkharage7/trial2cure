            "briefSummary": "Prostate cancer is a significant concern for Latin\u00e9 men, with over 17,000 new cases annually. Decision-making for treatment is complex, especially due to barriers like low health literacy and cultural factors. Research on survivorship and post-treatment issues like erectile dysfunction is lacking. To improve care, a study will engage 288 participants across various medical facilities, including 100 at Cleveland Clinic. Thirty subjects will participate in focus groups representing Spanish-speaking Latin\u00e9, bilingual Latin\u00e9, and English-speaking non-Latin\u00e9 individuals to understand their perspectives and enhance communication. This aims to develop tailored resources, like Spanish-language educational videos, addressing language and cultural needs for informed decision-making.",
            "detailedDescription": "Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among Latin\u00e9 men, with over 17,000 new cases yearly. While most men live with the disease rather than die from it, ensuring quality of life is crucial in treatment decisions. Latin\u00e9 men face unique decision-making challenges due to low health literacy, barriers to healthcare access, and cultural differences in treatment understanding and communication. Decision aids that consider patient values and cultural nuances like familismo are essential for effective shared decision-making.\n\nDespite the significance of racial and ethnic disparities in prostate cancer outcomes, research has been limited, especially among Latin\u00e9 populations. The CEASAR study highlighted the need for more inclusive research, showing no significant outcome differences across racial groups but underrepresenting Latin\u00e9 men. The Urology Care Foundation has provided Spanish-language resources, yet there's a gap in materials discussing treatment choices in the context of sexual, bowel and urinary health post-treatment.\n\nThis gap underlines the necessity for research focused on the Latin\u00e9 community's perspectives on prostate cancer survivorship, particularly concerning erectile dysfunction, bowel function and urinary function. This study aims to fill this void through focus groups to better understand Latin\u00e9 men's views and enhance patient education and shared decision-making. A Spanish-language educational video informed by these insights will address the critical need for culturally and linguistically appropriate resources, bridging the information gap for Spanish-speaking survivors"
