The Registry is a web-based platform to distribute cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys. Study surveys are designed based on input from advisor experts, including patients and caregivers, and focus on the social, emotional, physical, financial and decision-making experiences of those who have been diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers. Findings contribute toward enhancing care for patients, survivors and caregivers via programming and policy initiatives.",
            "detailedDescription": "The aims of the Registry are to: 1) better understand the psychosocial experiences and needs of people who have been impacted by cancer, including patients, survivors and caregivers; 2) inform the research community, healthcare providers, patient advocates and policy makers around gaps in care and the psychosocial challenges of people affected by cancer; 3) use the findings to develop and disseminate tailored (data-guided) programs and services that will address the emotional and social needs and ultimately improve the long-term quality of life of people affected by cancer; 4) link registrants to cancer related resources and programs via an online, modifiable platform; and 5) provide collaborating sites (e.g., hospitals/health networks/CSC affiliates) with aggregated reports on quality and needs of members or customers to enhance or improve quality of care.\n\nFindings from the Registry are disseminated online at https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/sites/default/files/file/2020-07/CSC_Registry_Report_June_2020.pdf"
