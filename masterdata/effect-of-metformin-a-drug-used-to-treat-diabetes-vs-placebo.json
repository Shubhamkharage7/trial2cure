            "briefSummary": "Metformin is a drug used to treat patients with diabetes. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of Metformin along with a low-calorie diet on obese and/or overweight adults with an increased waist measurement. In addition, the study also aims to look at the effect of the drug vs. placebo on quality of life and physical activity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Obesity is a growing epidemic in the United States. Weight gain is associated with an increased risk of developing life-threatening conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Therefore, there is great interest in developing non-invasive treatments to help combat obesity. Currently, there are only few weight-loss drugs available for the treatment of obesity. In the more recent past, GLP-1 analogues (a type of non-insulin medication used to treat patients with diabetes) are being promoted as a new strategy to lose weight without major side effects however, with high costs and challenging supply chain issues.\n\nThis is a double-blinded, randomized study. This means that participants will be assigned to one of two groups. Participants will have a 1:1 chance of being assigned to receive either the study drug or a placebo (a capsule that does not contain the active ingredients). This assignment will be determined by chance. The process is similar to drawing cards or picking straws. This means your assignment to one of the groups is based on chance and not a medical decision made by the study doctor. In addition, neither participants nor the investigators will know what groups participants have been assigned to.\n\nDuring this study, your participation will last up to 26 weeks (including screen) with a total of 8 clinic visits. Participants will undergo a total of 5 blood draws, blood samples will be taken at screen baseline and weeks 8, 16 and 24."
