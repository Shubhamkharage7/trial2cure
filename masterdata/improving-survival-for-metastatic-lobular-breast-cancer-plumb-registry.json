To understand the natural history, treatment patterns, and overall survival in patients with metastatic ILC using modern, real-world data.\n\nSecondary Aims:\n\n1. To evaluate the correlation between imaging findings and disease progression.\n2. To evaluate the correlation between ctDNA and disease progression.\n3. To develop an ongoing platform for evaluating new imaging tools, tumor markers, and participant recruitment for clinical trials.\n\nOutline:\n\nParticipants will be recruited to participate in the registry during a regularly scheduled clinic visit with their treating oncologist, and consented to participate at this time. At each evaluation time point, participants will have a blood draw performed. Participants will be followed until loss to follow up, death, or withdrawal from the registry."
