All cohorts will include participants receiving active treatment with SR604 and the other participant receiving matching placebo.\n\nIn Part B (multiple ascending dose \\[MAD\\]): Participants with severe Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B, with or without inhibitors, will be enrolled in 4 cohorts with four dose levels and is planned to receive SR604 subcutaneously.\n\nThe overall duration of study participation will be approximately 3 months."

Any condition for which, in the opinion of the Investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant or could prevent, limit or confound protocol-specified assessments.\n* Participants with a history of all types of thrombosis, including any arterial and/or venous thrombosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, or embolism. Additionally, participants with a history of thrombotic microangiopathy, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (TIA), or abnormal findings in any prior laboratory thrombophilia evaluation will be excluded.\n\nPart B:\n\n* Participants with a history of all types of thrombosis, including any arterial and/or venous thrombosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, or embolism. Additionally, participants with a history of thrombotic microangiopathy, stroke, and TIA, or abnormal findings in any prior laboratory thrombophilia evaluation will be excluded.\n* History of one or more of the following in participants and/or family members:\n\n  1.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\> 1.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN);\n  2. Total bilirubin \u02c33.0 \u00d7 ULN and direct bilirubin \u02c31.5 \u00d7 ULN (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome).\n* Calculated creatinine clearance \u02c2 60 mL/min using the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula at the Screening Visit.\n* Participant has positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. a) If participants test positive for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), additional tests including hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis B viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be conducted to determine if there is an active infection. Participants with active infection will be excluded from the study.; b) Participants who test positive for hepatitis C virus antibody will be required to have a negative result for hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) PCR before enrollment. Individuals with positive results for hepatitis C PCR will be excluded from the study.\n* Chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh class C hepatic impairment), or history of liver or kidney transplants.\n* Injury, trauma, and/or major surgery (mediastinoscopy, insertion of a central venous access device, and insertion of a feeding tube are not considered major surgery), major dental procedures (extractions, etc.) within 4 weeks of the first dose of SR604 or planned surgery during the study.\n* Active infection requiring systemic antibiotic or antiviral therapy or in a sepsis condition within 14 days prior to the first dose of SR604.\n* Any medical condition (eg, diabetes, obesity) which, in the Investigator's opinion, could compromise participant safety, interfere with SR604 metabolism, or put the study outcome at undue risk.",
