            "briefSummary": "Stress, when left unmanaged, can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health, contributing to conditions such as high blood pressure, anxiety, and even cardiovascular disease. Effective stress management therapies may help maintain overall well-being and reduce the risk of long-term health complications. The Primal Reflex Release Technique (PRRT) is a novel manual therapy that may reduce markers related to stress such as heart rate variability (HRV) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to elucidate the potential for PRRT to improve HRV and PROs.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized, controlled experimental intervention study evaluates acute impacts of a reflex-targeted manual therapy called Primal Reflex Release Technique (PRRT) on cardiovascular indices of stress and sympathetic tone. After consenting and baseline characteristics, subjects are allocated to receive either the PRRT or the control condition.\n\nContinuous electrocardiography (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) monitoring will be used to track heart rate variability (HRV) changes across three phases:\n\n1. Pre-intervention during a 5-minute video of aquatic nature scenes to establish resting baseline\n2. 5 minutes of a practitioner administering targeted spinal manipulation PRRT protocol in the treatment group to stimulate innate protective reflexes OR continued relaxation video viewing for control group\n3. Post-intervention repeat of the standardized video to assess changes after PRRT session without ongoing manipulation\n\nThe PRRT targets precise anatomical locations and neural pathways including stimulating facial muscles, upper spinal reflexes and traction of the suboccipital muscles. Brief, reversible sensations will occur without expected harm or lasting effects.\n\nPsychological state assessed via paper mood scales pre/post tracks subjective stress correlates. Analysis using linear mixed effects models contrast whether indices of cardiovascular reactivity and psychological responses shift acutely with PRRT versus control video. Findings could provide physiological validation for integration as stress-alleviating treatment."
