            "briefSummary": "Long-term weight loss maintenance is seldom achieved by individuals with obesity owing to numerous biological adaptations occurring in the post-weight loss setting, including neuroendocrine-mediated changes in appetite/satiety and reduction of energy expenditure. Following weight loss, peripheral and central mechanisms respond in a way similar to starvation by conveying a sense that energy reserves have dwindled, activating a strong counter-response to increase caloric intake. Moreover, metabolic rate drops, further compounding the propensity for weight rebound. Adolescents with severe obesity are not immune to the vexing issue of weight regain; therefore, effective and scalable treatments are urgently needed. Pharmacotherapy has the potential to prevent weight regain by targeting counter-regulatory mechanisms in the post-weight loss setting. Unfortunately, only one obesity medication is FDA-approved for long-term use in adolescents and is seldom prescribed owing to modest efficacy and notable side effects. Among the most promising candidates in the pediatric pipeline is the combination of phentermine and topiramate, which is the most effective adult weight loss medication currently available. The mechanisms of action are thought to reduce appetite, enhance satiety, and potentially increase energy expenditure, making this medication particularly well-suited for the purpose of weight loss maintenance since it targets many of the biological adaptations known to induce relapse and subsequent weight regain. The investigators have generated preliminary data demonstrating that both phentermine and topiramate reduce BMI in adolescents with severe obesity and have acceptable safety profiles. In this clinical trial, the investigators will utilize combination phentermine/topiramate to target counter-regulatory pathways responsible for weight regain after meal replacement therapy (structured meals of known caloric content) in adolescents with severe obesity with a goal of enhancing weight loss maintenance and improving obesity-related complications. Importantly, the investigators will maximize the clinical utility and overall impact of the study by comprehensively characterizing the safety of phentermine/topiramate utilizing sensitive measures of cardiac autonomic function, arterial stiffness, cognition, and bone health as well as examine the extent to which this medication counteracts mechanisms of weight regain.",
            "detailedDescription": "Severe obesity, afflicting \\~8% of adolescents in the U.S., is a serious and challenging medical and public health problem. The number and levels of cardiovascular risk factors are considerably higher in the context of severe obesity compared to milder forms of obesity. Approximately 85% of youth with severe obesity have \u22651 cardiovascular risk factor. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is highly-prevalent among adolescents with severe obesity with estimates nearing 60%. Subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial stiffening is present in youth with severe obesity at levels similar to those with type 2 diabetes. Youth with severe obesity have high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, adverse adipokine profiles, and arterial endothelial activation. Moreover, longitudinal data implicate obesity in childhood as a strong predictor of future risk factor clustering and sub-clinical atherosclerosis in adulthood. Risk of developing type 2 diabetes is high in youth with severe obesity. Severe obesity in adolescence is associated with chronic disability from a wide range of causes later in life. Perhaps most disturbing is the poor long-term prognosis for these youth. Approximately 90% will have a BMI \u226535 kg/m2 in adulthood. Disturbingly, severe obesity in adulthood reduces life expectancy by 7-14 years.\n\nIn the field of obesity management, weight loss maintenance has proven to be an arduous challenge. Indeed, long-term weight loss maintenance is seldom achieved owing to numerous biological adaptations occurring in the post-weight loss setting. These include, but are not limited to, neuroendocrine changes in the gut-brain axis influencing appetite and satiety and reduction of energy expenditure. Following weight loss, peripheral and central mechanisms respond in a way similar to starvation by conveying a sense that energy reserves have dwindled, activating a strong and persistent counter-response to increase caloric intake. Moreover, metabolic rate decreases, further compounding the propensity for weight rebound. These counter-regulatory adaptations persist for many years following initial weight loss, and in fact might be permanent.\n\nAdolescents with severe obesity (BMI \u2265120% above the 95th percentile or BMI \u226535 kg/m2) are not immune to the vexing issue of weight regain as evidenced by the poor outcomes of interventions using lifestyle modification alone.22-25 Indeed, large clinic-based studies from Europe and the U.S. reported that only a small fraction of patients were able to achieve and maintain clinically-meaningful weight loss with lifestyle modification therapy. Metabolic/bariatric surgery is an effective treatment but uptake is very low and many pediatricians and parents are concerned about the irreversible nature of this treatment and worry about the possibility of long-term (decades) risks, which are currently unknown. Therefore, a large treatment gap exists between lifestyle modification therapy and metabolic/bariatric surgery that remains unfilled.\n\nPharmacotherapy has the potential to prevent weight regain by targeting counter-regulatory mechanisms in the post-weight loss setting, with various agents demonstrating improved long-term weight loss durability in adults. Unfortunately, pediatric options are limited as only one obesity medication is approved for use among adolescents for long-term use (orlistat), and is rarely prescribed because of modest efficacy and notable side effects. Among the most promising candidates in the pediatric pipeline, owing to its relatively high degree of efficacy compared to other medications, is the combination of phentermine and topiramate, which is the most effective FDA-approved adult obesity medication currently available. Placebo-subtracted weight loss at one and two years with phentermine/topiramate is 9% at the top dose in adult trials. The mechanisms of action of phentermine/topiramate, which together are thought to reduce appetite, enhance satiety, and potentially increase energy expenditure, are well-suited for the purpose of weight loss maintenance since they target many of the biological adaptations known to induce relapse and subsequent regain.\n\nThe rationale for specifically focusing on phentermine/topiramate (vs. other medications) to prevent weight regain is supported by its multiple mechanisms of action, which are thought to target many of the post-weight loss counter-regulatory biological adaptations known to induce relapse. These mechanisms include: 1) reducing appetite through inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake (phentermine) and reduction of hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission (topiramate) and lowering the levels of neuropeptide Y (topiramate); 2) enhancing satiety by slowing gastric emptying (combination of phentermine/topiramate); and 3) increasing energy expenditure (both phentermine and topiramate independently). Through these mechanisms of action, sustained weight loss has been demonstrated with phentermine/topiramate treatment in adults. While other obesity medications target some of these pathways, their respective mechanisms of action are generally less comprehensive, and accordingly have lower efficacy, ranging from 3-5% placebo-subtracted weight reduction at 1 year.\n\nIn terms of safety, topiramate is FDA-approved in children and adolescents for the treatment of seizures and migraine headaches with a reasonable safety track-record. Importantly, the investigators observed no signal of cognitive problems in a pilot clinical trial of topiramate for the treatment of obesity. Phentermine is FDA-approved for short-term use in ages \\>16 years old for treatment of obesity and is the most widely-prescribed adult obesity medication in the U.S. Although in a distinct medication class, phentermine is not dissimilar in mechanism of action and side effects to many of the stimulant medications widely-prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in youth. Adult data suggest no adverse cardiovascular effects or increased risk of addiction potential or withdrawal symptoms associated with phentermine use and the investigator's clinical experience with phentermine in adolescents with obesity demonstrated an acceptable safety profile."
