Demographic information and adverse experiences will be documented during the baseline research session. Participants will be asked to document (weekly) current nasal symptoms and SinuSonic usage.",
            "detailedDescription": "All data collection will occur remotely using REDCap (via University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and SinuSonic use will take place in participants' homes. As this is a single-arm, feasibility/pilot study, all participants will follow the same protocol.\n\n1. Baseline Research Session: self-report completion of demographic information, health information \\[Short Form Health Survey (SF-20), Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)\\], autonomic reactivity (Body Perception Questionnaire, BPQ), anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), and adverse experiences (Adverse Traumatic Experiences Scale, ATES).\n2. Begin use of SinuSonic twice per day, every day, for 5 weeks. Duration of each use is approximately 2 minutes. During these 5 weeks, participants will be asked to complete weekly forms to document SinuSonic usage and current nasal symptoms \\[Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS).\n3. Post-intervention Research Session: after 5 weeks of SinuSonic use, self-report completion of symptoms (PGIC, TNSS), autonomic reactivity (BPQ) and anxiety/depression (HADS)."
