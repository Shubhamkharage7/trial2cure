            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the dissemination of the Go Sun Smart Georgia (GSSG) program with Georgia worksites and learn whether the intervention changes the employees' sun protection behavior in outdoor workers in Southwest Georgia.\n\nThe primary aim is to assess program effectiveness by comparing employee sun protection practices between the employers assigned to the GSSG intervention and the employers assigned to the wait-list control group (delayed intervention). The hypothesis that will be tested is that compared to the delayed intervention group, employees at intervention worksites will practice more sun protection during the post-test.\n\nWorksites will be asked to complete internal coach training and participate in technical assistance around sun safety. Study participants will fill out surveys and participate in interviews",
            "detailedDescription": "This project builds on the original Go Sun Smart at Work (GSSW) program-a sun safety educational program delivered to worksite leaders, managers, and workers-that was previously shown to be effective for employers adopting sun safety policies and implementing sun safety education and actions, and improved employees' sun protection behavior (e.g., use of protective clothing).\n\nTo successfully implement and scale up GSSW with outdoor workers in Southwest Georgia-predominantly African American and Hispanic-this intervention must be systematically adapted to ensure program fit to the population and setting while maintaining core program elements. A well-adapted and tailored occupational sun safety program with high dissemination potential will greatly impact this overlooked employee population, reduce health care costs, improve quality of life, and save lives. The adaptation process took place in 2022-2024, and the adapted Go Sun Smart Georgia (GSSG) program will be evaluated in 2024.\n\nGo Sun Smart Georgia (GSSG) is an educational, train-the-trainer, and technical assistance program for Georgia worksites that employ outdoor workers. It will be implemented with worksites assigned to the intervention group in May-Aug 2024 and with worksites assigned to the comparison (delayed intervention) group in Aug - Dec. 2024. The study team will provide worksites with training for internal worksite coaches (the coach(es) will be employee(s) chosen by the worksite to serve as a champion for the program, not part of the study staff and paid by the worksite), training for other internal educators, technical assistance for conducting the program, and employee educational sessions, as needed."
