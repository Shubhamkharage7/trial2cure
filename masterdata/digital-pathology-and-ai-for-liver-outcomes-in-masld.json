            "briefSummary": "The aim of this multi-center, retrospective epidemiologic study is to confirm the prognostic performance of the Digital Pathology (DP) FibroNest Phenotypic Fibrosis Composite Score (Ph-FCS), derived from standard digital pathology liver biopsy images, in predicting clinical hepatic decompensation events in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).",
            "detailedDescription": "MASH, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, presents histological liver changes resembling those caused by alcohol abuse, but in the absence of alcohol intake. Common among adults with conditions like obesity and type-2 diabetes, MASH, especially its severe form, is anticipated to become a leading cause of end-stage liver disease.\n\nCurrently lacking approved treatments, MASH poses a significant burden on liver health and transplantation. Diagnosis and assessment rely on subjective histological review, prone to variability and limitations in detecting subtle changes. Consequently, there's an urgent need for accurate, continuous histological biomarkers.\n\nThe FibroNest Ph-FCS offers a promising solution, utilizing high resolution digital pathology and sophisticated algorithmic methods for sensitive and reproducible fibrosis severity assessment and prediction of clinical events. In a 2003 proof of concept retrospective study on 400 patients, its prognostic performance was excellent.\n\nIn this proposed multi-center retrospective study, we aim to confirm the Ph-FCS's prognostic value on a large cohort of 1,700 MASLD patients. We will also compare the prognostic performance of the Ph-FCS with the prognostic performance of the NASH-CR Fibrosis stages, and with non-invasive biomarkers like Fib-4 and elastography/Fibroscan, also collected retrospectively from the point of initial diagnosis.\n\nThis study seeks to:\n\n(i) Confirm Ph-FCS's prognostic utility on a large scale.\n\n(ii) Compare biopsy-based Ph-FCS with NASH-CRN F Stages\n\n(iii) Compare biopsy-based Ph-FCS with non-invasive biomarkers."
