            "briefSummary": "The Pulmonary Specialist-Health Coach Consultation (PuSHCon) study examines the implementation of health coach-assisted consultations to improve access to specialist care and implementation of specialist recommendations for patients with COPD, asthma, and asthma COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) for low-income and vulnerable patients seen at public health clinics. Three hundred sixty (360) patients from ten clinics will be enrolled in the study and randomized at the individual level to receive health coaching or usual care; 180 patients will receive usual care and 180 patients will receive the PuSHCon model.",
            "detailedDescription": "While evidence-based care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma can substantially reduce disease burden and prevent emergency visits and hospitalizations, it is estimated that 55% of patients with COPD do not receive all recommended care and that less than 50% of patients with asthma are well controlled.\n\nThe proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel model for pulmonary specialist-health coach consultations (PuSHCon) in its ability to increase access to specialty recommendations and the provision of evidence-based care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or asthma receiving care at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The specific aims of the study are to compare the use of evidence-based care and of patient reported outcomes 4 months after the consultation. In addition, the study will evaluate the cost per patient in each model to determine the model's effectiveness in increasing access and lowering cost.\n\nThe first aim of comparing the use of evidence-based care will be measured as the proportion of guideline-based recommendations that are ultimately received by the patients. The secondary endpoint for this aim will be measured through the proportion of patients receiving guideline-concordant medications at 4 months after consultation compared to baseline.\n\nThe second aim of the study regarding patient-reported outcomes will be measured primarily through the change in COPD and/or asthma related quality of life measures from baseline to 4 months post consultation. The secondary measure for this aim will look at changes in COPD and/or asthma specific symptom scores.\n\nThe third aim of the study is to assess the impact of this model on access to care and cost of care. Access will be measured by tracking the number of patients who successfully complete a consultation per month. Costs will be determined by calculating time spent per patients, as well as by health care utilization."
