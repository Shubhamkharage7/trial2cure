            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests a collaborative pain management intervention (ASCENT) for improving cancer pain in rural and Hispanic cancer survivors. Cancer pain is prevalent, under-treated, and remains a major cause of suffering, impairment, and disability for millions of Americans. Individual pain interventions and care models show promise for cancer pain in controlled settings. Hispanic and rural-dwelling cancer survivors stand to benefit the most from electronic health record innovations, as each of these health disparities populations experience profound disparities in pain outcomes, including marked under- and over-prescribing of opioids. Digitally facilitated solutions are especially well matched for these patients, and can be customized to address their needs. The ASCENT intervention provides patients with an educational guide that describes techniques for addressing cancer pain, and uses community health workers and pain care managers to coach patients through a personalized pain management plan. This study may help researchers learn how pain management strategies can improve cancer pain and lower risk of opioid exposure and dependency in rural and Hispanic cancer survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To test a validated collaborative care model-based intervention aimed at improving pain control among rural dwelling and Hispanic cancer survivors by promoting multimodal pain care (MMPC) to reduce inappropriate opioid use and by addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) that impede a patient's access to appropriate care.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive enhanced usual care, which includes access to the educational and pain self-management materials developed for the ASCENT trial (the ASCENT guide).\n\nARM II: Patients receive the ASCENT guide and attend 3 video or phone calls over 30 minutes each with their community health worker (CHW) and/or pain care manager (PCM). During the first call, patients discuss barriers to receiving help for their pain with their CHW. During the second call, patients work with their PCM to develop an action plan for addressing their pain using the different techniques and interventions detailed in the ASCENT guide. During the third and final call, patients meet with both their CHW and PCM to discuss specialist recommendations for their pain management plan. After the final visit, patients will be contacted by the CHW or PCM every other week to monitor their progress and may also be contacted as-needed based on the their reported pain intensity, symptoms, or reported barriers."
