            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase II trial of NEOADJUVANT FOLFIRINOX CHEMOTHERAPY WITH PEMBROLIZUMAB followed by SURGERY and Adjuvant PEMBROLIZUMAB for Patients with LOCALIZED, RESECTABLE Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Investigators hypothesize that appropriately timed neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX with anti-PD-1 mAb (pembrolizumab) can be administered safely and feasibly, and that this combination will lead to improved clinical response associated with enhanced numbers of immune cells in surgically resected pancreatic tumors. Patients will receive 6 cycles of FOLFIRINOX with 2 cycles of PEMBROLIZUMAB before surgical resection. Following surgery patients will receive 5FU based chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles with 7 more cycles of PEMBROLIZUMAB. Patients will receive a total of 9 doses of Q6week cycles of PEMBROLIZUMAB.\n\nToxicities will be continuously monitored using the method proposed by Ivanova et al. \\[Ivanova, A., Qaqish, B.F., and Schell, M.J. (2005). Continuous toxicity monitoring in phase II trials in oncology. Biometrics 61: 540-545.\\]. The method generates a Pocock-type stopping boundary for repeated testing for toxicity. Sequential boundaries will be used to monitor dose-limiting toxicity rate. The accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of dose-limiting toxicities are seen, that is, if the number of dose-limiting toxicities is equal to or exceeds boundary number out of the number of patients with full follow-up. This is a Pocock-type stopping boundary that yields the probability of crossing the boundary at most 5% when the rate of dose-limiting toxicity is equal to the acceptable rate of 25%."

In addition to meeting all of the baseline patient selection criteria, clinical judgment on their susceptibility to infection and expected stability of their performance status and suitability to receive intensive chemotherapy cycles, should be paid special attention to. Patients should not be enrolled in the study should there be any hesitation on any of these considerations. Baseline criteria for all patients enrolled in the study must be carefully evaluated and all criteria followed appropriately.\n12. Patient has evidence of peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 or higher.\n13. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to first intervention (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a second urine pregnancy test will be required. In the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment, another urine pregnancy test must be performed and must be negative in order for the subject to start receiving study medication.\n14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137).\n15.

Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n18. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n19. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n20. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as detectable HCV by RNA) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authorities.\n21. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n22. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n23. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.",
