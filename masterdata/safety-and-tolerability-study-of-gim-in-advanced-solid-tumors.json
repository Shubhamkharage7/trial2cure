The Phase 1 portion will include a dose escalation with GIM-531 administered as a single agent. Additionally, there will be a dose expansion portion at the safety-cleared dose levels with participants allocated 1:1 within the proposed therapeutic range to accrue additional data for determining the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and early anti-tumor activity of GIM-531. In Phase 2, GIM-531will be administered to participants with advanced/metastatic cutaneous melanoma who have progressed following treatment with an anti-PD-1 therapy."
