After scheduling their surgeon visit, the investigators will enroll patients and measure their intended treatment choice, baseline awareness of the three treatment options, expected outcomes, self-efficacy, and activation. The participants will then be randomized 1:1 and deliver the CQUPLE intervention to the intervention group. The control group will receive usual care, which involves providing no disease or treatment specific information outside the surgeon visit. The study team will repeat all measures prior to the surgical consult and after the surgical consult. The study team will record the patients' actual treatment choice after the consult."
