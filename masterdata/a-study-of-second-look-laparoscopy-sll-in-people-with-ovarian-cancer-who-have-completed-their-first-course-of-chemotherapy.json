The researchers will compare the health outcomes of people who have minimal residual disease (MRD-small amounts of cancer cells in the body after a person receives treatment) at the time of SLL with the health outcomes of people who do not have MRD at the time of SLL. The researchers are also doing this study to determine if SLL is safe and practical (feasible) in people with advanced ovarian cancer who have completed the first course of therapy for their disease."
