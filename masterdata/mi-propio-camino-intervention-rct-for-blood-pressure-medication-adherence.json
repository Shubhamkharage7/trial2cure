Participants will be allocated to one of two educational intervention groups following a block randomization schedule, stratified on the hypothesized mediator variable of medication-related beliefs (high versus low scores on the BMQ Necessity-Concerns subscore) to ensure the groups are balanced on this variable. Primary endpoint is medication adherence at 6 month follow-up, defined as the proportion of days that the prescribed number of doses was taken by the patient during a 30-day period, measured by a pill bottle cap monitor (medication events monitoring device \\[MEMS\\])."

Subsequently, the middle of the BP cuff should be positioned on the patient's upper arm ensuring that the correct cuff size is used based on the cuff size criteria from AHA.
