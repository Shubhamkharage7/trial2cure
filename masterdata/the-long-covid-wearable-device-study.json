            "detailedDescription": "This study will have two components:\n\nOne study group will consist of up to 100,000 individuals who own wearable devices and are willing to share their data. These participants will be randomized and will receive educational materials. The investigators will study these dynamic wearable data along with participant survey responses that focus on diagnoses, symptoms, and quality of life to improve disease characterization and understanding of differences within and between individuals.\n\nThe other group in the randomized trial will participants who do not already own a wearable device. The study will distribute wearable devices and pacing educational materials to 500 individuals who do not already own them and experience post-exertional malaise, or the worsening of symptoms following exertion.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that access to personalized information from a wearable device will enable participants to reduce post-exertional malaise. The investigators will include up to 25% individuals whose post-exertional malaise is caused by a condition other than Long COVID-19."
