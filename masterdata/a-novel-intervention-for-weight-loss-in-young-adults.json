Weight loss can prevent these health problems, but current lifestyle interventions have limited success. New, effective strategies are needed to address this rising issue at the population level. The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate how a behavioral intervention combined with technology impacts weight loss in young adults. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n\u2022 How does the combination of behavioral intervention and technology influence weight loss in young adults?",
            "detailedDescription": "The study team is seeking volunteers to participate in a research study to help better understand how a behavioral intervention combined with technology may impact weight loss. Participation will span approximately 6 months. Participants will be required to attend up to 5 visits at the University of Chicago. Those visits will include daytime visits to a clinic involving fasted blood draws and completion of surveys. During the study, participants will regularly record their weight using a digital scale, input their daily food intake into a smartphone app, and wear a wrist activity monitor to track their physical activity. Participants will also be paired with a trained coach to guide and assist their progress over their 6 months of participation."
