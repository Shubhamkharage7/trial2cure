            "briefSummary": "The goal of this prospective trial is to compare CPR skill and attitudes in adolescent students. The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does a gamified CPR experience improve CPR skill retention compared to standard classroom CPR training?\n* Does a gamified CPR experience improve attitudes/knowledge relating to barriers for women and minorities receiving CPR?\n\nParticipants will\n\n* Answer pre-training questionnaires\n* Participate in CPR training\n* Participate in CPR skills testing on the day of training, and at 4-6 months\n* Answer post-training questionnaires\n\nResearchers will compare standard CPR classroom training to the novel gamified CPR training experience, which includes an interactive film, a CPR Trainer spring, and a mobile device app.",
            "detailedDescription": "We will investigate the effectiveness of the gamified CPR experience (Trainer + app + film + software). The study will be a prospective, cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2 arms: control (standard instructor-led CPR training), and gamified experience. The intervention and cluster randomization will occur at the classroom level and outcomes reported at the individual level. We assume negligible intra-class correlation because classes will be randomized in an alternating fashion to eliminate time-of-day differences. For example, 1st period is randomized to control, 2nd period to game.\n\nCPR training (control or game method) will occur at the beginning of each semester in 8th or 9th grade Health class. Immediately after training, students will perform 2-min of CC, while the app silently measures CC rate and depth. Pre- and post-training questionnaires assessing knowledge and response to female-specific and ethnic CPR barriers will be administered via paper-pencil. At the end of the semester (4 months), students will again perform 2-min of CC and answer questionnaires. All data will be collected on-site in paper-pencil format, and entered into Excel by research coordinator off-site. All data will be de-identified and reported in aggregate form"
