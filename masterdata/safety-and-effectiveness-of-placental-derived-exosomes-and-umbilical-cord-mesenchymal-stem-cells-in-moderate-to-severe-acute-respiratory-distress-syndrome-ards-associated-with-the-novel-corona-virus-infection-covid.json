            "briefSummary": "Recent advances have been made in prevention of the viral infection via vaccines but there is still need for effective treatment options for patients. Novel therapies need to be developed to further improve clinical outcomes. The biggest medical challenge in the response to COVID-19 is ARDS requiring hospitalization in an intensive care setting and ventilator dependence. Intravenously administered umbilical cord derived exosomes and stem cells have been reported in literature to alleviate pulmonary distress in such patients.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the safety and benefits of intravenous administration of WJPure and EVPure in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS. .",
            "detailedDescription": "One of the hallmark features of the progression of COVID-19 is lung injury from the viral infection leading to potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. In patients who survive ARDS, regardless of the pathology, there is evidence that their long-term quality of life is adversely affected.\n\nThe rationale for the dose and dosing regimen proposed in this study is based on the safe administration and benefits of this treatment regimen reported to us last year by physicians trying to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. In those reports, the intravenous route of administration was used. It has been reported that dosing every 2 days amplified the benefit of the combination of exosomes and mesenchymal stem cells. It has been suggested based on clinical experience that the exosomes and MSCs are complementary to one another as well as enhancing the innate abilities of both.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, intravenous infusion of a mixture of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 was reported to benefit hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 related ARDS. This study is designed to systematically explore the risk and benefits of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS.\n\nThis is a proof of concept, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion of EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122, versus placebo, for use in the treatment of moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19. This is an add-on treatment study; subjects will be allowed to take standard of care treatments available.\n\nThe study will have two arms (n=10 each):\n\n1. Experimental/treatment arm: EV-Pure\u2122 and WJ-Pure\u2122 plus standard care\n2. Placebo: Cryopreservation media plus standard care\n\nThe study duration would be 5 days of treatment plus 12 weeks follow up."
