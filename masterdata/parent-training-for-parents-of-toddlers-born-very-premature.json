            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to test the effects of the ezParent (web-based parent training program) intervention and telephone coaching calls (coach) on parent and child outcomes after 3-, 6-, and 12-months. Parents (n=220) will be randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to: (1) ezParent+coach, (2) ezParent, (3) Active Control+coach, or (4) Active control. The investigators will address these aims:\n\n1. Determine the independent and combined effects of ezParent and coaching calls on parent outcomes. H1: The ezParent and ezParent+coach groups will report greater improvements in parenting skills and self-efficacy and reductions in harsh and negative discipline; and exhibit observed improvements in parent-child emotional connection vs. active control H2: There will be a synergistic effect of ezParent and coaching calls on parent outcomes such that ezParent+coach will provide greater benefit than the sum of the main effects of ezParent or coaching calls.\n2. Determine the independent and combined effects of ezParent and coaching calls on child outcomes. H3: The ezParent and ezParent+coach groups will report greater reductions in child behavior problems vs. active control. H4: There will be a synergistic effect of ezParent and coaching calls on child outcomes such that ezParent+coach will provide greater benefit than the sum of the main effects of ezParent or coaching calls.\n3. Determine differences in ezParent engagement with and without coaching calls. Engagement will be assessed by frequency (the number of times parents use the program), activity (proportion of material completed), and duration (amount of time parents use the program). H5: Relative to the ezParent only group, the ezParent+coach group will exhibit higher engagement with the ezParent.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to test the separate and combined effects of the ezParent behavioral parent training (BPT) program and coaching calls on parent and former very preterm (VPT) child outcomes. Currently, there is no effective, accessible BPT intervention for parents of former VPT infants. The goal is to develop a widely accessible and effective form of BPT delivery to address the unmet and unique needs of parents of VPT children. This is a critical gap, because without such tailored intervention, early behavior problems will persist and impair individual and family functioning over the long term.\n\nA 2x2 factorial randomized design will be used with parent-child dyads (n=220) of children age 20-30 months corrected age (CA) who were born VPT (\\<32 weeks gestational age). Parent-child dyads will be randomized into one of four groups: (1) ezParent+coach, (2) ezParent, (3) Active Control+coach, or (4) Active Control. Parent and child outcome data will be collected at 4 time points (baseline; 3 months post-baseline; 6 months post-baseline; 12 months post-baseline).\n\nThe specific aims are to determine the independent and combined effects of ezParent and coaching calls on parent outcomes and child outcomes and to identify differences in ezParent engagement with and without coaching calls. Study hypotheses are:\n\n1. Parents in the ezParent and ezParent+coach groups will report greater improvements in parenting skills and self-efficacy and reductions in harsh and negative discipline; and exhibit observed improvements in parent-child emotional connection vs. active control.\n2. There will be a synergistic effect of ezParent and coaching calls on parent outcomes such that ezParent+coach will provide greater benefit than the sum of the main effects of ezParent or coaching calls.\n3. Parents in the ezParent and ezParent+coach groups will report greater reductions in child behavior problems vs. active control.\n4. There will be a synergistic effect of ezParent and coaching calls on child outcomes such that ezParent+coach will provide greater benefit than the sum of the main effects of ezParent or coaching calls.\n5. Relative to the ezParent only group, the ezParent+coach group will exhibit higher engagement with the ezParent.\n\nParent-child dyads (n=220) will be recruited for this study from 2 large pediatric academic medical centers that care for large and diverse populations of children born preterm (Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH), Columbus, OH, and Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), Chicago IL). Recruitment will be coordinated through RUMC and NCH's NICU follow-up clinics. Recruitment methods include: (a) in person recruitment by trained Research Assistants (RAs) at scheduled NICU follow up clinic appointments, (b) study information provided by NICU follow up clinics, and (c) direct mailings (email and postal) to parents with children in the eligible age range generated through the NICU follow up clinics via listservs and patient lists.\n\nAfter consent and completion of baseline surveys, parent-child dyads are randomized to one of four groups: ezParent, ezParent+coach, control, or control+coach. Based on participants' random group assignments, parents will receive instructions on the use of the assigned digital intervention and if parents are in a coaching group will schedule their first coaching call. The intervention period is 10-weeks. Parents in all groups will complete their digital program during that 10-weeks and parents in coaching groups will participate in weekly, brief (\\~15 minutes) coaching calls. Intervention activities are for parents only. There is no active child involvement during the intervention period. However, children may experience changes in parent behavior based on their receipt of the intervention content.\n\nThe ezParent Program is a 6-module digital adaptation of the group-based Chicago Parent Program (CPP). The CPP is an evidence-based, 12-session program for parents of young children. The purpose of the program is to strengthen parenting, decrease child d behavior problems, and increase child prosocial behavior. Each module includes: a video narrator describing parenting strategies; video vignettes of parents and children as examples of how parenting strategies work; questions following each vignette for parents to reflect upon; interactive activities for parents to complete; knowledge questions to assess parent understanding of the strategies; and practice assignments. The control program includes six topic areas are: Immunizations, Common Childhood Illnesses, Nutrition, Dental Health, and Indoor and Outdoor Injury Prevention/Safety. The program includes digital handouts, websites, and resources provided to parents of children in this age group.\n\nParents in the coaching groups will receive brief (\\~15 min) weekly telephone coaching calls to provide parents with an opportunity to receive clarification of intervention content (e.g., ezParent or control), encouragement and reinforcement of intervention completion, and support tailoring of intervention content for their child.\n\nParents will complete surveys and observations at 3-month post-baseline and surveys at 6 months and 12 months post-baseline."
