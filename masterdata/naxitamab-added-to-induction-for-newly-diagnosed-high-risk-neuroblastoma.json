            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, multicenter clinical trial in subjects with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma to evaluate the efficacy and safety of administering naxitamab with standard induction therapy. The initial chemotherapy will include 5 cycles of multi-agent chemotherapy. Naxitamab will be added to all 5 Induction cycles. Subjects with an ALK mutation or amplification will have ceritinib added to their treatment regimen as soon as results are available. We hypothesize that the addition of anti-GD2 therapy to induction chemotherapy will result in improved end of induction responses and improved survival.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multicenter clinical trial in subjects with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma to evaluate the efficacy and safety of administering naxitamab with standard induction therapy.\n\nAll subjects will be followed for disease response, event free survival, overall survival and toxicity. Extent of disease will be measured and assessed for changes throughout the course of the study. All efficacy analyses will be performed on the evaluable population which will consist of all enrolled subjects (subjects who initiate treatment with naxitamab in combination with GM-CSF plus standard induction therapy) and who have measurable disease at baseline.\n\nThe initial chemotherapy Induction regimen will utilize sequential administration of 5 cycles of multi-agent chemotherapy. Naxitamab will be added to all 5 Induction cycles.\n\nSubjects with an activating ALK mutation or ALK amplification will have ceritinib added to their treatment regimen as soon as results are available.\n\nStem cell mobilization and collection will occur after the 2nd cycle of induction.\n\nSurgical resection of the primary tumor will ideally occur after the 4th cycle of Induction but may be delayed until after the 5th cycle of Induction if medically necessary.\n\nDisease status evaluations will occur at the following time points: (1) pre-treatment, (2) post Cycle 2 Induction (3) Prior to surgical resection (if performed), (4) End of Induction (which includes surgery and 5 cycles of chemotherapy), and (5) End of Additional/Salvage Therapy as needed.\n\nThe current standard of care for high-risk neuroblastoma involves 5-7 cycles of induction chemotherapy with surgical removal of the tumor after 4-5 cycles of chemotherapy, followed by high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplant, then radiation to the primary tumor bed, followed by anti-GD2 immunotherapy and cis retinoic acid. This results in a less than 60% disease free survival for high-risk NB, a survival rate that still greatly needs improvement. Two areas in which improvements can be made include: 1) to improve response rate to induction chemotherapy and 2) to improve EFS by improving maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.\n\nWe hypothesize that the addition of anti-GD2 therapy to induction chemotherapy will result in improved end of induction responses and improved survival."
