In part 1, the safety and tolerability of YL211 in patients with selected advanced solid tumors will be evaluated and the MTD and RED will be determined.\n\nPart 2 is backfill enrollment part. We will further estimate the safety and efficacy of YL211 in patients with selected adcance tumor to select the RED(s) of YL211.\n\nPart 3 is dose-expansion part. In this part, we will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of YL211 at the MTD/RED(s) in patients with selected advanced solid tumors YL211 will be administered intravenously (IV) until criteria of treatment discontinuation are met."
