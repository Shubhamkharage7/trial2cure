            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C MR metabolic imaging as a new and unique tool for evaluating tumor burden and detecting early response to therapy in participants with glioma.\n\nII. To define the most appropriate imaging parameters for obtaining hyperpolarized 13C data from the brain, one hundred participants with evidence of residual disease from a prior MRI examination will have hyperpolarized metabolic imaging after receiving one or two injections of hyperpolarized 13 C pyruvate. For participants who are willing to receive two injections, the 2nd injection will be used to assess reproducibility, evaluate the performance of new acquisition methods, or compare metabolism between \\[1-13C\\]pyruvate and \\[213C\\]pyruvate.\n\nIII. To establish the time course of changes in hyperpolarized pyruvate and lactate peaks on a voxel by voxel basis from the dynamic hyperpolarized data after the injection(s) of hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate. Twenty participants will be studied before and after treatment with treatment in order to determine the time course of delivery of 13C pyruvate and the location of maximum pyruvate and lactate or glutamate signals in normal brain and in the region of T2 hyperintensity (T2L).\n\nIV. To evaluate if participants who receive treatment with standard radiation and temozolomide exhibit a reduction in hyperpolarized 13C lactate/pyruvate or 13C glutamate/pyruvate at post-radiation follow-up compared to their baseline scan. A second group of twenty participants will be studied at the time determined from the prior group to provide the maximum contrast between lactate/pyruvate or glutamate/pyruvate in the lesion versus normal brain.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Participants receive one or two hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate injections intravenously (IV) and undergo MRI.\n\nCOHORT II: Participants receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRI before treatment and 4 weeks after completion of treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed for up to 24 months."
