            "detailedDescription": "Patients will receive a total of six treatment cycles, at 3-week intervals. The study will use an IP neoadjuvant approach (IP chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP rintatolimod and IV infusion of pembrolizumab), followed by interval cytoreduction (usually laparoscopically) of residual tumor. Cytoreduction will occur approximately 4 weeks after the fourth treatment cycle. Post-surgery the investigators will consolidate with 2 additional courses of same chemo-immunotherapy regimen. Catheter will be removed 12 weeks after the last treatment. All surgical procedures, if done laparoscopically, are outpatient and will yield up to three serial biopsies of the tumor sites: 1) at catheter placement; 2) at interval cytoreduction which consists of removal of any visible tumor sites and the site biopsied initially whether tumor is present or not; 3) at catheter removal, when site of first tumor biopsy will be re-biopsied for pathologic response."

Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n7. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n   o Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n8. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n9. Patients with tumors of low malignant potential, except ovarian pseudomyxomas, or with no peritoneal disease.\n10. Concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study drug, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma, non- melanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer or per physician discretion that the previous cancer was adequately treated with curative intent and unlikely to recur (the study PI must concur with this determination).\n11. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n12. Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n13. Has a known allergy to cisplatin chemotherapy. Patients with carboplatin allergy may be included if they tolerate a test dose of IV cisplatin given in monitored floor conditions.\n14. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n15. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n16. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Note: No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n18. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA qualitative is detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n19. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n20. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n21. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n22. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.",
