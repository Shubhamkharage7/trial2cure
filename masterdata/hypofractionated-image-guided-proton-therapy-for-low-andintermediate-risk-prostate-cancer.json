Quality of life outcomes as well as gastrointestinal and genitourinary early and late toxicities will be analyzed and compared to conventional proton therapy regimens. It is thought that this regimen will produce comparable findings and would result in substantial health care cost savings, as well as, be more convenient for patients.",

Patients with 2 or 3 risk factors will require a negative bone scan for eligibility.\n  * Equivocal bone scan findings are allowed if plain film x-rays are negative for metastasis.\n  * Patient is able to start proton therapy or neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy, when recommended, within 12 weeks of registration.\n  * No prior radiotherapy to the pelvic area.\n  * No prior prostate cancer therapy such as: prostatectomy, cryotherapy, chemotherapy or hyperthermia.\n  * Platelets \u2265 100,000 cells/mm3, Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1,800 cells/mm3, Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb \u2265 8.0 g/dl is acceptable.)\n  * Obs.: Patients with high risk factors, such as T3, Gleason 8-10 or PSA \\> 20ng/mL who are not considered candidates for pelvic lymph node radiation treatment are still considered eligible for this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* \u2022 Prior radiotherapy to the pelvic area.\n\n  * Prior prostate cancer therapy such as: prostatectomy, cryotherapy, or hyperthermia.\n  * Prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy) for prostate cancer.\n  * Evidence of distant metastases.\n  * Regional lymph node involvement.\n  * Previous or concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer.\n  * Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition. Note however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol.
