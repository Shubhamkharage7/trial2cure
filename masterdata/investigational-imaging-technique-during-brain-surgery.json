            "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial tests the safety and reliability of an investigational imaging technique called quantitative oblique back illumination microscopy (qOBM) during brain surgery for detecting brain tumors and brain tumor margins in patients with glioblastoma, astrocytoma, or oligodendroglioma. Surgical margins refer to the edge or border of the tissue removed in cancer surgery. qOBM may be able to assess and reveal brain tumor surgical margins in a more safe and reliable manner.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To perform a first-in-human study to assess the ability of a quantitative oblique back illumination microscopy (qOBM) handheld device to safely and reliably image brain tumor pathology intraoperatively in-situ and in-vivo.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the biophysical and structural features that enable detection of bulk tumor and tumor margins, including infiltrative disease, with qOBM.\n\nII. To develop qOBM imaging probes with multimodal capabilities (analog black and white and color imaging, fluorescent imaging) and with the potential to clearly reveal brain tumor margins ex vivo and in vivo during neurosurgical procedures.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo craniotomy with intraoperative ex vivo and in situ tumor assessment with qOBM. Patients then undergo postoperative exam with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) any of days 1-5 after surgery."
