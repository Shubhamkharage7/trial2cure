            "briefSummary": "The investigators hypothesize that the utilization of Incrediwear's Back Brace, compared to a sham brace and a standard-issue brace, will lead to better brace adherence, increased patient satisfaction, reduced pain medication usage, and improved functional disability among non-surgical chronic LBP patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "Problem: Chronic low back pain (LBP) affects a substantial portion of the population and often leads to decreased functional ability and increased pain medication usage. While back braces have been recommended as part of LBP management, their efficacy and impact on patient outcomes remain uncertain.\n\nResearch Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the utilization of Incrediwear's Back Brace, compared to a sham brace and a standard-issue brace, will lead to better brace adherence, increased patient satisfaction, reduced pain medication usage, and improved functional disability among non-surgical chronic LBP patients.\n\nImportance of the Research: This randomized clinical trial aims to assess the efficacy of Incrediwear's Back Brace in improving patient outcomes for chronic LBP. The study will provide valuable insights into the utilization patterns and adherence of back braces, patient satisfaction with treatment protocols, and the impact of brace usage on pain medication consumption and functional disability. By evaluating these factors through a controlled trial, the investigators seek to enhance the understanding of effective LBP management strategies, potentially reducing the burden of chronic LBP on patients and healthcare systems.\n\nThe study will be conducted under the guidance of Dr. Akhil Chhatre, Principal Investigator at the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The research will involve 100 non-surgical chronic LBP patients meeting specific inclusion criteria. The patients will be randomly assigned to one of four study groups, and data will be collected through phone calls over a full 4-week duration."
