The project will be conducted in partnership with the Greater Cleveland Food Bank and the Better Health Partnership Community Health Worker HUB",
            "detailedDescription": "The Nourishing Beginnings pilot study will enroll 160 pregnant individuals (\\<22 weeks gestation) who are eligible to use the Partnership Community HUB (i.e., Medicaid eligible). Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two intervention arms - either direct food delivery (n=80) or small financial resources and individualized navigation support for accessing local healthy foods (n=80).\n\nThe pilot will (1) assess the feasibility and allow protocol refinement; (2) assess the preliminary impact of CHW-led intervention; and (3) conduct a rigorous process evaluation of the implementation of the intervention using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 design. Dietary behavior, psychosocial health, health care utilization, and health outcomes and birth outcomes will be tracked at baseline, mid-pregnancy, and at delivery, derived from both primary and secondary data sources (i.e., Hub and claims data). Critical implementation points (referral, CHW touch points, and food delivery) will be assessed. Intervention arms will be compared to a matched comparison group derived from local claims data for the same time period."
