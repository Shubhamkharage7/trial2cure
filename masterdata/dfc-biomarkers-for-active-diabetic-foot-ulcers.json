            "detailedDescription": "This study is a platform study designed to efficiently test multiple biomarkers to identify diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) with a higher potential for healing versus not healing that ultimately could be applied at the point of care to drive personalized management decisions, and to better inform clinical trials of wound healing interventions The platform study is designed to be flexible so that it is suitable for a wide range of studies relevant to patients with open (active) DFUs.\n\nThis platform study will enroll patients with DFUs seen in an outpatient setting in diabetic foot and wound care clinics across a range of healthcare systems, including community settings and tertiary care hospitals, participating in the DFC.\n\nThe platform study will include common procedures that are applicable across the entire spectrum of DFUs (e.g., uniform biospecimen collections, clinical and usual care characteristics, social determinants of health, and patient reported outcomes). Blood, wound fluid (by a variety of methods), wound dressings, and debridement tissue (if debridement is performed during the participant's clinical wound care) will be collected from all participants to support a biorepository for concurrent and future research. Urine samples will be collected if participants agree to provide them, and collection will be encouraged. Biomarker-specific studies requiring additional data or biospecimens not required in the platform study will be included as appendices, as needed. Other biomarker-specific studies that use platform study biospecimens and study data will follow the DFC ancillary study process.\n\nEligible participants enrolled in the master protocol who signed the informed consent may be enrolled in multiple biomarkers sub studies associated with the master protocol without the need to sign an additional informed consent.\n\nThis platform study is non-interventional; no study prescribed agents or therapies are administered.\n\nEligible and consented participants are managed at each DFC site according to the usual clinical care, which is expected to be in line with the current standards of care recommendations1-3. The study will collect relevant details regarding the care provided at each clinic visit and participant outcomes.\n\nFollow-up for participants will vary based upon the occurrence and timing of healing:\n\n* All participants will be followed every other week for one month and monthly thereafter until the wound is healed or week 52 if the wound has not healed.\n* Participants who experience wound healing prior to week 52 will have a confirmation visit 2 weeks later. These participants will also be assessed for recurrence of their DFU at weeks 52 and 78 via phone call or video visit.\n* Participants who experience wound healing at week 52 will have a confirmation visit 2 weeks later. These participants will also be assessed for recurrence of their DFU at week 78 via phone call or video visit.\n* Participants who do not experience wound healing by week 52 will have an additional phone call or video visit scheduled at week 78 to assess patient-reported wound healing, infection, or amputation with confirmation by electronic medical records (EMR), if available.\n\nStudy visits may occur in conjunction with the participant's scheduled clinical follow-up visits. After wound healing has been confirmed, the visit may be conducted by remote means.\n\nThe master protocol will enable evaluation of the time to healing over a 78-week period and of expectations on the natural history of wound healing in contemporary DFU participants. It also enables exploring rates of DFU recurrence in those who healed. These data will lead to more accurate DFU-specific standards of care guidelines that will have a direct impact and benefit in the clinical care, for a personalized approach.\n\nGeneral and biomarker-specific analyses will be performed. Participants who share common demographic or clinical characteristics may be pooled across substudies."
