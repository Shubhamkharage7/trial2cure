Eligible participants will be sequentially enrolled into dosing groups (10 mcg, 25 mcg, 50 mcg, and selected optimal dose) of DCVC H1 HA mRNA Vaccine. Dosing will commence at the lowest dose (10 mcg) and only escalate to the next higher dose if safety concerns are not identified. Up to ten subjects will be enrolled per dosing group. An optimal dosing group will be selected based on safety outcomes from the 10 mcg, 25 mcg, and 50 mcg dosing group. For the optimal dose, the highest dose with no identified safety concerns as determined by the SRC will be selected. This approach will allow determination of an optimal dosing group which will include 10 optimal dose vaccine recipients. Ten separate participants will be enrolled to receive standard quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). The primary goal of this study is to assess the safety of two doses of DCVC H1 HA mRNA Vaccine administered intramuscularly in healthy adults (18-49 yrs) at dosage levels of 10 mcg, 25 mcg, and 50 mcg.",
