This study will recruit a national sample of parents and their K-2nd grade children. The impact of the intervention will be tested using a rigorous randomized wait-list controlled trial design. The design of the intervention is based on research indicating that among children, positive intergroup contact with outgroup members, including vicarious engagement, can prevent or reduce anti-outgroup bias, in particular, when contact is based on common goals, cooperation rather than competition, and supported by external authorities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, a mixed-methods design will be utilized involving collection of a broad range of outcome measures through online questionnaire surveys, one-on-one interviews with parents and children, and parent-child dyadic interviews."
