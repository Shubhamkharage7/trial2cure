            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nIn a new cancer therapy, researchers take a person s blood, select a certain white blood cell to grow in the lab, and then change the genes of these cells using a virus. The cells are then given back to the person. This is called gene transfer. For this study, researchers will modify the person s white blood cells with anti-CD70.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo see if a gene transfer with anti-CD70 cells can safely shrink tumors and to be certain the treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 and older diagnosed with cancer that has the CD70-expressing cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, and other tests. They may by admitted to the hospital. Leukapheresis will be performed. For this, blood is removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.\n\nEligible participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in their upper chest. Over several days, they will get chemotherapy drugs and the anti-CD70 cells. They will recover in the hospital.\n\nParticipants will take an antibiotic for 6 months after treatment. They will repeat leukapheresis.\n\nParticipants will visit the clinic every 1-3 months for the first year after treatment, every 6 months for the second year, and then as determined by their physician. Follow-up visits will take 1-2 days. At each visit, participants will have lab tests, imaging studies, and a physical exam.\n\nThroughout the study, blood will be taken and participants will have many tests to determine the size and extent of their tumor and the treatment s impact.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* We generated a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that engages CD70 using its natural ligand CD27, as the binding moiety. Transducing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with this CAR conveys major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent recognition of CD70-expressing target cells, which include renal cell carcinoma and other cancers.\n* In co-cultures with CD70+ target cells, anti-hCD70 CAR transduced T cells secrete significant amounts of IFN-gamma with high specificity.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary objectives:\n\n* Phase I: Determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-hCD70 CAR in concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2; aldesleukin).\n* Phase II: Determine if anti-hCD70 CAR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of CD70 expressing tumors.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients must be/have:\n\n  * Age \\>= 18 years and \\<= 72 years\n  * Metastatic or unresectable CD70-expressing cancer which has progressed after standard therapy\n* Patients may not have:\n\n  * Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide, or fludarabine.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-hCD70 CAR in patients with measurable, unresectable cancer expressing CD70.\n* PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.\n* Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-hCD70 CAR.\n* All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n* On day 0, patients will receive PBL transduced with the anti-hCD70 CAR and will then begin high-dose aldesleukin.\n* A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (plus or minus two weeks) after treatment.\n* The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design, with two separate cohorts for the Phase II component:Cohort 2a, patients with CD70-expressing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and Cohort 2b, patients with a CD70-expressing non-RCC malignancy (solid tumors only).\n* A total of up to 124 patients may be required; approximately 38 patients in the Phase I portion of the study and 43 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable) patients in each cohort of the Phase II portion of the study."
