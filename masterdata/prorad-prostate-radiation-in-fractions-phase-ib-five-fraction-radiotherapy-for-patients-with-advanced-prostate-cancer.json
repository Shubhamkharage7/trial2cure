Patient-reported urinary, bowel, and sexual function and general QoL will be collected using validated EPIC-26, EQ-5D, PROMIS-Fatigue questionnaires prior to RT, at the end of RT 3, and 6, 12, 24 months after completion of RT.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nSecondary Objective #1: To estimate the metastasis free survival (MFS) at 24 months after study enrollment. All time-to-event analyses will be analyzed indexed to date of study enrollment.\n\nSecondary Objective #2: To estimate the rate of acute and late GI and GU toxicity of the treatment regimen\n\nSecondary Objective #3: To assess adherence to protocol treatment parameters. RT plans will be evaluated for contouring consistency, target coverage and tissue constraint adherence with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) auto-segmentation/contours and scorecards to facilitate this process and improve plan quality and clinical efficiency.\n\nSecondary Objective #4: To explore the impact of five fraction pelvic nodal RT on lymphopenia.\n\nWhite blood cell counts will be obtained before and after treatment and compared to historical data on lymphopenia with conventionally fractionated pelvic RT.\n\nSecondary Objective #5: To estimate HRQOL following the proposed treatment regimen compared to pre-treatment assessment at the end of RT 3 months, 12, and 24 months after completing RT and assess the HRQOL change over time.\n\nExploratory Objective #1: To investigate the effect of pelvic nodal RT on gut microbiome with gut microbiome sample collection pre- and upon RT completion."
