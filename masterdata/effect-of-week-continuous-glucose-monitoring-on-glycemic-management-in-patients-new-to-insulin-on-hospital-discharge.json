On hospital discharge, participants will be assigned to either the intervention of wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for 2 weeks or blood glucose monitoring (BGM) for 2 weeks. They will have a 2-week follow up visit, during which insulin doses will be adjusted as needed, and a 3-month follow-up visit, at which point HbA1c will be measured."

New initiation of insulin therapy, including basal insulin regimen, basal-bolus insulin regimen, or mixed insulin regimen at the time of hospital discharge\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior to admission use of home insulin therapy\n2. Current use of systemic corticosteroids\n3. Active pregnancy; as pregnancy requires different blood glucose targets, subjects known to be pregnant will be excluded from this study. Subjects will not be tested for pregnancy outside of testing performed in routine medical care; pregnancy will be determined by patient self-reporting. Females of childbearing potential will not be instructed to avoid pregnancy, however if they became pregnant during the study (detected by self-reporting), they will be withdrawn from the study.",
