The overarching goal of the CALERIE Legacy Study is to examine whether two years of CR results in sustained improvements in the biological, phenotypic, and functional hallmarks of human aging 10 to 15 years after the structured intervention. Participants will complete clinical assessments, dietary recalls, and questionnaires, and laboratory evaluations will be performed on blood and urine samples. The study also includes an optional biospecimen banking component."
