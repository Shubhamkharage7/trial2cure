Several different combinations of tumor types are of interest: parathyroid carcinoma (PC) versus (vs.) atypical neoplasm (AN), PC vs. parathyroid adenoma (PA), PN vs. PA, PC/AN vs. PA, and PC vs. AN/PA. Separately analyses will be performed for each. Following univariable analyses, a multivariable logistic regression model will be fit (again, separately for each combination of tumor types) to assess the ability of multiple markers to classify patients, and ROC analysis will also be used to summarize the performance of the resulting model.",
