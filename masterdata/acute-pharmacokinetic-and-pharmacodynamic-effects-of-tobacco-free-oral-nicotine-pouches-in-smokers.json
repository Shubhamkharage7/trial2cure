The study will utilize a within-subjects, double-blind design. Upon enrollment, participants will complete 7 dosing conditions: tobacco-flavored pouch (low or high nicotine dose), mint/menthol-flavored pouch (low or high nicotine dose), and fruit-flavored pouch (low or high nicotine dose); participants will also complete a condition where the participants will smoke participants' preferred brand of cigarettes. In each experimental session, participants will complete 2 product-use bouts. In bout 1, the participants will use a single product (pouch or cigarette) for a fixed period under controlled conditions. In bout 2, participants will be given 2 hours to use participants' assigned product ad libitum.",

Blood specimens will be obtained throughout the sessions to characterize the pharmacokinetics of nicotine and various pharmacodynamic outcomes (subjective drug effects, tobacco withdrawal symptoms, vital signs) will also be assessed. These procedures will be completed 7 separate times (on separate visits) by each participant (sessions will be separated by at least 48 hours)."
