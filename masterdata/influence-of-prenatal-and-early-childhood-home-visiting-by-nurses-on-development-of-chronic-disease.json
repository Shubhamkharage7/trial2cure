            "detailedDescription": "Addressing the unacceptably high rates of chronic disease and premature mortality among low-income African Americans (AA) is a public health imperative. The proposed study addresses this challenge by building upon decades of follow-up of low-income, primarily AA participants in a randomized clinical trial of the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), a program of prenatal and infant/toddler nurse home visiting for low-income mothers with no previous live births. It examines NFP effects on risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as premature mortality among both mothers and their first-born offspring at offspring age 30. It is the first adequately powered study of a very early intervention to examine risks for chronic disease and mortality, assessing both mothers and their first-born offspring.\n\nPlease note that for this section of the longitudinal study, just the outcome measures for 30 years after delivery are being measured. The study team also measured these outcome measures at baselines, 12 years, and 18 years after delivery in other studies, but for this specific study, the time frame for the listed outcome measures is 30 years after delivery."
