            "briefSummary": "This study will enroll patients with small fiber neuropathy (SFN). The study will look at an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) called Panzyga. Panzyga is approved by the FDA as a therapy for Primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) in patients 2 years of age and older; Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults and Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in adults. It has not been approved by the FDA for use in SFN.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) can cause pain reduction and improve objective nerve fiber densities on skin biopsies in great numbers in SFN patients. The primary outcome is quantified improvement in intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) on repeat skin punch biopsy after 6 months of IVIG treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is an increasingly prevalent diagnosis in neurology and neuromuscular centers. Modern diagnostic techniques, including skin biopsies and autonomic nervous testing are helping to find SFN in many patients with undiagnosed pain syndromes including fibromyalgia. The prevalence is rising for SFN, and an immune etiology may underlie 19%-34% of cases. While there is no standard of care treatment, current treatment strategies for SFN include long-term steroid therapy which come with a host of side effects. There is mounting evidence that Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) can cause pain reduction and improve objective nerve fiber densities on skin biopsies in great numbers in SFN patients, as well as improving validated questionnaire scores monitoring symptom burden and disability. However, neither IVIG nor any other immunosuppressant has been studied in a sufficiently powered and adequately dosed controlled, randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy."
