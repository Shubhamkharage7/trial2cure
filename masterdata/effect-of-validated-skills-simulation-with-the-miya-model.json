            "detailedDescription": "Vaginal Hysterectomy (VH) is the desired hysterectomy technique of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) since it is associated with less morbidity, quicker recovery and lower costs than laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy. Despite its well documented advantages, numbers nationwide in the US are declining. Of all minimally invasive hysterectomy procedures, the vaginal approach has been the only one demonstrating a consistent decrease in use from 25% of cases in 1998 to 17% of cases in 2010. A large part of this is due to inadequate training for this technique. There currently is no standardized curriculum for teaching VH, and training varies widely between residency programs. It is widely held that simulation training for surgical procedures improves outcome, but there is a need to validate this for vaginal surgery training."
