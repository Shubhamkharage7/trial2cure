The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of deescalating chemoradiation treatment based on mid-treatment tumor response determined by rapid nodal shrinkage and clearance of circulating HPV plasma tumor DNA . The primary objective of this study is to evaluate progression-free survival at 2 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "The secondary objectives will include 2-year loco-regional control and overall survival, quality of life, and late toxicity. Quality of life outcomes will be assessed with a validated, self-reported questionnaire. Late toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Additionally, the prognostic value of positive HPV in salivary rinse as well as plasma at mid and post- treatment time points will be evaluated with a baseline evaluation pre-treatment. Radiomic analysis of pre-treatment imaging will be correlated with outcomes."

Patients cannot have a cumulative personal smoking history that exceeds 10 pack-years.\n\n  1. Number of pack-years = \\[Frequency of smoking (number of cigarettes per day) x duration of cigarette smoking (years)\\] / 20\n  2. Note: Twenty cigarettes is considered equivalent to one pack. Cigar and pipe tobacco consumption is not included in calculating lifetime pack-years.\n* Zubrod Performance Status of 0-1 within 8 weeks prior to registration;\n* Adequate hematologic function within 2 weeks prior to registration, defined as follows:\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1,500 cells/mm3; Platelets \u2265 100,000 cells/mm3; Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dl; Note: the use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb \u2265 8.0 g/dl is acceptable.\n\n* Adequate renal function within 2 weeks prior to registration, defined as follows:\n\n  a.Serum creatinine \u2264 mg/dl or creatinine clearance (CC) \u2265 50 ml/min determined by 24 hour collection or estimated by Cockcorft-Gault formula: i.CCr male = \\[(140 - age) x (wt in kg)\\] \\[(Serum Cr mg/dl) x (72)\\] ii.CCr female = 0.85 x (CrCl male)\n* Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration for women of childbearing potential;\n* Patients who are HIV positive but who have no prior AIDS-defining illness and have CD4 cells of at least 350/mm3 are eligible.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon the current CDC definition with immune compromise greater than that noted in section 4.1.12; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immune-compromised patients.\n* Pregnancy; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment in this study may be significantly teratogenic\n* Prior allergic reaction to cisplatin.\n* Exclusion Criteria for MRI: Normal MRI exclusion criteria will apply, including those on the following list. A standard MRI safety form will be used to identify potential conditions warranting exclusion.\n* Electrical implants such as cardiac pacemakers or perfusion pumps\n* Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial heart, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, bullets, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants\n* Ferromagnetic objects such as jewelry or metal clips in clothing\n* Claustrophobia\n* History of seizures\n* Diabetes a.In addition, patients with GFR \\< 15 ml/min/1.73m2 or who are on dialysis will not have DCE-MRI scan.
