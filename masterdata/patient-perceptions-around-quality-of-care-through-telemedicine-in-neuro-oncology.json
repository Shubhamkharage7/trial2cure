To evaluate the patient-perceived quality of care by group (telemedicine versus in-person visits) in patients with central nervous system (CNS) cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the visits provided by telemedicine compared to those in-person.\n\nII. To contrast the average time spent on telemedicine visits compared to in-person visits, and the delay between visit order placement and visit occurring.\n\nIII. To evaluate the domains of patient care addressed on a telemedicine visit versus in-person visit per documentation, including (1) treatment planning, (2) symptom burden, (3) goals of care.\n\nIV. To evaluate frequency of acute care sought (through emergency room or urgent care clinic) within 30 days of encounter in telemedicine visit versus (vs) in-person visit.\n\nV. The impact of patient and clinical characteristics on perceived quality of care in the context of covariate-adjusted modeling.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete a survey related to their perceived quality of care via telephone and have their medical chart reviewed prospectively."
