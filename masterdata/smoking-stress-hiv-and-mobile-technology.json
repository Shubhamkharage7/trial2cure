The specific aims of this study are: (1) To modify a recently developed, culturally adapted, mobile application for Black smokers by integrating information specifically relevant to Black persons with HIV/AIDS. (2) To conduct a randomized clinical trial for anxiety-sensitivity reduction and cigarette cessation among Black smokers with HIV.",
            "detailedDescription": "The current trial aims to refine and conduct a comprehensive cultural and HIV-sensitive adaptation of an initially tested, novel mobile intervention (MASP+) targeting anxiety sensitivity (AS) among Black/African American (daily) cigarette users with HIV/AIDS. The MASP+ app prompts users remotely throughout the day to assess mood symptoms, cigarette cravings or nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and general mental health. When respondents indicate they are struggling with cigarette urges or cravings, or if they are experiencing heightened levels of stress or anxiety, the app selects and delivers a tailored message from a library of messages and videos.\n\nThe MASP+ app has the potential to deliver highly effective and accessible treatment to a highly underserved subpopulation within the Black community considered to be at exceptionally high risk of smoking problems (social, psychological, physical) and smoking relapse."
