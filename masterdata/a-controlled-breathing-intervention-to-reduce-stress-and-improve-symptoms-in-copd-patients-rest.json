The intervention is based on the breathing techniques of Pranayama. It was developed with patient and stakeholder input and is targeted for individuals with COPD who have moderate levels of stress and symptom burden. The intervention is a 15-minute breathing protocol which will be taught to participants and subsequently evaluated in a clinic setting with surveys, lung function, and cardiac assessments. This intervention will be pre-tested in 6 individuals, revised, and piloted in 30 individuals (15 in intervention group, 15 in control group). This study will answer the question of 1) whether a controlled breath protocol is feasible, acceptable, and safe for patients with COPD and 2) whether any modifications to the intervention are needed for a future multicenter trial to be proposed and conducted after the completion of the pilot trial. We will also 3) obtain sufficient estimates of variability in stress measures to inform statistical planning of a future trial."
