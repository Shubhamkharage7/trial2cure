The investigators will collect additional clinical data in a subset of participants who agree to undergo additional assessments in the Motion Analysis Laboratory at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, MA during two in-person data collection sessions. The investigators will assess feasibility and acceptability of the Tele-Tai Chi intervention; explore changes in clinically relevant outcome measures including: physical activity, self-efficacy, quality of life, balance, and gait; and evaluate longitudinal changes in Tai Chi proficiency.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of the study is to test the delivery of a novel Tele-Tai Chi (TC) intervention in a single-arm feasibility study for community-dwelling TC-nai\u0308ve older adults. The investigators will assess feasibility and acceptability of the Tele-TC intervention and its specific components through both qualitative and quantitative feedback, as well as the systematic tracking of adherence data to inform future trials and potential clinical use of the Tele-TC system. The investigators will also explore changes in outcome measures including physical activity, self-efficacy, quality of life, and gait, and evaluate changes in TC proficiency.\n\nOver the course of the 12-week program, participants will be assessed 4 times (baseline, two follow-up assessments at 4 and 8 weeks respectively, and a final assessment at 12 weeks).\n\nStudy volunteers will be instructed to train on their own at least three times a week and to participate in 1:1 live sessions with TC instructors two or more times during the study period."
