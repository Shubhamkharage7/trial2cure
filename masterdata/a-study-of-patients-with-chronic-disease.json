The protocol will follow a master protocol design in which a shared study infrastructure supports progressive development of the registry across the spectrum of chronic diseases.",
            "detailedDescription": "The TARGET-RWE master protocol design allows shared study parameters and operational components to be organized within a centralized platform. Utilizing this platform, therapeutic area-aligned Communities with associated Disease-Specific Cohorts (DSC) can be added according to scientific merit and need to address specific research questions in patients diagnosed with chronic diseases. This design capitalizes on a shared, sustainable infrastructure across a diverse patient population, which allows for more efficient coordination and conduct than can be achieved in traditional stand-alone, independently-conducted research studies with narrowly-focused target patient populations. This master protocol design will ultimately support a dynamic program that adapts to the changing landscape of chronic disease management and allows for rapid enrollment and collection of retrospective and long-term prospective data from participants in specific disease areas of interest.\n\nTARGET-RWE currently includes the TARGET-RWE.LUNG Community, with open DSCs for Asthma, COPD and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis."
