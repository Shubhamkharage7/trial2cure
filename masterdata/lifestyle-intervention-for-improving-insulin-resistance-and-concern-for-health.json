The main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does the diet and exercise program improve insulin resistance and apathy?\n2. Does the addition of soybean to the diet enhance the effect? Participants will be given all meals for 12 weeks and will exercise under supervision. They will undergo a test of insulin sensitivity and complete questionnaires.\n\nResearchers will compare the groups given:\n\n1. A diet to moderate the blood glucose response that contains soybean; and\n2. A diet to moderate the blood glucose response that does not contain soybean.",

The primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of a diet and exercise program on insulin sensitivity and apathy and determine if the addition of soybean to the diet enhances the effect. The primary outcomes of the study are insulin sensitivity measured using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test and apathy evaluated using the Apathy Evaluation Scale."
