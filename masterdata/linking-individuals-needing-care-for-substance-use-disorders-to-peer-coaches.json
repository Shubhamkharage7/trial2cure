            "briefSummary": "This is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized via a maximally tolerated imbalance randomization procedure using NCI's Clinical Trial Randomization Tool with 1:1:1 allocation to each group: in-person peer recovery coaching (PRC) with linkage to recovery resources, telemedicine-based peer recovery coaching with linkage to recovery resources, or usual care.\n\nIn the PRC arms, PRCs will meet patients at bedside (in person) or via a tablet-based video call (telemedicine). They will assess the participant's state of change, engage in motivational interviewing techniques, and link the participant to community-based recovery resources according to the needs of the participant. They will also schedule and perform follow up calls after the participant is discharged from the ED to provide ongoing support and facilitate re-linkage to recovery resources, if needed.\n\nParticipants in the usual care arm will be provided with a list of community recovery resources, but there will be no PRC interaction or direct linkage to resources through the study.\n\nFollow up visits will take place at 7, 30, and 90 days after enrollment. Most will take place via telephone, but participants will be given the option of an in-person visit if they so desire.",
            "detailedDescription": "Deaths from drug overdose have risen to record levels since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionately impacting Black individuals and people experiencing homelessness. Fewer than one-third of the 8.3 million individuals living with an illicit drug use disorder in 2019 reported receiving treatment. Telemedicine services have increased access to care for many patients living with substance use disorders (SUD), but the long-term role of this treatment approach in SUD care is uncertain. Multifaceted strategies are needed to build recovery capital and link vulnerable individuals to recovery resources.\n\nEmergency department (ED) visits are an opportunity to screen for SUDs, initiate treatment, and link to recovery resources. Observational studies have noted that consultation with a peer recovery coach (PRC) was well-received in EDs, with high rates of engagement and satisfaction. PRCs facilitate conversations allowing patients to express their ideal pathway to recovery, provide linkage to services across the social ecology, and follow up to support recovery, including re-linkage to resources as needed. Nonetheless, their role in ED screening and linkage to resources, including the potential role of telemedicine, has not been rigorously evaluated.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial enrolling 600 subjects across three arms: in-person peer coaching with linkage to recovery support services and callbacks, telemedicine-based peer coaching with linkage and callbacks, or usual care. Results will inform other EDs considering a peer recovery coach program for patients presenting with SUD-related conditions. By utilizing telemedicine, this model will be rapidly scalable and readily implemented at other facilities."
