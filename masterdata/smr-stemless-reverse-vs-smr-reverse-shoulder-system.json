This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate non-inferiority of the SMR Stemless Reverse to the SMR Reverse Shoulder System.\n\nPatients with joint dysfunction who continue to experience significant symptoms despite an appropriate course of non-operative management are eligible. Patients will be considered enrolled into the study when an ICF has been signed, all inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are present including intraoperative exclusion criteria, and the patient is randomized into either the SMR Stemless Reverse (investigational) group, the SMR Reverse Shoulder System (control) group or is part of the roll-in population. Enrollment is expected to take approximately 24 months."
