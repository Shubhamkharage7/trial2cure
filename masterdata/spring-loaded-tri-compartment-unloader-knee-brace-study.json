Randomly selected participants will wear a TCU brace for several weeks during physical therapy and activities of daily living that is designed to reduce compressive forces in all three compartments of the knee during weight-bearing flexion. Our hypothesis is that TCU bracing will improve clinical outcomes relatednto pain and function.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients in this study have been identified as good candidates by their physicians. As the study procedures closely follow the standard of care procedures in place, study participation presents little additional risk above and beyond the standard of care procedures. The study was designed to present the least risk possible consistent with sound research design.\n\nParticipants in this study will undergo standard of care X-rays that will help in eligibility determination. Participants will be randomized to either group, and will have a 50% chance of receiving the brace. Outcomes will be measured at baseline (before any intervention), 6 weeks after commencing rehabilitation at Stanford, and 3 months after commencing rehabilitation at Stanford.\n\nThese outcome measures are collected using PatientiQ which is is being used at the clinic as part of standard of care. Spring Loaded Tech is providing the TCU braces for the patients in this study at no cost."
