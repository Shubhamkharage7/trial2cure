The iHERO Toolkit was developed over one year with the type 1 diabetes community, The Diabetes Link organization, and experts. Now, the investigators want to understand the impact of the iHERO Toolkit on diabetes self-management, financial stress, and health insurance literacy outcomes. The investigators are doing this study because it will help to better understand how to support health insurance and financial stress and improve self-management outcomes in young adults with type 1 diabetes. The investigators want to understand how the iHERO Toolkit helps all young adults with diabetes, but especially those on Medicaid and who are racially or ethnically diverse. The investigators will ask participants to participate at four-time points over one year. For the first time, participants will fill out online enrollment and demographic forms and 9 surveys. The 9 surveys have 8-40 short questions each, estimated to take about 45 minutes. Participants will also be asked to complete a home A1c collection with a University Hospitals team member on Zoom."
