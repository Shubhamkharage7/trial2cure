            "briefSummary": "This is a single-arm open-label phase I/II trial studying the safety and efficacy of focal 're-priming' radiation therapy (RT) to FDG-avid residual sites of disease in relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL) patients with incomplete response (IR) to CAR T-cell therapy (CAR-T) by day 30 post-CAR-T PET/CT. We hypothesize that focal 're-priming' RT will be safe (phase I) and improve conversion to metabolic complete response (CR) by day 90 post-CAR-T PET/CT from 29% (historical control) to 58% (phase II).",
            "detailedDescription": "Early clinical trials of CAR-T in R/R NHL suggest that only \\~40% of patients achieve CR by day 30 PET/CT evaluation. Of those who do not, the large majority (\\~70%) ultimately fail, while \\~30% convert to CR after a median time of 64 days (range, 49-424). This group of patients, who have incomplete response on day 30 PET/CT after CAR-T and thus are most likely to fail CAR-T alone, may be the ideal target for early therapeutic intervention to 're-prime' CAR-T and convert them from IR to CR.\n\nPreclinical and early clinical studies suggest potential immune augmentation when combining RT with CAR-T. Therefore, we propose a phase I/II clinical trial investigating the impact of RT to poor responding sites of disease after CD19-directed CAR-T in R/R NHL patients who are likely to fail CAR-T alone. We hypothesize that focal RT to residual FDG-avid sites of disease on day 30 PET/CT will improve the number of patients who convert to CR by day 90 PET/CT both through local cytotoxic effects as well as local and systemic synergistic effects through 're-priming' of CAR T-cells."
