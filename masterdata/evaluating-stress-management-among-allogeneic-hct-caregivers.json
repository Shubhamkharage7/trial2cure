As the program progresses, participants are asked to apply these skills to thoughts and emotions. Throughout the treatment, caregivers are reminded to utilize existing coping skills, as well as how to integrate the new skills learned throughout this program for managing stress. Formal mindfulness meditations are conducted within each session, lasting from 7-20 minutes; participants will be asked to practice mindfulness exercises daily.",
