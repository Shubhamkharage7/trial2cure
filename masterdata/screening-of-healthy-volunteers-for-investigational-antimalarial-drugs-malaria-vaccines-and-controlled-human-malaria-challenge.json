            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMalaria is a serious infection caused by a parasite. People get malaria when an infected mosquito bites them. Malaria can cause major health and social problems in places were malaria is common, such as Africa but can also affect travelers who have never been exposed to malaria. Researchers at the NIH want to find a safe and effective malaria vaccine, antimalarial drugs, or prevention regimen. To do this, healthy volunteers are recruited under a general screening study in order to see if are qualified to join a future malaria study.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo screen healthy volunteers to see if they are eligible to join investigational malaria studies. The studies will be trials of investigational antimalarial drugs, malaria vaccines, or prevention regimens. They may also involve controlled human malaria infection trials.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people ages 18 50\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will first be prescreened by phone.\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nParticipants may go more than 1 year without joining a clinical trial. If this happens, they may be re-contacted to see if they still want to be part of this screening protocol. Those who still want to participate and have had relevant medical changes will be rescreened.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a screening protocol for healthy volunteers to participate in research studies conducted by Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV).\n\nMalaria-related morbidity and mortality have a major economic impact in endemic regions and\n\npresent a substantial health risk to non-immune travelers and people living in endemic areas. To stem the worldwide impact of this devastating disease, a safe and broadly effective malaria vaccine and improved antimalarial therapeutics are urgently required.\n\nThis screening protocol is designed to continuously evaluate potential healthy volunteers to build a pool of volunteers who may participate in future and ongoing LMIV malaria drug, vaccine, or controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) trials. A complete medical history and blood and urine samples will be obtained to evaluate whether volunteers are eligible for study-specific screening."
