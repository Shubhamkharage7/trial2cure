            "briefSummary": "IVC filters are mechanical filters placed in a patient's body to trap blood clots in the legs migrating to the lungs. When no longer indicated, interventional radiologists are consulted for IVC filter removal. Currently, many methods for extracting IVC filters exist. Two of the most common methods involve using an endovascular snare device or rigid forceps. We intend to prospectively compare these two methods in an attempt to see if one offers an advantage to the other. This will be compared by evaluating success rates and procedure time.",
            "detailedDescription": "Currently the optimal method for IVC filter retrieval with respect to success rate and fluoroscopic time (i.e. radiation exposure) is poorly understood. Both snare and forcep techniques have independently evaluated in literature but have never been compared directly. The proposed study would prospectively assess whether one of these established technique offers an advantage with respect to either of these variables."
