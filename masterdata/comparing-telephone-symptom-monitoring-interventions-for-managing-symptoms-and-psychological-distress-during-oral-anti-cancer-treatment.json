            "briefSummary": "In this clinical trial, symptom monitoring (interactive voice response \\[IVR\\] is compared to automated telephone symptom management \\[ATSM\\] and telephone interpersonal counseling \\[TIPC\\]) for reducing symptom burden and psychological distress (depressive and anxiety symptoms) among people receiving oral anti-cancer treatment. Symptoms are the number one driver of treatment interruptions and unscheduled health services use. To reduce the risk of these events, symptom monitoring and management are necessary. However, these services are not implemented routinely, especially in the community oncology settings. Further, depressive and anxiety symptoms are a key barrier to enacting symptom self-management strategies. IVR is a form of symptom monitoring where patients, when called, enter their symptom ratings over the phone. Their symptom summary is sent to their provider, and patients may be advised to reach out to their oncology provider, based on their symptoms. The ATSM intervention combines IVR assessments with a Symptom Management and Survivorship educational handbook with self-management strategies. Patients receiving ATSM enter their symptom ratings over the phone and have their symptoms reported to their provider, but patients are also directed to the handbook for strategies to manage elevated symptoms. Patients receiving ATSM who report being anxious, discouraged, or sad will also receive TIPC, which targets psychological distress and its connection to social support and interpersonal communication. Information gathered from this study may help researchers learn more about the best ways to manage patient symptoms and improve patient outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Test the effectiveness of Automated Telephone System Management (ATSM) + Telephone Interpersonal Counseling (TIPC) versus active control on patient-level outcome of the summary toxicity index of 24 Patient Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) symptoms that include depressive, anxiety, and other symptoms commonly experienced during oral anti-cancer treatment over weeks 1-12 (immediate effect) and 13-17 (sustained effect).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Test the effectiveness of ATSM+TIPC versus active control on patient-level outcome of unscheduled health services over weeks 1-12 and 13-17.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate implementation outcomes at the practice personnel level (physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, advanced practice providers, physician assistants, medical assistants, pharmacists, social workers, and other behavioral health professionals):\n\nIa. Feasibility as reflected by practice personnel attitudes toward symptom management and time to address weekly IVR symptom reports; Ib. Practice personnel's actions on symptom reports (symptom-related oncology visits, oral agent treatment alterations, prescriptions of supportive care medications, referrals to supportive care services); Ic. Treatment fidelity of TIPC delivered by social workers/counselors in the ATSM+TIPC arm and time spent by them; Id. Perceptions of intervention acceptability and appropriateness for the community oncology practice.\n\nII. Estimate delivery cost of the ATSM+TIPC and active control and cost savings for the ATSM+TIPC versus active control as a result of reduced unscheduled health services use.\n\nIII. Estimate the effect of the ATSM+TIPC versus active control on patient-reported financial burden.\n\nOUTLINE: Practices are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive IVR symptom monitoring calls once a week for 12 weeks, and a summary symptom report is sent to their provider. Call duration is approximately 15 minutes.\n\nARM II: Patients receive the Symptom Management and Survivorship handbook and receive IVR symptom monitoring calls for 12 weeks, with summary symptom reports sent to their provider. Call duration is approximately 20 minutes. Patients who report anxious, discouraged, or sad mood items on their monitoring calls for two consecutive weeks between weeks 1 and 4 also receive TIPC calls for up to 8 weeks. TIPC call duration is approximately 30 minutes.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up during weeks 13-17 and practice personnel are assessed at intake and 2 and 25 months later."
