These patients will receive a targeted dye to aid in the resection of these metastases. We plan to assess ICG as it relates to:\n\n1. Diagnostic accuracy using pathologic correlation as gold standard measure\n2. Short and long term event free and overall survival",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients diagnosed with solid malignancies or metastatic lesions who require clinically indicated resection will be identified by their Oncologist. The oncologist will inform the subject/family about the study and ask if they may be interested in participating. If the subject/family demonstrates potential interest in the study, the Pediatric Surgery Research team will discuss the risks and benefits of pre-operative ICG administration with the patients and enrollment.\n\nStudy subjects: All patients diagnosed with solid malignancies as well as those with metastatic disease distant from the primary tumor will be potentially eligible for the study. Diagnosis will be made:\n\n1. In a multimodal fashion including physical exam, radiologic evaluation (ultrasound, MRI, CT scan, etc), and sometimes biopsy.\n2. Prior to definitive surgical resection of the newly diagnosed malignancy"
