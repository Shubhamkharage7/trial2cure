Treatment will be administered on days 1 and day 15 of each cycle. Treatment will be discontinued if the participant reports unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the participant's best interest to continue treatment, or the participant has confirmed progressive disease by iRANO, unless the participant is potentially deriving benefit per Investigator's assessment. Participants will be followed for collection of survival status every 12 weeks (\u00b1 2 weeks) for the first 2 years, then yearly thereafter."

Previous first line treatment with at least radiotherapy and temozolomide. Subjects must have been off prior treatment at least 28 days prior to initiation of study therapy. Subjects must be at least 90 days from completion of radiation to reduce the risk of pseudoprogression being misdiagnosed as progression, unless the recurrence is a new enhancement on MRI outside the radiation treatment field or progression is confirmed by biopsy.\n6.

Platelet count \\< 100,000 cells/mm3.\n    4. Total bilirubin \\> 2 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN; unless the subject has documented Gilbert's syndrome).\n    5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST \\[SGOT\\]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT \\[SGPT\\]) \\> 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (\\> 5 \u00d7 ULN in subjects with liver metastases).\n    6. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels \\> 2.5 \u00d7 ULN (\\> 5 \u00d7 ULN in subjects with liver metastases, or \\> 10 \u00d7 ULN in subjects with bone metastases).\n    7. Serum creatinine \\> 2.0 mg/dL or 177 \u00b5mol/L.\n    8. Albumin \\< 3.0 g/dL.\n\n    Note: Each study site should use its institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) to determine eligibility.\n16. Clinically significant (ie, active) cardiovascular disease or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to first study medication; unstable angina; congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association grade 2 or higher; or serious cardiac arrhythmia. Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension should be medically managed on a stable regimen to control hypertension prior to study entry.\n17. Current, serious, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, defined as the existence of an absolute arrhythmia or ventricular arrhythmias classified as Lown III, IV or V.\n18. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study medication(s).\n19. Participation in an investigational drug study or receiving any investigational treatment within 28 days prior to study treatment. No wash out is necessary for subjects previously receiving Tumor treating field (TTF); TTF will be allowed to continue at the discretion of the Investigator. FDA-authorized drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 are permitted.\n20. Assessed by the Investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n21. Concurrent participation in any interventional clinical trial.\n22. Pregnant and nursing women.",
