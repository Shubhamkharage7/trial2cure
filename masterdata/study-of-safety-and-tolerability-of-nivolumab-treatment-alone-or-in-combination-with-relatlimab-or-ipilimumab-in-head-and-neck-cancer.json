            "detailedDescription": "Immunotherapeutic agents have been well tolerated in the recurrent/metastatic patient population. Studies have shown that delay of surgical resection for 3-4 weeks after diagnosis is acceptable. Overall survival for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are poor with the current treatment modalities available. Previously untreated, locally advanced (AJCC 8th edition stage III-IVa) HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients who are candidates for surgical resection, as deemed by the multidisciplinary team will be included in this trial. Patients with histories of autoimmune disease or with current or previous histories of immune modulating agents will be excluded from participation.\n\nRelatlimab will be given IV at a dose of 480 mg IV on D1 (and on D28 if surgery is postponed at the discretion of the investigator). Nivolumab will be given IV at a dose of 480 mg on D1 (and on D28 if surgery is postponed at the discretion of the investigator) when given alone or with relatlimab. Nivolumab will be given at dose of 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks on D1 and D14 (and on D28 if the operating room time is not yet available, and the 4-week CT scan demonstrates at least stable disease ) when given with Ipilimumab. Ipilimumab will be given at a dose of 1 mg/kg IV once only on D1. Patients will undergo biopsy and CT scan prior to treatment initiation. 4 weeks (\u00b1 1 week) after, patient will undergo surgical resection. CT scan will be repeated prior to surgery (from 1-72 hours prior to surgery).The patients will be monitored from time of biopsy until 6 months postoperatively."

All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first receiving investigational product. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive investigational product and must not be enrolled in the study. All WOCBP must agree to use appropriate contraception to prevent pregnancy for the duration of treatment with study treatments, plus 24 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (i.e., 30 days \\[duration of ovulatory cycle\\] plus approximately 5 half-lives).\n7. All males must agree to use appropriate contraception for the duration of treatment with study treatments plus 33 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (i.e., 90 days \\[duration of sperm turnover\\] plus approximately 5 half-lives). In addition, male participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time. In addition, men enrolled on this study must be informed of the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control\n8. Azoospermic males are exempt from contraceptive requirements unless the potential exists for fetal toxicity due to study drug being present in seminal fluid, even if the participant has undergone a successful vasectomy or if the partner is pregnant. WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt from contraceptive requirements, and still must undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.\n9.

If TnT or TnI levels are \\> 1 to 2 \u00d7 ULN within 24 hours, the subject may undergo a cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment, following a discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor or designee. When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test should be conducted as soon as possible.
