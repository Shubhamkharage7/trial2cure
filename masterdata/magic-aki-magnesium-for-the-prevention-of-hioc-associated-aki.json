Investigators will randomly assign 130 patients to receive IV Mg versus an equal volume of normal saline (0.9% NS) placebo, of whom it is anticipated 80 will complete the study. Investigators will also collect blood and urine pre- and postoperatively for exploration of secondary outcomes.\n\nInvestigators will screen for eligibility at participant's preoperative visit with their thoracic surgeon. Intravenous magnesium will be administered as a continuous infusion, soon after induction and stabilization by anesthesia in the operating room. The magnesium drip will start at 1 g/hour and will be titrated to achieve target levels of 3-5 mg/dl. The total duration of the infusion will be 24 hours."
