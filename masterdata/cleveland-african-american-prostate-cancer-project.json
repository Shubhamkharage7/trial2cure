The approaches are 1) education and passive navigation, 2) education and active navigation, and 3) education and active navigation with community based outreach. Completion of a PSA blood test is the primary outcome of this study, which will be evaluated four months following the recruitment phase at each shop. At the 4 month follow-up, participants will be asked about PSA completion; participants who completed PSA screening will be asked to provide outcomes from their PSA screening (ie. PSA results and provider recommended next steps), as well as their feelings regarding their screening experience, trust in the screening process, and knowledge about prostate cancer."
