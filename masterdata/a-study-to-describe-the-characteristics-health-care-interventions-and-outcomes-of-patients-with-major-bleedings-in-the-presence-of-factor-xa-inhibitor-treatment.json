The generation of insight on treatment approaches and associated outcomes in hospitalized patients with Factor Xa inhibitor-related major bleeds may inform clinical guidelines, health system decision making and streamline treatment pathways in this population.",
            "detailedDescription": "REVERXaL is a multinational observational study incorporating 2 patient cohorts (historical and prospective) with major bleeds during Factor Xa inhibitor use. This study will be mainly descriptive in nature without any pre-specified statistical hypotheses. Variables will be collected according to routine medical practice either through primary data collection directly from patients, or from secondary data collection via data extraction from electronic or paper medical records into electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard medical care as determined by their treating physicians. Patients will not receive any experimental disease management intervention or experimental treatment because of their participation in the study. As part of routine care, study investigators will evaluate patients about their medical history, medication history, bleeding presentation, and any adverse event (AE) or severe adverse event (SAE) experiences since the previous clinical visit and the related information. No additional or pre-defined site visits will be scheduled outside of the patient's routine clinical visits."
