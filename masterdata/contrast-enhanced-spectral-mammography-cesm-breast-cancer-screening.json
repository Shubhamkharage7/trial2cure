            "detailedDescription": "Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an FDA approved tool for breast cancer detection. However, adoption into clinical practice has been slow. In this study, we will explore patient issues related to the use of CESM for breast cancer screening. For this study, 210 women with heterogeneous or dense breast tissue reported on a previous mammogram, will be recruited to undergo a screening Contrast-enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM). The CESM will serve as the subject's annual screening breast exam for clinical care. A survey will be administered before and after the examination that evaluates the patient experience. Women will not be at high risk for breast cancer (\\<20% lifetime risk). All abnormal findings will be acted upon independently. Results of the general screening population survey will be compared with those of women who choose to undergo the CESM examination in order to evaluate the influence of age, education, and lifetime risk on decision making about advanced screening."

CESM has also been used to determine the extent of a known breast cancer, to screen patients at high risk for developing breast cancer due to a family history or positive cancer genes, and for women with dense breast tissue. Two images are taken almost at the same time during the exam, after the iodine based contrast injection is administered. The first image is comparable to a regular mammogram. The second image shows areas that take up the contrast (enhance) showing increased blood flow. Breast cancers often enhance with contrast due to a greater amount of blood vessels. Non-cancerous lesions can also have greater blood flow.",
