The medicine in the study is called NDec and it is a combination of two medicines (decitabine and tetrahydrouridine). Both medicines are new for the treatment of sickle cell disease, a rare blood disease. The purpose of the study is to compare the absorption of two different NDec versions (a tablet and a capsule). Participant will either get first the tablet and then the capsule, or the other way around. The order in which participant get them is decided by chance. The study will last for about 12 to 45 days depending on the wash-out period between the two stays in the clinic and from recruitment to the first study day."
