            "briefSummary": "Apalutamide is an anti-androgen that blocks the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer growth. This phase IIa trial is designed to determine whether very low doses of apalutamide, given for 3 to 4 weeks before prostate surgery to men with prostate cancer confined to the prostate gland, reduces plasma levels of PSA (a biomarker of apalutamide's ability to block testosterone). If low dose apalutamide lowers PSA levels in this setting, further study of this agent in men with localized prostate cancer who wish to delay definitive therapy with surgery or radiation may be warranted.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the effects of low dose apalutamide on circulating levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the effect of low dose apalutamide on:\n\nIa. Reversibility of testosterone levels 7-14 days post intervention; Ib. Post-intervention plasma trough apalutamide concentration; Ic. Health-related quality of life.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the effects of apalutamide on intra-prostatic immune cell infiltration and Gleason score and the effects of tobacco/alcohol use on the study endpoints.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive apalutamide orally (PO) on study. Patients also undergo collection of blood samples throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of the trial intervention, patients are followed up at 7-10 days, 60 days, and 3 months post-prostatectomy."
