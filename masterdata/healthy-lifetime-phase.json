            "detailedDescription": "HL seeks to intervene early in the aging process when individuals have the best chance for longer term benefits of changing their health behavior, as a means to stave off functional decline, and minimize the onset or exacerbation of chronic conditions. And, for individuals who are experiencing any of the barriers described above, our HL program's Nurse Coaches are prepared and experienced in helping them achieve their highest level of functioning and self-care capacity, while integrating and collaborating with, but not duplicating, their medical services such as primary care, specialty care, and case management or medical social services. While the latter medically oriented services support clinical management, they do not focus on helping older adults maximize health and function by building self-care capacity, long term health behavior change capacity and the functional resilience necessary to sustain or regain independent living."
