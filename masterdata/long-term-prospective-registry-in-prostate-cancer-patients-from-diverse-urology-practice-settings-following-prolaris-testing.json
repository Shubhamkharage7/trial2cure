This registry will evaluate oncologic and co-morbidity outcomes in patients who receive Prolaris testing. Additionally, the registry will measure the prevalence and distribution of pathogenic mutations in hereditary cancer risk-associated genes among men with prostate cancer who meet National Cancer Center Network (NCCN) criteria for hereditary cancer genetic testing.\n\nThe primary objective of this registry is to evaluate initial selection of active surveillance (Active Surveillance selection) versus definitive therapy (DT) among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who make treatment decisions with Prolaris testing, and among patient subsets defined by race/ethnicity.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the registry are to evaluate progression of from Active Surveillance to definitive therapy over time and prostate cancer-associated morbidities that affect quality of life among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and who undergo Prolaris testing, and among patient subsets defined by racial/ethnic background and ancestry."
