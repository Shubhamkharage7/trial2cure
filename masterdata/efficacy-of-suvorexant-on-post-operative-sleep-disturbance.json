            "briefSummary": "The study is a parallel group, double blind, randomized trial. Subjects will be recruited from individuals undergoing elective surgery for orthopedic, abdominal, urologic, gynecologic or spine reasons. Out of 92 subjects, one experimental group of 46 subjects will receive 20 mg Suvorexant beginning the first in-hospital night (\"day 0\") and continuing for their hospital stay. If the dose is not well tolerated (e.g., daytime sleepiness), then the dose may be decreased to 10 mg of Suvorexant.\n\nFor blinding purposes each arm will receive two tablets (two 10 mg tablets or one 10 mg tablet and a placebo). The other control group of 46 subjects will receive placebo (two tablets) and treatment as usual.",
            "detailedDescription": "It is rare to get a good night's sleep in the hospital. Even routine patient care, including alarm systems, and too much light can lead to sleep disturbance. Failure to achieve enough high-quality sleep has been associated with decreased brain and heart function. The investigators aim to restore usual sleep patterns in hospitalized patients to have a positive influence on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Suvorexant, the tested drug in our protocol, works on a different brain chemical system than most other sleep drugs, which may account for its ability to restore natural sleep. Suvorexant has been shown to reduce wakefulness during sleep by a reduction in long wake bouts. This reduction has a positive effect on sleep quality. In keeping with Suvorexant's established ability to decrease insomnia in outpatient settings, the investigators will assess its efficacy to improve sleep quality in the hospital environment in patients having surgery who have sleep disturbance. Suvorexant will be administered beginning on the night after surgery and through the hospitalization (it is estimated that stays will be 1-3 days; the investigators will set a maximum of 4 days). If the dose is not well tolerated (e.g., daytime sleepiness), then the dose may be decreased to 10 mg of Suvorexant. The investigators aim to study the participant's sleep patterns by using a self-wearable electroencephalography (EEG) recording device, the Sleep Profiler, and see patterns such as total sleep time or the stages of sleep such as rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM, etc. Additionally, the investigators hope to determine if concentration, attention, and general cognitive performance are improved as a result of better sleep. Promoting \"natural sleep\" may improve surgical recovery through the lessening of fatigue and improvements in brain health."

For each item, respondents are given a visual analogue scale and are asked to place a mark on the line indicating where their own experiences fit between two extremes (for example, the degree to which they received a \"good night's sleep\" or \"a bad night's sleep\"). Scale lines extend from 0 to 100 mm, and scores are calculated by measuring where responses fall on each line. A total score is obtained by summing each score out of 100 and dividing the total by five. Lower scores indicate a poorer quality of sleep (worse outcome).",
