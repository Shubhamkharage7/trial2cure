            "detailedDescription": "The investigators seek to determine if improved breast cancer detection is maintained with biennial contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) added to annual digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with overall fewer false positives than from annual DBT plus CEM. The investigators will offer biennial CEM exams for eligible patients. Enrolled participants will have a baseline CEM exam with their routine DBT exam, and then have another CEM exam 24 months after their baseline CEM exam and then again at 48 months. Participants will continue to have their annual DBT exams during this time as a part of their usual care. Two radiologists (one primary) will evaluate each pair of examinations by sequentially interpreting each of DBT and CEM in opposing order (primary reader DBT then CEM and secondary reader CEM then DBT), initially blinded to the other modality. We expect that with biennial screening, at least a similar number of cancers will be detected with CEM (and possibly more that were occult on the DBT-only screen 12 months prior), with a similar incremental false-positive rate and at least similar (if not improved) overall positive predictive value (PPV1)."
