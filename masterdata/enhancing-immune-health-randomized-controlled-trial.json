This psychoeducational intervention supports lifestyle changes, including promotion of immunity-enhancing nutrition and immunity aids, activated intentions to receive needed inoculations and annual health screenings, better sleep, and more effective stress management. Adult clients of collaborating community mental health agencies are randomly assigned to the intervention plus services as usual, versus services as usual alone. They are assessed at baseline, two months post-baseline, and three months later. Multivariable analysis models are used to assess the primary outcome of self-reported immune status."

They evaluate what participants already know about immune health to assess how to expand participants' understanding of immunity and health self-management. Instructors engage participants in personally-meaningful activities and goals to improve their immune health literacy and behaviors.
