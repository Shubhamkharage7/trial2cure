            "briefSummary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased caregiving demands for caregivers of Veterans with dementia. Dementia caregivers are particularly at-risk for depression and anxiety, known risk factors for increased suicidality. Emerging research also suggests that dementia caregivers are experiencing greater suicidality during COVID-19 at a time when VHA is also devoting increased efforts toward caregiver health and support services. Aims are to determine the feasibility and acceptability of video-delivered Problem-Solving Therapy for reducing suicide risk in caregivers of Veterans with dementia.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed single-arm pilot will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a brief behavioral treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and for increasing reasons for living in caregivers of Veterans with dementia. The proposed study will examine Problem Solving Therapy (PST) using a protocol that teaches skills to address emotional and practical barriers to effective problem solving. The VA usual care practice of collaborative safety planning will also be included in the treatment protocol, herein referred to as enhanced usual care (EUC). For participant safety, all caregivers will receive both PST and EUC. The study design is a single arm. Both PST and EUC are evidence-based interventions, and the treatment is delivered in six sessions. The study will occur at VA Palo Alto.\n\nThe assessments and treatments will be conducted entirely by video. Participants will be sent VA-approved tablets. Longitudinal assessment of suicidal ideation and reasons for living will occur at eleven timepoints: baseline, after each of the six weekly treatment sessions, posttreatment (7 weeks), at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. The recruitment goal is 10 caregivers. Caregivers must be 50 years or older and report suicide ideation to be eligible. Veterans will be excluded and referred for other services if they have psychotic symptoms, bipolar disorder, or severe OCD; an alcohol/substance use disorder; severe or unstable medical conditions; recent head injury (past year) or history of a head injury with loss of consciousness for 24 or more hours; terminal illness; positive cognitive screen indicative of possible dementia; or if they are unable to participate in the study or follow-up sessions. Recruitment will occur through multiple strategies at VA, Vet centers, and in the community to ensure the feasibility of recruiting a total of 10 caregivers."
