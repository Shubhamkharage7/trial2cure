It consists of two phases- an open label pilot and a randomized waitlist control trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "CAPABLE is a multicomponent goal-directed program that reduces physical disability by working with the person and environment but has not been explored in prehabilitation research. The purpose of this study is to adapt CAPABLE, an existing evidence-based program for functionally and socio-economically vulnerable older adults, as a prehabilitation intervention for people with frailty awaiting KT.\n\nAs in CAPABLE, the delivery characteristics of CAPABLE Kidney Transplant consist of an assessment-driven, individually tailored package of interventions delivered over the course of 4 months by an occupational therapist (OT) (\\~6 home visits for \u2264 1hour), a registered nurse (RN) (\\~4 home visits for \u2264 1hour) and a handy worker (HW).\n\nIn earlier phases, research team members conducted preliminary activities to design the CAPABLE Kidney Transplant intervention using Human-Centered Design techniques.\n\nThis study will seek to accomplish two aims:\n\n1. To iteratively refine the CAPABLE -Transplant prototype for those currently KT inactive. -\n2. To pilot test the CAPABLE-Transplant intervention\n\nThe investigators will collect feedback during the open label pilot to further refine the intervention that will be tested as part of the randomized control trial."
