Participants are English- and Spanish-speaking patients from a county-based public health system who have received a positive airway pressure device for the treatment of sleep apnea. An unlicensed, trained health coach will call patients three times to resolve barriers to adherence. Primary outcomes include both adherence measures collected by the device modem at baseline and 4 months, and patient-reported outcomes such as daytime sleepiness."
