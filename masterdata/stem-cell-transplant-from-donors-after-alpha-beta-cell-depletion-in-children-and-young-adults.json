Initially this device will be used in a single-center, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of haploidentical PBSC grafts depleted of TCR\u03b1/\u03b2+ and CD19+ cells using the CliniMACS\u00ae TCR\u03b1\u03b2/CD19 System in children and adults with hematological and non-hematological malignancies."
