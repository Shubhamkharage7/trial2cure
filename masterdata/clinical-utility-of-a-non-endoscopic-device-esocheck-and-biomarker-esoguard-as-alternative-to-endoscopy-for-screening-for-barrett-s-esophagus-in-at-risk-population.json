Physicians eligible for participation are those whose scope of practice includes preventative care and disease screening - namely screening of BE, such as primary care physicians, family medicine physicians, and general practitioners; physicians whose scope of practice include diagnosis and management of esophageal disease may also participate.\n\nThe participants will complete two rounds of questions concerning the assessed risk for BE and decision for endoscopy referral of 6 patient cases (clinical vignettes). Per round, there will be 3 different questionnaires consisting of 6 clinical vignettes (A/B/C). Participants will be randomized to questionnaire A, B or C according to the randomization scheme. After the first round has been completed, an EsoCheck/EsoGuard educational information package and the second round of 6 clinical vignettes including EsoGuard results will be sent."
