            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this trial is to test whether treatment with tralokinumab (administered subcutaneous injections \\[SC\\]) in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) is safe and effective to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in children and infants. This will be judged by a range of assessments that rate the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis and its symptoms, as well as general health status and quality of life. The trial will last for up to 4 years. There will be visits every 2 weeks for the first year and every 6 weeks thereafter. Some of the visits will be conducted by phone.\n\nThe study involves two different age groups: children aged 2 to under 12 years and infants aged 6 months to under 2 years. This trial compares tralokinumab +TCS to placebo + TCS for children with moderate-to-severe AD and evaluates tralokinumab + TCS for infants with moderate-to-severe AD. Infants will not receive placebo. All subjects will go through a screening process, which is the first part of the trial and will last up to 4 weeks. During this period, it will be checked if the child or infant meets the criteria to participate in the trial.\n\nThe children will be randomly assigned to receive tralokinumab + TCS or placebo + TCS for the initial 16 weeks, with the treatment being double-blinded. During the first 16 weeks, children will have a 2 out of 3 chance of getting tralokinumab and a 1 out of 3 chance of getting placebo. Thereafter, all subjects will receive tralokinumab + TCS. The infants will receive tralokinumab + TCS as open-label treatment for the entire treatment period, meaning that the participants will know they are receiving tralokinumab. After stopping treatment, all participants will enter a 4-week safety follow-up period."
