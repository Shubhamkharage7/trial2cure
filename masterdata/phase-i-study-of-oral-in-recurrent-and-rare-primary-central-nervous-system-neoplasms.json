            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, and exploratory study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile (establish the maximum-tolerated dose) and evaluate the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) following single weekly or multiple-day weekly dose regimens of single-agent, oral ONC206 in patients with recurrent, primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, and exploratory study of ONC206 in patients with recurrent, primary CNS neoplasms. All patients will be informed about the study and potential risks and required to provide written informed consent prior to undergoing study-related procedures.\n\nThere will be a total of 11 Dose Levels. Dose-escalation for Dose Levels 1 through 5 proceeded according to standard 3+3 design using a 28-day DLT window. The first cohort of 3 patients enrolled into the study received Dose Level 1 followed by increments as per the modified Fibonacci sequence. It is anticipated that approximately 46 patients will be enrolled in order to determine the MTD of ONC206.\n\nFor Dose Levels 1 through 5, a safety evaluation was conducted when 3 evaluable patients have completed 1 cycle (28 days) of therapy. After Protocol Amendment 6, all available PK data will also be considered for dose escalation decisions. Dose levels may be adjusted based on review of PK data but will not exceed maximum dose levels described in Table 6. Additionally, dose frequencies (e.g., once daily or 3 times daily) may be added and/or removed based on emerging PK data and concentration projections.\n\nPrior to advancing/changing dose levels, a cohort summary must be completed and submitted to the sponsor Medical Monitor, for review and approval. Dose escalation for subsequent patients will proceed as follows:\n\n* If no DLT is reported at a dose level, that dose level will be considered safe, and patient(s) will be enrolled at the next dose level. Toxicity information will continue to be evaluated from the time of the first protocol specific intervention, until 30 days from the last dose of study drug.\n* If 1 patient in a cohort of 1 experiences a DLT, the dose level will be expanded to obtain an additional 2 evaluable patients.\n* If 1 patient in a cohort at a dose level experiences a DLT, the dose level will be expanded to obtain an additional 3 evaluable patients.\n* If 2 of 3 patients in a cohort at a dose level experience a DLT, that dose level will not be considered safe, no further dose escalation will take place, and the MTD will have been exceeded\\*.\n* If 1 patient experiences a DLT among the expanded cohort of evaluable patients, a cohort of 3 patients will be enrolled in the next higher dose level.\n* If 2 or more patients experience a DLT among the expanded cohort of evaluable patients, that dose level will not be considered safe, no further dose escalation will take place, and the MTD will have been exceeded\\*. The previous dose level at which \u22641 patients experienced a DLT will be declared the MTD.\n\n  * When the MTD has been exceeded:\n\nIf less than 6 patients have been treated in the next lower dose level (the possible MTD level), additional patients will be entered into this dose level until there are 6 patients treated. If \u22641 of these 6 patients encountered DLT, then this dose level will be declared to be the MTD. If 2 or more of the 6 patients encounter DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded.\n\nGiven the experience with ONC201, it is possible a MTD may not be reached through the planned dose escalation cohorts. If the therapeutic target concentrations have been achieved in the dose escalation cohorts, and no DLT has been identified, then analysis of the safety and PK data will be evaluated by the Investigators and the Sponsor. Further dose levels may then be considered at higher intermittent dosing schedules and will be added by protocol amendment with review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) before implementation.\n\nToxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 24.0 (CTCAE 24.0). If the CTCAE 24.0 does not apply to an adverse event, it will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe.\n\nDLTs will be assessed during the first course of each cohort (28 days), and refers to a study drug related or possibly related event that meets 1 of the following criteria using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0:\n\n* Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity.\n* Grade 4 hematologic toxicity (ANC \\<0.5 \u00d7 109/L and platelet count \\<25 \u00d7 109/L). Lymphopenia is not considered a DLT. A confirmed DLT requires 2 consecutive measurements separated by 48 hours.\n* Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC \\<1.0 \u00d7 109/L) with elevated fever (\\>101\u00b0F). A confirmed DLT requires 2 consecutive measurements.\n* Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding.\n* Inability to receive the scheduled Cycle 2, Day 1 dose of study drug within 14 days due to study drug-related toxicity persisting from Cycle 1 or study drug-related toxicity newly encountered on Day 1 of Cycle 2.\n\nSafety and tolerability will be monitored by assessing physical examinations including height (at Screening only) and weight, KPS, vital signs, ECG, laboratory assessments including hematology, chemistry, and coagulation, as well as collecting of the AEs at every visit."

Patients who are unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the Investigator.\n5. Patients with a known HIV-positive test on combination anti-retroviral therapy are ineligible for this initial first-in-human trial because of the potential for PK interactions with ONC206.\n6.

If the patient has had a recent tumor resection, cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic changes that occur peri operatively are not an exclusion.\n9. Patients with refractory epilepsy are excluded. Patients with primarily or secondarily generalized seizures in the 28 days prior to study enrollment will be excluded. Peri-operative seizures, defined as seizures occurring within the 7 days after a stereotactic biopsy, open biopsy, or surgical resection will not be an exclusion as long as the patient has had no generalized seizures starting 8 days after the surgical procedure.

Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, or men who do not agree to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 16 additional weeks after the final dose of study drug.\n\n    Highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n    * True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n    * Sterilization: Females must have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n    * Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n    * If patients are not practicing true abstinence and/or if the patient or sexual partner have not had a sterilization procedure as listed above, patients and their sexual partners must follow double barrier contraception in accordance with the guidelines for contraception below:\n\n      * Females of childbearing potential:\n\n        * Must use an intrauterine device or intrauterine system, during dosing of any study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study drug; or\n        * Must use a double barrier method of contraception: use of an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) with spermicide for women combined with use of a condom by their male partners capable of conceiving offspring.\n      * Males capable of conceiving offspring must use condoms during dosing of study agent and for an additional 16 weeks after final dose of study drug.\n\n    Note: Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by CYP interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study.\n20.
