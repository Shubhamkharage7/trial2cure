            "detailedDescription": "Newly proposed studies will identify the inflammatory cues that draw immune cells into islets for disease initiation (Project 1); probe the motility of immune cells through inflamed vasculature to the target organ and antigen priming sites within secondary lymphatics (Project 2); and characterize the T1D-associated adaptive immune signatures in blood and immune tissues (Project 3).\n\nThe overall hypothesis of the renewed P01 states: 1) the impact of T1D-risk variants will vary by tissue, cell subset, and activation state, and 2) risk variants, cellular stress, and defects in immunologic pathways are key to engender the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic B-cells that results in T1D."
