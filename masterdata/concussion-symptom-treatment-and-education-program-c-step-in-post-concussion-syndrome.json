            "detailedDescription": "This prospective randomized intervention study aims to determine if C-STEP improves outcomes for children with post-concussion syndrome. Forty children with post-concussion syndrome referred to the Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) Complex Concussion Clinic will be randomized to receive either usual care in the NCH Complex Concussion Clinic (comparison) or usual care in the NCH Complex Concussion Clinic plus four weekly sessions of C-STEP (treatment).\n\nC-STEP has been developed for patients with post-concussion syndrome. The CBT intervention involves 4 primary components: psychoeducation, activity management, sleep hygiene, and relaxation training (adapted from McNally et al., 2018). Psychoeducation involves providing patients and families with information about typical concussion symptoms and recovery, the role of non-injury/psychological factors in post-concussion syndrome, and information about the mind-body connection. Activity management involves setting specific goals to achieve a return to normal daily activities such as school attendance, schoolwork completion, household activities, and participating in social/leisure activities. The sleep hygiene component involves providing individualized recommendations to promote healthy sleep habits such as eliminating naps, keeping a consistent sleep schedule, turning off electronics at bedtime, or other needed modifications. Finally, relaxation training involves teaching specific evidence-based strategies for relaxation and coping with stress such as diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation."
