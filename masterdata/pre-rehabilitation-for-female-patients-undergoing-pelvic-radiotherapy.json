            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of adding pre-rehabilitation pelvic health physical therapy to standard of care radiation therapy treatment plan for female patients who have been diagnosed with cervical, vaginal, vulvar, uterine, or anal cancer and are a candidate for curative pelvic radiation with external beam. Participants will receive education on using a vaginal dilator for use during treatment and complete questionnaires looking at pain and sexual function.",
            "detailedDescription": "Because of the increasing survivorship rate, there is a need for research addressing the post-treatment side effects of pelvic pain and dyspareunia, due to the significant impact these side effects have on patients' quality of life. Current best practice from trained pelvic health physical therapists for addressing dyspareunia and pelvic pain due to vaginal stenosis after radiation therapy, is vaginal dilation. Vaginal dilators are cone shaped durable medical equipment that are inserted into the vagina with lubricant, to assist in patency of the vaginal canal and stretching of the pelvic floor muscles.\n\nThe primary objective of this pilot clinical trial is to assess the feasibility of implementing a collaborative, coordinated, and multidisciplinary initiative between radiation oncology and pelvic health physical therapy to answer the following questions: 1) What are the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a pre-rehabilitation service for gynecological and female anal cancer patients undergoing pelvic radiation and 2) What is the potential clinical value of adding pre-rehabilitative pelvic health services, with an emphasis on vaginal dilator education and use, to the gynecological and female anal cancer radiation setting, in collaboration with radiation oncology staff, as a means of reducing pelvic pain and dyspareunia?"
