            "briefSummary": "This multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study is being conducted to determine if the experimental cell therapy is safe, tolerable and can delay the return of cancer in patients with a newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in combination with standard chemotherapy treatment temozolomide (TMZ). If there is a 25% or greater improvement in survival in this study then the therapy should be studied further.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1b and 2 open-label cellular therapy trial using genetically modified gamma-delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cells or DeltEx Drug Resistant Immunotherapy (DRI). Gamma-delta T cells are a type of immune cell that may help the immune system recognize and kill cancer cells. The cells have been modified to make them resistant to the killing effects of chemotherapy such that they may be administered in combination with chemotherapy without being destroyed. The chemotherapy that is being used in this study is called temozolomide (TMZ) which is the standard-of-care used to treat glioblastoma patients. The DRI cells are given in combination with a standard dose of TMZ and are administered through a catheter directly into the brain where the tumor is located.\n\nThere are four arms to this study for eligible subjects with either newly diagnosed or relapsed IDH wild-type (IDH-wt) glioblastoma (GBM). Arm A will enroll newly diagnosed glioblastoma subjects to receive DRI cells derived from their own cells (autologous). The Phase 1b, Arms B and C will enroll subjects to receive DRI cells derived from a donor's cells (allogeneic). Subjects in the Phase 1b portion and Arm B must have relapsed disease, that is disease that has returned after initial treatment, while Arm A and C subjects must have newly diagnosed disease.\n\nPrescreening subjects will have a standard-of-care surgical resection of their tumor. Once their preliminary eligibility is confirmed, they will have a Rickham catheter placed which is a device typically used to deliver chemotherapy into the brain that will be used to deliver the DRI cells directly to the tumor.\n\nFollowing the surgical resection, subjects in Arm A will return to the study doctor's office/clinic to undergo a procedure called an apheresis. This procedure will isolate the immune cells from the blood to help make the DRI product for the subject. These cells include the gamma-delta T cells that will be used to make the DRI cells. Once the cells for the DRI product are made, they are frozen and stored for future use. In the Phase Ib and Arms B and C of the trial, a donor will undergo apheresis to provide the source of cells for the DRI product.\n\nFollowing apheresis and confirmation that the required number of gamma-delta T cells were successfully collected; subjects in Arm A and C will begin the recommended or standard-of-care treatment for newly diagnosed GBM. This will include six weeks of chemotherapy with TMZ and radiation. Subjects will then have about a four week break prior to beginning the maintenance phase of treatment. Maintenance therapy includes five days of chemotherapy, every 28 days, which is repeated for six cycles. The previously frozen DRI product is thawed, prepared and is infused on the first day of each five-day cycle through the Rickham catheter. Subjects received a total of 6 infusions.\n\nSubjects in the Phase Ib and Arm B will only receive one dose of TMZ along with the DRI product every 28 days for a total of six cycles.\n\nSubjects will be observed for a of minimum 30 days after receiving the first dose of the DRI gamma-delta T cells. Subjects will be followed for potential side effects. The approximate duration of the study may be up to 15 years, or until disease progression or subjects withdraw from the study."
