            "briefSummary": "The heart and brain are regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Control of these organs can be disrupted in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). This may affect their ability to regulate blood pressure during daily activities and process the high-level information. Previous studies show that high-intensity exercise induces better outcomes on heart and information processing ability in non-injured people compared to moderate-intensity exercise. However, it is unknown the effects of high-intensity exercise on heart and brain function in people with SCI. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of a single bout of high-intensity interval training on heart and brain function in this people with SCI compared to age- and sex-matched non-injured controls.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be a cohort control study involving two groups: individuals with SCI, whose level of injury is at the 6th thoracic vertebra or above, and age- and sex-matched controls. Eligible participants will be asked to visit the Laboratory located at 115 Kimball Tower, University at Buffalo South Campus, twice. The first visit takes up to 3 hours, and the second visit takes up to 5 hours."
