Patients enrolled will also contribute biopsies to support manufacturing requirements. All patients will be followed through 24 weeks post-treatment.\n\nPatients will be evaluated at their Screening Visit (D -60 to D -25), a phone call approximately 14 days after screening, and at Baseline (Day -1) prior to treatment on Day 0. Patients will remain in the hospital, or other suitable inpatient medical facility that will allow appropriate immobilization of treated wounds, as determined by the Investigator, for observation for up to 7 days (\u00b12 days) following treatment. They will be evaluated by phone on Day 14; by telehealth visits on Weeks 4, 8, and 18; and by clinic visits on Weeks 12 and 24."
