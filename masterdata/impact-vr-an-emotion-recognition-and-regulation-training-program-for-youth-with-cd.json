            "briefSummary": "Conduct disorder (CD) is one of the most prevalent childhood psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, there are limited treatments available for CD. The present study aims to test an innovative virtual reality intervention called Impact VR for symptom reduction in a sample of 60 youth with CD.",
            "detailedDescription": "Within the CD diagnosis, a subset of youth (12-46%) display callous-unemotional (CU) traits (termed \"limited prosocial emotions\"). CU traits denote additional symptoms including a lack of remorse/guilt, a callous lack of empathy, shallow affect, and/or lack of concern about performance. Although both CD and CU traits are inextricably linked to poor outcomes for youth, there remains a scarcity of targeted interventions for CD and CU traits. One of the most significant challenges for treatment is that youth with CD are often perceived by providers as treatment-resistant and treatment disrupters. This leads to poor treatment retention and further isolation from treatment opportunities. Further, existing interventions that target antisocial behaviors more generally are costly because they require 24/7 behavioral management therapies. Impact VR is a psychoeducational intervention for improving emotion recognition and regulation, using immersive gameplay and storylines that are relevant to youth. Impact VR uses evidence-based cognitive and dialectical behavioral approaches to improve emotion regulation. At the center of Impact VR is an individualized training program that teaches youth to effectively identify emotional expressions in others."
