Patients will be randomized to Xiflam the study drug (n=10) or Placebo (n=5). Both Xiflam and Placebo will be taken once daily by mouth for 12 weeks.\n\nI. Baseline Screening Visit After obtaining informed consent and before treatment is initiated, an initial study visit will be conducted in person to confirm subject eligibility. Subjects will be asked complete a baseline questionnaire to assess signs and symptom severity. During this screening visit, a baseline blood sample will be obtained to determine any changes over time in any of the measured parameters. These include biomarkers of inflammation. Additional study procedures occurring during the baseline/screening phase of this study are outlined in the protocol. Patients who are found not to meet inclusion criteria, will not be entered into the treatment Phase of the study."
