Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized to receive platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or saline injections. The study is designed as an 9-month study. This study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.\n\nSubjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered for enrollment."

Patients who have been using agents that may affect eyebrow hair growth for at least 12 months may be included if the patient agrees to continue their current dosing regimen for the duration of the study.\n4. Known disease, infection, or abnormality in the treatment area or hair shaft\n5. Patients with tattoos, scars, hyperpigmentation, or other features which could prevent accurate evaluation of hair growth in the eyebrow area.\n6.
