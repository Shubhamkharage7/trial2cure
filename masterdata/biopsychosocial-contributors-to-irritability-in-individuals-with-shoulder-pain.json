Irritability is deeply embedded in the physical therapy clinical decision-making process. However, the mechanisms contributing to irritability are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to characterize pain sensitivity and pain-related psychological factors by irritability level in individuals with shoulder pain."
