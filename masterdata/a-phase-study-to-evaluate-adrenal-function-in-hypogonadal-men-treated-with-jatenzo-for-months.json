The dose of JATENZO will be titrated using its standard dose-titration algorithms based on serum testosterone levels. The Treatment Period will consist of Visits 1 - 12, with cosyntropin stimulation test completed at Visit 9 (Day 169 \u00b17) and Visit 12 (Day 365 \u00b17). At each visit during the Treatment Period, subjects will be evaluated for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, occurrence of adverse events, and changes in concomitant medications. There will be a safety follow-up visit 2 weeks after completion of Visit 12."
