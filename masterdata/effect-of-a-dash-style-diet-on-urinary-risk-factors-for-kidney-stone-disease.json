            "briefSummary": "The true capacity for a healthy diet to improve urinary stone risk factors is not well-defined. The objective of this study is to measure the effect of adopting a healthy dietary pattern on kidney stone disease (KSD) risk. The working hypothesis is that a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet will improve 24-hour urine stone risk parameters. The approach to testing this hypothesis will be to randomize participants with KSD to a standardized DASH-style vs. Western-style diet for one week. The Bionutrition Unit of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science will provide all meals to participants. The rationale for this study is that by measuring the effect of a DASH-style diet on urinary stone risk parameters, a benchmark for future real-world, implementation studies will be established. Based on available evidence, this will be the first controlled diet study to assess the DASH dietary pattern for improving urinary stone risk parameters."
