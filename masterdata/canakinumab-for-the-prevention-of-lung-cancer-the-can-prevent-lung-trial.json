Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving canakinumab may prevent the development of lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine whether canakinumab increases regression rate of high-risk pulmonary nodules.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether canakinumab prolongs lung cancer-free survival. II. To determine whether canakinumab decreases the incidence of lung cancers. III. To assess the safety and tolerability of canakinumab in patients with high-risk indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs).\n\nIV. To assess quality of life by patient reported outcomes in patients treated with canakinumab.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the radiographic (including radiomic features) evolution of high-risk IPNs with treatment of canakinumab and to assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with canakinumab.\n\nII. To explore the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire evolution of patients with high-risk IPNs and assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with canakinumab.\n\nIII. To explore the evolution of serum soluble factors, such as IFN-gamma and interferon inducible factors (such as CXCL9 and CXCL10), IL-12, TNFalpha, IL-10, TGF-beta, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-18, C-reactive protein etc.) and assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with canakinumab.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive canakinumab subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks."
