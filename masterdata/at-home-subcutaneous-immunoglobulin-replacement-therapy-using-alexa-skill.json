Participants will be enrolled into following observational Cohorts:\n\n* Adult patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID)\n* Caregivers of patients with a self-reported diagnosis of PID\n* HCPs who prescribe SCIG for patients with PID\n\nInterviews will be conducted by a trained qualitative research interviewer with patients, caregivers, and HCPs, and self-reported data will be collected.\n\nThis trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the study will be approximately 4 months."
