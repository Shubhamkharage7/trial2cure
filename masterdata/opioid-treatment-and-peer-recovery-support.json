Determine whether client-level outcomes are further enhanced by the introduction of Peer Support Services.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background: The purpose is to determine whether a facilitated local change team (LCT) intervention improves linkage to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and implementation outcomes, and whether participant-level outcomes are further enhanced by the use of Peer Support Specialists (PSS).\n\nMethods/Design: This Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study involves a pre-post design (implementation study) followed by a randomized trail of PSS (effectiveness study). The study is conducted at 7 performance sites in 3 states.\n\nPhase 1 (Core Implementation Study): The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainability (EPIS) framework is used to guide system-change through facilitated LCTs consisting of probation and community treatment staff who are given a core set of implementation strategies which are used to conduct a needs assessment and set goals. The overall objective is to improve linkage to the continuum of evidence-based care for justice-involved individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Organizational (program-level) and staff survey are collected at the end of each EPIS stage (baseline Exploration, end of Preparation, end of Implementation, and 12 months \\[Sustainability\\]). Implementation outcomes: Organizational engagement in MOUD (primary), plus changes in staff knowledge/attitudes and organizational outcomes (secondary).\n\nPhase 2 (Effectiveness Study of PSS): After completing implementation, 450 adults on probation are randomized to receive PSS vs. treatment as usual (TAU), with assessments at baseline, 3, and 6 months. This trial tests whether having a trained peer improves clinical outcomes beyond effects of Core Implementation. Implementation program-level outcomes include organizational engagement in MOUD use (primary outcome); changes in staff knowledge and attitudes about MOUD, commitment and efficacy, readiness for change; organizational attitudes for change, commitment and efficacy (secondary outcomes). Client-level effectiveness outcomes include participant engagement in MOUD (primary outcome), probation revocation, illicit opioid use, and overdoses (secondary outcomes). Other aims include identifying barriers and facilitators, and cost-benefit analysis of PSS.\n\nPrimary Research Questions:\n\nThe primary aim is to test the effectiveness of PSS compared to TAU (agency approach after implementation) on outcomes of individuals on probation: Engagement in MOUD (primary effectiveness outcome), probation revocation (secondary), illicit opioid use (secondary), and overdose (tertiary).\n\nThe second aim is to test the effectiveness of EPIS-based Core Implementation Intervention relative to baseline on engagement in MOUD (primary implementation outcome).\n\nThe third aim is to test the effects of the EPIS implementation strategies relative to baseline on program-level (organizational and staff-level) outcomes.\n\nThe fourth aim is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of implementing PSS compared to TAU.\n\nThe fifth aim is to identify organizational and staff barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation by conducting qualitative interviews with key probation and community treatment stakeholders who are managing and delivering the MOUD program."
