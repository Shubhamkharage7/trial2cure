Patients with PIK3CA-mutant HR-/HER2+ and HR+/HER2+ breast cancer may enroll, the latter cohort will receive concomitant treatment with standard doses of fulvestrant to block HR signaling. In phase Ib part, we will confirm the tolerability of tucatinib and alpelisib combination and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In phase II part, we will expand the testing of this drug combination at MTD to determine the PFS rate."
