All eligible participants with AD will be treated with Dupixent\u00ae for 104 weeks according to locally approved Dupixent\u00ae product label (in country/region where the study is conducted). After the 104-week treatment phase and the last assessment at the End of Treatment (EoT), participants will be followed-up for 4 weeks and an End-of-Study (EoS) visit by telephone at 4 weeks after the EoT visit will end the study for each participant. The maximum duration of the study per participant will be 112 weeks (including screening period).\n\nThe study population will include approximately 48 pediatric participants with AD for long-term treatment with dupilumab:\n\n* Treatment cohort 1 - newly recruited participants with AD (aged \u22656 to \\<12 years at study entry)\n* Treatment cohort 2 - any former PELISTAD participants (from the previous 16-week treatment study \\[PELISTAD/LPS16764\\] who consent to participate in this long-term study; aged \u22656 to \\<15 years at entry to this study)",

If unable to identify non-lesional skin 4 cm from the lesional area, it is acceptable to identify normal looking skin as close to the lesion as possible.\n* Willing to refrain from applying any topical medications on the target assessment areas (including lesional and non-lesional) throughout the study until EoS unless necessary to alleviate intolerable symptoms.\n* Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study-related procedures.

Face and neck may be treated with topical steroids during the washout period if approved by the Investigator.\n* Participants who received a live vaccine within 4 weeks of baseline. Prior/concurrent clinical study experience\n* Current participation in another investigational or interventional clinical study.\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a potential participation in a clinical trial.",
