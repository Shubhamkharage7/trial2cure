            "detailedDescription": "R3R01 is investigational small molecule designed to decrease fat levels in certain cells in the kidney and therefore may improve kidney function and reduce damage in the kidney. This is a single arm open-label study enrolling patients in three cohorts. Cohort 1 will include 5 adult (\u226518 y/o) patients from Cohorts 2 and 3 (including at least one patient from Cohort 2 and at least one patient from Cohort 3). Cohort 2 will include approximately 20 male and female patients from 12 years and older with X-linked Alport Syndrome (AS), and male and female patients with autosomal inherited AS. Cohort 3 will include approximately 30 male and female patients from age 12 to 75 years with a biopsy proven diagnosis who present with primary steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with proteinuria.\n\nAll eligible patients will be enrolled to receive R3R01 over a treatment period of 12 weeks with a primary efficacy outcome as the percentage change in proteinuria from baseline to the end of treatment (Day 84) in each cohort as a whole"

If taking other chronic immune-modulatory medications that are small molecules, the dosage must be stable for 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study.\n24. If previous Rituximab treatment is greater than 120 days from screening, CD20 cell count should be within normal limits.\n25.
