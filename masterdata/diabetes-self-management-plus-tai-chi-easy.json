This project will use an established, well-known program for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) and combine it with Tai Chi Easy (TCE)\u2122 to enhance physical health, psychological health, and health behaviors. Participants will be asked to attend 45 minutes of DSMES and 45 min of TCE twice a week for 6 weeks. All classes will be recorded and available online and can viewed at a time when it is most convenient to accommodate working adults. Participants will be asked to complete survey questionnaires online, at the beginning and end of the program; and have a smart phone to connect with a smart ring during the 6-week DSMES+TCE program. After the program is done, participants will be asked to return the smart ring. Upon receipt of the smart ring, they will receive a give a gift card to thank them for their participation in the program."
