Cardiac toxicity, changes in heart function is a well-recognized complication of certain cancer related therapies. Understanding these changes may allow early intervention against therapy-related cardiac toxicity and also identify novel therapeutic targets to protect patient long-term cardiac health. Studying samples of blood from patients with breast cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), identify biomarkers related to cardiac toxicity, and prevent the development of therapy-induced cardiac toxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy.",

Characterize TRPC6 risk variants for doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity in prospectively collected samples from breast cancer patients.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an ancillary-correlative study.\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood samples at time of therapy initiation. Patients who develop cardiac toxicity may undergo additional collection of blood samples. Patients' medical records are also reviewed."
