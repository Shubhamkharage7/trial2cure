            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of body changes in pregnancy on doravirine concentrations, to determine what dose of doravirine should be used. Study participants will remain on their normal antiretroviral medications (ARVs) while participating in this study as prescribed by their regular clinic provider. Study participants will come to the research clinic for three sampling visits throughout their time as a participant. Study participants will only take one dose of doravirine during each sampling visit, which will occur during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, as well as after their baby is delivered. This study was designed intentionally to not give a dose of doravirine in the first trimester when there is the greatest chance for all drugs to potentially cause injury to the baby. Study participants that choose to participate in this study may be enrolled for up to 10 months depending on the length of their pregnancy and how the visits are scheduled.",
            "detailedDescription": "Antiretroviral (ARV) medications are used to treat infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). During pregnancy, ARV therapy keeps women healthy and decreases the spread of HIV to their babies (\\<1-2%).\n\nMany changes occur in the body during pregnancy, which can alter the concentrations of drug in the body. Doravirine (DOR) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ARV, but the extent to which the drug concentrations of doravirine change during pregnancy is unknown. Because these changes are unknown, DOR has not been approved by the FDA for use among pregnant women; however, the FDA has given the researchers permission to use it in this study Pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials, so it can take several years after a drug gets approved before contemporary ARV is available to them.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of body changes in pregnancy on doravirine concentrations, to determine what dose of doravirine should be used. Study participants will remain on their normal antiretroviral medications (ARVs) while participating in this study as prescribed by their regular clinic provider.
