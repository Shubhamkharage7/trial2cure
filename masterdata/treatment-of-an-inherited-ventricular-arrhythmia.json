This disease is associated with fatal changes in heart rhythms leading to sudden death with exercise or excessive excitement. It is due to mutations in the Ryanodine Receptor calcium release channel, which cause leaky channels leading to the disease. S48168 (ARM210) repairs these leaky channels and can be a disease-modifying therapy restoring normal function to the channels. This result would allow patients with CPVT to live normal, active lives.
