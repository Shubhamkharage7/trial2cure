            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib in treating cancer that has metastasized to the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved niraparib for cancer metastasized to the central nervous system (CNS) but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nNiraparib is a type of drug called a \"PARP inhibitor\", which blocks DNA (the genetic material of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place. In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells by not allowing the cancer cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage associated with your diagnosis from occurring.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive the study drug for up to 2 years or until their disease worsens, they have unacceptable side effects, or they meet one of the criteria to be removed from the study. Participants will then be followed every 4 months for up to 2 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the study, including the study drug."
