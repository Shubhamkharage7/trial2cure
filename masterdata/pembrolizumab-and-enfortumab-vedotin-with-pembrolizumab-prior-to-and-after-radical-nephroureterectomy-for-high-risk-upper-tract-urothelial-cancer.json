            "briefSummary": "This phase II clinical trial tests how well pembrolizumab plus enfortumab vedotin prior to and after radical nephroureterectomy works in treating patients with high-risk upper tract urothelial cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) is the surgical removal of a kidney and its ureter. Giving pembrolizumab plus enfortumab vedotin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and may reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed and giving pembrolizumab after surgery may kill any remaining cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess pathologic objective response rate (ORR; complete response \\[CR; pT0\\] and partial response \\[PR; \\< pT2\\] rate) at the time of radical nephroureterectomy.\n\nII. To assess recurrence-free survival post radical nephroureterectomy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To describe the side effect profile, tolerability, and surgical complications in patients receiving neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (pembro)/ enfortumab vedotin (EV) prior to RNU.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Correlative studies will evaluate the predictive potential of imaging and ureteroscopic response (visualization of tumor, biopsy, and cytology), and urinary, serum, and tissue biomarkers to pathologic response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) and enfortumab vedotin IV on study. Patients undergo radical nephroureterectomy and receive pembrolizumab IV on study Patients also undergo magnetic resonance urogram (MRU) imaging and undergo blood, urine and tissue sample collection throughout the study."

Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant\n* Subjects who have previously received enfortumab vedotin or other MMAE-based ADCs\n* Subjects with an estimated life expectancy \\< 12 weeks\n* Subjects with known severe (\\>= grade 3) hypersensitivity to any enfortumab vedotin excipient contained in the drug formulation of enfortumab vedotin (including histidine, trehalose dihydrate, and polysorbate 20). Subjects with known severe (\\>= grade 3) hypersensitivity to any pembrolizumab excipient contained in the drug formulations of pembrolizumab\n* Subjects with another underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair the ability of the subject to receive or tolerate the planned treatment and follow-up; any known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperating with the requirements of the study\n* Subjects with active keratitis or corneal ulcerations. Subjects with superficial punctate keratitis are allowed if the disorder is being adequately treated in the opinion of the investigator",
