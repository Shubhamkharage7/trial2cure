            "briefSummary": "Coffee has been found to have beneficial effects on cognitive function and blood sugar control. Benefits include reduced risk of cognitive decline and improved performance on cognitive tests, as well as reduced risk of diabetes and improved blood sugar control in people with diabetes, a population that is at a higher risk of cognitive decline. These effects have been observed for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, and have been associated with the polyphenol chlorogenic acid (CGA). This polyphenol has been found to be more bioavailable in certain coffees, known as \"speciality coffee\" as defined by the Specialty Coffee Association of America, depending on agriculture, roasting, and brewing method.\n\nThis current project will bring together these previous findings to explore the effects of specialty coffee on cognitive function and glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes through a randomized control trial with two groups: a high CGA specialty coffee group and a conventional coffee control group. Participants will be quasi-randomly assigned to one of these two groups following the completion of a 4-week run-in period during which participants will consume conventional coffee only. The length of the experimental arms is 8 weeks, therefore the total length of the study is 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of each experimental arm participants will undertake a cognitive assessment online using the Gorilla platform, and a series of questionnaires relating to health and mood measures (details in procedure). Cognitive function will also be assessed at the beginning of the 4-week run-in period."
