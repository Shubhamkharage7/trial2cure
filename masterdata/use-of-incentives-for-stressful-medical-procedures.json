            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the use of incentives in pediatric patients requiring medical procedures. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Are incentives effective at reducing pediatric anxiety for medical procedures?\n* What is the best way to use incentives with pediatric populations requiring medical procedures? Participants will be provided support in preparation for their procedure and during the procedure by a child life specialist and might receive an incentive prize after their procedure. Participants distress levels during the procedure will be observed and they will be asked to rate their anxiety on a visual analog scale.\n\nResearchers will compare the anxiety of those who did or did not receive an incentive after their procedure to see if incentives reduced procedural anxiety.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact incentives have on the distress and cooperation of children undergoing stressful medical procedures. The primary aim is to determine if offering an incentive reduces procedural distress for children undergoing stressful medical procedures. Secondly, if an incentive is offered does the process for offering the incentive (conditional or unconditional) to the patient impact the procedural distress of the patient. Patient anxiety and visit satisfaction will be looked at as secondary measures."
