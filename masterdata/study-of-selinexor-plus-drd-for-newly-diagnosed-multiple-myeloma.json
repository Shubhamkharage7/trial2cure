            "briefSummary": "This is a single-arm, phase II, open-label trial to investigate the effects of selinexor (S) in combination with daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (DRd) for first-line treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).\n\nFDA has approved selinexor plus dexamethasone in multiple myeloma after four prior therapies, and DRd is also already approved by the FDA for multiple myeloma. This study will use all four (S-DRd) together to treat MM as an initial treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease with high death rates as a result of developing resistance to treatments. Even with the advent of novel therapies, myeloma patients ultimately progress from frontline therapy. Common treatments include glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors (PIs), Immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), stem cell transplants, and radiation therapy. Optimal frontline therapy with deeper remissions translates to improved overall survival and progression free survival. The purpose of this study is to investigate and improve upon reported outcomes in the frontline setting.\n\nSelinexor has shown potent anti-myeloma activity in preclinical models of MM and Phase 1, Phase 2 clinical studies as well as in a randomized phase 3 clinical trial called BOSTON. Selinexor was approved by the US FDA in July 2019 in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients relapsed/refractory (RR) MM who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, at least two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 (anti-cluster of differentiation 38) monoclonal antibody. In June 2020, Selinexor was approved as a monotherapy by the FDA for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after at least 2 lines of systemic therapy.\n\nTreatment with combination therapies including daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone has shown improvement in response rates, time to progression, and survival. Daratumumab is an approved CD38-directed cytolytic antibody used as a monotherapy for patients with heavily pre-treated MM, and in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The risk of death or disease progression was 44% lower and increased overall response rate (ORR) of 92.9% was observed in patients with newly diagnosed MM that received the triplet combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (DRd) compared to lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd).\n\nTolerability of the DRd combination in patients was consistent between DRd and Rd treatments. The safety profile of DRd was shown to be consistent with known safety profiles of daratumumab and Rd. Higher rates of infections (upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia) and neutropenia in DRd treated patients than in Rd treated patients were observed. However, grade 3 or 4 infections were similar between DRd and Rd treatment groups and were managed by standard of care. After exposure to DRd for a median of 34 months, no new safety concerns were observed in the extended follow-up of the POLLUX phase III study.\n\nPreclinical data demonstrated that patient-derived MM cells were sensitized to the combination of Selinexor and daratumumab compared to the single agents. Clinical data demonstrate an ORR of 74% in patients with relapsed myeloma treated with Selinexor, daratumumab, and dexamethasone.\n\nThe rationale for the combination of Selinexor, lenalidomide, daratumumab, and dexamethasone (S-DRd) in the current study is based on the following: preclinical synergistic activities observed with Selinexor and dexamethasone, the preclinical activity of Selinexor combined with both lenalidomide and daratumumab; as well as the clinical experience of the combination of Selinexor and lenalidomide/dexamethasone can be safely combined with 92% ORR in patients with relapsed myeloma; and the combination of Selinexor and daratumumab/dexamethasone can also be safely combined with an ORR of 74%. There is an urgent need to induce more efficient, deeper and durable responses in patients with newly diagnosed MM."

Has clinically significant cardiac disease, including:\n\n   * Myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months before first day of first cycle (C1D1), or unstable or uncontrolled disease/condition related to or affecting cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class III-IV)\n   * Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade 2 or higher) or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities\n5. Screening 12-lead ECG shows a baseline QT interval (QTc) \\>470 msec\n6. Has any of the following laboratory test results during the screening phase:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count \u22641.0 \u00d7 109 /L; (granulocyte colony stimulating factor use is permitted)\n   * Hemoglobin level \u22647.5 g/dL (\u22645 mmol/L); blood transfusions to maintain hemoglobin \\>7.5 are acceptable\n   * Platelet count \\<75 \u00d7 109 /L for patients in whom \\<50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells; otherwise platelet count \\<50 \u00d7 109 /L; no platelet transfusions in the past 7 days are allowed\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level \u22652.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level \u22652.5 \u00d7 ULN\n   * Total bilirubin level \u22651.5 \u00d7 ULN, (except for Gilbert Syndrome: direct bilirubin 2 \u00d7 ULN)\n   * Creatinine clearance \u226420 mL/min estimated using Cockcroft-Gault;\n7. Has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human proteins, daratumumab or its excipients (refer to Investigator's Brochure), or known sensitivity to mammalian-derived products\n8. Has plasma cell leukemia (\\>2.0 \u00d7 109 /L circulating plasma cells by standard differential), Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and/or skin changes), or amyloid light-chain amyloidosis\n9. Is known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol (e.g., because of alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder) or the patient has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the patient (e.g., compromise their well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments\n10. Is considering becoming pregnant\n11. Has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the patient (e.g., compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol- specified assessments\n12. Has had major surgery within 2 weeks before C1D1, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned during the time the patient is expected to participate in the study or within 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug administration. (Note: patients with planned surgical procedures to be conducted under local anesthesia may participate. Kyphoplasty is not considered a major surgery.)\n13. Is eligible for stem cell transplant. Must be transplant ineligible as determined by their physician, or if transplant eligible, not expect to undergo transplant for at least 24 months after study enrollment.\n\nNOTE: Investigators should ensure that all study enrollment criteria have been met at screening. If a patient's status changes (including laboratory results or receipt of additional medical records) after screening but before C1D1 such that he or she no longer meets all eligibility criteria, then the patient should be excluded from participation in the study.",
