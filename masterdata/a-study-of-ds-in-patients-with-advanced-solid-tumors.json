In Part B (Dose Expansion), the safety and tolerability of DS-9606a will be further explored and the overall response rate will be assessed.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study will assess pharmacokinetic properties of DS-9606a and investigate the duration of response and progression-free survival of DS-9606a, and assess the immunogenicity of DS-9606a."
