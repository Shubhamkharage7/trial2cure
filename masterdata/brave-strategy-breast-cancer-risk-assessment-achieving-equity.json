The BRAVE Strategy (Breast cancer Risk Assessment - achieVing Equity) study aims to assess the feasibility, reach, acceptability, and appropriateness of select customized strategies to increase uptake of breast cancer risk assessment. The investigators will achieve these aims through a conducting a stepped-wedge trial conducted in 10 healthcare clinics in the state of Tennessee. The primary outcome is the proportion of women age 25-49 having risk assessment. Secondary outcomes include the numbers of 1) women identified as high-risk; 2) pursuing risk-adherent screening; and 3) diagnosed with breast cancer."
