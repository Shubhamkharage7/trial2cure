This improvement is usually accompanied by an improvement in function or mechanics or both. Its presence and relevance is determined over 2-3 visits. This study aims to identify the proportion of participants with concussion who present with a directional preference during the course of physical therapy. A secondary aim of this study is to investigate whether directional preference is associated with the eventual patient related outcomes following care."
