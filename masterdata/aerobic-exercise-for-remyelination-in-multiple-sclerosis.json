            "briefSummary": "This is a clinical trial to determine the feasibility of a stationary aerobic cycling intervention and explore if aerobic exercise independently promotes remyelination in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-traumatic disabling neurologic condition of young adulthood, affecting more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Permanent disability in MS is caused by recurrent demyelination due to episodic inflammation, followed by neuronal damage, axonal degeneration, and progressive failure of remyelination. There is an urgent need to restore activity and participation in people with MS (pwMS), and remyelination is the most promising therapeutic strategy to accomplish this goal.\n\nRemyelination in pwMS will likely require integration of pharmacologic and rehabilitative approaches to ensure effective remyelination of appropriate neural pathways. Aerobic exercise is an ideal complement to remyelinating medications because aerobic exercise 1) improves walking function in pwMS, and 2) promotes remyelination in animal models both independently and synergistically with medications. However, there are many unknowns that need to be addressed before aerobic exercise can be explored in multimodal clinical trials for remyelination. First, it is imperative to understand how myelination impacts disability in MS, as many other factors could contribute to reduced activity and participation. Additionally, as remyelination occurs over 12 to 24 weeks, it is imperative to establish the feasibility of similar duration of aerobic exercise interventions, and explore if exercise independently influences established remyelination outcomes before integration into multimodal strategies.\n\nThis is a randomized, single-blind, parallel clinical trial of a 24-week aerobic stationary cycling intervention to determine feasibility and explore if aerobic exercise independently promotes remyelination in pwMS."
