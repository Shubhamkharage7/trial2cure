            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of the study is to determine the efficacy of the treatment with mito-MES 20 mg daily versus placebo for 14 days to prevent confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Primary measure will be confirmed COVID-19 infection based on a diagnostic test within 14 days after exposure. Secondary measures of efficacy will be symptomatic viral infection, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support attributable to COVID-19 disease, mortality. The secondary objective is to determine the safety of mito-MES for 14 days as post-exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 in healthy adults."
