            "briefSummary": "This observational study will be conducted across the Houston Methodist system, including all hospital-based and freestanding emergency departments (ED), and up to 4 additional sites in the United States. The safety of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) 300 IU/mL product (HyperRAB\u00ae) in pediatric patients has not been fully established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of HRIG 300 IU/mL when given to pediatric patients per standard of care for rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in the ED.",
            "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND: Rabies PEP consists of thorough wound cleansing, administration of HRIG 20 IU/kg body weight, and 4 to 5 doses of rabies vaccine. The safety of HRIG 300 IU/mL has been confirmed only for adult patients. Although the safety of HRIG 300 IU/mL in the pediatric population has not been fully established, there is no age limit on the FDA approved indication for HRIG 300 IU/mL, and it is routinely administered to pediatric patients as standard of care in the United States.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: This observational, multicenter, prospective study will collect information on safety events that occur up to 30 days after standard of care administration of HRIG 300 IU/mL among pediatric patients (age \u226417 years) at up to 5 study sites in the United States. Safety data will be collected using surveys and chart review of the health record. All participants will receive HRIG 300 IU/mL per standard of care prior to joining this study. The day of HRIG 300 IU/mL administration will be defined as day 0. The study will conduct Survey 1 on day 2 and Survey 2 on day 10 to collect information on adverse events (AEs). Investigators will review the electronic health record on day 30 to collect additional information on AEs. If a serious adverse event is detected during Survey 1, Survey 2, or the 30-day chart review and is not previously documented as being resolved or stabilized the study will conduct Survey 3 on day 30."
