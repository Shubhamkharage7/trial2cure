            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well CPI-613 (devimistat) in combination with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine works in patients with solid tumors that may have spread from where they first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or that have not responded to chemotherapy medications (chemorefractory). Metabolism is how the cells in the body use molecules (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) from food to get the energy they need to grow, reproduce and stay healthy. Tumor cells, however, do this process differently as they use more molecules (glucose, a type of carbohydrate) to make the energy they need to grow and spread. CPI-613 works by blocking the creation of the energy that tumor cells need to survive, grow in the body and make more tumor cells. When the energy production they need is blocked, the tumor cells can no longer survive. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug used to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis and may also improve the immune system in a way that tumors may be better controlled. Fluorouracil is in a class of medications called antimetabolites. It works by killing fast-growing abnormal cells. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill tumor cells. CPI-613 (devimistat) in combination with hydroxychloroquine and 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine may work to better treat advanced solid tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. The primary objective of this study will be to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of treatment with devimistat (CPI-613) plus HCQ and, depending on the cohort and indication, either 5-FU or gemcitabine.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with solid tumors that are treated with CPI-613 plus HCQ and, depending on the cohort and indication, either 5-FU or gemcitabine.\n\nII. Determine overall survival (OS) of patients with solid tumors that are treated with CPI-613 plus HCQ and, depending on the cohort and indication, either 5-FU or gemcitabine.\n\nIII. Assess duration of response (DOR) of patients with solid tumors that are treated with CPI-613 plus HCQ and, depending on the cohort and indication, either 5-FU or gemcitabine.\n\nIV. Assess safety and tolerability for patients with solid tumors treated with specified treatments.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Blood from patients in cohort 3 that consent will be collected at baseline, cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1), C1D15, C2D1, and at the time of treatment discontinuation for further molecular and metabolic analysis, possibly including but not limited to proteomic, metabolomic, and genetic/genomic analysis.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT 1: Patients with colorectal cancer receive devimistat intravenously (IV), 5-FU IV, plus HCQ orally (PO) on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and undergo blood specimen collection throughout the study.\n\nCOHORT 2: Patients with pancreatic cancer receive devimistat IV, 5-FU IV, plus HCQ PO on study. Patients also undergo CT and/or MRI and undergo blood specimen collection throughout the study.\n\nCOHORT 3: Patients with gastroesophageal cancer receive devimistat IV, 5-FU IV, plus HCQ PO on study. Patients with urothelial, ovarian, or non-small cell lung cancer receive devimistat IV, gemcitabine IV, plus HCQ PO on study. Patients with biliary tumors receive devimistat IV and gemcitabine IV or HCQ PO on study. Patients also undergo CT and/or MRI and undergo blood specimen collection throughout the study."

For this reason and because antineoplastic agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, patients of child-bearing potential (POCBP) regardless of gender must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from time of informed consent, for the duration of study participation, and for 180 days following completion of therapy. Patients who can impregnate their partners regardless of gender must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from time of informed consent, for the duration of study participation, and for 180 days following completion of therapy. Should a patient become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant while they or their partner is participating in this study, they should inform their treating physician immediately.\n\n  * Note: At the discretion of the investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence \\[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods\\] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n  * Note: A POCBP is any person with an egg-producing reproductive tract (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n    * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\n    * Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for \\> 12 months)\n* POCBP must have a negative pregnancy test prior to registration on study.\n\n  * Note: If negative pregnancy test result is \\>7 days from first dose of study treatment it must be repeated at time of first dose of study treatment (with any of the four drugs used in this study).\n* For patients with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy must have a viral load undetectable for 6 months prior to registration.\n* For patients with a known history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n* Patients with a known history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. Patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, must have an undetectable HCV viral load. Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardio toxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. Patients must be class 2B or better.\n\n  * Note: Patients with pacemakers where corrected QT interval (QTc) is not a reliable measure will require an evaluation by a cardiologist to exclude co-existing cardiac conditions which would prohibit safe participation in the study.\n* Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document for the duration of the entirety of the study.\n* Patients must be reliable, willing to make themselves available for the duration of the entire study and willing to follow screening procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1).\n\n  * Note: Patients who experience adverse events of alopecia and peripheral neuropathy that have not recovered are eligible; patients with any lab abnormality that is above grade 1 related to previous therapy found to be not clinically significant will also be eligible.\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastases currently using corticosteroids.\n\n  * Note: Patients with brain metastases who are asymptomatic and off corticosteroids for at least one week are eligible.\n* Patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease.\n* Patients with a history of myocardial infarction that is \\<90 days prior to registration.\n* Patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc intervals. For example, patients receiving amiodarone. Using amiodarone together with hydroxychloroquine can increase the risk of long QT syndrome that although rare, may be serious, and potentially life-threatening.\n* Patients with a history of additional risk factors for drug-induced QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome).\n* Patients with major surgery or significant traumatic injury =\\< 21 days prior to registration.\n* Patients receiving treatment with low dose chemotherapy concurrent with radiation =\\< 21 days prior to registration.\n\nOR patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy =\\< 21 days (42 days for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to registration.\n\n* Note: Palliative radiation before and during study participation is permissible providing it is not to a target lesion.\n\n  * Patients who have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to any of the following, are not eligible:\n* Ongoing or active infection requiring systemic treatment.\n* Clinically significant complications such as perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, or diverticulitis within 42 days prior to registration.\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure; symptomatic coronary artery disease, symptomatic angina pectoris, or symptomatic myocardial infarction.\n* Unstable angina pectoris.\n* Unstable cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Active substance abuse.\n* Any other illness or condition that the treating investigator feels would interfere with study compliance or would compromise the patient's safety or study endpoints.\n\n  * Patients who are pregnant or nursing.\n  * Patients with Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) \\> 470 msec (female) or \\> 450 (male), or history of congenital long QT syndrome. Any electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude safe participation in the study.\n  * Patients who have pre-existing retinopathy of the eye.\n  * Patients who are unable to swallow or retain and absorb oral medication\n  * Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the following: CPI or its inactive components, 4-aminoquinoline compounds, or quinine.\n  * Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of \\> 7%, pre-prandial capillary plasma glucose \\> 130mg/dl, and peak postprandial capillary plasma glucose of \\> 180mg/dl).",
