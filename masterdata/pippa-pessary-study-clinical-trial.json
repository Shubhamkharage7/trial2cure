Specifically, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Pippa Fitness Pessary by assessing reduction in urine leakage in up to 90 women with Stress Urinary Incontinence.\n\nEffectiveness will be assessed by percentage reduction in 1-hour pad weight gain, reduction of stress urinary incontinence episodes per day, and a quality-of-life questionnaire. The safety of the Pippa Fitness Pessary will be evaluated by assessing all adverse events, including the results of urinalysis and vaginal examination."
