            "briefSummary": "Development and pilot testing of a clinician coaching communication intervention to improve communication between medical teams and caregivers (parents, family members) of children in the hospital. Our team is specifically focused on improving partnership, respect, and collaboration with Black and Latinx caregivers of children in the hospital by incorporating elements from trauma-informed care and racial equity into a communication intervention. The investigators will explore the impact of this intervention on child and caregiver mental health both in the hospital and 90 days after discharge.",
            "detailedDescription": "When admitted to the hospital, Black and Latino(a/x) children are at greater risk of medical errors, surgical complications, longer, more-costly hospital stays, and mortality compared to White children. Although many factors play a role, poor clinician communication likely contributes to these disparities in health outcomes. Across settings, including our preliminary work in the inpatient pediatric environment, Black and Latino(a/x) patients have been shown to experience worse communication quality as evidenced by less patient and family-centered, empathic, and respectful communication as compared to White patients. Poor communication can make the hospital stay more stressful for caregivers, with implications for caregiver and child health and recovery from illness. While prior experiences of discrimination and trauma can negatively affect clinician-caregiver communication, current best practices in clinician communication fail to incorporate equity and trauma-informed principles. In this study the investigators will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a pilot randomized waitlist control trial of an equity focused and trauma-informed clinician coaching communication intervention that aims to teach clinicians skills to improve communication in areas where inequities are known to exist (i.e. respect, partnership) and incorporate principles of equity (i.e affirmation) and trauma-informed care. To do this, first the investigators will co-develop and refine a clinician coaching communication intervention with iterative feedback from Black and Latino(a/x) caregivers as well as clinicians of children in the hospital. Second, the investigators will examine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. The investigators will randomize 10 clinicians to an intervention or waitlist group; clinicians in the intervention group will receive the intervention immediately, while clinicians in the waitlist group will initially serve as the control arm then receive the intervention to provide feasibility and acceptability data. The investigators will assess the feasibility of recruiting and collecting data as well as acceptability of the intervention by clinicians. The investigators will explore preliminary efficacy for the effect of the intervention on child adjustment to hospitalization and caregiver post-discharge stress. The investigators hypothesize that our intervention will reduce caregiver stress in the hospital leading to greater participation in hospital care as well as better child adjustment and caregiver mental health after discharge. The investigators will explore the effect of the intervention on child 30 and 90 day readmission."
