For females of child-bearing potential: ability and willingness to use a highly effective form of contraception (as defined in ICH M3 guidance, e.g., true (not periodic) abstinence from sexual intercourse, surgical sterilization (of subject or partner), combined oral contraceptive pill, or any other method or combination of methods with a failure rate generally considered to be \\<1% per year) between the date of screening and at least 48 hours after administration of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients scheduled to undergo transplant or Central Nervous System (CNS) surgery\n2. Patients scheduled to receive only a local anesthetic and/or regional neuraxial (intrathecal or epidural) block (without general anesthesia) or to receive general anesthesia involving total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol\n3.
