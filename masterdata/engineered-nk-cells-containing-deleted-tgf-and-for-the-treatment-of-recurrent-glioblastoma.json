CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- cells are genetically changed immune cells that may help to control the disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of off-the-shelf CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Group 1) II. To evaluate the immunological phenotype and anti-tumor function of NK cells in resected tumor tissue after treatment with CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- in the surgical expansion group. (Group 2)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine response as measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO), duration of clinical response, progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Monitoring immune responses following CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- dosing, in vivo persistence and expansion of CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- during treatment, characterization of immune cell subpopulations in the peripheral blood, serum analysis of immune correlates, alloreactivity characterization, and anti-HLA antibody analysis, and CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- trafficking in tumor microenvironments in the surgical expansion cohort.\n\nII. Tumor tissue from surgical resection will be further analyzed for immune infiltrates, fibrosis, and tumor microenvironment.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP 1: Patients receive CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- intratumorally over 5-10 minutes weekly for up to 8 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nGROUP 2: Patients receive CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- intratumorally over 5-10 minutes on days 0, 7, and 14. Patients undergo standard of care surgical resection on day 15. Beginning 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- intratumorally over 5-10 minutes weekly for up to 5 doses (total of 8 doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 30, and 90 days."

Exceptions include but are not limited to basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy. Any exceptions must be discussed with the protocol PI.\n11. Has known gliomatous cerebri, extracranial disease, or tumor localized primarily to the brainstem or spinal cord.\n12.
