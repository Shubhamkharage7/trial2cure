            "briefSummary": "LCCC1852-ATL is a prospective 2-arm study designed to determine if chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells result in immunomodulation which can be subsequently exploited by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies to achieve clinical responses in subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL).",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study, investigators will enroll subjects with relapsed/refractory cHL being treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. The study will examine the treatment of relapsed/refractory cHL in this population in , two arms with 10 subjects each: (1) Arm 1: 10 subjects who have previously received anti-PD-1 therapy and experienced progression and more recently received CD30 CAR-T cell therapy and have evidence of progression, and (2) Arm 2 : 10 subjects who have never received CD30 CAR-T therapy and have evidence of progression are initiating treatment with anti-PD1 therapy. In both arms of the study subjects will be offered anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab, at the discretion of treating oncologist), as per standard of care in r/r cHL\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy in study Arm 1 subjects within r/r cHL. The secondary objectives will be to measure the change in T-cell receptor clonality during treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression after CD30 CAR-T therapy in these subjects, the change in peripheral blood immunophenotype during treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy and progression free survival (PFS) of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy.\n\nPreliminary data from subjects treated with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression following CD30 CAR-T cell therapy has suggested surprisingly robust clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, this study is an important advancement for understanding both immunomodulation after CD30 CAR-T cell therapy, as well as clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy. This study will serve as a baseline for clinical response and immunomodulation for future clinical trials evaluating the combination of anti-PD-1 therapy and CD30 CAR-T cell therapy."
