Mood Lifters is an effective peer-led program that improves or maintains mental health. It seeks to help people enhance pleasure, engagement, and meaning in their lives while minimizing depression, fear, loneliness, and other negative feelings via a proprietary peer-based program that offers weekly meetings and other flexible support options. One obstacle to providing mental health care in the US is that it is costly to provide one-on-one therapy by a licensed professional. This is particularly true in large group settings with limited resources (counseling centers) and a large need for mental health care, like universities."
