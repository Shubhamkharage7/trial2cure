This trial may help researchers learn more about diet and exercise programs designed to decrease body fat in postmenopausal women who are of normal weight but have an elevated risk of breast cancer because of excess body fat.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate the feasibility of a diet and exercise intervention to decrease body fat in postmenopausal women with normal body mass index (BMI) but high body fat (trunk fat mass 9.4 kg, the 50th percentile of normal BMI women in the Women's Health Initiative \\[WHI\\]).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess preliminary efficacy of the intervention by evaluating the post-intervention differences between the intervention and control groups in:\n\nIIa. Circulating markers of inflammation and metabolic dysfunction linked to both excess adiposity and breast cancer (high sensitivity C-reactive protein \\[hsCRP\\], fasting insulin, leptin, IL-6, triglycerides, sex hormone binding globulin \\[SHBG\\], adiponectin, and high density lipoprotein \\[HDL\\] cholesterol).\n\nIIb. Body composition body fat, trunk fat mass, fat mass, lean mass, fat-free mass).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Exploratory outcomes include fitness (oxygen consumption VO2 peak, sit-to-stand test), behavior (physical activity, energy intake, macronutrient consumption), and quality of life (global health-related quality of life, physical functioning, sleep, menopausal symptoms).\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Participants complete lifestyle intervention consisting of 1-3 sets of high-resistance circuit training sessions per week, up to 150 minutes of aerobic training per week, and diet recommendations from a health coach or registered dietitian twice per week for 16 weeks.\n\nGROUP II: Participants are placed on a wait-list and then complete lifestyle intervention after 4 months."
