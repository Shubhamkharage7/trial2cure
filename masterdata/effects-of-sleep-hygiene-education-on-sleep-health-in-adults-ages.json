Group One will watch a one-time educational video on sleep hygiene, Group Two will watch the video plus be sent daily automated text messages to reinforce the education learned in the video, and Group Three will be a control group with no intervention. The participants in Groups One and Two will receive the education after two weeks of data tracking on a Fitbit device. They then will have four additional weeks of tracking. At the end of the study time of six weeks, all participants will return for follow-up testing. The sleep tracker will monitor the physiological markers of sleep provided by wearable technology on sleep efficiency, time in bed, time actually sleeping, and time spent at each stage of sleep."
