            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective randomized blinded controlled trial that will enroll 175 subjects undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass at NorthShore University HealthSystem. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes in elective and urgent cardiac surgical patients at NorthShore University HealthSystem when receiving sugammadex, a common neuromuscular blockade reversal drug given after surgery and before the breathing tube is removed vs. those patients who do not receive sugammadex (placebo) group. The Investigators will compare the following outcomes in both the sugammadex and placebo groups during patients hospital stay: # of patients who have the breathing tube removed within 6 hour of the end of surgery, time it takes to remove the breathing tube after surgery, ICU and hospital length of stay, cost of the ICU stay, time to achieve a train of four ratio of \\> or equal to 0.9, whether patients develop pneumonia or not, whether they require the breathing tube to be replaced during their hospital stay and to compare the nursing perception of patients recovery within first 24 hours of their ICU stay.",
            "detailedDescription": "At the conclusion of many cardiac surgical cases requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, patients are typically transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the endotracheal tube remaining in the airway postoperatively without routine reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB). This blockade is typically metabolized by the liver/kidney and then patients are liberated from the ventilator in the ICU afterwards. The proposed reason for this strategy is to reduce the potential risk of rebleeding or arrhythmias due to a sympathetic response from patients. A survey among 495 cardiac anesthesiologists in the U.S. in 2002 suggested that only 9% of anesthesiologists routinely reverse NMB in these patients prior to extubation. However, the lack of reversal drug use among any surgical patient population could result in residual neuromuscular blockade, which is defined by a train of four ratio \u22650.9. Patients who do not meet this level of neuromuscular recovery are at risk for a number of adverse outcomes including hypoxemia, airway obstruction, impaired swallowing function, increased risk for aspiration, prolonged length of stay, postoperative respiratory complications, and need for reintubation. The data regarding residual neuromuscular blockade in cardiac surgical patients is limited. A prospective observational cohort of 50 cardiac surgical patients, suggested that 66% of patients had significant residual neuromuscular blockade within 1 hour postoperatively. Prolonged intubation can lead to unwanted adverse outcomes such as pneumonia. Our clinical practice at NorthShore University HealthSystem for cardiac surgical patients changed as it relates to managing neuromuscular blockade. Prior to 2019, the clinical care team (cardiac surgery, intensive care, nursing, and anesthesia) did not routinely discuss dosing or reversal of neuromuscular blockade during the ICU handoff of patients. Anesthesia professionals also did not routinely reverse neuromuscular blockade in post-cardiac surgical patients. In the latter half of 2019, the care team developed a multidisciplinary handoff checklist, which includes discussion regarding the last dose of NMB, and whether the patient was given reversal. The anesthesia professionals changed practice to meet or exceed the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) early extubation national benchmark within 6 hours of the end of surgery. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that by reversing cardiac surgery patients with sugammadex in the ICU, the investigators will be able to achieve the STS early extubation criteria more frequently and it will also result in reduced ICU, hospital length of stay and cost of ICU stay. The investigators also believe it will result in less reintubation and pneumonia."
