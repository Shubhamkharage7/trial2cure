            "briefSummary": "Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a condition that affects both men and women. SUI is the involuntary leakage of urine caused by an increase in intra-abdominal pressure from activities such as exercise, coughing, laughing, or sneezing. It can significantly affect quality of life as patients avoid activities or behaviors that cause leakage. This clinical trial will compare the efficacy of the Emsella chair to sham and determine if electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of SUI.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, sham-controlled, observational study of subjects undergoing electromagnetic perineal stimulation for the treatment of SUI. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive active treatment or sham in a 1:1 ratio. Eight treatments (2 treatments each week) for 4 weeks will be completed with the Emsella chair to the pelvic floor muscles.\n\nElectromagnetic stimulation of the pelvic floor is a FDA approved therapy whereby a coil generates pulsed electromagnetic fields that penetrate deep into the pelvic floor muscles inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation of weak pelvic muscles.The Emsella Chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders. HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over 28 minutes.This technology is typically not covered by insurance, is minimally invasive, and safe, but has limited data available.\n\nCurrently, there is no data available from sham controlled studies evaluating efficacy of this technology. The purpose of this study is to compare the Emsella Chair to sham and to determine whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of SUI."
