Dose escalation will be conducted in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors who are refractory to all standard of care therapies. Dose expansion will be conducted in two arms: Arm A will enroll patients with indications for which a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) is indicated/approved who demonstrate primary or secondary resistance to an anti-PD(L)1 treatment regimen, and Arm B will enroll patients with tumor types for which CPI therapy is not indicated/approved."

Significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities\n7. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years.\n8. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency, on immunosuppressive therapy, or receiving chronic systemic or enteric steroid therapy (dose \\> 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent).\n9. Prior receipt of an allogeneic stem cell transplant or allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy.\n10. Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n11. Investigational agent or anticancer therapy (including chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, anticancer Chinese medicine, or anticancer herbal remedy) within 5 half-lives or 4 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of study drug.\n12. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the start of study treatment. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u2264 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n13. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 Grade 1 at the time of starting study drug with the exception of alopecia and Grade 2 platinum therapy-related neuropathy.\n14. Use of sensitive substrates of major CYP450 isozymes.\n15. Any illness, medical condition, organ system dysfunction, or social situation (including mental illness or substance abuse), that may interfere with a patient's ability to sign the ICF, adversely affect the patient's ability to cooperate and participate in the study, or compromise interpretation of study results.\n16. Received a live vaccine within 30 days of the first dose of study drug.\n17. Active, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.\n18. HIV-infected participants with a history of Kaposi sarcoma and/or Multicentric Castleman Disease.\n19. Active infection with hepatitis B as determined by hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody, or hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing.\n20. Active infection with hepatitis C as determined by hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody or HCV RNA by qPCR testing.\n21. Pregnant or lactating.\n22. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drug components.\n23. Additional criteria may apply",
