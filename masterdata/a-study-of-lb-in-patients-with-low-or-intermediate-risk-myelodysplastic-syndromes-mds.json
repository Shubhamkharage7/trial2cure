LB-100 has previously been administered to patients with various solid tumors. In this study, LB-100 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 120 minutes. This study will be conducted in 2 phases. In phase Ib, escalating doses of LB-100 will be administered to patients to study the safety and to determine a safe dose of LB-100. In phase 2, patients will be administered LB-100 at the dose that was found to be safe in phase Ib. The efficacy (benefits) and safety of LB-100 will be determined in this phase of the study."

For del(5q) patients, failed prior treatment with at least 2 cycles started of lenalidomide defined as no response to treatment, loss of response at any time point, or progressive disease/intolerance to therapy.\n7. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2.\n8. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence; tubal ligation, partner's vasectomy) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has a known history of HIV infection (testing not mandatory).\n2. Patient has any of the following cardiac abnormalities:\n\n   * symptomatic congestive heart failure\n   * myocardial infarction \u2264 6 months prior to enrollment\n   * unstable angina pectoris as designated by the treating physician\n   * serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia as designated by the treating physician\n   * QTcF (Fridericia's correction formula) \u2265 450 msec\n3.

Use of chemotherapeutic agents or experimental agents (agents that are not commercially available) for the treatment of MDS within 14 days of the first day of study drug treatment.\n5. No concurrent use of erythroid stimulating agents, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is allowed during study except in cases of febrile neutropenia where G-CSF can be used for short term. Growth factors must be stopped two weeks prior to study.\n6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LB-100 has not been studied in pregnant subjects.
