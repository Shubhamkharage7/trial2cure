            "briefSummary": "This is a phase I/Ib imaging study of granzyme B, 64-copper granzyme targeting restricted interaction peptide specific to family member B (64Cu-GRIP B) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receiving CD19-directed Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy. The proposed study represents the first-ever lymphoma patient imaging studies with 64Cu-GRIP B PET. The tracer is designed to detect extracellular granzyme B as it is secreted by activated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, which may highlight tumors that will exhibit a durable response to Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19)-directed CAR T-cell therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objectives:\n\n1. To establish the feasibility of granzyme B detection with 64Cu-GRIP B PET in participants with relapsed/refractory NHL receiving CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy in both cohorts.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To descriptively report the patterns of intra-tumoral uptake of 64Cu-GRIP B on whole body PET, including by site of disease, uptake by tumor type, inter-tumoral and inter-participant heterogeneity, and tumor-to-background signal in participants with participants with NHL.\n2. To descriptively report the number of lesions identified on 64Cu-GRIP B PET compared with conventional imaging in participants with NHL.\n3. To assess the safety of 64Cu-GRIP B in participants with NHL undergoing CAR-T cell therapy.\n\nParticipants will be initially enrolled in Cohort 1. Based on the interim analysis, enrollment will begin in Cohort 2. An optional research biopsy will be collected after the post-therapy scan and participants will be followed for 12 months after the end of the study intervention."
