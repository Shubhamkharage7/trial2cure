            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial tests the side effects and best dose of minnelide when given together with osimertinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and has a change (mutation) in a gene called EGFR. Minnelide is a biologically inactive compound that can be broken down in the body to produce a drug that rapidly releases the active compound triptolide when exposed to phosphatases in the bloodstream. Sometimes, mutations in the EGFR gene cause EGFR proteins to be made in higher than normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to divide more rapidly. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking EGFR that is needed for cell growth in this type of cancer. Minnelide and osimertinib may work better in treating patients with EGFR mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of triptolide analog (minnelide) capsules when given in combination with osimertinib.\n\nII. To establish the dose of minnelide capsules recommended for future phase II studies when given in combination with full dose osimertinib (recommended phase II dose \\[RP2D\\]).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of minnelide capsules by objective radiographic assessment when in combination with osimertinib.\n\nII. To determine pharmacodynamic effects of minnelide capsules on heat shock protein (HSP)72 levels when given in combination with osimertinib.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Measure HSP levels, pre/post and during therapy as predictive biomarker. II. Determine levels of minnelide in the blood, and its effect. III. Determine the cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood as biomarker. IV. Evaluate the microbiome pre-, during-, and post-therapy as potentiator of therapeutic response.\n\nV. Determine the exosomes as biomarker.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of minnelide.\n\nPatients receive minnelide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and osimertinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for 2 years."

Female and male condoms should not be used together.)\n    * Agree not to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 180 days after receiving their last dose of study drug.\n* Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medications\n* Previously tolerant of osimertinib at 80 mg QD\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 21 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C). Exceptions to this exclusion are brain radiation and osimertinib\n* Biological therapy, immunotherapy within 21 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n* Strong CYP3A4 inducers/ inhibitors within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n* Patients receiving class 1A or class III antiarrhythmic agents within 14 days prior to Day 1 of protocol therapy\n* Herbal and alternative (eg. turmeric, cannabidiol, ginseng) medications within 7 days prior to Day 1 of protocol therapy\n* Clarithromycin, loperamide, ondansetron within 7 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent\n* Active diarrhea\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Known history of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection\n* Prior malignancy other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or nonmelanoma skin cancer, unless that prior malignancy was diagnosed and definitively treated 5 or more years prior to study entry with no subsequent evidence of recurrence. Patients with a history of low grade (Gleason score =\\< 6 = Gleason Group 1) localized prostate cancer will be eligible even if diagnosed less than 5 years prior to study entry\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Any malabsorption condition\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, except for individuals who have previously-treated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for steroid medication for 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug and have completed radiation 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy\n* Diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
