            "detailedDescription": "Postoperative urinary retention following laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair occurs in approximately one out of ten patients. The more rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade with Sugammadex has empirically been associated with low rates of postoperative urinary retention. In this study, patients will receive Sugammadex following laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and then be retrospectively matched against a group of patients who did not receive Sugammadex. The primary aim of this study will be to compare the rate of postoperative urinary retention between patients receiving Sugammadex and those receiving traditional reversal agents (e.g. neostigmine which has a retention rate of 5-11%). We will also examine difference in cost and quality of life between the two groups. Our hypothesis is that the use of Sugammadex will decrease rate of postoperative urinary retention, decrease associated cost, such as need for admission, and not negatively impact quality of life."
