There will be two arms to test the variables of ML NK cell source. ML NK cells from an autologous source will be used for Arm 1, and ML NK cells from an allogeneic source will be used for Arm 2. The investigators hypothesize that ML NK cells from either an autologous source or allogeneic source are safe and tolerable in subjects with advanced and/or metastatic melanoma."
