            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn the impact of lutein, zeaxanthin, and fish oil (LZF) supplementation in healthy adults.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is: Will supplementation with LZF improve macular pigment optical density (MPOD), cognitive performance and bone mass compared to controls after six months?\n\nSubjects with an MPOD \\<.43 will significantly improve MPOD after 6-months of LZF supplementation.\n\nConsuming a LZFO supplement for 6-months will improve visual cognitive performance. Consuming a LZFO supplement for 6-months will improve bone density.\n\nParticipants will be asked to take either a LZF supplement or placebo daily for 6 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Macular degeneration, cognitive decline, and osteoporosis often occur with aging. Lutein, zeaxanthin, and fish oil (LZF) have been shown to have improvements in these areas. This 6-month double-blind randomized controlled trial will study the impact of LZF on cognitive performance, macular pigment optical density (MPOD), and bone health in healthy adults ages 18-45 with a MPOD \\<.43. We seek to create a precision nutrition model reducing macular degeneration, cognition, and bone health that includes non-invasive screening for high-risk carotenoid deficiencies (MPOD, dietary intake) and individual response to LZF supplementation.\n\nHealthy adults ages 18-45 years with MPOD \\<.43 will be randomly assigned to take a LZF supplement with 7 mg lutein, 14 mg zeaxanthin, and 245 mg fish oil or a placebo daily for six months. They will have baseline and ending measures of fasting blood draw, MPOD, bone health using a DXA, and visual cognitive performance using Neurotracker software."
