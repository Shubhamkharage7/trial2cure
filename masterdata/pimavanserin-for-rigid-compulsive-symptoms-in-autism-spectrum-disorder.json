After completing the second experimental day of the cross-over trial, participants will immediately enter the Open-Label Trial, where they will take pimavanserin 34 mg for six weeks total. There will be 2 recruiting sites with a total sample of 30 participants. Blinding will be maintained by using identical tablets containing either Pimavanserin or placebo."
