Test group: After gingival flap reflection and debridement of bone and root surfaces L-PRF will be applied to the alveolar bone, tooth roots, and gingival flap prior to suturing.\n2. Control group (Standard of care): Gingival flap reflection and debridement of bone and root surfaces, followed by suturing of the gingival flaps.\n\nThe study is a split-mouth design, randomized, prospective clinical trial. The protocol will randomize gingival quadrants in subjects to one of two standard of care procedures OFD or OFD + L-PRF. Patients needing periodontal surgery to correct periodontal disease will be enrolled. There will be two subject groups in this study. Each subject will be randomized to one of the treatments for the first quadrant and the contralateral quadrant will receive the other treatment. No risk is expected from being assigned to either group as both procedures are standard of care, with possible benefit of enhanced wound healing and bone regeneration in the test group.\n\nAllocation of subjects into test group or control group will be based on numbers drawn from a stack of sealed envelopes."
