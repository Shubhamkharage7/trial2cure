            "briefSummary": "This is a research study to evaluate how the genetic makeup of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can affect the response to FDA-approved chemotherapy treatment, FOLFIRINOX, given before surgery to remove the tumor. Certain types of PDAC tumors can be surgically resected (removed). However, not all types of PDACs are resectable, especially if they are close to important structures like blood vessels or intestines. These types of PDACs are treated with chemotherapy such as FOLFIRINOX. Research studies showed that chemotherapy after surgical resection of PDAC tumors reduced the risk of the cancer returning.\n\nChemotherapy is used to treat PDAC that has not spread outside of the pancreas and is not resectable. FOLFIRINOX is a chemotherapy treatment that combines multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and 5-FU. Patients receive these agents by intravenous infusion. Of these drugs, 5-FU requires you to return home with a chemotherapy pump that will deliver chemotherapy over 46 hours. This regimen has been studied in pancreatic cancer that has been removed with surgery as a method for preventing the cancer from returning. Studies showed FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy reduced the risk of cancer returning and increased patients survival. In this study, researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy given before surgery will make the cancer easier to remove with surgery and increase the chances of the cancer staying away after surgery.\n\nResearchers have shown that pancreatic cancers are not all the same when you look at the DNA and RNA that is inside a pancreatic cancer cell.\n\nDepending on the expression of different genes in a cancer cell, some pancreatic cancers may respond differently to chemotherapy. In this study researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy can change the genetic profile of the cancer. This will be studied by obtaining a biopsy of the cancer before the start of chemotherapy, and after 8 treatments of chemotherapy. They will also study cancer cells that will be collected from blood samples.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm, phase II clinical trial designed to assess the impact of tumor and stromal molecular subtypes on the efficacy of neoadjuvant FOLFIRNOX in untreated subjects with resectable, borderline resectable and unresectable locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Subjects will undergo an EUS-guided core biopsy of the pancreas prior to treatment and after cycle 8 of FOLFIRINOX. Imaging will be performed after every 4 cycles of chemotherapy (8 weeks) and reassessed for resectability after 12 cycles. If patients show a response to treatment that is deemed by the surgical oncologist to be amenable to resection, surgery can be pursued after 8 cycles of therapy. In this case, the remaining 4 cycles of treatment will be given after surgery.\n\nDuration of Therapy:\n\nIn the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until:\n\n* Disease progression,\n* Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment,\n* Unacceptable adverse event(s),\n* Subject decides to withdraw from the study, or\n* General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.\n\nDuration of Follow Up:\n\n- Subjects will be followed for 36 months after removal from study treatment or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event."
