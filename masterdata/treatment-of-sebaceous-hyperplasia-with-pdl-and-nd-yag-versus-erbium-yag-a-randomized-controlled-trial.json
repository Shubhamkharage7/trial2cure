Approximately 18 participants will enrolled. Each participant will have their sebaceous hyperplasia lesions randomized to receive either Erbium:YAG, PDL plus Nd:YAG, or ED\\&C treatment. Solitary lesions will be randomized to a group, thus, a patient may receive all three treatments, each on different lesions. Lesions will be treated twice, 2-6 weeks after the first treatment. Lesion size and count will be measured before treatment and at follow-up 4-12 weeks after the first treatment. This study is a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of these procedures.\n\nSubjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered for enrollment."
