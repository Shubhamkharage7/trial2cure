Microdevices will then be removed by resection of the tumor mass during a previously planned, and clinically indicated, surgical procedure.\n* It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this microdevice. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the microdevice as a tool to identify which cancer treatment is best for any disease."

The patient's surgical and/or medical gynecologic oncologist must also confirm the patient's medical fitness to undergo an additional biopsy procedure and the indicated surgical procedure. The patient must have a plan to undergo surgery for clinical purposes.\n* The following criteria must be met:\n\n  * Participants must have undergone an abdominal/pelvic CT scan that both assesses the extent of disease and identifies an area of tumor amenable to safe microdevice placement. CT scans with both oral and IV contrast media are preferred but not required.\n\nCT scans performed at outside institutions are acceptable providing that the images are considered adequate to assess the stage of the disease and to assess the safety and feasibility of the placement of the microdevices and their retrieval during standard-of care surgery. CT scan must be completed within 4 weeks prior to the microdevice placement.\n\n* Patient has sufficient volume of disease as measured by CT scan to allow implantation of the microdevice.\n* Patient has sufficient volume of disease that removal of the lesion where the microdevice is placed will not potentially affect adequate tissue for diagnosis.\n* A lesion can be selected where the microdevice is to be implanted that is\n\n  * Amenable to percutaneous placement\n  * Amenable to removal at the time of surgery or laparoscopy. If patient is undergoing laparoscopy, the lesion must be able to be removed using a laparoscopic approach in a manner that would not significantly alter the procedure or affect patient safety, per opinion of the surgical oncologist.\n\n    * Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n    * Patients must be willing to undergo research-related genetic sequencing (somatic and germline) and data management, including the deposition of de-identified genetic sequencing data in NIH central data repositories.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit the safety of a biopsy and/or surgery.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the possible increased dose of radiation from imaging associated with the microdevice placement and the potential risk to the pregnancy of the biopsy/device placement in an abdominal lesion.\n* Uncorrectable bleeding or coagulation disorder known to cause increased risk with surgical or percutaneous biopsy procedures.\n* Significant risk factors (including, but not limited to, high risk of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke or myocardial infarction) precluding the safe cessation of anticoagulation medication as per SIR guidelines.
