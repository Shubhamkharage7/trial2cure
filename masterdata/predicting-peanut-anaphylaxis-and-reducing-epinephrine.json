Eligible participants will have a small monitor (transepidermal water loss) placed on the forearm during a food challenge (for peanut allergies). This monitor continuously records the amount of water lost through the skin.\n\nIn a previous study the team learned what values are associated with an anaphylactic reaction. These values are called \"stopping rules.\" This study is looking at whether it can use these new stopping rules to end the oral food challenge before a person may show any symptoms."
