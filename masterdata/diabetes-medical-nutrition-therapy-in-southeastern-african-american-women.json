Participants will include 291 African American women with type 2 diabetes that are at risk for development and/or progression of diabetes complications. Both arms, diabetes medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and diabetes MNT plus motivational interviewing (MI), will include: 1) a 3-month active intervention period of six biweekly (every other week), group-based, trained nutritionist-facilitated sessions; 2) a 3-month maintenance intervention period, which will include one group-based maintenance support session; and 3) a 6-month inactive period (no contact). The differences between arms is the integration of culturally-adapted MI exercises during the diabetes MNT plus MI active and maintenance intervention periods."
