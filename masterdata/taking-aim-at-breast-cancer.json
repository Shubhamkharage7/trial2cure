The investigators hope to learn whether participating in a specific exercise program can cause inflammation in the fat tissue to decrease.\n\nThe names of the study interventions involved in this study are:\n\n* Circuit-style aerobic and resistance exercise (CARE)\n* Traditional aerobic and resistance exercise (TARE)\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nThe study treatment will be for 4 months and participants will followed for 8 months.\n\nThe total time for participation in this study will be about 12 months. It is expected that about 300 people will take part in this research study."

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Patients must undergo a pregnancy test via urine strip that will be covered and provided by the PI. Urine strips will be utilized over bloodwork for cost effectiveness. Urine tests will be distributed once before DEXA scans.\n* Are centrally obese with the following criteria\\[57\\] (determined by study team at eligibility screening): BMI \\>30 kg/m2 (calculated using height and weight; an upper limit BMI will not be set; we will rely on obtaining physicians' clearance to assess full eligibility) or body fat \\>30% (estimated by bioelectrical impedance), and waist circumference \\>35 in.\n* Have undergone a lumpectomy or mastectomy.\n* If cancer treatment included neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, participant must have received and completed treatment.\n* Speak English\n* Is in breast cancer remission with no detectable disease present\n* Able to initiate a supervised exercise program (free from any cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity)\n* Free from history of chronic disease including uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension or thyroid disease.\n* Have not experienced a weight reduction \u226510% within the past 6 months\n* Currently participate in less than 60 minutes of structured exercise/week\n* No planned reconstructive surgery with flap repair during trial and follow-up period\n* May use adjuvant endocrine therapy, trastuzumab or pertuzumab if use will be continued for duration of study intervention\n* Does not smoke (no smoking during previous 12 months)\n* Willing to travel to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension or thyroid disease\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents, or concurrent biological, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy\n* Patients with other active malignancies are ineligible for this study.\n* Patients with metastatic disease\n* Is not centrally obese as defined above\n* Has not completed surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment associated with their diagnosis\n* History of any musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory or neurological diseases that preclude the participation in exercise\n* Participates in more than 60 minutes of structured exercise/week\n* Is planning reconstructive surgery with flap repair during trial and follow-up period\n* Currently smokes\n* Is unable to travel to the exercise facilities\n* Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study",
