Patients undergoing cardiac surgery may be particularly susceptible to iron-mediated kidney injury due to the profound hemolysis that often occurs from cardiopulmonary bypass. The investigators will test in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial whether prophylactic administration of deferoxamine decreases the incidence of AKI following cardiac surgery."
