            "briefSummary": "This is a single center pilot study evaluating intraoral photobiomodulation for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Patients who are planned for alloHCT will receive daily intraoral photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) using a novel LED device.\n\nThe name of the study device involved in this study is:\n\n- THOR LX2.3 with LED Lollipop",
            "detailedDescription": "As part of a transplant procedure patients will receive chemotherapy in a conditioning regimen in preparation of alloHCT as well as immunosuppressive medications to help prevent graft-versus-host disease (\"GVHD prophylaxis\"). Together, these treatments will put patients at risk for developing side effects. A common side effect is oral mucositis (OM), in which mouth sores develop making eating and speaking difficult and painful.\n\nPhotobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a light-based therapy that reduces inflammation and enhances wound healing. PBMT delivered inside the mouth has been shown to reduce OM in patients undergoing alloHCT.\n\nThe name of the study device involved in this study is:\n\n- THOR LX2.3 with LED Lollipop\n\nThis research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time that investigators are examining this LED based intraoral PBMT.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved PBMT for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including daily PBMT and clinical evaluations.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment daily from the start of conditioning chemotherapy to day +20, or discharge (if you are able to be discharged from the hospital prior to day +20), whichever occurs first.\n\nIt is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study"
