The main questions it aims to answer are: What impact does the clinic-based coaching session have on preschool-aged children's school readiness skills and their parents' confidence in supporting and practicing early math and literacy behaviors at home? Participants will receive a 1-hr coaching session at their pediatric clinic and return after three months for a follow-up session. Researchers will compare pre-and-post child and parent SR outcomes between these two sessions.",

The secondary question this study aims to evaluate is: Does the 1-hr school readiness coaching session affect rates of well-child checks at the pediatric clinic? Participants will receive a 1-hr coaching session at their pediatric clinic and return after three months for a follow-up session. Researchers will compare pre-and-post Brigance scores for the child and pre-and post parent SR confidence DREME scores."
