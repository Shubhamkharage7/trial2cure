            "briefSummary": "This phase 2 trial studies the side effects and best dose of tazemetostat and zanubrutinib in combination with tafasitamab and lenalidomide, and to see how well these combinations work in treating patients with large B-cell lymphoma that returned or did not respond to earlier treatment. Tazemetostat is in a class of medications called EZH2 inhibitors. It helps to stop the spread of cancer cells. Zanubrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells. tafasitamab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Lenalidomide is in a class of medications called immunomodulatory agents. It works by helping the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. The addition of tazemetostat or zanubrutinib to tafasitamab and lenalidomide may be able to shrink the cancer or extend the time without cancer symptoms coming back.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the recommended phase II dose of tafasitamab + lenalidomide + tazemetostat AND of tafasitamab + lenalidomide + zanubrutinib. (Safety Run-in) II. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (R/R LBCL) treated with tafasitamab + lenalidomide + tazemetostat vs control (tafasitamab + lenalidomide) AND treated with tafasitamab + lenalidomide + zanubrutinib versus (vs) control. (Randomized Phase II Study)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the hazard ratio for PFS for control vs. tafasitamab + lenalidomide + tazemetostat in germinal center B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB (activated B-cell \\[ABC\\]/unclassified) subsets.\n\nII. To estimate the hazard ratio for PFS for control vs. tafasitamab + lenalidomide + zanubrutinib in GCB and non-GCB (ABC/unclassified) subsets.\n\nIII. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), partial response rate (PR), duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), in GCB and non-GCB LBCL for each treatment.\n\nIV. To evaluate adverse events within each treatment arm.\n\nOTHER OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore PFS within subgroups defined by molecular profile (e.g., MCD, BN2, N1 and EZB) and genetic subtypes.\n\nII. To explore PFS in the tafasitamab-lenalidomide control arm vs that in matched historical control from L-MIND and realMIND studies.\n\nIII. To assess frailty (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale \\[CIRS\\] and Timed Get Up and Go \\[TUG\\]) and its correlation with outcome.\n\nPRIMARY PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare patient-reported lymphoma-specific symptoms as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) Trial Outcome Index sub-scale at 3 months after randomization between the control arm and each experimental arm (Arm 1 versus Arm 2 and Arm 3 versus Arm 2).\n\nSECONDARY PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare participant-reported toxicity (treatment side effect) symptoms using selected Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) items between experimental vs control arms.\n\nEXPLORATORY PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare patient-reported quality of life using the FACT-General (G) subscale score and the FACT-Lym total score at 3 months after randomization between the control arm and each experimental arm.\n\nII. To compare quality of life over time between treatment arms from baseline to 12 months after randomization as measured by the FACT-Lym trial outcome index (TOI), FACT-G, and FACT-Lym total score using longitudinal analysis.\n\nBANKING OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tazemetostat and zanubrutinib.\n\nPART I (SAFETY RUN-IN): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms per treating investigator's choice.\n\nARM I: Patients receive tafasitamab intravenously (IV), lenalidomide orally (PO), and tazemetostat PO on study. Patients also undergo positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans throughout the trial. Patients also have the option to undergo collection of blood samples during screening and on study.\n\nARM III: Patients receive tafasitamab IV, lenalidomide PO, and zanubrutinib PO on study. Patients also undergo PET/CT and CT or MRI scans throughout the trial. Patients also have the option to undergo collection of blood samples during screening and on study.\n\nPART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive tafasitamab IV, lenalidomide PO, and tazemetostat PO on study. Patients also undergo PET/CT and CT or MRI scans throughout the trial. Patients also have the option to undergo collection of blood samples during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive tafasitamab IV and lenalidomide PO on study. Patients also undergo PET/CT and CT or MRI scans throughout the trial. Patients also have the option to undergo collection of blood samples during screening and on study.\n\nARM III: Patients receive tafasitamab IV, lenalidomide PO, and zanubrutinib PO on study. Patients also undergo PET/CT and CT or MRI scans throughout the trial. Patients also have the option to undergo collection of blood samples during screening and on study."

Participants currently being treated for HCV infection must have undetectable HCV viral load test on the most recent test results obtained within 28 days prior to registration\n* Participants must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption, such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels\n* Participants must be offered the opportunity to participate in specimen banking. With participant consent, specimens must be collected and submitted via the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Specimen Tracking System\n* Participants who can complete the FACT-Lym and PRO-CTCAE forms in English or Spanish must agree to participate in the patient-reported outcome study\n* Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.\n\n  * For participants with impaired decision-making capabilities, legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants in accordance with applicable federal, local, and central institutional review board (CIRB) regulations.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must not have active lymphomatous involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) because the treatments used in this study are not effective to sufficiently penetrate the blood brain barrier\n* Participants must not have known abnormalities associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (e.g., del 5q, chr 7 abn) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (e.g., JAK2 V617F) observed in cytogenetic testing and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing. Testing is not required for eligibility determination\n* Participants must not have a known prior history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL)/T-cell acute leukemia (T-ALL). Testing is not required for eligibility determination\n* Participants must not be a candidate based on investigator assessment to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or must have declined ASCT. Participants who had disease progression after stem cell transplant or cellular therapy (such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell) are eligible\n* Participants must not have received prior treatment with tafasitamab and/or lenalidomide\n* Participants must not have had prior BTK inhibitor or tazemetostat\n* Participants must not have any known allergy or reaction to any component of tafasitamab, lenalidomide, tazemetostat or zanubrutinib\n* Participants must not be receiving direct vitamin K inhibitors or strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers at the date of registration\n\n  * Notes: Because the list of these agents is constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated medical reference\n* Participants must not have a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment (in the opinion of the treating physician) has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen\n* Participants must not be pregnant or nursing and must follow the guidelines according to the lenalidomide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program. The effects of tazemetostat, zanubrutinib, lenalidomide and tafasitamab, and the combination of these drugs have not been studied on the developing human fetus are the effects are unknown. Individuals who are of reproductive potential must have agreed to use a highly effective contraceptive method with details provided as a part of the consent process. A person who has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months or who has semen likely to contain sperm is considered to be of \"reproductive potential\". In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"acceptable contraception\" also includes refraining from sexual activity that might result in pregnancy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) including hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, and vasectomy with testing showing no sperm in the semen",
