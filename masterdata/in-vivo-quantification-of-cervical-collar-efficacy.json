Cameras will be placed directly superior, anterior, and lateral to the volunteer's head. C-spine volunteers will be asked to actively move their head to the maximal flexion, extension, bilateral rotation, and bilateral side bending to assess baseline ROM.\n\nProvider volunteers will individually place a C-collar on the C-spine volunteer's neck. They will have a range of sizes to choose from or adjustable units as applicable. The provider volunteer will be able to independently select and adjust a collar to best fit the C-spine volunteer.\n\nThe C-spine volunteer will then actively move their head to the maximal flexion, extension, bilateral rotation, and bilateral side bending with the C-collar on.

This process will be repeated for each C-spine volunteer and each provider volunteer (Minimum 3 volunteers per 1 provider volunteer).\n\nThe angle of ROM in flexion, extension, rotation, and side bending without and with C-collar placement in each video will be measured using image analysis software. The decrease in ROM while wearing the C-collar for each encounter will be calculated. Scoring of C-collar placement will be done by an investigator while the provider volunteer is placing the C-collar. Providers will then receive additional information and resources specific to C-collar make/model placement and asked to complete a short survey (Appendix E) related to the content provided.\n\nProvider volunteers will then have training on correct sizing and placing of C-collars and be reassessed in the same manor described above.
