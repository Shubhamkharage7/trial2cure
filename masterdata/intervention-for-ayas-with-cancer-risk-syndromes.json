In this study, the investigators are looking at whether using a chatbot and online portal for cancer risk information helps improve communication and decision-making.\n\n* Over 70,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. every year and up to 10% have genetic changes (or, mutations) that put them at a higher risk of developing new cancers during their lifetimes. These genetic mutations can result in cancer risk syndromes (such as, Lynch Syndrome or Li-Fraumeni Syndrome). Identifying cancer risk syndromes can allow for screening and early diagnosis of future cancers, which could ultimately save lives and offer more care choices for patients. As a result, genetic counseling and testing for cancer risk syndromes is being recommended more for Adolescents and Young Adults with new cancer diagnoses, regardless of family history.\n* This research study to develop an intervention called AYA-RISE that aims to assist AYAs with cancer risk communication and decision-making around their caregivers.",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study involves three aims (Aims 1, 2, and 3).\n\n* Aim 1, Part 1, which focuses on finding the best format for the study intervention (called AYA-RISE); whether AYA-RISE is easy to use; and whether patients, family caregivers, and providers find AYA-RISE acceptable.The research study procedures include:\n\n  * Using and reviewing AYA-RISE,\n  * Participating in audio-recorded, 30-minute interviews\n* Aim 1, Part 2, which is a pilot study of the study intervention (called AYA-RISE). In this pilot study, the investigators are looking at whether AYA-RISE is easy to use and what participants think of it.\n\n  -- The activities involved in this part of the study are:\n  * Baseline Questionnaire\n  * Using and reviewing AYA-RISE\n  * Follow-up Questionnaire\n  * Brief feedback interviews on AYA-RISE\n* In Aim 2, participants will be randomized trial into one of two groups;\n\n  * Group 1: Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit or\n  * Group 2 : Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit and Access to AYA-Rise\n* Aim 3: Semi-Structured Interviews:\n\n  * Evaluate implementation outcomes using 28 semi-structured interviews with patients, family members, providers, and site principal investigators"
