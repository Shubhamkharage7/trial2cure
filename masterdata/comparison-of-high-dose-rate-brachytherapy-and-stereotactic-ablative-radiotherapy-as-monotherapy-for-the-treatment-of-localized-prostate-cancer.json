            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial compares high-dose rate brachytherapy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy as monotherapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized). High-dose rate brachytherapy delivers radiation directly into the prostate within a few minutes by a single radioactive seed through temporarily placed plastic catheters inside the prostate gland. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy is an external beam radiation method that delivers large doses of radiation to the cancer in a short period of time, usually 5 treatments. This trial aims to find which of these two approaches is better in terms of patient-reported quality of life.",

To assess feasibility of a pilot non-randomized trial evaluating stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and high-dose rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients elect to participate in arms 1 or 2.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR).\n\nARM II: Patients undergo SABR every other day for 5 treatments.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
