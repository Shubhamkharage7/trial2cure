Enrolled clinical study subjects will be randomly allocated to receive respiratory air with Infasurf\u00ae (Intervention Arm) or respiratory air alone (Sham Control Arm) through the InfasurfAero\u2122.\n\nThe objectives of this clinical study are to i) assess the effectiveness of a single dose of Infasurf administered through the InfasurfAero in preventing CPAP failure, and ii) assess the safety of Infasurf administered through the InfasurfAero.\n\nSubjects will be enrolled at one of 10+ sites. 7 sites are currently recruited."
