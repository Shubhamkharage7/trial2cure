            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot study evaluating the efficacy of percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation for the treatment of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).",
            "detailedDescription": "IBS has a worldwide prevalence around 11% and is characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. Abnormalities within the brain-gut axis, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system are important components contributing to the pathophysiology of IBS. Despite recent advances in medical therapies for IBS, a significant subgroup of patients fails to experience satisfactory relief of abdominal pain. Given evidence of anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive components of vagal nerve pathways, peripheral field stimulation of the vagus nerve may help reduce abdominal pain in patients with IBS.\n\nPercutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS) administered via the IB-Stim device (Innovative Health Solutions, Versailles, IN, USA) has been shown to be efficacious in adolescent patients with abdominal-pain-related functional GI disorders, including IBS. This device uses discontinuous frequencies of stimulation to target central pain pathways through branches of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X that innervate the external ear and project to certain brainstem nuclei, including the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The NTS then acts as a relay station to other brain areas involved in pain modulation and autonomic control, including the rostral ventral medulla, locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. In adolescent studies, PENFS was associated with a greater reduction in worst abdominal pain and composite abdominal pain scores from baseline as well as compared with a sham device after three weeks of treatment. These effects were sustained over an extended follow-up period with minimal to no side effects. In addition, a greater proportion of adolescents in the PENFS arm achieved at least a 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain scores from baseline after 3 weeks of treatment.\n\nThe IB-Stim is the first device to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in adolescents aged 11-18 with IBS. However, the efficacy of PENFS in adults with IBS is not currently known. This study is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot study evaluating the efficacy of PENFS using IB-Stim for the treatment of IBS symptoms in adult patients with IBS."

Needles are inserted into the dorsal and ventral aspects of the ear, within 1-1.5 mm of the vascular branches to create a field effect. The device settings are standardized and deliver 3.2 volts with alternating frequencies (1 ms pulses of 1 Hz and 10 Hz) every 2 s. This stimulation targets central pain pathways through branches of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X, which innervate the external ear. The device is worn for 5 days/week for a total of 4 weeks.
