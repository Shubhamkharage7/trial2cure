Infants and caregivers will receive brief health education and coaching sessions from health educators at primary care visits in the first two years of life as well as two text messages per week with health information and tips. Half of the participants will receive the Futuros Fuertes 2.0 intervention that includes health coaching and education on infant feeding, screen time and sleep (intervention group). The other half will receive health coaching and education on safety, home management of childhood illnesses, and promotion of language development (control group). We will look at the impact of the Futuros Fuertes 2.0 intervention on child BMI and various health behaviors."
