            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of the present pilot, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (Pilot SMART) is to determine feasibility and acceptability of delivering (from the perspective of the treatment/intervention staff) and receiving (from the perspective of the patient) an adaptive intervention for reducing rates of opioid misuse and preventing development of opioid use disorder in individuals hospitalized for traumatic injury. A complimentary secondary objective is to ensure the feasibility of conducting a future, multi-site, full-scale SMART.\n\nApproximately 107 participants will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for up to 6 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed project would be the first clinical trial to assess the feasibility of implementing a preventative treatment design that specifically targets the needs of individuals receiving opioid prescriptions following surgery for traumatic injury. The project will operationalize a standardized approach to screening, treating, and monitoring risk of opioid misuse following traumatic injury. If funded, the project would provide a personalized approach to post-injury monitoring and management through an adaptive intervention designed to target the needs of the individual, rather than implementing a rigid, one-size-fits-all intervention model to prevent opioid misuse.\n\nApproximately 107 participants will be enrolled into the study (approximately 54 participants at UW and 53 participants at MCW). At or very shortly after (within 1-2 days) discharge, participants will be randomized using a 2x2 factorial design to initially receive any one of the following four interventions:\n\n1. standard Trauma Care Coordination (sTCC)\n2. sTCC + an abbreviated Pain Coping Skills Training (PCST-Lite)\n3. enhanced Trauma Care Coordination (eTCC)\n4. eTCC + PCST-Lite\n\nFour weeks following hospital discharge, participants will be evaluated for risk of opioid misuse, measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), modified Pain Enjoyment of life and General activities (PEG) scale, and the modified 9-item Current Opioid Misuse Measure (mCOMM-9). Participants identified as being at greater than low risk for opioid misuse will be randomized to continuing their current clinical management plan vs. an augmented, more intensive intervention plan; participants scoring at low risk will continue with the intervention they were initially randomized to receive.\n\nComponents of the adaptive intervention will be iteratively refined at various points before, during, and after the pilot SMART in order to maximize feasibility and acceptability.\n\nPrimary Objective: Determine the feasibility of delivering an adaptive intervention for reducing rates of opioid misuse and preventing development of opioid use disorder in individuals hospitalized for traumatic injury.\n\n* Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility of delivering the proposed adaptive intervention, as measured by rates of recruitment and retention at Weeks 4 and 12.\n* Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the adaptive intervention, from the perspective of treatment providers and recipients.\n\nSecondary Objective: Obtain the preliminary data necessary for a successful NIH R01 Application.\n\n* Specific Aim 3: Construct a randomized trial protocol informed by data from the present study, to be used in the proposed subsequent, full-scale sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial.\n* Specific Aim 4: Construct an initial implementation strategy manual to evaluate implementation of the future R01 and support the installation of the adaptive intervention in future hospitals, by future implementers.\n* Specific Aim 5: Construct a manual for the adaptive intervention, to enhance fidelity in the subsequent full-scale trial.\n\nSafety Objective: Determine rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events.\n\n* Specific Aim 6: Evaluate the frequency and presentation of adverse events associated with each arm of the adaptive intervention.\n\nExploratory Objective 1: Identify associations between the interventions delivered and opioid use/misuse.\n\nExploratory Objective 2: Identify associations between the interventions delivered and the physical, social, and psychological antecedents of opioid misuse."
