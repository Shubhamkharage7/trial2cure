Participants will be adolescents (12-18 years) with short sleep duration, sleep-wake irregularity, and depression."

Youth and provider jointly select SPP strategies relevant to the contributors to poor sleep for each youth (e.g., time management, limiting weekend oversleep). In the second session they review progress and adjust the plan.
