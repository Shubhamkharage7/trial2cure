            "detailedDescription": "The current study will collect clinical evidence for OSTEOAMP SELECT in spinal fusion procedures. In particular, the study will explore the use of OSTEOAMP SELECT as part of a lumbar interbody fusion (LIF) procedure of two lumbar motion segments between L2 to S1 in patients suffering from symptomatic degenerative disc disease (DDD), degenerative spondylolisthesis, and/or mild degenerative scoliosis.\n\nEffectiveness will be based on the lumbar interbody fusion rate at the index levels assessed by a treatment-blinded independent reviewer at 12 months and 24 months.\n\nSafety will be evaluated by documenting the number and nature of all (serious) adverse events that may in any way be related to the surgical procedure or product. The complication rate will be compared to the rate in control populations from literature."

Females of child-bearing potential must agree not to become pregnant for the duration of the study.\n* A history of alcohol and/or drug abuse within 6 months prior to screening or exhibits evidence, in the investigator's opinion, of alcohol/drug abuse at screening.\n* Current history of heavy nicotine use (e.g. more than 20 cigarettes per day).\n* Any condition, which in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with study instructions, which might confound data interpretation.",
