            "detailedDescription": "All participants will read a decision aid (DA) communicating evidence about mammography screening benefits and harms. Participants' evaluations of that evidence will be assessed, along with their screening intentions and receipt of screening. Participants will also be asked to report on whether they talked about mammography screening and the content of the DA with their provider. Participants will be sent 3 surveys via email and a final brief survey conducted by email or phone. The four surveys will be collected 1) upon enrollment and prior to the primary care appointment; 2) following the primary care appointment; 3) 3 months after enrollment; 4) 1 year after enrollment. The final 2 surveys will offer an increased incentive to increase retention rates. Time 1 will be an online survey that addresses Aim 1, assessing participants' evaluations of mammography evidence conveyed in the DA. Time 2 will include repeated measures from Time 1 and additionally assess the following: 1. Whether screening was discussed with the provider. 2. If screening was not discussed, why not (e.g. did not want to, no time, other pressing issues, etc.). 3. If screening was discussed, (a) what content from the DA was discussed (i.e. benefits, false positives, overdiagnosis), (b) overall satisfaction with the discussion, (c) whether the provider offered a screening recommendation, (d) open-ended qualitative response eliciting how the discussion went. 4. Whether discussed the BCS-DA with anyone else (e.g., friends or family). 5. Patient activation. 6. Preferred role in decision-making. 7. Perceived barriers to screening. Finally, participants' information environment will be assessed using questions from Pearlman et al. (1997), 8. information seeking (e.g. to what extent the participant valued opinions from the provider, friends, and family), 9. information sharing and communication (e.g. screening attitudes of friends and family), and 10. perception of self as disseminator of mammography-related information. Time 3 will repeat the summary of mammography evidence and measures from Time 2. At Time 4 the team will assess whether screening was received up to one year after study enrollment using the participants' self reports and electronic medical record."
