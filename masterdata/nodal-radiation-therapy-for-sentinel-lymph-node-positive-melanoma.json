Prior studies of patients with more advanced melanoma have shown nodal radiation therapy can decrease the risk of nodal recurrence but it is not known if this same benefit will be seen in patients with high risk sentinel lymph node positive disease who are planned for immunotherapy.",

To determine if regional nodal radiation therapy prolongs the time to regional recurrence.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive adjuvant immunotherapy and nodal radiation therapy (30 Gy in 5 treatments over 2-2.5 weeks).\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive adjuvant immunotherapy alone.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years."
