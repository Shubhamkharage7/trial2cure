            "briefSummary": "Lumbosacral spinal stenosis (LSS) is a leading cause of limited mobility, reduced independence, and poor health outcomes in older adults, and is very common in older adult Veterans. Several years ago, major research studies indicated that surgery for LSS was more effective than usual (medical) management. Nonetheless, there are many patients for whom surgery is not the ideal therapy. There have been reports that modifications in daily activities including temporary use of a modified rolling walker and changes in sleep positioning may help relieve LSS. The investigators have assembled a VA team to study this carefully. The investigators will recruit a small group of older adult Veterans with LSS to try out this program; the investigators will monitor them closely for relief of their symptoms and improvements in walking. The investigators will, as part of this small study, try to understand potential barriers to use of this therapy. The investigators will interview the Veterans and healthcare providers to identify problems that may arise in trying this therapy. If this small study works, the investigators plan to expand the effort."
