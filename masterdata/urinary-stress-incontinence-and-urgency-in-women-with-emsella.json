            "detailedDescription": "This is a blinded study to be conducted at San Diego Sexual Medicine in San Diego, CA. Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive one treatment cycle of active treatment or sham. The device will be equipped with 3 protocols in addition to the standard protocol, two of which are identical to the standard protocol (for active treatment) and one of which does not deliver HIFEM (for sham treatment). The active treatment arm consists of 6 treatments, 2 per week, with at least one day in between. Follow-up visits will occur at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the last treatment. Unblinding will take place at the 12 week follow up visit, and subjects assigned to the sham arm will be crossed over to active treatment, beginning their first treatment on that day, completing 6 treatments and 2 follow up visits. Once unblinded the subject will be treated with the standard protocol of the device.\n\nAfter the informed consent is signed, and inclusion and exclusion criteria completed, participants will complete validated questionnaires and undergo a baseline physical therapy assessment of pelvic floor muscle strength."
