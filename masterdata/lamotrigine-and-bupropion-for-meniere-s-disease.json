Thirty four participants will be randomized to treatment or placebo groups. Each participant will take part in the trial for 34 weeks, or approximately 9 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants begin with a 4 week lead-in after screening to determine the frequency and severity of vertigo they are experiencing. Participants continue to track their vertigo episodes throughout the study. At Visit 2, if eligible, participants begin the titration of lamotrigine or matching placebo. Participants are on the full dose of lamotrigine/placebo for 8 weeks, and then begin taking bupropion or matching placebo along with lamotrigine or matching placebo for 12 weeks. At Week 27, participants are tapered off lamotrigine/placebo and stop taking bupropion/placebo. Participants have an in-person visit approximately once a month over 9 months."
