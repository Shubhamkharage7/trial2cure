            "briefSummary": "One of the goals of an ablation procedure is to create scarring of cardiac tissue. Not all ablations result in scar tissue. Advances in technology have improved scarring but ideal parameters that result in scar tissue are still not completely clear and there is great variability in the parameters used. Theoretically, intense ablation can always create scar tissue but is also likely to create more complications such as cardiac perforations. The investigator recently published another retrospective study looking at ablation parameters that reliably result in scar tissue but it had its limitations as it was retrospectively done.\n\nThis is a prospective study to validate the parameters that result in long term scarring. MRI has long been used to visualize ablation scar tissue. So in this study patients undergoing, initial left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation as standard of care will undergo a 3 month post ablation MRI and that will be used to validate the ablation parameters.",
            "detailedDescription": "A critical step to improve atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation broadly is to minimize interoperator variability. VISITAG SURPOINT calculated a marker tag index value by combining contact force, power setting, and duration of energy delivered. Use of VISITAG SURPOINT has accurately predicted sites of pulmonary vein reconnection and regional changes in late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2 (edema) intensity 24 hours post ablation. Prospective use of the ablation index improves first pass pulmonary vein isolation and 1-year freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias compared to conventional treatment.\n\nThere remains a paucity of data regarding if ablation guided by index values and VISITAG SURPOINT results in durable scar formation in humans in general and compared to conventional approaches. In addition, the relative contribution of the components of VISITAG SURPOINT impact scar formation in-vivo and across a broad diversity of atrial anatomies. Such data are critical in patients that present with various degrees of atrial myopathies, arrhythmia substrate, and anatomies."
