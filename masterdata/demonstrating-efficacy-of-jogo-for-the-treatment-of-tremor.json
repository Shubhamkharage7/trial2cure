JOGO is a biofeedback device that has been shown to help patients with several conditions, e.g., chronic pain, migraine, and Parkinson's disease (PD)-related tremor. JOGO provides biofeedback by using wireless adhesive stickers, called surface electromyography, to get information about muscle activity. This information is then used to modify symptoms through a series of training sessions with a physical therapist and individual practice."
