            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility of adding a combination of metformin and turmeric as part of a nutritional intervention regimen to the current standard of care, namely, intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy (iADT), for patients with castration sensitive biochemical progressive prostate cancer.\n\nThe main objectives are:\n\n* Assess the feasibility of the study population and enrollment.\n* Evaluate time to PSA relapse with nutritional intervention on iADT.\n\nParticipants who are receiving iADT will be dispensed Metformin and turmeric and complete a pill diary. Participants will also have blood and stool samples collected and complete quality of life questionnaires.\n\nThe long-term goal is to further assess the efficacy and safety of this nutritional regimen and the roles of metabolic syndrome, microenvironment/microbiome, and genomic vs epigenomic profiles in the care of these patients through a clinical trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research is to determine if a nutritional plan of metformin and turmeric is feasible for individuals receiving iADT for prostate cancer. Turmeric is an over-the-counter supplement that is believed to provide anti-inflammatory effects. Metformin is an FDA-approved medication for diabetes to help lower blood sugar. This feasibility study will be conducted according to the standard of care (SoC) for eligible subjects receiving iADT but coordinated and streamlined in a prospective manner to care for subjects while collecting and annotating data for the duration of their care.\n\nAll subjects will receive iADT + turmeric + metformin + dietary consultation.\n\nSoC laboratory tests will be performed in accordance with clinical practice for the care of patients with prostate cancer on or off iADT. Additional vials of blood will be collected for research purposes in order to assess epigenetic biomarkers, CSC biomarkers, and cancer dormancy biomarkers. Stool samples will be used to obtain microbiome profiles. QOL instruments (FACT-P and AMS) will also be administered."
