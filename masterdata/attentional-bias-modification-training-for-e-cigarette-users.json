To accomplish these aims, a theory-driven parallel, controlled 2-arm randomized clinical trial will be conducted with young adult e-cigarette users (approximately N = 50). Outcomes are attentional bias to e-cigarette cues and abstinence outcomes including nicotine dependence, and arousal/urges for e-cigarette use."
