In addition, venous blood sample will be taken to identify biomarkers that are associated with elevating blood pressure and decreasing blood flow.\n\nThe 10-day monitoring period includes a wrist-worn activity tracker and a blood pressure monitor bracelet; a smartphone app that will prompt surveys up to 6 times a day to assess behaviors, social/physical context, mood/stress, and experience of racial discrimination/microaggression.
