            "detailedDescription": "This study will assess the efficacy of ketamine for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease (PD), in a parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT). Imaging will be used to examine the mechanistic effects of ketamine treatment. Specifically, the investigators will use positron emission tomography (PET) to measure synaptic density and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure functional connectivity. The investigators hypothesize that a course of ketamine treatment will result in a significant reduction in depression severity compared to placebo. Mechanistically, ketamine will result in a reorganization of functional networks and an increase in synaptic density."
