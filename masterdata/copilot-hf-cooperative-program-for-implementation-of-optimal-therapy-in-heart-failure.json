Determine if a remote, or virtual, clinic that implements a standardized, stepped-approach to guideline-directed medication optimization in patients with heart failure (across the spectrum of ejection fraction), will achieve a higher rate of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) than a strategy of patient and provider education followed by remote heart failure clinic management.\n2. In eligible patients with LVEF\\<50%, determine if the sequencing of GDMT initiation (traditional vs. sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors-first) leads to improved GDMT intensification"
