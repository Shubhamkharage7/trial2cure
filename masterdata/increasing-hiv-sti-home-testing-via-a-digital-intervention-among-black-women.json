            "briefSummary": "The proposed intervention is a web-based intervention guided by theoretical components to increase HIV home testing among Black women at risk for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in a HIV hotspot in the South. The intervention will promote using the home test, linkage to care, and linkage to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) evaluation. The intervention has the potential to be implemented on a large scale and tailored based on location and population to increase testing, treatment, and PrEP adoption.",
            "detailedDescription": "In Travis County, Texas, deemed a HIV geographic hotspot due to high HIV rates, Black women are 18.4 times more likely to contract HIV compared to women of other races/ethnicities. Black women also have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than other women; many STIs have no symptoms, are undiagnosed, and are untreated. Having an STI triples one's risk for contracting HIV. In Travis County, over 20% of women learned one year after contracting HIV that the the individual is HIV-positive, highlighting barriers to testing. Home HIV/STI testing has promise to increase rates of testing by circumventing barriers and thereby reduce medical costs through early detection and care. Home HIV/STI testing is also a prime opportunity to link Black women at high risk for HIV to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Yet, home testing alone may not overcome all barriers. Pairing home testing with an intervention designed to increase motivation and overcome barriers has the most promise to increase HIV/STI testing rates. The proposed project draws on 3 components, the situated, information-motivation-behavioral (sIMB) model, mental contrasting, and implementation intentions to develop a new, web-based intervention. This intervention is comprised of 5 sessions: 1) using the HIV/STI home testing kit, 2) mailing in the kit, 3) checking results, 4) obtaining treatment, and 5) attending an appointment for PrEP. Each session is structured the same: information regarding the importance of each behavior (i.e., taking the home test, mailing in the test, checking results, linkage to care, and linkage to PrEP), motivation via mental contrasting (identifying positive outcomes and barriers to each session) and methods to overcome the identified barriers (implementation intentions), and behavioral skills to increase self-efficacy. The project will occur in 3 phases that coincide with the aims to develop and culturally tailor the intervention. 1) Conduct formative research to develop the intervention. Four focus groups (n=4-6), with 24 Black women from Travis County will explore the constructs of sIMB, mental contrasting, and implementation intentions to develop the intervention protocol to be field tested in Aim 2. 2) Field test the intervention. The investigators will test the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of the intervention with 6 participants to make any necessary adjustments for Aim 3. 3) Conduct a feasibility pilot of the intervention. The investigators will determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy among 60 Black women in Travis County. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or a web-based educational control. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible, acceptable, and demonstrate a trend toward efficacy for completion of home testing, linkage to care, and linkage to PrEP. Follow-up web-based assessments will be administered 2-, 4-, and 6-months after baseline. The web-based design of the intervention greatly increases the opportunity for implementation on a large scale. The long-term goal is to increase HIV/STI testing among low-income Black women via scalable and sustainable methods to decrease HIV transmission and subsequent disparities."
