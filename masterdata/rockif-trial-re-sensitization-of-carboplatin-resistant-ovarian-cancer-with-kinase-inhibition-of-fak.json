The study will evaluate whether this regimen is safe. The study will also evaluate whether the regimen can reduce the amount of cancerous cells in your body. If you agree, you will be treated with VS-6063 by mouth, as well as carboplatin and paclitaxel infusions. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are approved by the FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer. VS-6063 is considered experimental because it is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer."
