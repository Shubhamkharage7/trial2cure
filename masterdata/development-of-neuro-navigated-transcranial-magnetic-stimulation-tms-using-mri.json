All subjects will undergo a single MRI session and will then participate in an on-line neuro-navigation session in which various TMS coil positions will be recorded. The brain/head images will be provided to the programmer to permit development of the virtual neuro-navigation algorithm. Data from Yr1 will be used by the programmer as a training sample, and from Yr2 as a test sample.",
            "detailedDescription": "HC subjects (n=10)/yr will be studied once to provide data needed to validate the virtual neuro-navigation system. All subjects will undergo a single Human Connectome Project compatible MRI session permitting application of both surface-based and more standard volumetric analyses. Subjects will then participate in an on-line neuro-navigation session in which TMS coil positions (in 10/20 coordinate space) will be recorded corresponding to the following targets: 1) hand-representation of motor strip; 2) 5-cm location; 3) 5.5 cm location; 4) MNI coordinates corresponding to the \"Fitzgerald\"4 and \"Weigand\"6 volumetric targets; 5) peak anti-correlated region (calculated from rsfcfMRI data alone); 6) center of our targeted parcel, calculated using surface-based approaches. The brain/head images will be provided to the programmer to permit development of the virtual neuro-navigation algorithm. Data from Yr1 will be used by the programmer as a training sample, and from Yr2 as a test sample. The Go/No-go criterion is an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of \\>.9 between scalp coordinates determined by on-line neuro-navigation and those determined virtually"
