The study will compare those who receive diabetes education (10 educational modules and monthly health coaching) through the research program with those who receive care as usual.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Hope App offers a simple, high-impact, engaging, and immersive telehealth experience with the potential to become a ubiquitous diabetes management tool to transform diabetes patients into high performing drivers of their own care.\n\nThe research team aims to scale the platform, develop features that are important to aging adults, and run a clinical trial to validate the Hope App's health benefits.\n\n* Specific Aim 1: Develop the Hope App's state-of-the-art immersive patient engagement experience with automated onboarding, social networking and gamified DSME/S features to support long-term patient retention. In doing so, usability testing will be performed to ensure patient-facing features on the platform and patient-facing content and curriculum materials are functioning and well received by participants.\n* Specific Aim 2: Develop the Hope App's predictive analytic capabilities for population health management.\n* Specific Aim 3: Conduct a clinical validation trial of the Hope App intervention on six-month clinical outcomes (Hemoglobin A1c), patient reported outcomes (diabetes distress) and engagement outcomes (patient retention, adherence to self-care behaviors).\n\nThe research team intends to deliver a scalable Hope App platform with a usable patient engagement portal designed for older adults and achieve decreases in blood glucose levels (HbA1c) and depressive burden, and sustained patient engagement."
