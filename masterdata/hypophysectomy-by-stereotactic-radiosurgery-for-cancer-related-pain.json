Feasibility will be defined as completion of SRS hypophysectomy enrollment and treatment of the lead-in cohort (n=20 patients) within one year of trial activation.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo obtain estimates of the change from baseline over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in the worst pain subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form.57\n\nTo obtain estimates of the change from baseline over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in the pain composite scale of the BPI short form.57\n\nTo obtain estimates of the change after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in the interference scale of the BPI short form.57\n\nTo obtain estimates of the change in the daily usage of opioid medications, calculated as oral morphine equivalents (OME), over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain.\n\nTo obtain estimates of the change in mood and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) composite score over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain.60\n\nTo obtain estimates of the change in beliefs on self-efficacy using the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain.61\n\nTo obtain estimates of the change after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative Care (QLC C15 PAL).59 To obtain estimates of neurologic toxicity related to SRS measured by the NCI's CTCAE v5.0.\n\nCorrelative Objectives:\n\nTo apply novel fMRI and DTI MRI protocols to characterize functional and connectome changes following SRS hypophysectomy.\n\nTo study neuroanatomic and histobiochemical changes of the pituitary gland/stalk after SRS hypophysectomy on post-mortem tissue.\n\nTo obtain estimates of neurocognitive changes following SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain, including learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised), attention (WAIS-IV Digit Span, Trail Making Test Part A, Stroop test, WAIS-IV Coding), and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B, Controlled Oral Word Association) referred to hereafter as \"neurocognitive battery\".63-66"
