            "briefSummary": "The investigators aim to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a hybrid non-ablative/ablative laser for acne scarring in skin of color.",
            "detailedDescription": "Acne is chronic inflammatory condition involving the pilosebaceous unit. One of the most common complications of acne is scarring, which occurs as a result of dermal damage during the healing process of active acne. Studies have shown that acne scarring can have a negative impact on an individual's quality of life and has been described as a risk factor for multiple psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, suicide, and poor self-esteem. Unfortunately, treatment of acne scarring, particularly those of the atrophic subtype, prove difficult to treat. A 2016 Cochrane review failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the first-line use of any intervention. Laser technology has been emerging as an effective, non-invasive treatment of acne scarring. Ablative lasers work by delivering energy to the dermal layer of the skin, resulting in thermal injury and stimulation of dermal cells to produce collagen, thus resolving the scar. More recently, fractional lasers, which create multiple tiny columns of thermal injury, have been introduced with the benefit of reduced downtime and adverse effects compared to ablative lasers. The fractional CO2 laser is widely used for the treatment of acne scarring, however its use is limited in patients of Fitzpatrick IV and V skin due to risk of hyperpigmentation among other adverse events. The erbium-YAG fractional laser serves as an alternative, and has shown to produce less thermal injury and thus be more well-tolerated with lower risk of adverse effects in patients. The hybrid fractional laser combines a 2940 nm wavelength with a 1470 wavelength and has an ablative component targeting the epidermis and a nonablative component targeting the dermis at the same spot. The investigators seek to investigate the Sciton Halo, hybrid fractional laser for its efficacy in treating acne scarring and tolerability in patients with a specific emphasis on those with Fitzpatrick IV and V skin."
