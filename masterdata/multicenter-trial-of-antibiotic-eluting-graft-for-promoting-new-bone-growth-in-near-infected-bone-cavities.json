            "detailedDescription": "This is a pivotal, prospective, multi-center, randomized, concurrent control, patient and assessor-blinded study to demonstrate superiority of new bone growth and a reduction in recurring infections, and thereby improve outcomes for patients undergoing a 2-stage surgical revision treatment for periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs).\n\nThe standard of care for treatment of PJIs typically involves a 2-stage revision which entails loss of bone stock resulting from debridement of infected bone in Stage 1. In the Stage 2 procedure, surgeons use metal cones to make up for this bone loss and better support the revision implant. Inadequate bone growth could result in gaps at the the voids below the level of the cortical bone, resulting in regions with no contact with the revision implant or cement mantle. Such gaps could result in dead-space regions, and zones without new bone growth required to support the revision implant. Both deficiencies affect long-term survival of the revision implant.\n\nThe study has two arms: a treatment arm (where subjects will be treated with the EP Granules with Tobramycin investigational device in the 1st stage of the 2-stage surgical treatment, and a control arm where subjects are treated with the standard-of-care 2-stage surgical treatment for infected PJIs.\n\nOutcomes are demonstration of new bone growth and reduction of recurrent infections."
