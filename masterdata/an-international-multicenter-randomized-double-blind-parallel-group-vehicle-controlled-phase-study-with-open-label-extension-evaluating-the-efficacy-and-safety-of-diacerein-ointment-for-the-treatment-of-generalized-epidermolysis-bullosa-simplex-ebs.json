            "briefSummary": "The proposed Phase 2/3 trial with double-blind and open-label extension phases is an international, multicenter study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of diacerein 1% ointment in patients with generalized EBS.",
            "detailedDescription": "Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a genetic skin disorder characterized by skin fragility and recurrent blister formation, primarily caused by mutations in keratins 5 and 14. EBS has 3 common subtypes based on clinical severity and manifestations: localized EBS, intermediate EBS and severe EBS. Severe EBS and intermediate EBS collectively are also known as generalized EBS due to widespread blistering.\n\nDisruption of the keratin 5/14 filament network in basal keratinocytes is a key factor in EBS pathogenesis, compromising skin integrity. The severity of EBS is linked to the extent of keratin mutations disrupting this network, particularly resulting in keratin aggregates in severe cases. Recent studies suggest that mutated keratin proteins can trigger inflammation, exacerbating EBS. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines, like IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, are observed in EBS patients, and IFN-\u03b3 may mediate inflammation, promoting keratin aggregations. As a result, targeting inflammation is considered a potential therapeutic approach in EBS.\n\nAC-203 (diacerein 1% ointment) is a topical formulation of diacerein, well-known for its ability to inhibit IL-1\u03b2 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, diacerein and its active metabolite, rhein, have demonstrated ability in reducing keratin aggregates in keratinocytes derived from severe EBS. Taken together, with its anti-inflammatory property and ability to diminish keratin aggregation, AC-203 shows promise in reducing the clinical severity of EBS."
