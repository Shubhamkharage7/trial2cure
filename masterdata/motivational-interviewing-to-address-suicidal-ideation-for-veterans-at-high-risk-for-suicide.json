            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this project is to conduct a randomized control trial with 470 Veterans to examine the impact of a revised version of Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI-R) on risk for suicide attempts and suicidal ideation when compared to high quality usual care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Research suggests that treatments to reduce suicidal behavior may need to focus on both the motivation to live and the motivation to die to obtain optimal effects. The PI developed a revised version of Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI-R) to help Veterans resolve ambivalence about living by increasing the motivation to live, that consists of three sessions delivered in-person, virtually, or by telephone. Enhanced usual care (EUC) for high-risk Veterans includes safety plans administered or reviewed by research therapists, care coordination, and access to a 24-hour crisis hotline. In a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) in psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans, MI-SI-R plus EUC was associated with 50% fewer suicide attempts and 41% lower likelihood of suicidal ideation compared to EUC alone. The investigators are proposing an RCT comparing MI-SI-R plus EUC (MI-SI-R+EUC) to EUC alone in a sample of 470 high-risk Veterans with recent suicidal crises from three VHA Medical Centers, with \"high-risk\" defined as a suicide attempt within a month or suicidal ideation \\> 5 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Half (n = 235) will be randomized to MI-SI-R+EUC (three sessions in-person, via Video Connect, or telephone) and the remaining participants (n = 235) will receive EUC alone. All participants will be asked to complete telephone follow-up assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months after randomization. This will allow the investigators to determine the efficacy of MI-SI-R+EUC in reducing risk for suicide attempts (Aim 1) and reducing overall suicidal ideation (Aim 2) when compared to EUC alone."
