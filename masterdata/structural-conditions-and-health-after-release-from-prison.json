Access to high quality healthcare following release from prison is key to preventing poor health and CV outcomes. Our study team will investigate facilitators and barriers to health care access experienced by people released from prison.",
            "detailedDescription": "Upon release from prison, people face numerous challenges including unstable housing, limited employment, stigma, and poor health. Structural conditions in healthcare systems, including policies, practices and attitudes around healthcare access, transition programs, culture, support of social determinants of health, and specialized services for people released from prison, may influence access and health outcomes for people released from prison. We will enroll people released from prison into a prospective cohort study to examine the association between exposure to structural conditions and 12-month primary outcomes of healthcare utilization (clinic visits, emergency visits, hospitalization) and secondary outcomes of CV hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Moderation by participant characteristics such as self-reported race, ethnicity, gender, age and baseline CV health will be tested."
