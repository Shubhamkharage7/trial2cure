This study will examine the effect of delivering EX/RP to women during different phases in their menstrual cycle to determine the effects of hormones on the fear extinction network and on their OCD symptoms.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study involves neuroimaging and a brief EX/RP protocol. The investigators will recruit both male and female participants. All participants will complete neuroimaging, hormonal assays and symptom ratings before and after a brief course of EX/RP. Female participants will be randomized to complete brief EX/RP during distinct phases of their menstrual cycles. This design will allow the investigators to study the effects of hormonal variation during the menstrual cycle and sex on the fear extinction network and on EX/RP outcome. The long-term goal is to optimize EX/RP for individuals suffering from OCD. Men will also be recruited for this study to further explore biological sex differences. The results will elucidate treatment mechanisms and could lead to personalized treatment recommendations for women with OCD."
