            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the implementation and delivery of CAB/RPV LA to women with HRSN by adopting a pharmacist-led CDTM. The project primarily addresses the real-world use of CAB + RPV LA among women who are under-represented in clinical trials and assesses the feasibility and acceptability of CDTM+, and adoption of CAB/RPV LA among participants receiving the CDTM+ model.\n\nInvestigators will enhance the existing CDTM to reduce important social and structural barriers to CAB/RPV LA for women with HRSN, by increasing accessibility- using telehealth to deliver CDTM outreach to clinical and community sites without a clinician referral (CDTM+), which is highly scalable. In addition to assessing engagement with the CDTM+ intervention and impact on key implementation (reach, feasibility, acceptability, uptake) and clinical outcomes (CAB/RPV LA initiation), investigators will also assess impact on patient engagement in non-HIV related care and psychological, sexual, and social well-being."
