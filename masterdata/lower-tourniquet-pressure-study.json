A secondary goal is to evaluate the effect of lower tourniquet pressures on post-operative tourniquet site pain. The rationale behind the study is to provide evidence-based guidelines on tourniquet use to continue providing quality surgical care while minimizing pain and potential harm to patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients undergoing hand and upper extremity surgery at our institution will be offered participation in this study. Consenting patients will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to either standard tourniquet pressure of 250 mmHg or lower tourniquet pressures based on SBP. Demographic data will be recorded as well as details of the surgical procedure. Post-operatively, the operating surgeon will complete a questionnaire about the quality of bloodless surgical field and the patient will complete a questionnaire about post-operative pain. This study will enroll approximately 150 patients. Statistical analysis will be completed to analyze the effectiveness of the intervention."
