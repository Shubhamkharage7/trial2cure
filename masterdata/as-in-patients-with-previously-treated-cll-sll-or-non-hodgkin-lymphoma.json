            "detailedDescription": "This study consists of 2 parts.\n\nDose escalation part will enroll up to 27 patients to evaluate safety profile and tolerance of AS-1763 using 3+3 design. The starting dose of AS-1763 in oral tablet form is 100 mg twice daily (200 mg/day). Dose escalation will continue up to the planned maximum dose level or until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified.\n\nDose expansion part will enroll up to 48 CLL/SLL patients (Cohort 1) and up to 35 NHL patients (Cohort 2). The first 30 patients in each cohort will be allocated to three dose levels (n=10 at each dose level) which will be selected based on the data from dose escalation. Preliminary efficacy and safety data from the first 30 patients in one of cohorts will be used to identify the provisional recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) level. Thereafter, up to a further 18 patients for Cohort 1 and up to a further 5 patients for Cohort 2 will be enrolled and allocated to the provisional RP2D level.\n\nStudy assessments will continue for 24 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days) or until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation because of other reasons. Patients will then be followed for survival status for a further 2 years.\n\nRP2D will be determined based on all the data generated in the study."
