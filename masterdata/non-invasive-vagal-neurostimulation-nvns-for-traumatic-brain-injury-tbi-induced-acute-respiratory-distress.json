            "detailedDescription": "A pilot population of 46 individuals between 18-80 years of age inclusive, will be enrolled, with an in-trial monitoring period of up to 30 days following baseline measurements. Study subjects will remain in-trial until one of the following occurs: a) 30 days without any progression to respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation; b) requirement for mechanical ventilation prior to 30 days; or c) death prior to 30 days. In addition to the screening, a total of up to 5 additional in-trial events (depending on the time at discharge from hospitalization) plus one additional clinical site visit at the end of the follow-up period will comprise the study events schedule of this trial."
