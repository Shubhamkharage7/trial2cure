The investigators plan to conduct an analysis of patients meeting the inclusion criteria from 2005 to present. Study will also be conducted by the PI, Sub-Is, surgery fellows, office staff and clinical research coordinator who are delegated to do by the PI. Data will be obtained by looking through either investigator's patients or through a national database. Data will be analyzed primarily by the study conductors.",
            "detailedDescription": "It is reported in the literature that the treatment of any pancreatic disease process, whether benign or malignant, continues to be a huge challenge. For example, patients with adenocarcinoma continue to be diagnosed at an advanced stage with medical and surgical options that are improving in terms of outcome measurements but with much more room for improvement. The investigator's goal is to continue to review our treatment outcomes to further improve overall survival, overall symptom control, mortality, and morbidity.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the outcomes from the investigator's decisions on multiple treatments of benign or malignant pancreatic diseases.There is a need to understand and improve the current diagnosis and treatment algorithm for pancreatic pathologies. Continued evaluation and study is imperative to ensure that national guidelines are improving to enhance patient cure and/or recovery.\n\nAll past patients who were treated for a particular benign or malignant pancreatic disease process under evaluation from 2005 to present will be included in this study."
