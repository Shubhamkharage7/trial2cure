            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Magnesium-vitamin B6in combination with treatment as usual for treating symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety in patients with first episode bipolar I disorder.",
            "detailedDescription": "After a first episode of bipolar disorder, subsequent depressive and anxiety symptoms can pose a major challenge to an individual's recovery early in the illness. Individuals often have depressive and anxiety symptoms for a significant proportion of their time. These mood and anxiety symptoms are associated with higher risk for relapse, chronicity and disability. Previous studies have shown that the combination of Magnesium-vitamin B6 has beneficial effects on stress, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will assess the benefits of Magnesium-vitamin B6 in combination with treatment as usual (standard of clinical care) on depressive and anxiety symptoms and stress in individuals with bipolar disorder in the early phase of illness. In addition, the investigators aim to assess the effects of Magnesium-vitamin B6 on brain free \\[Mg2+\\] and energy metabolism, observed to be altered in bipolar disorder, measured by in vivo 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS). Magnesium is a promising targeted intervention for bipolar disorder given its significant effects on energy metabolism."
