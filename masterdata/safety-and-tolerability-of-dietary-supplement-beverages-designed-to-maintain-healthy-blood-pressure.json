The study period will be 29 days in length, during which we will monitor and catalogue the blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), as well as self-reported side effects of all subjects on a daily basis. Note that each beverage will be evaluated at multiple doses: Beverage 1 will be monitored at a low, medium and high dose, where the medium and high dose is quantitatively twice (2X) and thrice (3X) the low dose (1X), respectively. Similarly, we will evaluate Beverage 2 at a low dose and high dose where the high dose is quantitatively twice (2X) of the low dose (1X). A placebo treatment will also be incorporated into this study as well. As such, there will be 6 groups in this study. Three subjects will be assigned to each treatment group for a total of 18 subjects."
