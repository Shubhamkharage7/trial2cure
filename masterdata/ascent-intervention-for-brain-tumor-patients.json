            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to test a psychosocial intervention called ASCENT (ACT-based Supportive intervention for patients with CENTral nervous system tumors). This intervention was developed to help patients after being diagnosed with a brain tumor. The main question this study aims to answer is whether this intervention is feasible (i.e., possible to carry out) and acceptable (i.e., considered helpful) to patients. Participants will be asked to take part in 6 coaching sessions and complete short surveys at four different time points. Some participants will be asked to share feedback via interviews.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, population-specific intervention designed to help patients with newly diagnosed malignant brain tumors cope with their illness.\n\nThe specific aims are to 1) refine the ASCENT intervention based on stakeholder interviews (n=15) and patient feedback from an open pilot study (n=10), 2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of ASCENT intervention versus usual care in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT; n=100) and estimate preliminary effects of ASCENT on psychological and behavioral outcomes."
