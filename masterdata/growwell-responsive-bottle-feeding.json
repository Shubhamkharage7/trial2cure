Intervening on weight gain during infancy offers an opportunity to influence lifelong obesity risk. Using personalized motivational messages and targeted skills-training resources, the intervention will support parents and caregivers in adopting responsive feeding strategies. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to develop a future, larger grant submission focused on developing healthy feeding and eating habits among mother-infant dyads.",
