The reasons of this weight gain are still poorly understood. To better understand weight gain, this study is looking to see how a 6-month low carbohydrate diet can affect the body's ability to use energy in addition to the affects it has on heart and blood vessel health.\n\nThis study will help researchers to better understand weight gain after a transplant. This knowledge will help doctors prevent weight gain after a liver transplant and therefore improve the health of liver transplant patients."
