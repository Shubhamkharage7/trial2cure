The primary outcome of this study is to determine whether the rate of singlet oxygen (sO2) production and/or the initial intralesional photosensitize (PpIX) levels, can predict the clinical responsiveness of AK lesions to PDT. Participants will receive standard red light PDT treatment, except that lesions will be carefully counted beforehand. During the window of red light illumination, photos and a video of one area of skin will be taken to allow us to monitor the progress of the treatment. Any remaining lesions will be counted upon follow-up."
