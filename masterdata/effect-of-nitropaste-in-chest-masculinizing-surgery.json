            "briefSummary": "Nitropaste is a topical agent that contains 2% nitroglycerin. It is an effective vascular smooth dilator, with more powerful effect on venous vasculature than arterial vasculature. While its main indication is for angina pectoris, there have been many studies showing improved survival of axial and random pattern flaps. Furthermore, recent clinical studies highlight significantly decreased mastectomy flap wound complication and need for sharp debridement. Nitropaste has low rates of side effects and is very well tolerated in general. To this date, there's no study that investigates its utility on patients who are undergoing chest masculinizing surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential utility of nitropaste in reducing rates of wound complications in patients undergoing chest masculinizing surgery.",

It is an effective vascular smooth dilator, with more powerful effect on venous vasculature than arterial vasculature. While its main indication is for angina pectoris, there have been many studies showing improved survival of axial and random pattern flaps. Furthermore, recent clinical studies highlight significantly decreased mastectomy flap wound complication and need for sharp debridement. Nitropaste has low rates of side effects and is very well tolerated in general. To this date, there's no study that investigates its utility on patients who are undergoing chest masculinizing surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential utility of nitropaste in reducing rates of wound complications in patients undergoing chest masculinizing surgery utilizing double incision with free nipple grafting technique. The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study and compare nitropaste vs. no nitropaste on mastectomy flaps. Nitropaste will be applied intraoperatively and the patients will not have to re-apply it. Follow up will occur on post-op day 5, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks during their routine postop visits. A study coordinator will document the condition of free nipple grafts and any other wounds at surgical site if present, which will be the primary outcome. Any complications including hematoma, seroma, infection, hypertrophic scarring, need for sharp debridement, 30 day ED visit or admission rates will be documented as secondary outcome."
