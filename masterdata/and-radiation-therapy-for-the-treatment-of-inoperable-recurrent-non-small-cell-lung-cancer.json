            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial investigates the best dose and side effects of NBTXR3 when given together with radiation therapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be treated by surgery (inoperable) and has come back (recurrent). NBTXR3 is a radio-enhancer designed to increase the radiotherapy energy dose deposition inside tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving NBTXR3 and radiation therapy may increase radiation-dependent tumor cell killing without increasing the radiation exposure of healthy surrounding tissues.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the safety of 45 Gy in 15 fractions in patients with inoperable, locoregional recurrent NSCLC, previously treated with definitive radiation therapy.\n\nII. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in patients with inoperable, locoregional recurrent NSCLC, previously treated with definitive radiation therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC.\n\nII. To evaluate the anti-tumor response of reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC.\n\nIII. To evaluate time-to-event outcomes after reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess biomarkers of response in patients treated with NBTXR3/radiation therapy (RT).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of NBTXR3.\n\nPatients receive NBTXR3 intratumorally (IT) or intranodally on day 1. Within 15 days, patients undergo RT 5 times weekly (Monday-Friday) over 3 weeks for a total of 10-15 fractions.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for up to 5 years."

Signed informed consent form (ICF) indicating that participant understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study.\n12. English speaking or Non-English Speaking subjects\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. At screening, past medical history of:\n\n   a. Interstitial lung disease b. Drug related pneumonitis c. Any Grade 4 thoracic radiation related toxicity d. Unresolved radiation related i. Esophagitis ii. Pneumonitis iii. Bronchopulmonary hemorrhage e. Any Grade i. Esophageal perforation ii. Radiation associated airway necrosis iii. Bronchoesophageal fistula iv. Tracheoesophageal fistula v. Spinal cord myelopathy\n2. Has received any approved or investigational anti-neoplastic or immunotherapy agent within 3 weeks prior to NBTXR3 injection\n\n   a. Note: a reduced washout window may be considered for therapies with short half-lives (i.e., kinase inhibitors) after discussion with Nanobiotix, IND medical monitor and Investigator.\n3. Use of concurrent systemic therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy) or patient participation on another therapeutic clinical trial.\n4. Active malignancy, in addition to locoregionally recurrent NSCLC, with the exception of definitively treated and relapse free within 1 year from diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ; definitively treated non-metastatic prostate cancer; or patients with another primary malignancy who are definitively treated and relapse free with at least 2 years elapsed since the diagnosis of the other primary malignancy.\n5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with treatment.\n6.

Women of child-bearing potential and their male partners who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period. Acceptable methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.\n9. Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g., compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.\n10.
