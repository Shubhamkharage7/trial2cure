Study will also evaluate how much of the study drug LY3985297 gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to remove it.\n\nThe study is conducted in two parts (part A and B), each part has a separate treatment cohort.\n\nThe study will last up to approximately 116 days for part A, and 145 days for part B, including the screening period."
