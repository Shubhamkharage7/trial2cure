            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial is to evaluate the effects of acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma that does not respond to treatment (refractory) or that has come back (recurrent). Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Given acalabrutinib and venetoclax may kill more cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice a day (BID) and venetoclax PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients receive acalabrutinib alone for the first three 28 day cycles. Venetoclax is added beginning with Cycle 4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed-up every 12 weeks and annually for 10 years."
