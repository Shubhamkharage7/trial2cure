            "briefSummary": "The goal of ADELANTE is to determine whether a multi-level intervention to improve household food insecurity and glycemic control is effective for Latino patients with diabetes.\n\nSpecifically, ADELANTE aims to\n\n1. determine whether weekly household food delivery plus an intensive lifestyle intervention is more effective than usual care for improving glycemic control (HbA1c) at 6 months,\n2. examine the effects of the multi-level intervention on = household food insecurity, dietary behaviors, and psychosocial outcomes, and\n3. assess the future potential for implementation and dissemination of this multi-level intervention in primary care settings.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants and up to two of their household members will be randomized to one of two groups:\n\n1. healthy food box home delivery for 12 weeks plus a 12-month remotely delivered lifestyle behavioral intervention, Vida Sana, which incorporates family members and is aligned with Latino cultural values, or\n2. a wait list control group who will receive the food box deliveries 6 months later (but not the Vida Sana intervention).\n\nThe first 6 months will evaluate the effects of receiving Vida Sana plus food delivery versus being randomized to control (no intervention); the final 6 months will evaluate receiving food delivery with versus without Vida Sana.\n\nVIDA SANA (intervention arm):\n\nThe Vida Sana intervention is a cultural adaptation of Group Lifestyle Balance, a 12-month group program in turn adapted from the NIH/NIDDK-supported Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). It has been shown to be effective in promoting clinically significant, modest weight loss and significant improvements in moderate-intensity physical activity. Participants receive a total of 23 group sessions over 12 months with a trained health coach who provides personalized feedback based on self-tracking.\n\nThe program emphasizes a) moderate caloric reduction by 500-1,000 calories per day through healthy substitutions, b) incremental increases in moderate physical activity such as brisk walking, and c) behavioral strategies to support successful adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors. These behavioral strategies include realistic goal setting, fostering social support, and stress management. Study health coaches will also add COVID-specific topics to ensure that participants are equipped to change behavior and manage stress during the pandemic.\n\nFOOD BOXES (intervention arm (immediately) and control arm (6 months later)):\n\nEach healthy food box delivery will include a variety of seasonal produce and a rotation of different whole grain foods (3+ grams of fiber/serving) such as cereal, pasta, tortillas, bread, and crackers. Participants will receive familiar foods as well as (intentionally) unfamiliar items to encourage them to try new foods. All items are also available at low-cost grocery stores so participants can continue to purchase them after the end of the study if they wish. The quantity is scaled to three household sizes. It is intended to supplement a family's food supply and provide opportunities for trying new fiber-rich foods recommended by the Vida Sana intervention."
