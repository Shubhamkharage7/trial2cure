            "briefSummary": "Swallowing impairments (dysphagia) frequently occur after stroke and have devastating consequences on overall health and quality of life, and long-term deficits in swallow function also increase risk of morbidity (e.g. depression) and mortality (i.e. aspiration pneumonia). As such, rehabilitation of swallow function to improve safety and efficiency of swallowing is essential in this population. This study aims to: 1) Provide preliminary data to evaluate the effect of a novel lingual endurance exercise on swallow function in individuals with post-stroke dysphagia; and 2) Collect preliminary data regarding changes in white matter tract diffusion and cortical thickness and from MRI data to better understand effects of lingual exercise training on neuroplasticity.",
            "detailedDescription": "This pilot trial will evaluate the effect of lingual endurance exercise (vs sham exercise) on recovery of swallow function after stroke. The Primary Aim of this study is to evaluate effects of lingual endurance exercise vs sham on swallow function in individuals with post-stroke dysphagia. The investigators hypothesize that lingual endurance training will result in greater improvement in measures of oral swallow physiology as compared to sham. Regardless of outcome, this dataset will provide innovative and highly novel information regarding the relationship between lingual function, swallowing impairments, and cortical representation of dysphagia in a post stroke population. These pilot data will be essential in providing sufficient power for designing an R01 Phase II intervention trial to investigate how to maximize gains with timing and intensity of therapy delivery to better recover swallow function after stroke."
