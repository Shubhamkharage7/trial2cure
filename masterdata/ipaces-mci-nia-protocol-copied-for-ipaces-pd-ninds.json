Participants will include persons with PD, and potentially, also their co-residing partner, who will exercise at home or accessible location, 3-5 times per week for at least 6 months, with follow-up one month after the main intervention. All participation is \"remote\" (completed at home, or location of choice), utilizing either one's own equipment (\"bring-your-own-devices\" BYODs: pedaler, phone/tablet, smart-watch) or some equipment which may be supplied by the grant-funded study and shipped directly to the home; all study measures are completed remotely (e.g., via phone app, website, biometric device, videoconference, email, snail mail, etc.).",
