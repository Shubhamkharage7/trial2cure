            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to learn if women of Hispanic/Latina ethnicity are willing to self-collect a cervico-vaginal sample for HPV testing. The main question the study will answer is:\n\n\u2022 Does a brief educational intervention increase the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling among Hispanic/Latina women?\n\nThe study team will compare whether including a brief educational intervention with a mailed HPV self-sampling kit is more acceptable than receiving a mailed HPV self-sampling kit alone.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete surveys at study entry (baseline) and then randomized to receive only the HPV self-sampling kit, or the kit plus a small group education that meets with a bilingual health educator.\n\nParticipants will then be contacted about one-month later to complete a follow-up survey. The study team will also measure the number of participants in each group who self-collect a sample and mail it in for HPV testing.",
            "detailedDescription": "We will recruit a sample of underscreened Latinas (n=100) who will be randomly assigned to either the educational intervention (n=50) or a control condition (n=50). Feasibility will be measured through study enrollment and intervention completion (defined as the proportion of women who self-collect a sample). Acceptability of intervention materials and self-sampling procedures will be measured using self-report surveys at follow-up assessments."
