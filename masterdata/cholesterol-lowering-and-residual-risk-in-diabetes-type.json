Analyze the effect of reducing the cholesterol levels in the blood on platelet function. (Platelets are small cells in the blood which help form blood clots to slow or stop bleeding and to help wounds heal\n2. Analyze the effect of reducing the cholesterol levels in the blood on While Blood Cell (WBC) gene expression, (White Blood Cells are part of the body's immune system which help the body fight infection and other diseases) and\n3. Analyze the effect of reducing the cholesterol levels in the blood on vascular or blood vessel function.",
