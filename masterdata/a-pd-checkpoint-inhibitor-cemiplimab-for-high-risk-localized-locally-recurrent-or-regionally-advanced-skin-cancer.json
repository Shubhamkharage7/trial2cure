            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well cemiplimab before surgery works in treating patients with skin cancer that is high-risk and has not spread to other parts of the body (localized), has come back locally (locally recurrent), or has spread regionally (regionally advanced), and can be removed by surgery (resectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cemiplimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the pathological partial response (PPR) rate in patients with potentially resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the pathological complete response rate (PCR). II. To estimate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version \\[v\\]1.1) 9 week objective response rate (ORR).\n\nIII. To estimate the RECIST (v1.1) 12 month progression free (PFS). IV. To assess the toxicity among patients with CSCC treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate tumor mutational burden (TMB) and correlate with response to PD-1 blockade therapy.\n\nII. To evaluate PD-L1 expression on CSCC tumor cells and correlate with response to PD-1 blockade.\n\nIII. To evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration into CSCC tumors and correlate with response to PD-1 blockade.\n\nIV. To assess other adaptive immune resistance mechanisms in CSCC tumors.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive cemiplimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles (or up to 4 cycles for patients whose disease is unresectable after 3 cycles) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 6 weeks of last dose of therapy, patients with potentially resectable tumors undergo surgical resection.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months."

Patients must have recovered from any major complications before registration\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. use of disease modifying agents or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* History of other prior malignancy in the last five years, with the exception of: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers (including multiple primary skin cancers), adequately treated in situ cancer, and other local tumors considered cured by local treatment (including melanoma)\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cemiplimab or any other PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor\n* Uncontrolled, intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness / social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Positive pregnancy test, active pregnancy or nursing / breast-feeding, due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants\n* History solid organ or bone marrow transplantation",
