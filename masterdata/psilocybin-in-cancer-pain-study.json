            "detailedDescription": "This study is a phase 2 open label, single center, concurrent mixed-methods trial to assess the feasibility of a novel palliative-care informed psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy regimen to alleviate opioid-refractory pain in patients with advanced-cancer. Psilocybin works on the serotonin system in the brain which is linked to the regulation of mood, motivation and impulse control.\n\nPsilocybin is an \"Investigational\" drug, meaning that the study drug has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for any disease. However, investigators have permission from the FDA to use this drug in this research study.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, an electrocardiogram, blood tests, and the study intervention includes preparation, evaluations, one psilocybin session and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will be followed for up to 12 weeks (approximately 3 months) after receiving the study treatment.\n\nIt is expected that about 15 people will take part in this research study.\n\nFilament Health is supporting this research study by providing the study investigational medication, psilocybin.\n\nCy Biopharma and Pancreatic Cancer North America are supporting this research study by providing funding."

Participants with a history of atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or any other arrhythmia associated with a bypass tract may be enrolled if they have been successfully treated.\n* Participants who have a history of additional risk factors for Torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)\n* Participants who have a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease or heart failure\n* Participants who have a marked Baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval. For purposes of eligibility, this is defined as repeated demonstration of a QT interval corrected on the triplicate ECGs performed at screening, using Fridericia's formula \\[QTcF\\] \\> 450 milliseconds \\[ms\\] in males and \\> 460 ms in females.\n* For transgender or non binary participants, QTc interval will be evaluated based on sex assigned at birth, unless the participant has been on hormonal treatment for five or more years.\n* Women who are pregnant, nursing, or able to become pregnant and are not practicing an effective means of birth control. Acceptable methods of contraception are the following: intrauterine device, injected/ implanted/ intravaginal/ transdermal hormonal method, oral hormones plus a barrier contraception, abstinence, vasectomized sole partner, or double barrier contraception.\n* Participants who have hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the IMP (Investigational Medicinal Product).",
