This study will also determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of botensilimab monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab.",
            "detailedDescription": "This Phase 1 study will enroll up to approximately 550 evaluable adult participants with refractory, advanced cancer (solid tumors).\n\nThe study will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation. Different dose levels of botensilimab, both monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab, will be evaluated in individual cohorts based upon dose. Each participant will remain in the cohort of the dose level and schedule assigned at study entry. Participants can be replaced for any reason other than a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Participants will receive treatment for \u2264 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal of trial occurs.\n\nAdditionally, the study is intended to further explore the safety, PK, PD, and clinical activity in selected cancer types at dose levels (botensilimab monotherapy and combination therapy with balstilimab) determined as potentially effective. Indications of interest include, but are not limited to, non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, angiosarcoma, colorectal cancer without liver metastases, prostate cancer, and fibrolamellar carcinoma."
