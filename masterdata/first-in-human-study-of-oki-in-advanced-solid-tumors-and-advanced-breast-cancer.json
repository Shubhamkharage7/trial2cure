Phase 1a (Part A) will investigate escalating doses of OKI-219 monotherapy, and Phase 1b will investigate OKI-219 (at a tolerated dose determined in Part A) in combination with standard dose fulvestrant (Part B) or standard dose trastuzumab (Part C). Participants will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or other study treatment withdrawal criteria are met."
