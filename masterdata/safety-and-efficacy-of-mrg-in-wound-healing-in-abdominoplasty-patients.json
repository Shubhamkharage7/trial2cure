Body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at the Screening Visit.\n9. Men must be willing to use double-barrier contraception from enrollment until 8 weeks after the last dose of the study drug, if not abstinent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participation in any other clinical trial of an experimental treatment or used an investigational drug within the past 30 days.\n2. Subject has a clinically significant history or evidence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, immunological, hematological or psychiatric disorder(s) as determined by the Principal Investigator or designee.\n3. History of diabetes mellitus or an HbA1C greater than 5.7 percent.\n4. History of prior abdominal surgery or abdominal liposuction, cryolipolysis, focused ultrasound or other fat reduction procedures in or near the anterior abdomen within 12 months prior to screening.\n5. History of poor or delayed wound healing such as prior wound dehiscence, chronic wound or leg ulcer.\n6. History of or evidence of a genetic collagen disorder such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.\n7. Operating Physician is unable to design an abdominoplasty incision area of at least 25 cm wide by 12 cm tall at the center of the fusiform.\n8. The presence of any abnormality of the skin within the area of the proposed abdominoplasty that, in the opinion of the PI, could interfere with the excision process or grading of the resultant surgical scar (e.g., striae gravidarum, striae distensae, excessive nevi, numerous seborrheic keratoses, tattoos, etc.).\n9. History of splenectomy or splenomegaly (spleen weighing \\>750 g).\n10. Currently taking immunomodulating drugs (e.g, interferons, interleukin, JAK1/2 inhibitors/corticosteroids).\n11. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed at any time through 90 days after last dose of IP.\n12. History of alcohol and/or illicit drug abuse within 2 years of entry.\n13. History of hypersensitivity to MRG-001's components (tacrolimus or plerixafor) or hypersensitivity or intolerance to local anesthetics.\n14. Any personal, familial, employment or financial situation that could impede the subject's ability to attend all study visits and successfully complete the entire clinical study.\n15. Unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related restrictions, the nature, scope and possible consequences of the clinical study.\n16. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for follow-up visits and improbability of completing the clinical study.\n17. Subjects defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical study may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate (e.g., vulnerable populations, persons in detention, minors and those incapable of giving consent).",
