While several mechanisms are responsible, PM2.5-induced elevations in blood pressure (BP) may be relevant. Indoor portable air cleaners (PACs) are a novel approach to reduce exposure to PM2.5 and potentially lower blood pressure. The current study is being conducted to provide evidence that PACs reduce PM2.5 exposure and lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) in key patient populations."
