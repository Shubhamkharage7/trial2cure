The phase II part of the study will also evaluate the clinical activity of the combined regiment. Based on pre-clinical studies and a phase I trial, the investigators hypothesize that the combination of an FDA-approved non-toxic dose of oral Metformin with Vemurafenib will yield little toxicity and improve clinical outcomes in terms of objective response rates and survival in metastatic melanoma patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I/II study. Phase I will be evaluating the safety of the FDA-approved Vemurafenib (960 mg orally, daily) in combination with Metformin (500 mg orally, twice daily for 2 weeks, then 850 mg orally,twice daily) in patients with unresectable Stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma. Phase II will evaluate the clinical activity of the combined Vemurafenib/Metformin regimen. The safety profile of this combined Vemurafenib/Metformin regimen will be monitored during both phases. The treatment period consists of 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs."
