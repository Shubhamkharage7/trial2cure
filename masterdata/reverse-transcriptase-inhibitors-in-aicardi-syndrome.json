Additionally, this trial will further the investigators understanding of this disorder, measuring for the first time retroelements in human participants, exploring the retroviral burden in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the Interferon (IFN) signaling response, as well as evaluating antigen targets of autoimmunity and cytokines. If successful, this approach will clearly demonstrate the need for a larger trial of antiretrovirals in AGS with more clinically relevant outcomes."
