            "briefSummary": "The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using ECAP (electrically evoked compound action potential)-controlled CL (closed-loop) SCS (spinal cord stimulation) to treat chronic pelvic pain by stimulating an area in the spine called the conus medullaris (the lowermost tapering extremity of the spinal cord).",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective Evaluate the efficacy of ECAP CL-SCS in treating chronic pelvic pain.\n\nSecondary Objectives Evaluate changes in impact of pain on activities of daily living, pain quality, quality of life, sleep, anxiety and depression, pain catastrophizing, patient satisfaction, and symptoms related to urinary urgency frequency.\n\nEvaluate safety of using ECAP-controlled CL-SCS in treating chronic pelvic pain. Summarize and evaluate device performance and typical programming parameters.\n\nStudy design This protocol describes an observational, prospective, single-arm, single center study. Eligible subjects will undergo an implant procedure as per standard of care for SCS. The system will be used within its licensed use. Data will be collected prospectively from 1 US study center. Time points of data collection are at baseline, trial, device implant and at 3-, 6-, -12 months post-implant.\n\nStudy population Subjects with chronic, intractable pelvic pain will be screened for participation in this study.\n\nSubjects who provide informed consent and meet the study eligibility criteria will be enrolled and will undergo a trial procedure.\n\nFollowing the trial phase subjects may receive a permanent implant and be followed up at 3-, 6-, and 12-months following the permanent implant.\n\nEnrollment will continue until 15 subjects receive a permanent implant. We estimate that up to 20 subjects will be enrolled in this study.\n\nStatistical analyses will be conducted using an appropriate software package (e.g., SAS, SPSS, R, Statistics). Standard summary statistics will be used to summarize endpoints and key study variables. Categorical variables, including the incidence of adverse events, will be summarized via counts and percentages. Continuous variables will be summarized via mean, median, standard deviation, and range. 95% confidence intervals will also be included with summary statistics for primary and secondary endpoints as well as other variables where appropriate. Any p-values for secondary or other endpoints will be nominal and not adjusted for multiplicity."
