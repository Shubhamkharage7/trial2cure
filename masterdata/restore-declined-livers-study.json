The discarded livers rejected by all other centers and meeting pre-NMP eligibility criteria will receive NMP using the OrganOx\u00ae metra device. The NMP-treated liver that meets the viability criteria will be transplanted to patients who are eligible and consented to the study. Liver transplant outcomes will be ascertained during 12 months post-transplantation. The results of the trial will be compared with those of contemporary comparison groups of patients who received the standard criteria donor liver transplantation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized, clinical trial to assess the feasibility of successful transplantation of NMP-treated livers to patients. First, up to 71 marginal livers declined for transplantation will be treated with NMP using the OrganOx\u00ae metra device and tested for viability using previously defined criteria. NMP-treated viable livers will be subsequently transplanted to patients (n=5 in the 1st stage; additional 10 transplantation in the 2nd stage; additional 10 transplantation in the 3rd stage: total N=25). Patients will be closely followed for clinical outcomes of the transplantation during 6 months post-transplantation. The follow-up will also be extended up to 1 year post-transplantation. The trial will compare the results to those of three comparison groups - 1) matched patients who received liver transplantation at Washington University/Barnes Jewish Hospital; 2) matched patients who received DBD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS database; and 3) matched patients who received DCD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS database. Given that patient safety is the priority, the trial uses a multi-stage design in which the study stops earlier when NMP-treated liver transplantation is observed to be ineffective (see trial schema in Section 3.1)."
