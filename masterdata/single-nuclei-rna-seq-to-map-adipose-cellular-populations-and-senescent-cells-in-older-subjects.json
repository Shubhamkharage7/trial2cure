The app will be used to record amount of each meal consumed in order to determine daily food and beverage and supplement intake and quantity for dietary composition analysis. DEXA analysis will be performed to measure lean and fat body mass.\n\nSubjects will undergo evaluation of physical function/performance, including the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and VO2 peak testing for assessment of aerobic capacity. The SPPB will be done in older adults only.\n\nThe NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System (PROMIS) will be used to measure participants' self-report of symptoms, function, and health-related quality of life in the domains of physical, mental and social health.\n\nAll subjects will undergo a two-step euglycemic insulin clamp and indirect calorimetry.\n\nOnly older obese participants will continue to the randomization to likestyle intervention, senolytic agents or placebo."

On each session, aerobic exercise will be followed by resistance exercise.\n2. Diet: The aim of the dietary intervention is to reduce caloric intake sufficient to result in 8-10% weight loss, while incorporating behavioral and dietary strategies to maximize adherence and to minimize risk of muscle and bone loss. Subjects will attend small-group sessions led by a dietitian for changing their dietary composition to follow American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines.",
