            "briefSummary": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "The specific aim of this clinical study is to identify patients who will or will not respond to PVI, PVI plus other ablation or Maze surgery based on locations of organized-to-disorganized areas and clinical profile. We will develop non-invasive ECGI and intracardiac recordings in our registry, then test them prospectively in an observational study.\n\nPremise: Identifying responders or non-responders to PVI alone, or PVI plus other ablation or Maze surgery may enable patient-tailored therapy. This may raise overall success, reduce risks from unsuccessful procedures and improve resource utilization(58,128-130). This proposal will prospectively test in single-arm observations studies if patients who exhibit large organized AF areas at planned ablation regions have higher procedural success than patients with smaller areas. We will use non-invasive ECGI indices of organized AF, based on Preliminary data(9, 84, 85).\n\nThis project is significant because it will establish a deeper understanding of AF and will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy."
