            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the how well fractionated gemtuzumab ozogamicin works in treating measurable residual disease in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called gemtuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called ozogamicin. Gemtuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD33 receptors, and delivers a chemotherapy known as calicheamicin to kill them.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 7. Treatment continues for 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Responders and non-responders, without significant adverse events during the first course, may receive a second course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin within 60 days after course 1.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months."
