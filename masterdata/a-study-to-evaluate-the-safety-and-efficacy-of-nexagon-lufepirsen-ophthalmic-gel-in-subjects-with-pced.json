Those subjects whose defect has not re-epithelialized by the completion of the Treatment Period or who achieved re-epithelialization but failed to maintain re-epithelialization for 28 days after treatment completion (durability) are eligible to enter the NEXAGON Open-label Treatment Period for an additional 8 weeks."
