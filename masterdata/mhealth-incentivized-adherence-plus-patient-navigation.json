Patients with opioids and methamphetamine use often experience serious medical complications requiring hospitalization, which provides an opportunity to offer addiction treatment. Yet linkage to outpatient treatment post-discharge is suboptimal and methamphetamine exacerbates outcomes. The investigators propose to pilot test \"MHealth Incentivized Adherence Plus Patient Navigation\" (MIAPP) to promote treatment linkage and retention for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and methamphetamine use who initiate buprenorphine in the hospital. The investigators Aim is to perform a two-arm, pilot randomized clinical trial (n=40) comparing MIAPP + treatment-as-usual (TAU) versus TAU alone on outpatient medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) linkage within 30 days (primary) and 90-day retention on medications (secondary) among hospitalized patients with OUD and methamphetamine use."
