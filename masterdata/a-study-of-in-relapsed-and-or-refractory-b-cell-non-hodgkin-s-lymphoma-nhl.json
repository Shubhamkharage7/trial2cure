This first-in-human Phase 1/2 Study CRC-403 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of bbT369 in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Phase 1 will be a dose escalation, up to a planned four dose levels. After establishing MTD, Phase 2 will enroll subjects with B cell NHL in 2 cohorts: CAR T exposed subjects (Cohort 1) and CAR T na\u00efve subjects (Cohort 2). A long-term follow-up is planned, in which subjects who received bbT369 will be followed for up to 15 years after drug product infusion to evaluate for safety and continued efficacy."
