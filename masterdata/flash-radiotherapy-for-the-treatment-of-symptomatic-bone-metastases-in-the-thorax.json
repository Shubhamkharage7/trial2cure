Workflow metrics of FLASH radiotherapy in the thorax in a clinical setting will also be assessed. Patients at least 18 years of age with painful bone metastases located in the thorax will be considered for the study. Eligible subjects will be treated for painful bone metastases in the thorax using a palliative regimen of FLASH radiotherapy and followed post-treatment until subject death or lost to follow-up."
