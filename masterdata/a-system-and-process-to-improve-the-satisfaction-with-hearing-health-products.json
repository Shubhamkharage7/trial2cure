            "detailedDescription": "As of 2015, 28.8 million U.S. adults could benefit from using hearing aids and the prevalence of hearing loss in the United States is predicted to rise significantly due to an aging population and the growing use of personal listening devices. However, only 28.5% of individuals who could benefit from a HA actually wears one. The non-use of hearing aids by people with hearing loss has many far-reaching implications for their physical health, mental health, and their social life. As the market moves towards a, direct-to-consumer distribution model following the 2017 FDA directive, more patients will be receiving therapy for hearing loss. While in traditional practice, an audiologist assists the patient with support adjusting to their new therapy, there is no person fulfilling that role in the direct-to-consumer model. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the integration of Health and Wellness Coaching, aided by cloud-based tools, into this process will increase patients' satisfaction and usage of hearing health products. Specific Aims: 1) Create patient/coach interaction protocol and training; 2) Develop a cloud-based Health Coaching Interface; 3) Evaluate system effectiveness through a clinical trial."
