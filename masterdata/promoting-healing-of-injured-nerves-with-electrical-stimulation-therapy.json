Participants will be randomized into one of two groups, treatment or control, with all participants receiving standard of care treatment for the nerve injury. The treatment group will also receive a single dose of the therapeutic stimulation during the surgical intervention for their nerve injury.",

This pilot study is investigating the use of a single dose of therapeutic electrical stimulation to promote nerve healing.
