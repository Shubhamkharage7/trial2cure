Questions regarding inclusion of individual subjects should be directed to Drs. Cobain and Speers (ecobain@med.umich.edu and cspeers@med.umich.edu).\n* Patient has a concurrent invasive malignancy or a prior invasive malignancy whose treatment was completed within 2 years before randomization. Note: Patients with adequately treated, basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma or curatively resected cervical cancer in situ are eligible.\n* Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the oral trial treatments (e.g. uncontrolled ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection).\n* Patients must not receive any additional anti-cancer therapy or investigational agents during study therapy. Anti-cancer therapies include chemotherapy and endocrine therapy.\n* Patient is currently receiving any of the following substances within 7 days before randomization:\n\n  * Concomitant medications, herbal supplements, and/or fruits (e.g. grapefruit, pummellos, starfruit, Seville oranges) and their juices that are known as strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5.\n  * Medications that have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4/5.",
