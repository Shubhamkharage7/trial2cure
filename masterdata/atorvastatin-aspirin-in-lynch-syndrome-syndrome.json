Subjects will be stratified based on their prior history of polyps/cancer to receive atorvastatin without or with aspirin for 6 weeks. Blood and normal colon biopsies will be obtained at Day 0 and at 6 weeks on study. Tissue endpoints for analysis include cell proliferation, apoptosis and changes in gene expression. Circulating lipid profiles and metabolic function, and post-treatment questionnaires will be used to assess the acceptability of the study."
