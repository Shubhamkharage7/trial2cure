            "briefSummary": "ASCEND researchers are partnering with families of children who receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after a sudden failure of breathing named pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). ECMO is a life support technology that uses an artificial lung outside of the body to do the lung's work. ASCEND has two objectives.\n\nThe first objective is to learn more about children's abilities and quality of life among ECMO-supported children in the year after they leave the pediatric intensive care unit. The second objective is to compare short and long-term patient outcomes in two groups of children: one group managed with a mechanical ventilation protocol that reserves the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) until protocol failure to another group supported on ECMO per usual care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Decades after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was first used to support children with severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS), pediatric intensivists lack both prospective studies of long-term outcomes in ECMO for PARDS and well-powered studies comparing the impact of ECMO initiation strategies on mortality and morbidity. While clinicians lack the equipoise necessary to randomize ECMO in dying children, there is uncertainty on if and when it is best to initiate ECMO to preserve survival, functioning, and quality of life. To determine if and when ECMO should be initiated in children with severe PARDS, it is necessary to compare the long-term outcomes in ECMO supported children to otherwise similar children who did not receive ECMO at the same threshold if at all.\n\nAn opportunity to address this question is provided by NHLBI-funded Prone and Oscillation Pediatric Clinical Trial (PROSpect) and the ECMO registry, Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). PROSpect is an existing randomized clinical trial testing the impact of supine/prone positioning and conventional mechanical ventilation/high-frequency oscillatory ventilation on short and long-term clinical outcomes in 1,000 children with severe PARDS. PROSpect manages subjects with a rigorous protocol that reserves ECMO for protocol failure. The ELSO Registry includes children receiving usual care ECMO, initiated at the discretion of the intensivist.\n\nASCEND harmonizes PROSpect and ELSO data collection and prospectively measures functional status and quality of life via surveys in an additional 550 children with severe PARDS from ELSO sites. ASCEND measures children's abilities and quality of life when the child was in their normal state of health (just prior to being hospitalized), at discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit, and at 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months after discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit. After enrollment of the usual care ECMO (in ELSO) and PROSpect's protocolized therapies (from the PROSpect clinical trial) is complete, then ASCEND will match similarly critically ill children based on their propensity to receive usual care ECMO.\n\nASCEND combines real-world observational data (from ELSO) and a randomized clinical trial (from PROSpect) to address two specific aims.\n\nAim 1: The study will test the hypotheses that one year after children receive usual care ECMO for PARDS, there will be a decline in long-term functional status and health-related quality of life as well as an increase in the proportion of children receiving respiratory support.\n\nAim 2: The study will test the hypotheses that 90-day mortality, one-year functional status, and one-year health-related quality of life are not equivalent for children with usual care ECMO (in ELSO) and PROSpect's protocolized therapies.\n\nProtocol change in November 2021:\n\nInclusion criteria: Extend the window between intubation and ECMO cannulation from 120 hours to 168 hours.\n\nExclusion criteria: Remove active air leak, critical airway, and facial surgery/trauma within the last 2 weeks.\n\nProtocol change in October 2022:\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n1. Extended the age range from 14 days - 17 years to 14 days - 20 years of age.\n2. Extended the window between intubation and ECMO cannulation from 168 hours to 240 hours."
