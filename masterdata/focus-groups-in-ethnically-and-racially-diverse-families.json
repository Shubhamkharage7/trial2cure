Researchers will engage Black and Hispanic families in focus groups to discuss mental health priorities related to their children, and real or perceived barriers to engagement in research studies. The feedback will inform the final design and recruitment for the multinutrient feasibility study in Black and Hispanic populations. One group will comprise individuals who self-identify as Hispanic, another, as Black, in order to create space to hear perspectives that may differ between broadly defined groups."
