            "briefSummary": "Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a condition where the cornea, or clear outer covering of the eye, has reduced sensation due to a variety of reasons. In more advanced cases of NK, the cornea can develop an area of thinning called an ulcer. The purpose of this research is to find out if Oxervate (cenegermin-bkbj 0.002%) an FDA-approved treatment for neurotrophic corneal ulcers leads to an increase in thickness of the corneal stroma (middle layer of the cornea) during and after treatment of a neurotrophic ulcer. Corneal thickness will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-contact imaging device used routinely in ophthalmology examinations. Corneal sensation will also be measured during and after treatment with a device called a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer to see if the treatment increases corneal sensation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a condition where the cornea, or clear outer covering of the eye, has reduced sensation due to a variety of reasons such as previous surgery or infection. In more advanced cases of NK, the cornea can develop an area of thinning called an ulcer. If the cornea becomes too thin, it is at risk for perforation or rupture, which requires extensive surgery to save vision and the eye. This risk can last for many years even after the ulcer is no longer active. The purpose of this research is to find out if Oxervate (cenegermin-bkbj 0.002%) an FDA-approved treatment for neurotrophic corneal ulcers leads to an increase in thickness of the corneal stroma (middle layer of the cornea) during and after treatment of a neurotrophic ulcer. The FDA trials demonstrated that Oxervate does lead to more rapid healing of the epithelium (thin surface layer) of the cornea, but it is unclear if it increases the thickness of the stroma, which is the strongest part of the cornea. Corneal thickness will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-contact imaging device used routinely in ophthalmology examinations. Corneal sensation will also be measured during and after treatment with a device called a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer to see if the treatment increases corneal sensation. If treatment with Oxervate increases corneal sensation, then this decreases the risk of future ulcer formation.\n\nAbout 10 subjects will take part in this research."
