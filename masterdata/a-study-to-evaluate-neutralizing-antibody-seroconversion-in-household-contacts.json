Up to 5 participants from the same household may be enrolled. The objective is to estimate the likelihood of NAb seroconversion to AAV9 in household contacts of a patient in one of the interventional studies who is treated with fordadistrogene movaparvovec gene therapy.",

Eligible participants will undergo a blood draw provided by a Home Health Care Vendor at three home visits.\n\nThe total duration of participation in this study is about 4 months, including up to 48 days for the screening/baseline period and about 56 days after the DMD patient of the same household is dosed with the investigational gene therapy in the interventional study.\n\nTo maintain the blind in the blinded interventional studies, all C3391007 study participants and investigators as well as the sponsor will remain blinded to the Cohort assignment of the interventional study patient until the interventional study becomes unblinded."
