            "briefSummary": "This project involves two sub-parts:\n\nStudy 1: Effect of lab-based Functional Balance Intervention (FBI) for physical and cognitive symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nStudy 2: Feasibility of home-based FBI for physical and cognitive symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nEach study involves a 2-arm, Phase-1, randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of FBI on physical, cognitive function, and daily living among people with MS (PwMS). Study 1 is conducted in a lab setting, while Study 2 is conducted at home with additional safety measures. A total of 150 people with multiple sclerosis will be recruited and telephone screened, with an expected enrollment of 120 (60 per phase). After in-person screening, 96 eligible participants (48 per phase) will undergo pre-training assessment and randomization into FBI or Stretching groups. Training sessions will occur twice a week for four months. Anticipating a 15-17% attrition rate, the target sample size is 80 (40 per phase) for completion of the study. Post-training assessments will be conducted after four months to evaluate FBI's impact on physical and cognitive functions. This evidence-based protocol, previously successful with neurological and older adult populations, intends to provide a low-cost, safe, and effective intervention for PwMS in clinical and community settings, including rural areas.",
            "detailedDescription": "1.0 BACKGROUND/SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE (Study 1 and 2) Of the 1 million adults living with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, over 80% have physical impairment, an estimated 45-60% have cognitive impairment and 20-30% will develop severe dementia. Physical deficits include muscular weakness, spasticity, sensorimotor dysfunction, and imbalance, which co-occur with cognitive dysfunction and directly impact community mobility and overall quality of life. Cognitive deficits include slowed processing speed and reaction time, poor executive functions like planning and problem-solving, and learning and memory deficits. Physical and cognitive deficits rarely remit after onset and are associated with secondary problems with mobility and balance, resulting in increased fall-risk. Whereas treatments targeting restoration of physical function in PwMS have been established, research informing effective management of cognitive dysfunction is in its early stages. Further, there is limited evidence for pharmacological and rehabilitation approaches that can target both physical and cognitive dysfunction. Yet, there have been recent calls for greater focus on unique modes of exercise training as the most promising approach.\n\nExercise training interventions have yielded modest, but consistent improvements in physical function, walking ability, and fatigue in PwMS. Whereas there is extensive evidence on exercise training targeting physical function, there is comparatively much less known about exercise training targeting cognitive function in PwMS, and this literature is not yet conclusive. Additionally, previous interventions among PwMS have rarely incorporated components of functional balance for treating physical and cognitive dysfunction. Interventions like aerobic and/or strength training are effective in improving physical function, yet effects on cognitive dysfunction might not be very robust. Indeed, cognitive improvements after protocols of aerobic and/or strength-based exercise training might be limited because these modalities might share limited brain resources with physical domains and cognitive tasks, resulting in only a minor transfer of improvements to physical and cognitive performance. On the other hand, there is more evidence of common neural resources shared between cognitive tasks and balance control (e.g., vestibular, visuospatial processing, executive function, attention). Thus, focusing on functional balance training could have a greater activation of the central nervous system (CNS) integrative frameworks for treating cognitive dysfunction in PwMS. It could further have secondary benefits of improving fall efficacy, physical activity, and community mobility thereby mediating change in measures of quality of life among PwMS. Thus, the investigators propose a novel, multicomponent exercise intervention named Functional Balance Intervention (FBI) for improving physical and cognitive function and other measures of daily living among PwMS. The effects of FBI will be tested in a laboratory setting (Study 1) and then tested in a home-based setting (Study 2) in parallel. For both studies, the FBI will be compared to a control group, who will complete an equivalent dosage of stretching. Results from the proposed Phase-I Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will inform the research community to launch a line of larger Phase-II RCT examining the comparative effectiveness of the FBI program among PwMS. The findings from this project can also serve as preliminary groundwork for conducting large-scale clinical trials to assess comparative effectiveness of FBI with other pre-established interventions particularly for individuals with restricted mobility and/or restricted access to onsite healthcare services.\n\n2.0 OBJECTIVES (Study 1 and 2) The two-study project is an alternative, non-pharmacological intervention, which represents an important avenue for treating physical and cognitive symptoms of MS and aims to impact measures of mobility and quality of life. Through this project, the investigators will simultaneously examine the effects of FBI compared to stretching among PwMS in a lab-based setting (Study 1) and home-based setting (Study 2). Study 1 and 2 will run in parallel i.e., all data collection, analysis, and dissemination activities will occur simultaneously. For both studies, the investigators first postulate that a Functional Balance Intervention (FBI) can result in immediate improvements in physical function, possibly mediated via improvements in secondary endpoints of dual-task balance, functional mobility, and gait. Secondly, the investigators postulate the possibility that cognition shares more similar neural processes with balance control than with other functional domains, such that CNS adaptations induced by functional balance training could translate into immediate in cognition40. The improvements in physical and cognitive function will mediate improvements in other measures of daily living.\n\nBelow are the combined specific aims for Study 1 and 2:\n\nAim 1: Examine the effect of the FBI (Intervention Group) on physical function in PwMS compared to a stretching program (Control Group).\n\nHypothesis 1: After 4 months of training, the FBI will show significantly higher improvements in physical function compared to the stretching.\n\nAim 2: Examine the effect of a multicomponent FBI on cognitive function compared to PwMS in the stretching program.\n\nHypothesis 2: After 4 months of training, the FBI will show significantly higher improvements in cognitive function compared to the stretching.\n\nAim 3: Examine the effects of the multicomponent FBI compared to the control group among PwMS on measures of daily living (dual task performance, balance confidence community mobility, and quality of life).\n\nHypothesis 3: After 4 months of training, the FBI will show significantly higher improvements in measures of daily living compared to stretching.\n\n3.0 Research Design Both sub-studies included in this project (i.e., Study 1 and 2) involve a randomized controlled trial design to establish the feasibility and initial effect of a multicomponent, Functional Balance Intervention (FBI) for immediate improvements in physical and cognitive function, and measures of daily living among persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Study 1 will include training sessions in the lab, and Study 2 will include training sessions at home. Data collection procedures for Study 1 and 2 will run in parallel.\n\nA total sample of 120 participants with Multiple Sclerosis (60 in each study) will be enrolled in this project. The investigators expect \\~20% in-person screening failures. Hence, the investigators expect that \\~96 PwMS will be eligible to be included in the study, undergo pre-training assessment, and then randomized into 2 groups. The Interventional Group (n=24 for Study 1 and n=24 for Study 2) will undergo a multi component Functional Balance Intervention for 4 months, whereas in the Control Group (n=24 for Study 1 and n=24 for Study 2) will receive a stretching intervention for 4 months.\n\nStudy overview (Study 1 and 2) All participants will undergo the following procedures.\n\n* Week 1: Recruitment and phone screening\n* Week 2: In-person screening (2 hours)\n* Week 3: Pre-training assessment (2 hours)\n* Week 4: Random Assignment\n* Week 5-20: Training sessions (1 hour/day, 2 times per week for 4 months)\n* Week 21: Post-training assessment (2 hours)"
