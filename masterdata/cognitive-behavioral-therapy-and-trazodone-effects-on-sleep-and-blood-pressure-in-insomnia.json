This study will examine whether patients with ISS and INS demonstrate a differential response to two common insomnia treatments. One is behavioral, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). The other is a widely prescribed, non-habit-forming medication, trazodone used at a low dose. The investigators' findings could lead to evidence-based treatment guidelines that help clinicians more effectively match treatments to insomnia patients and reduce associated health problems."

A copy of the data will be uploaded to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repositories Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) repository. The datasets will not include any personal identifiers related to participants or clinical sites. Dates will be de-identified through a date-shifting algorithm to mask actual dates while maintaining a relation to the epoch in which events occurred. Data tables will be exported in comma-separated format, readable by statistical software. Variable dictionaries and code books, detailing variable description, format, value domain and labels, will be produced. Raw data files for polysomnogram/actigraphy/cortisol will also be made available, ensuring that data are linkable to study data and data are de-identified.",
