            "briefSummary": "As part of Phase II of the NIH SBIR grant, the study will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial in which the MapHabit system (MHS) will offer a caregiver training product that is linked to MHS, an Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (AD/ADRD) assistive technology product that uses visual maps to improve a patient's behavior and sense of autonomy. MapHabit's combined areas of focus, i.e., offer a single integrated product to address the caregiver and the person under this caregiver's care, are unique and will create a new standard in the field to reduce caregiver burden in the setting of caring for individuals with AD/ADRD. Additionally, the study will integrate enhanced user support modules, i.e., gamifying, dashboarding, and social networking, to improve the Caregiver Training Program (CTP) experience.The study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial, in which two conditions will be investigated: 1) control condition in which the MHS alone is incorporated in the participant's daily care and 2) experimental condition in which the MHS+CTP is implemented into the daily care received by participants. The sample size will be a total of 50 patient-caregiver dyads, 25 in each condition. The study duration will be a 6-month intervention."
