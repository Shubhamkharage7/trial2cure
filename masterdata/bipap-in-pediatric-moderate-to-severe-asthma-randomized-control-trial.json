            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to study if starting bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), a mask that gives pressure to the lungs, works well for children in the emergency department with moderate to severe asthma attacks. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Whether initiation of BiPAP at the same time as continuous beta-agonist therapy (e.g., nebulized albuterol) will decrease how long children with moderate to severe asthma attacks need to receive continuous beta-agonist therapy.\n2. Whether early BiPAP changes how the lungs function in children with asthma attacks.\n3. Whether children receiving early BiPAP experience more issues or side effects than those children who do not.\n\nAll children will receive the usual treatment for asthma attacks; if they are still experiencing moderate to severe symptoms after the initial treatment, they will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will then wear a mask while they are receiving the continuous beta-agonist therapy. Some patients will receive BiPAP where pressure is given to the lungs and others will have a sham BiPAP mask where no pressure is given to the lungs. Study participants will wear the mask for 4 hours or until their treatment team feels they are ready to come off of the continuous beta-agonist therapy. Participants will receive more medications and decisions on going home or being admitted to the hospital will be decided as usual by their treatment team.\n\nResearchers will compare BiPAP versus Control (Sham BiPAP) groups to see if there is a difference in how long continuous beta-agonist therapy is needed, how the lungs are functioning, and number or type of side effects."
