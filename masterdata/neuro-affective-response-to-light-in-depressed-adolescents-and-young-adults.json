The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n* Does acute exposure to blue light (vs red light) stabilize emotional brain function in depressed individuals?\n* Are stabilizing effects of blue light (vs red light) stronger for blue light in adolescents than young adults?\n\nParticipants will complete:\n\n* A magnetic resonance imaging brain scan, in which we will examine the effect of blue versus red light on emotional brain function at rest and in response to rewards and losses.\n* A pupillometry test of sensitivity to blue vs red light\n* Clinical interviews and surveys\n* Screening measures for drug and alcohol use, MRI safety, and current pregnancy \\[if relevant\\]\n* Home sleep tracking with sleep diary and actigraphy for one week"

            "description": "The investigators will complete and submit a National Data Archive (NDA) Data Sharing Agreement within 6 months of the Notice of Award Issue date. Study staff will upload data dictionary to the NDA website, and will review the NDA data definition for the measures collected and define the project's data definition harmonized to that standard. For measures not yet defined, project staff will work with the NDA staff to define the measure following NDA best practices. Informed consent will be collected from study participants that allows for broad sharing of participants' de-identified data. Study staff will use participants' personally identifiable information to generate NDA Global Unique Identifier (GUID) numbers for study participants.\n\nAll data will be identified by GUID numbers only prior to submission to the NDA database. Data transfer procedures will be in accordance with all Institutional Review Board guidelines and federal regulations including HIPAA.",
            "timeFrame": "Raw data and data from descriptive/raw measures will be submitted on a semi-annual basis by July 15 and January 15 or the next business day. We also agree to submit to NDA the analyzed data yielded in our project (i.e., 12 months after accomplishment of each primary aim or objective, or immediately upon publication of the project's primary results, whichever occurs first). The PIs reserve the right to publish on the stated aims in a timely manner during the period of the award. Data will be available for addressing other research questions (i.e. which are not described in funded/pending grants) as soon as the data have been checked for accuracy (a period which will be no later than one year after the completion of each assessment). After the award has ended, the study investigators will continue to test the stated aims, but will also continue to solicit collaborations with outside researchers and to consider data requests in a timely manner.",
            "accessCriteria": "Outside investigators must submit a 1) proposal of the study aims, hypotheses, variables/constructs, analytic approach, and estimated duration of the proposed research; 2) resume, qualifications, source of financial support, and conflict of interest statement; 3)sign a data-sharing agreement and confidentiality statement that stipulates using the data for the stated research purposes only, securing the data using appropriate computer technology, not manipulating the data in order to identify participants, acknowledging the grant that supported data collection and management in publications/presentations, and destroying or returning the data after analyses are complete; 4) obtain approval from their Institutional Review Board, and along with other staff members who have access to the data, submit certificates of human subjects protection training.",
