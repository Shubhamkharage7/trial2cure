            "briefSummary": "Tobacco use disorder is a chronic, relapsing health condition that necessitates a chronic care approach. However, traditional smoking cessation treatment programs allocate nearly all their resources only to those smokers who are willing to set a quit date. This is problematic because few smokers are ready to set a quit date at any given time, and a smoker's stated intention to quit can change rapidly.\n\nOne novel potential treatment strategy is to foster practice quitting (PQ), defined as attempting to not smoke for a few hours or days, without pressure or expectation to permanently quit. Although a growing body of evidence supports the role of practice quitting in fostering permanent quit attempts and cessation, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding which treatment strategies should be used to engage smokers in practice quitting. The proposed study will test the role of PQ counseling vs. Motivational Interviewing (MI) counseling, and NRT sampling (four-week supply of nicotine lozenges and patches) vs. none.",

However, traditional smoking cessation treatment programs allocate nearly all their resources only to those smokers who are willing to set a quit date. This is problematic because few smokers are ready to set a quit date at any given time, and a smoker's stated intention to quit can change rapidly.\n\nOne novel potential treatment strategy is to foster practice quitting (PQ), defined as attempting to not smoke for a few hours or days, without pressure or expectation to permanently quit. Practice quitting represents a useful treatment exercise, as it offers a point of focus for behavior change coaching and goal-setting, with or without a planned quit date. The proposed study will test the role of PQ counseling vs. Motivational Interviewing (MI) counseling, and NRT sampling (four-week supply of nicotine lozenges and patches) vs. none. Specific aims are to:\n\nAim 1: Evaluate hypothesized mechanisms of action for PQ counseling and NRT sampling on incidence of quit attempts by 6 months among current smokers who are not planning to quit in the next 30 days (N=780). We will test the mediational effect of each variable on the relationship between PQ-focused treatment and incidence of quit attempts.\n\nAim 2: Test both the individual and combined roles of PQ counseling and NRT sampling on incidence of quit attempts by 6 months. We hypothesize that PQ counseling combined with NRT sampling will produce the highest rates of quit attempts through an additive relationship between these two treatment components."
