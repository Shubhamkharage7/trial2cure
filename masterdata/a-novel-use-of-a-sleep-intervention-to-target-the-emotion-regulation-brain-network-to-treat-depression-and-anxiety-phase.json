            "briefSummary": "This project is the second phase of a two-phased project investigating the impact of a proven sleep intervention, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on engagement of the emotion regulation brain network as a putative mechanistic target.",
            "detailedDescription": "Several lines of evidence suggest that insomnia contributes to emotionally distressing depressive mood symptoms through disruption of brain networks that regulate emotional functions. Of particular concern, insomnia is associated with an increased risk for suicide, even when accounting for the presence of other depressive symptoms. However, we do not yet know to what degree that the emotion regulation brain network is modified by the restoration of sleep, or whether the degree to which a sleep intervention engages these neural targets mediates reductions in depressive symptoms and suicidality.\n\nThis project is the second phase of a two-phased project investigating the impact of a proven sleep intervention, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on engagement of the emotion regulation brain network as a putative mechanistic target.\n\nThis project aims to extend the initial findings from the first phase (IRB-56961) to (1) confirm target engagement, defined as the treatment effect on increasing mPFC-amygdala connectivity, and/or decreasing amygdala reactivity during emotion reactivity and regulation paradigms, by testing the hypothesis that compared with a control condition, CBT-I participants will show significant change in the emotion regulation network targets that met the Go Criteria of the first phase in the direction of normalization, at the end of treatment, (2) examine the relationships of target engagement to treatment outcomes by study group, and (3) test whether emotion regulation network measures at baseline predict depressive symptom and suicidality reduction.\n\nParticipants will be 150 adults experiencing at least moderate sleep disturbances and who also have elevated anxious and/or depressive symptoms. Eligible participants will be randomized into either the Immediate Treatment group, which will receive six sessions of CBT-I over the eight weeks of treatment phase immediately after randomization, or the Monitored Control group, which will be offered the same CBT-I as the Immediate Treatment group upon completion of the 6-month follow-up session, approximately 7 months after randomization. Emotion distress and sleep disruption will be assessed prior to, and weekly during the eight weeks of treatment phase. CBT-I improves sleep patterns through a combination of sleep restriction, stimulus control, mindfulness training, cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep hygiene education. Using fMRI scanning, emotion regulation network neural targets will be assayed prior to and following completion of CBT-I treatment."

SC is an intervention that re-establishes the connection between the bed/bedroom with sleep to help develop a more consistent sleep/wake pattern. SR leads to higher quality sleep by reducing excessive time spent in bed to the actual amount of sleep, thereby creating mild sleep deprivation and increasing the homeostatic sleep drive.

Since these fluctuations are controlled mainly by vagal influences on the heart, RSA serves as a reliable metric for measuring parasympathetic activity.
