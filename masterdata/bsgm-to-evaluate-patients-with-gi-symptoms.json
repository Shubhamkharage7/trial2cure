The main question it aims to answer is which patterns or signals are associated with GI symptoms as measured by a body surface gastric mapping (BSGM) device. Participants will have their stomach activity recorded for up to 4 hours using the BSGM device and log real-time symptoms. Researchers will compare the recordings of healthy children and children with GI symptoms to define abnormal GI patterns.",
