            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies how well new adhesive-based sensors that stick to the skin (transcutaneous) work in detecting cancer-related long-term arm swelling (lymphedema). For many patients, lymphedema s painful, unsightly, and weakening. The early signs of lymphedema are hard to see, and sometimes it is only diagnosed by hospital equipment at larger centers. Treating lymphedema early is usually more successful than trying to treat in later stages. The adhesive-based sensors used in this study work by using techniques called photoplethysmography (PPG) and bioimpedance (BI). PPG is an optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in tissue. BI evaluates how tissue responds to an externally applied electrical current. This study may assist researchers in distinguishing participants with lymphedema in comparison to participants without lymphedema, and develop a way for patients to check for lymphedema at home.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Describe a unique signature using a combination of photoplethysmography and bioimpedance that distinguishes participants with lymphedema in comparison to participants without lymphedema at rest.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. In participants with lymphedema, describe a unique signature using a combination of photoplethysmography and bioimpedance that distinguishes the affected arm in comparison to the unaffected arm.\n\nII. Tolerability of the transcutaneous sensors during the participant data collection session.\n\nIII. Use a combination of photoplethysmography and bioimpedance to identify likely cut points for lymphedema in participants with lymphedema.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants undergo BI and wear \"watch-like\" sensors and undergo PPG at rest and while active (pedaling an exercise bike) on study."
