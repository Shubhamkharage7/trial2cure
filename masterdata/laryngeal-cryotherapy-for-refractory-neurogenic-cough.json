The new treatment involves the use of laryngeal cryotherapy which is the therapeutic freezing of tissue in the throat to numb the overactive sensory nerves in the throat which is believed to reduce cough symptoms. Patients will first undergo a flexible scope of the throat (laryngoscopy) to test for hypersensitive areas in the throat, then undergo the cryotherapy procedure in the office. After that, patients will be followed up in the clinic with the usual standard of care visits and undergo validated cough surveys to track their cough symptoms after the procedure. Possible side effects to this procedure are listed in detail below, and include temporary throat pain and coughing."
