            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Larazotide (AT1001) versus placebo in children and young adults 7 to \u226421 years of age who present with symptoms of Long COVID in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia. AT1001 (n=32) or placebo (n=16) will be administered orally four times a day (QID) for 21 days.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AT1001 for use in children and young adults with symptoms of Long COVID in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia. Eligible participants (N= 48) will be treated with AT1001 (n= 32) or matching placebo (n= 16) orally four times a day (QID) for 21 days. The study will consist of three phases:\n\nI. Baseline Screening Visit\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent and before starting treatment with Larazotide or placebo, an initial study visit will be conducted in person to confirm subject eligibility. Subjects will be asked complete a baseline Symptom Burden Questionnaire\u2122 for Long COVID (SBQ\u2122-LC) to assess organ involvement and symptom severity. During this screening visit, a venous blood sample will be obtained to, among other things, assess for Spike antigenemia and confirm subject eligibility. Additional study procedures occurring during the baseline/screening phase of this study are outlined in Section 6 of this protocol. Candidates who are found not to meet inclusion criteria, or those who meet \u22651 exclusion criteria will be terminated from the study and will therefore not be treated with AT1001 or placebo.\n\nII. Treatment phase\n\nPatients who meet inclusion criteria as stated in Section 4 of this protocol will be treated with AT1001 or matching placebo at a dose of 250 \u03bcg or 500 \u03bcg for 21 days. Drug dose will be determined by weight: patients \\<25.0 kg will receive 250 \u03bcg of Larazotide or Placebo, and patients \u226525.0 kg will receive 500 \u03bcg of Larazotide or Placebo. Randomization and initial dosing will occur on Visit 1 (Day 1). Visits will then occur on a weekly basis during the treatment phase and will consist of data and/or specimen collection. Visit 2 (Week 1) and Visit 3 (Week 2) will take place virtually and will not involve sample collection. Once the subject has completed 21 days of dosing, Visit 4 (Week 3) will take place in person and require the collection of blood, stool and nasal swabs. Further detail of study procedures during the treatment phase is provided in Section 6 of this protocol.\n\nIII. Follow-up phase Patients will have two additional virtual follow-up visits after completing their 21-day course of treatment with the study drug. The first follow up visit will occur one week after completing the study drug (ie. at week 4), and the second will occur one month later (ie. at week 8). Week 8 visit will serve as the end of study visit. Biospecimens will not be collected during the follow-up phase.\n\nSafety monitoring, including physical examination, vitals, and clinical laboratory testing will be performed during the screening phase and after completion of treatment. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded during the entire study.\n\nTotal duration of the participants' participation in the study is approximately 8 weeks (with 21 days treatment period). Total duration of the study is projected to be 12-36 months, dependent on enrollment timeline."

The effectiveness of AT1001 in controlling paracellular permeability as a tight junction regulator has been widely demonstrated in animal models both in vitro and in vivo. In MIS-C, prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract leads to release of zonulin, a biomarker of intestinal permeability, with subsequent trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 antigens into the bloodstream, leading to hyperinflammation (Yonker, et. al. 2021). Five children treated with AT1001 (through an Emergency Investigational New Drug request authorized by the FDA) displayed a decrease in plasma SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen levels, inflammatory markers, and symptom improvement superior to that achieved with the current standard of treatment for MIS-C (ie. immunoglobulin, systemic steroids) (Yonker, et. al. 2021) (Yonker, et. al. 2022)",
