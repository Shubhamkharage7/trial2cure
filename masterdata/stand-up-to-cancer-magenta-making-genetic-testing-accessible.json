To test the effects of online genetic education versus telephone genetic counseling on cancer-risk distress.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To test the effects of online genetic education versus telephone genetic counseling on testing completion rates.\n\nII. To evaluate the role of psychological and social variables in women's reactions to genetic testing for ovarian cancer risk with variable education strategies.\n\nIII. To consider the effects of variations of genetic education/counseling on genetic knowledge, satisfaction with the decision to undergo testing, and family communication.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video and receive genetic testing online test results report.\n\nARM B: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive genetic testing online test results report, and post-telephone genetic counseling.\n\nARM C: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive pre-telephone genetic counseling, genetic testing online test results report, and post-telephone genetic counseling.\n\nARM D: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive pre-telephone genetic counseling, and genetic testing online test results report."
