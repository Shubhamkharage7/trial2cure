            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase II study to determine the rate of stabilization or disease improvement from investigational decitabine/cedazuridine (INQOVI) treatment in subjects with BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 (BAP1) Cancer Predisposition Syndrome (CPDS) and subclinical, early-stage mesothelioma. Progression-free survival (PFS) will also be determined for treated subjects, and the treatment safety (toxicity) evaluated.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nMutations involving BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 (BAP1), a nuclear deubiquitinase involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and cellular energetics, have emerged as one of the most common somatic mutations in malignant mesotheliomas.\n\nGermline mutations involving BAP1 predispose individuals to mesotheliomas and a variety of other malignancies including melanomas, as well as lung, renal, gastric, breast, and hepatobiliary carcinomas.\n\nThe cancer penetrance of germline BAP1 mutations is nearly 100%, and most patients develop multiple synchronous or metachronous neoplasms.\n\nMesotheliomas are the most common malignancies diagnosed in subjects with BAP1 Cancer Predisposition Syndrome (CPDS).\n\nAlthough clinically evident mesotheliomas arising in the context of germline BAP1 mutations tend to be more indolent than more common, sporadic mesotheliomas, the natural history of early-stage mesotheliomas in subjects with BAP1 CPDS is unknown.\n\nPresently there are no established guidelines for the treatment of subclinical malignancies in subjects with BAP1 CPDS.\n\nEpigenetic aberrations including those related to the up regulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) induce genomic instability and enhance the growth and invasion of mesothelioma cells.\n\nOver-expression of DNMT1 also promotes the development of an immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment (TME).\n\nUp-regulation of DNMT1 is an early event during mesothelioma development, and levels of DNMT1 over-expression are associated with poor survival in mesothelioma patients.\n\nGenetic or pharmacologic inhibition of DNMT1 activity induces growth arrest, genomic stress, and apoptosis of mesothelioma cells.\n\nDNMT1 inhibition can reprogram TMEs thereby promoting more effective antitumor immune responses.\n\nDecitabine/cedazuridine is an oral DNMT inhibitor which is FDA approved for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).\n\nConceivably decitabine/cedazuridine therapy can arrest or delay the progression of subclinical/early-stage mesotheliomas in subjects with BAP1 CPDS.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo determine stabilization or disease improvement rates in participants with early-stage mesotheliomas arising in the context of BAP1 CPDS following decitabine/cedazuridine treatment.\n\nEligibility:\n\nParticipants with history of germline BAP1 mutations and histologically confirmed subclinical, early-stage mesotheliomas, with or without other early-stage BAP1-associated malignancies.\n\nThe extent of the disease insufficient to warrant approved front-line therapies (surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy).\n\nAge (Bullet) 18 years.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 1.\n\nWillingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment, minimally invasive thoracoscopy, and/or laparoscopy to assess treatment response.\n\nAdequate cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic function.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants with subclinical, early-stage mesotheliomas will undergo baseline imaging studies followed by minimally invasive thoracoscopy and/or laparoscopy to document the extent of the disease and obtain biopsies for pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints.\n\nParticipants will then begin oral decitabine/cedazuridine at a fixed dose and schedule (one capsule taken per day for three consecutive days during the first week of each four-week cycle) and will continue this regimen for six cycles.\n\nParticipants will then undergo repeat imaging and minimally invasive thoracoscopy and/or laparoscopy to determine treatment response and obtain tissue for response endpoints.\n\nParticipants who experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicities will be removed from the study.\n\nParticipants with stable disease or disease regression will be offered an additional 6 months of decitabine/cedazuridine treatment.\n\nApproximately 15 participants will be accrued to this trial."
