            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim of this study will be to assess the benefits of disease-targeted VR combined with linaclotide, compared to sham VR combined with linaclotide, in patients with IBS-C as defined by Rome IV criteria. The investigators hypothesize that compared to patients receiving sham VR and linaclotide, IBS-C patients receiving combination therapy with active VR and linaclotide will achieve statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in disease-targeted health-related quality of life while demonstrating improvements in global IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain.\n\nAims\n\n1. Evaluate changes in quality of life using the validated IBS-QoL (primary outcome);\n2. Evaluate global improvement in IBS symptoms using the validated IBS-SSS;\n3. Assess global improvement in IBS symptoms using the validated Abdominal Scoring system (11);\n4. Evaluate improvement in abdominal pain using a numerical rating system (NRS);\n5. Assess improvement in constipation using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS);\n6. Evaluate response to bloating using the validated Mayo bloating questionnaire (12);\n7. Assess response to coexisting psychological distress using the validated HADs questionnaire;\n8. Evaluate changes in work productivity using the validated WPAI."
