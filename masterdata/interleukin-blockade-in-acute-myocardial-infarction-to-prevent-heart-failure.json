            "briefSummary": "Patients who have a heart attack are at high risk for future development of heart failure ('weakening of the heart'). The researchers believe that the reaction of the heart muscle to injury (inflammation) during a heart attack may be contributing to the risk of heart failure. The current study will test the ability of an anti-inflammatory medicine (anakinra) to block the inflammation in the body during and after a heart attack.",
            "detailedDescription": "Anakinra (Kineret\u00ae) is a 'copy' of a naturally occurring protein made by the body to block inflammation. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved anakinra 100 mg daily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but anakinra is not currently approved for the treatment of heart disease. Anakinra is generally well-tolerated, but can cause pain or redness at the injection site and may affect risk of infections. The study team will work with participants to help avoid (or manage) any side effects throughout the study.\n\nThe study is designed to measure how well anakinra can protect participants from developing heart failure. Participation in this study will last approximately 1 year. During the first 2 weeks of the study, participants will receive an injection with anakinra or placebo (a liquid that looks like anakinra but contains no active medicine). While hospitalized, a nurse will do the injections for participants; upon discharge participants will be taught to give the remaining injections at home. Assignment to treatment with anakinra or placebo will be determined by randomization (like the \"flip of a coin\"). Approximately 84 people will participate in this study over the course of 4 years."
