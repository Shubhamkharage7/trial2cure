            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of health warnings on waterpipe smoking behavior in a real-world setting. The primary hypothesis is that hookah caf\u00e9 customers who are in the intervention (warning) arm will smoke less than customers who are in the control (no warning) arm, determined by differences in the boost in expired carbon monoxide from caf\u00e9 entry to after caf\u00e9 exit.",
            "detailedDescription": "Expired carbon monoxide is an objective biological marker of combustible tobacco smoking and is strongly correlated with the amount of smoke inhaled. In the intervention arm, warning messages will be displayed at various agreed-upon locations in the caf\u00e9, such as on hookah pipes, tables, countertops, walls, and menus. The goal is to maximize the potential for customers to be exposed to warnings. Participants will be patrons of the caf\u00e9 and will be recruited before entering the caf\u00e9. Participants will complete a brief survey and provide a breath sample to measure expired carbon monoxide. When leaving the caf\u00e9, they will complete another survey and provide a second breath sample."
