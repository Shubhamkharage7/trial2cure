            "briefSummary": "The long-term goal of this project is to improve the health and well-being of preterm infants and their parents. Although there is evidence to support positive multisensory interventions in the NICU, these interventions are often applied in an inconsistent manner, reducing their benefit. Through a rigorous and scientific process, we have developed a structured multisensory intervention program, titled Supporting and Enhancing NICU Sensory Experiences (SENSE), which includes specific doses and targeted timing of evidence-based interventions such as massage, auditory exposure, rocking, holding, and skin-to-skin care. The interventions are based on the infant's developmental stage and are adapted based on the infant's medical status and behavioral cues. The multisensory interventions are designed to be conducted during each day of NICU hospitalization by the parents, who are educated and supported to provide them. The proposed work aims to determine the effect of multisensory interventions on parent mental health, parent-child interaction, brain activity (amplitude integrated electroencephalography), and infant developmental outcomes through age 2 years, with specific attention to language outcome.",
            "detailedDescription": "Two-hundred fifteen parent-infant dyads of preterm infants born \u2264 32 weeks gestation and admitted to a Level IV NICU will be enrolled within 1 week of birth. Infants will be randomized to either the SENSE multisensory program or to the standard of care during the NICU stay. The SENSE program combines structured, easy-to-conduct, multisensory interventions with parent engagement to optimize outcomes in the complex medical environment of the NICU. Standardized assessments of parent mental health, infant neurodevelopment, and parent-child interaction will be conducted prior to NICU discharge and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, adjusted for prematurity. Differences between groups will be investigated. Brain activity during NICU stay, including in the presence and absence of different sensory exposures, will also be investigated. The expected outcome is that the SENSE multisensory program will have a positive effect on improving outcomes."

After enrollment, the SENSE program will be described to those parents assigned to the SENSE group. The use of nurses and therapists to aid the parent in conducting sensory interventions at the bedside will be described to those parents assigned to the standard of care group. All assessments in the NICU will be conducted at the infant's bedside by a certified (when necessary) and trained evaluator who is blinded to treatment assignment. All assessments following NICU discharge will be conducted by a different blinded evaluator (to decrease bias), who is trained and experienced with standardized childhood assessment.

Infant holding is supported, provided the infant can maintain physiological stability during handling. Parents can hold infants on mechanical ventilation, but holding is not encouraged during times when the infant is on oscillatory ventilation and/or when chest tubes are in place. Holding time may be restricted in infants \\<32 weeks due to temperature instability. Nurses and therapists foster parent participation through instruction on caregiving and developmentally appropriate interactions, but these are balanced with other priorities of care. With standard of care, there is no targeted and set amount of positive sensory exposure, and practices vary based on the comfort level of nurses, the medical team, and the parents.",

A sensory support team can fill in the gaps in intervention for infants in the SENSE group when parents are not available. The parent education materials identify specific doses of sensory inputs at each PMA. Feasibility has been established, with provision of an average of 155 hours of sensory exposures across NICU hospitalization.",
