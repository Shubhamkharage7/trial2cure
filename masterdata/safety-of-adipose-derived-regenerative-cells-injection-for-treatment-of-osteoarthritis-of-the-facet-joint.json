Have failed 3 months of conservative back pain care. (Conservative treatment regimens may include any or all of the following: initial rest, medications \\[e.g., anti-inflammatory, analgesics, narcotics/opioids, muscle relaxants\\], massage, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, activity modification, home-directed lumbar exercise program, and non- invasive pain control treatments or procedures).\n   3. Have undergone supervised physical therapy, such as daily walking routines, therapeutic exercises, and back education programs specifically for the treatment of low back pain.\n   4.

Current infection or prior history of spinal infection at the symptomatic level (e.g., discitis, septic arthritis, epidural abscess) or an active systemic infection.\n13. Severe and/or chronic pain conditions that may potentially confound facet joint symptom assessment, in the opinion of the investigator.\n14. Cauda equina syndrome.\n15. Receiving workman's compensation unless litigation is complete.\n16. Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the investigator, is unable to give Informed Consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse personal circumstances or lack of autonomy.

Subjects with documented history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last year.\n18. Subject is in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason. This includes completion of patient reported outcome instruments.\n19. Body habitus precluding adequate fluoroscopic visualization for the procedure or the procedure is physically impossible due to inability to inject the facet joint.\n20. Failed any component of the lumbar neurological exam at baseline (i.e., motor, sensory, or a reflex portion of the exam).\n21. The subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has a known immunologic or severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.).\n22. Clinically significant, in the opinion of the investigator, nerve pain (e.g., chronic radiculopathy) or clinically significant sacroiliac joint pain based on targeted, pre-specified physical examination, and, if deemed medically necessary, confirmed by anesthetic injection. If a previously performed anesthetic injection to confirm SI joint pain was performed up to 6 months prior to injection (with documentation indicating no SI joint pain), this does not need to be repeated at screening.\n23. Symptomatic lumbar intervertebral foraminal stenosis at the symptomatic level resulting in clinically significant spinal nerve root compression, in the opinion of the investigator.\n24. Symptomatic central vertebral canal, lateral recess stenosis or foraminal stenosis, in the opinion of the investigator.\n25. Severe instability where, in the opinion of the investigator, surgical interventions to stabilize the segment would be required.\n26. An acute fracture of the spine. Clinically compromised, in the opinion of the investigator, vertebral bodies at the symptomatic level due to current or past trauma, e.g., sustained a pathological fracture or multiple fractures of vertebrae.\n27. History of Chronic tobacco and nicotine usage.\n28. Insufficient amount of subcutaneous tissue to allow recovery of at least 100 mL of adipose tissue.\n29. Subjects who have document allergy to radiographic agents or sodium citrate or any \"caine\" type of local anesthetic.\n30. Subjects with radicular leg pain as determined by investigator",
