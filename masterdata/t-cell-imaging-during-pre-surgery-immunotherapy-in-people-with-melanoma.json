Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to find out whether neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab can kill melanoma tumors before surgery and prevent disease from coming back after surgery. This study also explores a new, experimental PET scan that images the immune system to see if it is related to treatment outcomes."
