            "briefSummary": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has a high incidence of mortality and significant morbidity, with mortality exceeding 30% in the first two days.The initial injury is related to increasing intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and neuronal injuries associated with the release of iron. Iron has been shown to increase the incidence of cerebral edema, ischemia, and formation of hydrocephalus. Deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), a hydrophilic chelator, creates a stable complex with free iron thus preventing the formation of iron related free radicals.\n\nThis trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of clinical deferoxamine for the treatment of aSAH for patients that are admitted to the hospital at the University of Michigan or Peking University Health Science Center. Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of 2 doses of Deferoxamine or placebo (saline). Information regarding the patients will be collected and followed for up to 6 months post discharge."
