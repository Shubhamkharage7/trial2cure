The purpose of this research study is to test if soft palate exercises using a hand help breathing device will help improve the ability of the soft palate to close the area between the throat and nose and help improve speech.",

A randomized, controlled trial will be conducted at a cleft craniofacial center at a tertiary children's hospital. Patients will be block randomized based on Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Scale (PWSS) score (3-6 or 7+) to Expiratory Muscle Strength Training for 6 to 8 weeks or no exercises. Patients with reductions in PWSS during this time will be further randomized to EMST maintenance training for 6 months or no exercises."
