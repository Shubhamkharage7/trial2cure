            "briefSummary": "This is a first-in survivor, single-arm pilot study with the goal of establishing evidence of feasibility and safety of a combined pharmacologic (metformin) and lifestyle intervention (using an existing digital platform) to prevent diabetes in prediabetic adult survivors of childhood cancer.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nThe primary aim of this proposal is to establish the feasibility and safety of a 24-week combined metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention among adult survivors with prediabetes (including a 12-week lifestyle alone run-in followed by 12-week combined intervention among survivors remaining prediabetic).\n\nPrimary endpoints of this trial will be adherence to 1) daily metformin administration and 2) completion of required core-curriculum of the lifestyle change intervention. Safety will be assessed using the Global Rating of Side Effects Burden\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nThe secondary aim is to assess preliminary evidence for efficacy of the combined metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention on glycemic control and insulin resistance. Glycemic control will be measured by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and insulin resistance measured by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and IGF- binding protein 1 (IGF-BP1; a measure of insulin sensitivity strongly correlated with euglycemic insulin clamp testing).\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\nTo assess preliminary evidence for efficacy of the combined metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention on weight, other anthropometric measures, blood pressure and lipid profile, physical activity (self-reported and as measured by accelerometer), frailty measures, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We will also assess diabetes development at future SJLIFE visits.\n\nTo assess measures of participation in the lifestyle change program as well as barriers to participation and medication adherence.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eligible subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled in a 12 week run-in period of the digital lifestyle intervention program. At the 12 week study visit, those who remain prediabetic will received metformin extended release daily, first at lower dose (500 mg/day) to minimize gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, bloating), then escalated to a maximum dose of 1000 mg/day at week 14. The digitally delivered lifestyle change program will include a core curriculum focused on diet quality, food types, exercise and behavioral strategies for goal setting, and self- monitoring."
