The ACHIEVE GREATER Center will involve three separate but related projects that aim to mitigate health disparities in risk factor control for three chronic conditions, hypertension (HTN, Project 1), heart failure (HF, Project 2) and coronary heart disease (CHD, Project 3), which drive downstream lifespan inequality. All three projects will involve the use of Community Health Workers (CHWs) to deliver an evidence-based practice intervention program called PAL2. All three projects will also utilize the PAL2 Implementation Intervention (PAL2-II), which is a set of structured training and evaluation strategies designed to optimize CHW competence and adherence (i.e., fidelity) to the PAL2 intervention program. The present study is Project 3 of the ACHIEVE GREATER Center."
