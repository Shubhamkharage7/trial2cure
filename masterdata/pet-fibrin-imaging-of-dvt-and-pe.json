            "detailedDescription": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most common causes of death in the United States, resulting in more than 100,000 deaths annually. Current diagnostic techniques rely on indirect measures of clot for diagnosis and therefore suffer from the problems of both under and overdiagnosis and cannot always be performed on patients with renal failure and lung disease. In this study, we will use the novel fibrin-specific probe 64CU-FBP8 (Copper-64 labeled fibrin binding probe 8) for PET imaging of fresh blood clots in PE and DVT. Our long-term goal is to establish a novel thrombus body scan (TBS) using 64CU-FBP8 for PET imaging to overcome the limitations of indirect venous thromboembolism diagnosis, and, with one single test, provide a total-body assessment of fresh intravascular clot."
