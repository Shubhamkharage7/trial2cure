A cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) study is the standard of care prior to dental implant placement. However, following closed sinus augmentation nothing is known as to the extent of augmentation in the medial to lateral (cross-sectional) dimension. Patients will have a low volume CBCT taken immediately postsurgically, and again at the six-month postoperative visit to determine the dimensional changes in the augmentation. These images will be compared to standard periapical radiographs at the same time points."
