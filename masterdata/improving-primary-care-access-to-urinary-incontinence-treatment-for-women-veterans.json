            "briefSummary": "The PURSUIT project aims to improve access to evidence-based nonsurgical UI treatment for women Veterans in the Southeast region of the United States using the most effective remote delivery modality. Using cluster randomization, the study will compare two models at the practice level: (1) the use of a practice facilitation toolkit with a mHealth UI modality alone and (2) the practice facilitation toolkit with a mHealth UI model combined with education on clinical pathways for consultation. Patient level outcomes related to UI symptom improvement will be compared. Patient and provider perceptions of factors that could influence future remote UI treatment scalability will also be assessed. All primary care practices will receive practice facilitation with a PURSUIT toolkit that includes (1) 1-2 visits with a practice facilitator; (2) mobile-health or mHealth application training (MAT); 3) online resource hub; and (4) health information technology (HIT) assistance. PURSUIT's future goal is to disseminate the most effective modality for delivering nonsurgical UI treatment for women Veterans nationally within the VHA.",
            "detailedDescription": "PURSUIT aims to recruit 62 practices to participate in the trial implementation at 50 practices. Specifically, Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) from VA Integrated Service Network (VISN) 7 will be targeted, spanning the states of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. The project will focus on VISN 7 CBOCs, serving at least 50 women Veterans with primary care services, will be recruited through connections with local women's health providers. The team estimates outreach to approximately 50,000 women Veterans and estimates that 30 percent (n=15,000) of these women will have UI symptoms, and, among those, 15 percent (n=2,500) will participate."
