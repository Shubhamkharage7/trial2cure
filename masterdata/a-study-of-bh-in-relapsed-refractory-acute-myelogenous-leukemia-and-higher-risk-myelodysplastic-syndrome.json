Approximately 50 participants may be enrolled in Phase 1 of the study.\n\nPhase 1b (Dose Expansion) will follow Phase 1 to further understand the relationships among dose, exposure, toxicity, tolerability, and clinical activity. Up to 24 participants may be enrolled in Phase 1b of the study.\n\nThe dose expansion part (Phase 1b) will be followed to understand the relationships among dose, exposure, toxicity, tolerability and clinical activity. Up to 24 participants may be enrolled in Phase 1b of the study.",
