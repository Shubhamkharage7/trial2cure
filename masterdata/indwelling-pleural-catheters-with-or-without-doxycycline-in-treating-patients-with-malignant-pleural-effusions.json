Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are commonly used to treat pleural effusions (build-up of fluid in the lungs). Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is also used to treat pleural effusions. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding doxycycline to the use of an IPC can lead to shorter treatment times with IPCs.",

We will also analyze time to catheter removal for any cause and conduct pre-specified secondary analyses to evaluate the effect of fluid drainage amount (i.e., how much was being put out from the indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) the day of IPC placement and on the day of doxycycline instillation) and size of residual effusion as assessed by chest x-ray (CXR) (on day of IPC placement and day of doxycycline instillation) on time to catheter removal.",
