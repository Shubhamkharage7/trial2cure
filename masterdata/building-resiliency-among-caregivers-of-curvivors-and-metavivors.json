Randomization means that a participant is placed into a group by chance.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last about 180 days.\n\nIt is expected about 96 people made up of 48 patients and 48 caregivers will take part in this research study.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is supporting this research by providing funding."
