            "briefSummary": "This study is researching an experimental drug called ALN-PNP (called \"study drug\"). This is a first in human study. The study drug is not approved by any public health agency such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any kind of treatment.\n\nPart A is focused on healthy participants. Part B of the study is focused on participants who are known to have NAFLD and a specific variant of the PNPLA3 gene. The aim of the study is to see how safe, tolerable and effective the study drug is.\n\nPart A is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)\n* Explore impact of Japanese ethnicity on safety and PK (pharmacokinetics, or study of what the body does to the drug) of single doses of ALN-PNP over time\n\nPart B is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug\n* How the study drug works to change liver fat content in NAFLD\n* How much study drug and study drug metabolites (byproduct of the body breaking down the study drug) are in your blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)\n* Better understanding of the study drug and NAFLD"
