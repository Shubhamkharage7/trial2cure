The meditation app of interest is the Healthy Minds Program (HMP). The HMP app provides training in four pillars of well-being (Awareness, Connection, Insight, Purpose) through a combination of podcast-style didactic material and guided meditation practices.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive an initial coaching call with a team member. Participants will also be randomly assigned to receive or not receive access to email-based support. All participants with receive text messages encouraging them to engage in the practices taught in the app.\n\nParticipants will complete a set of questionnaires at baseline and post-test (following the 4-week intervention period). Questionnaires and items will be selected from the set of questionnaires included in this application. The average length of time to complete questionnaires will be within 15 to 30 minutes. Participants will also receive short daily surveys."
