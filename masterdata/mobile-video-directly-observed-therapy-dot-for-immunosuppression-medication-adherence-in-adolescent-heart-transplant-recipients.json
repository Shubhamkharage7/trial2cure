Herein, we propose an innovative approach to promote medication adherence and improve patient and graft outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Few interventions have proven to be successful in promoting medication adherence and impacting short- and long-term post-transplant outcomes in adolescent heart transplant (HT) recipients. Improving adherence is a persistent challenge with youth experiencing chronic health conditions, especially among adolescent transplant recipients. Adolescent organ transplant recipients experience unique challenges remaining adherent to the complex post-transplant regimen, with rates of non-adherence as high as 40% to 60%. In this population, medication non-adherence remains a primary cause of late acute rejection (LAR) episodes, increased number of hospitalizations, graft failure, and patient mortality. Herein, we propose an innovative approach to promote medication adherence and improve patient and graft outcomes."
