            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well mosunetuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin works in treating patients with grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Giving mosunetuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin may kill more cancer cells in patients with relapsed or refractory grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of mosunetuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). (Safety lead-in) II. Estimate the complete response (CR) rate to mosunetuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin in R/R FL patients. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the overall response rate (ORR), time to first CR, time to best response, duration of response (DOR), duration of response among CR (DORC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL) in R/R FL patients treated with mosunetuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin.\n\nII. Evaluate the toxicity of mosunetuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin for R/R FL. III. Examine the use of tocilizumab for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in R/R FL patients treated with mosunetuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess baseline and on-treatment biomarkers, and evaluate association with anti-tumor activity and safety.\n\nII. Examine the type and incidence of CD20 gene mutations/ downregulation at relapse in R/R FL patients treated with mosunetuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive polatuzumab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive mosunetuzumab subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of remaining cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 8-17 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection and computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then for 3 years."
