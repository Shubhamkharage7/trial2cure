This study aims to measure the anxiety of patients as they arrive before their procedure, when parting from their parents for transportation to the procedure room, and when anesthesia is provided. Compliance during anesthesia induction will also be monitored. Participants will be randomly placed into to one of two groups. Group 1 will receive standard care from a Certified Child Life Specialist prior to their surgery. Group 2 will receive standard care from a Certified Child Life Specialist and distraction with a novel virtual reality software program.",

This study aims to specifically monitor and measure the anxiety of patients as they arrive at the preoperative suite, when parting from their parents for transportation to the procedure room, and at induction of anesthesia. Compliance during anesthesia induction will also be monitored. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 will receive standard care during their surgery. Group 2 will receive standard care and distraction with a novel virtual reality software program. We hypothesize that anxiety will be reduced, and anesthesia compliance will improve for participants in Group 2."
