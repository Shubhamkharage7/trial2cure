            "detailedDescription": "Human breast milk has been widely studied in babies, as have certain elements of breast milk in adults. None of those studies, however, address the effectiveness of raw breast milk in adults. Furthermore, Adventa Bioscience's proprietary process of converting breast milk into a powder which is then encapsulated has not been studied. Early customers of the breast milk capsule, Trulacta, have experienced incredible results; from increased sleep, reduced pain and bloating, and reduction or elimination of symptoms caused by severe diseases. An early analysis of Trulacta in partnership with a company 4Life, has shown that the milk powder in Trulacta has a high immunologic activity level with Natural Killer cells in controlled environment.\n\nThe purpose of this non-randomized, prospective clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of 90 days of supplementation with a human breast milk supplement on sleep quality, low-grade chronic inflammation, immuno-modulation, metabolic health, and epigenetic aging."
