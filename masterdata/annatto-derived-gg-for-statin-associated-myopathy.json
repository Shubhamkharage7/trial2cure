            "detailedDescription": "Statins are widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering oral drugs. The majority of reported adverse effects due to statin include muscle pain, weakness, cramp, and tiredness. CoQ10 supplementation has been widely used to reduce statin-related muscle complaints. Several human studies have been reported with inconsistent effects of CoQ10 on statin-related symptoms. This study is to investigate the role of 3-month annatto-derived geranylgeraniol (GG) in statin-related muscle outcomes in humans. Qualified subjects will be matched by age, gender, and body weight, and then randomly assigned to a no GG group, a low GG dose group, or a high GG dose group. The outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Muscle-associated measurements will be recorded using subject questionnaires (also follow-up after 3 and 6 months), muscle performance results, and blood samples. We will monitor the safety of subjects after 3 months. Food intake, physical activity, and medication changes will be recorded at baseline and after 3 months. All data will be analyzed statistically."
