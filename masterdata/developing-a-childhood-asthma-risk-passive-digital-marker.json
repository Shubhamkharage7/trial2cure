Current prognostic approaches using risk-score based tools have poor-to-modest accuracy, are impractical, and have limited evidence of efficacy in clinical settings and hence are not widely used in practice.\n\nThe objective of the study is to determine the usability, acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the childhood asthma passive digital marker (PDM) among pediatricians. The study will include practicing pediatricians within the IU Health Network."
