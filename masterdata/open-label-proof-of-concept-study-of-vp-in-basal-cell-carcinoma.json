Dosing will commence in a single target lesion. Once a lesion is observed to be fully necrotic (Part 1, Part 2; Cohorts 1-2 only), treatment of that lesion stops, and treatment of subsequent target lesions (up to 2 total) may continue on Day 1 of the following week. In Part 2, Cohorts 4 and 5, treatment of a second target lesion begins on W2D1 (not based on status of necrosis of target lesion 1)."

Clinically significant laboratory values, as assessed by the investigator, for the tests listed in the Schedule of Assessments, including:\n\n   1. serum creatinine \\>1.5\u00d7 the upper limits of normal and\n   2. serum tryptase concentration \\>11.4 ng/mL\n6. Chronic medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator(s) would interfere with the performance of the study or would place the subject at undue risk, such as, but not limited to:\n\n   1. Uncontrolled infection or infection requiring antibiotics\n   2. Uncontrolled cardiac failure: Classification III or IV New York Heart Association\n   3. History of cerebrovascular or cardiac disorders, or subjects at particular risk of sequelae following a short hypotensive episode, including subjects with systolic BP \\<110 mmHg and/or diastolic BP \\<70 mmHg at screening or Day 1\n   4. Uncontrolled systemic or gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions\n   5. Known bone marrow dysplasia\n   6. History of positive tests for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or active hepatitis B or C\n   7. History of systemic autoimmune disease requiring anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy within 3 months prior to Day 1, with the following exceptions:\n\n   i. Subjects with a history of autoimmune thyroiditis are eligible provided the subject requires only thyroid hormone replacement therapy and disease has been stable for \u22651 year\n\n   ii. Subjects with well-controlled type I diabetes (in the opinion of the investigator) are eligible\n\n   h. Known mast cell activation syndrome, mastocytosis, or chronic idiopathic urticaria\n7. Known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medication\n8. Elective surgery within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit, during the study, or 4 weeks after the treatment period\n9. Evidence of current chronic alcohol or drug abuse\n10. Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such a study within 4 weeks of the screening visit\n11. In the investigator's opinion, evidence of unwillingness, or inability to follow the restrictions of the protocol and complete the study\n12. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n\nBCC Lesion Exclusion Criteria\n\n1. Recurrent or previously treated lesions\n2. Lesions within 1 cm of the eyelids or lips, or on the hands, feet, ears, nose, and genitalia\n3. Histological evidence of any other tumor in the biopsy specimen\n4. Histological evidence of infiltrative, desmoplastic, sclerosing, or morpheaform BCC subtypes in the biopsy specimen\n5. Medium- and high-risk basal cell carcinomas as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or Mohs Appropriate Use Criteria (ie, BCCs eligible for Mohs surgery).\n\n   TARGET LESION EXCLUSION ONLY:\n6. For subjects with severe stasis dermatitis, target BCC lesions may not be on the lower extremities\n7. Within 2 cm of the target BCC lesion(s):\n\n   1. Treatment with the following topical agents within the 12 weeks prior to the screening visit: aminolevulinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, corticosteroids, diclofenac, imiquimod, ingenol mebutate\n   2. Treatment with surgical excision, or curettage within the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit\n   3. Evidence of dermatological disease or confounding skin condition that may interfere with clinical evaluation (ie, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, propensity to form keloids or hypertrophic scarring)\n   4. Use of topical immunomodulators during study\n8. Within 5 cm of the target BCC lesion(s): history of any skin cancer, except for other currently identified target and nontarget BCC lesions\n9. Target BCC lesion is in the area of prior resurfacing procedure with CO2 laser or any photodynamic and phototherapy treatment within the 3 months prior to the screening visit",
