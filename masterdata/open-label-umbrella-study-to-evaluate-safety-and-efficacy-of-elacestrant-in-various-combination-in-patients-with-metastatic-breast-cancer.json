The Phase 2 part of the trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the various combinations in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a multicenter, Phase 1b/2 trial. The Phase 1b aims at selecting the RP2D dose, defined as a dose that is associated with less than 33% of patients experiencing a DLT of elacestrant when administered in combination with alpelisib, everolimus, palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib, that is, \u22641 patient experiencing a DLT out of 6 DLT evaluable patients. For each combination, this phase will have between 1 and 3 cohorts of 6 DLT-evaluable patients each. The total number of DLT-evaluable patients in all the combinations will vary between 24 and 72.\n\nThe Phase 2 part of the trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the various combinations in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer.\n\nThe treatment arms will be:\n\n* Arm A: 50 patients: elacestrant with alpelisib;\n* Arm B: 50 patients: elacestrant with everolimus;\n* Arm C: 60 patients (30 patients in each combination): elacestrant with either abemaciclib or ribociclib;\n* Arm D: 90 patients (30 patients in each combination): elacestrant with either palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib\n* Arm E: 60 patients: elacestrant with capivasertib\n\nPhase 1b will have a total of 90 patients, while Phase 2 will have 310 patients for all treatment arm combinations."
