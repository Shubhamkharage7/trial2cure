Exceptions are allowed for rituximab and methotrexate for patients enrolling Arm A as long as patients have recovered from side effects.\n* Patient has received external beam radiation therapy to the CNS within 28 days of the first dose of the study drug.\n* Patient has an active concurrent malignancy requiring active therapy.\n* The patient has been treated with radio- or toxin-immunoconjugates within 70 days of the first dose of the study drug.\n* Patient weighs \\<40kg\n* Patient is allergic to components of the study drug.\n* Patient is known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Patient is known to have a history of active or chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) as determined by serologic tests.\n* Severe, active medical co-morbidity such as unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, significant abnormalities on electrocardiogram (EKG), uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias or valvular disease; active infection, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other respiratory illness, hepatic insufficiency, known pre-existing immunodeficiency as seen in organ transplant recipients, renal failure with CrCl \\<60 mL/min.\n* Patient has a life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the subject\"s safety or put the study outcomes at undue risk.\n* Patient has large pleural or ascetic fluid collection.\n* Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.\n* Prior severe allergic reaction to any of the study drugs that cannot be resolved with medication.\n* Patient has undergone prior allogenic stem cell transplant (autologous stem cell transplant is NOT an exclusion).\n\nArm Outpatient MTX Therapy in times of COVID-19:\n\nPatients eligible for this arm must not meet any of the following criteria:\n\n* Patients with SCNSL requiring treatment for extra-CNS disease are excluded.\n* Patients weighing \\<40kg\n* Inadequate bone marrow and organ function shown by:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\</= 0.5 x 10\\^9/L\n  * Platelets \\</= 75 x 10\\^9/L\n  * Hemoglobin (Hgb) \\</= 8 g/dL\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\>/= 3 times the upper limit of normal\n  * Serum bilirubin \\>/= 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; or total bilirubin \\>/= 3 times the upper limit of normal with direct bilirubin outside of the normal range in patients with well documented Gilbert Syndrome\n  * Creatinine \\>/= 1.3 mg/dL\n* Patients allergic to components of the study drug.\n* Patients with severe, active medical co-morbidity such as unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, significant abnormalities on electrocardiogram (EKG), uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias or valvular disease; active infection, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other respiratory illness, hepatic insufficiency, known pre-existing immunodeficiency as seen in organ transplant recipients, renal failure with creatinine \\>/= 1.3 mg/dL.\n* Patients with a life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the subject's safety or put the study outcomes at undue risk\n* Patients with large pleural or ascetic fluid collection\n* Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control during the period of therapy and for 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. Men who are sexually active must agree to use highly effective contraception during the period of therapy and for 3 months after the last dose\n\nArm E:\n\nPatients eligible for this arm must not meet any of the following criteria:\n\n* Weight \\<40kg\n* Prior severe allergic reaction to methotrexate or glucarpidase that cannot be resolved withmedication.\n* Severe, active medical co-morbidity such as unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, significant abnormalities on electrocardiogram (EKG), uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias or valvular disease; active uncontrolled infection, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other respiratory illness, hepatic insufficiency\n* Patient has a life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunctionthat, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the subject's safety or put the study outcomes at undue risk.\n* Presence of large pleural or ascetic fluid collection.\n* Treatment with MTX dose greater than 8 g/m2",
