            "briefSummary": "Currently, optical and pharmacological interventions have been developed to prevent the progression of childhood myopia. However, no myopia control strategy has been shown to have complete efficacy in controlling myopia progression in children. One possible reason is that risk factors contributing to the development of myopia were not controlled in previous clinical studies including time outdoors and near vision behaviour. This study aims to quantify time spent outdoors and near vision behavior in myopic children and its impact on myopia control efficacy. The outcomes of this study will guide clinicians on risk management and improve responses to existing treatments for progressive myopia."
