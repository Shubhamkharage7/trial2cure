The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* whether continuous renal NIRS monitoring is feasible;\n* whether NIRS monitoring results in higher nursing and parent/caregiver satisfaction than current standard monitoring; and,\n* whether participants who develop CoA will spend a smaller proportion of time within the normal range than patients who do not have CoA.\n\nParticipants will be observed through continuous renal oxygenation monitoring with NIRS."
