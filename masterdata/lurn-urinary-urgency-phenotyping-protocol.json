            "detailedDescription": "LURN is pursuing deeper phenotyping of patients with urinary urgency and UUI using distinct, but related, projects. The Urinary Urgency Phenotyping Protocol is the overarching effort, and will comprise five integrated projects. Project A, the Observational Cohort, will be a large-scale accrual of male and female participants with urinary urgency and age-matched controls without any LUTS. Standardized clinical data, comprising information typically gathered at the patient clinic encounter, self-report symptom, urologic and non-urologic data, and biosamples will be collected. Using this group of participants, subsets will be identified for more focused and in-depth studies of urinary urgency and urgency incontinence. This more focused effort will be conducted as Project B: the Central Sensitization Study; Project C: the Physical Activity and Sleep Study; Project D: the Organ-Based Study; and Project E: the Qualitative Assessment of Patients with Urinary Urgency Study."
