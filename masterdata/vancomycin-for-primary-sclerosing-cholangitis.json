Levels of serum ALP obtained at 6,12,and 18 months of OV treatment, and at 3, and 6 months post OV treatment will be compared to those obtained at baseline (month 0), and with values at the same study time points in the placebo arm.\n\nB. Determine if OV stabilizes or improves liver fibrosis assessed by LSM using TE. Liver stiffness will be measured at 6, 12, and 18 months of OV treatment, and at 6 months post OV treatment, and values will be compared to those obtained at baseline (month 0), and with values in the placebo arm.\n\nC. Determine the changes in the intestinal microbiota in relation to the use of OV, and study the correlation between the changes in the intestinal microbiota and the changes in: 1) liver enzymes, particularly serum ALP, and 2) liver stiffness, assessed by LSM using TE.\n\nD. Determine if changes in proinflammatory cytokines (TGF-\u03b2, IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, etc.) predict response to OV. Cytokines will be measured at baseline, months 6, 12, 18, and at 3, and 6 months post OV treatment, if the study is positive."
