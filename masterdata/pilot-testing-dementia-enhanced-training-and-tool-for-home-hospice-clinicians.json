The investigators expect family caregivers of clinicians in the intervention group will report less caregiver burden (primary outcome) than caregivers of clinicians in the control group. The investigators expect that, compared to clinicians in the control group (usual care), clinicians in the intervention group (receive the training and use the tool) will demonstrate more knowledge of dementia-related caregiving issues (secondary outcomes). In exploratory analyses, the investigators expect family caregivers will report greater self-efficacy and preparedness, and that patients of clinicians in the intervention group will experience fewer live discharges than family caregivers of patients of clinicians in the control group.",
            "detailedDescription": "For this aim, the investigators will conduct a randomized pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the training and tool in clinical practice compared to usual care with 40 clinicians (20 intervention, 20 control) and 160 Black and white FCG (80 intervention, 80 control). The investigators will also determine preliminary efficacy of the training and tool. Outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, reducing FCG burden (primary outcome), improving clinician knowledge and confidence (secondary outcomes) and increasing FCG preparedness and self-efficacy."

The remaining 8 teams will be adaptively randomized as they enter the study to maintain balance between the number of Black and White family caregiver participants in each arm. Family caregivers will be assigned to the same group (intervention or control) as the clinician they are assigned to.
