            "briefSummary": "This research study is being done to develop a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that can enable severely paralyzed individuals to interact with the world through direct brain-control of a computer. This technology is named MindEx (for Mind Extender). It utilizes four implanted \"chips\" in the human brain from which investigators can record brain activity during subjects' thoughts and decode meaningful information from this activity to be used as control signals for a computer, a laptop, or a tablet. The use of four brain regions is a significant differentiating feature and scientific innovation of this study over much prior work in this space, that typically derived control signals from one, or sometimes two brain regions. The brain regions to be used here can allow the decode of multiple variables simultaneously, including not just moment-to-moment position, but also high-level goals, intentions, decisions, scene comprehension, and error-related signals involved in natural human behavior. The research is being done through a prospective, longitudinal, single-arm early feasibility study to examine the safety and effectiveness of using MindEx to provide the user an intuitive, efficient, and accurate ability to control multiple applications on a computer interface such as a word processor, a paint application, or to play simple video games. Such versatility could greatly improve the autonomy and quality of life of severely paralyzed individuals. Two subjects will be enrolled, each implanted with MindEx for a period of at least 53 weeks and up to 313 weeks. The study is expected to take at least one year and up to six years in total."

These will be in 1) prefrontal cortex, a brain area involved in scene comprehension, action selection, and error signaling, 2) premotor cortex, a brain area involved in planning ongoing and upcoming actions, 3) posterior parietal cortex, a brain area involved in processing sensory-to-motor transformations during movements, and 4) primary motor cortex, responsible for controlling movement. The pair of electrode arrays in each NeuroPort Multi-Port Array connect to a single percutaneous pedestal attached to the skull during a surgical procedure. Following recovery from the surgical placement, subjects will participate in study sessions up to 5 times a week. They will learn to use thought to control applications on a computer, a laptop, or a tablet.",

Each MultiPort can have a total of 128 active channels (capable of transmitting neural signals to the percutaneous connector) across the two arrays. In our design, we will split active channels evenly between the two arrays resulting in 64 active channels per array.
