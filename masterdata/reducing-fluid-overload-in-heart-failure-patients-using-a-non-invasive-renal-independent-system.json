            "detailedDescription": "This study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the AquaPass System in reducing fluid overload in patients with decompensated heart failure and chronic kidney disease stage 2-3 who are not responding adequately or resistant to current medical treatment.\n\nThe study checks if patients' fluid loss as a result of taking diuretics medications is improved when using AquaPass in parallel to this treatment.\n\nThe evaluation of success is done by comparing participants' weight before and after the use of the AquaPass system, to evaluate if the system effectively removes excess fluids.\n\nPatients will also have blood and urine tests every morning to check how well their kidneys and heart are functioning.\n\nThe first visit will be observation only, without using AquaPass. This will serve as the baseline data. The investigators will compare the data of the AquaPass treatments with this baseline to measure the effectiveness of the system in removing access fluids."
