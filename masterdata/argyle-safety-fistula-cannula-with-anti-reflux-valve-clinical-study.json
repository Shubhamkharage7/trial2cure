            "detailedDescription": "The study will be performed at up to 5 US hemodialysis clinics.\n\nQualified patients who choose to participate and sign informed consent will be enrolled in the study. The investigational sites chosen to participate in this study will be trained on the insertion procedure using plastic fistula cannulas according to established curriculum. A combination of didactic training followed by insertion using a cannulation arm will be conducted. Cannulation on consented subjects will begin after the inserter demonstrates proficiency on the cannulation arm. Proficiency definitions are outlined in the protocol. After two supervised (by Medtronic and/or dedicated, trained super user) successful cannulations on consented subjects, the clinician will be permitted to cannulate without supervision.\n\nData supporting the primary, secondary, and exploratory objectives will be captured following thirty-six (36) hemodialysis sessions for each enrolled subject.\n\nCannulations will be performed by a minimum of five different clinicians at up to 5 dialysis clinic sites.\n\nThe investigational sites chosen to participate in this study will be trained on the insertion procedure using plastic fistula cannulas for a pre-determined period and according to established curriculum. A combination of didactic training followed by insertion using a cannulation arm will be conducted. After two supervised (by Medtronic and/or dedicated, trained super user) successful cannulations on consented subjects, the clinician will be permitted to cannulate without supervision and the data collection for the primary and secondary objectives will begin. Hemodialysis sessions will be performed, according to the investigator's prescription, throughout the duration of the study. Dialysis adequacy will be verified at baseline and during the mid-week session on weeks 1, 3, 6 and 12. Other than the blood sampling, there are no study-specific procedures, other than cannulation with the Argyle\u2122 Safety Fistula Cannula with Anti-Reflux Valve, that will be required."
