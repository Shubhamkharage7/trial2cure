Patients undergoing alloHCT will receive HCT in a US transplant center and be reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) using well-established CIBMTR report forms and data collection procedures as well as a study-specific supplemental form. Data on the historical non-HCT controls will be collected at 14 US academic centers. These centers will provide data on all consecutive patients with PMF, post-ET MF, or post-PV MF referred to their institutions between 2000 and 2012.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients with primary MF (PMF), post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) MF, or post-polycythemia vera (PV) MF, with intermediate-2 or high-risk disease as determined by the DIPSS, and aged \u226555 at the time of DIPSS assessment are eligible for this study. For the allogeneic HCT arm of the HLA-Matched Donor HCT Study, donors must be either 6/6 HLA-matched related donors, defined by Class I (HLA-A and -B) intermediate resolution or high resolution DNA-based typing and Class II (HLA-DRBI) at high resolution DNA-based typing (but not monozygotic twins), OR an 8/8 HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 at high resolution DNA-based typing matched unrelated donors; both peripheral blood stem cells and bone marrow grafts are allowed, and all conditioning regimen intensities and graph versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens are allowed. For the Haploidentical Donor Study, donors must be haploidentical.\n\nThis study will target accrual of 650 patients receiving alloHCT, including approximately 225 receiving myeloablative conditioning. Participating centers are expected to provide data for approximately 2,400 patients to form the non-HCT historical control cohort."
