            "briefSummary": "The Hispanic/Latinx community (hereafter Hispanic) is the country's second-largest racial/ethnic group, accounting for 19.1% of the total population. However, they remain one of the most underserved populations with suboptimal access to healthcare and screening services due to low income, lack of health insurance, perceived discrimination, language barriers, and limited health literacy. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality with 1.8 million annual deaths worldwide, with Hispanic patients known to have lower survival rates compared with non-Hispanic whites. Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) decreases this mortality rate of lung cancer by 20%. Yet many Latinx patients who are eligible for lung cancer screening are still falling through the cracks which prevents patients the ability to detect lung cancer early. This study will test and compare the effect of a multi-level intervention on ordering LDCT within 4 months after patient enrollment to those in an Enhanced Usual Care. Our proposed intervention includes:\n\n* Primary care provider notifications of patients' LCS eligibility;\n* Patients' education;\n* Patients' referral to financial navigation resources;\n* Patients' reminder to discuss LCS during primary care provider (PCP) visit."
