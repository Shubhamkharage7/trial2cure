They will complete 3 rounds of 3-week daily diaries followed by an intermittent survey at 12 week intervals for the next 33 weeks. The delayed intervention group will receive 12 weeks of attention, complete 1 round of 3-week daily diaries followed by an intermittent survey, then complete 12 weeks of CuRB-IT, and complete 2 rounds of 3--week daily diaries followed by an intermittent survey at 12-week intervals for the next 18 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purposes of the delayed-intervention randomized clinical trial (N=266) are to:\n\nCare-Resistant Behavior Internet Training (CuRB-IT).\n\n1. examine the efficacy of CuRB-IT in increasing the self-efficacy of family caregivers of persons living with dementia to handle care-resistant behaviors (CRB);\n2. further test the efficacy of CuRB-IT in improving caregivers coping strategies (a) among the experimental (immediate-intervention group) as compared to the control (delayed-intervention group) (between groups) and (b) within-person from pre- to post- intervention;\n3. examine intervention decay at 3- and 6-months post intervention to determine performance of intervention and inform scheduling of booster sessions;\n4. assess the efficacy of the CuRB-IT intervention in preventing onset of poor coping strategies by family caregivers;\n5. test the hypothesized mechanism of action that increased CRB self-efficacy and use of CuRB-IT problem-focused coping strategies mediate the relationship between CRB stress appraisal and caregiving activities."

The storage of our research product here will permit many researchers free access to our data in perpetuity. Our archived study will principally include our original (but anonymized) databases as well as any \"cleaned,\" computed, and recoded measures that we produce for or is produced by our analysis. Our project deliverables will include the quantitative databases, a well-documented statistical packaging (SPSS) system file with variable and values labels, a data user guide that includes all SPSS and related computational and analysis syntax code, summary statistics (frequency distributions, means, etc.) for all quantitative variables, a copy of applicable subject consent form, human subject application and the institutional review board (IRB) approval letter, and a blank copy of the survey instrument and interviewer guide.",
