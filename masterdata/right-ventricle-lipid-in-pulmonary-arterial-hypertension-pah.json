            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that abnormal lipid metabolism in PAH leads to delivery of fatty acids in excess of RV oxidative capacity, resulting in steatosis and lipotoxicity. The objectives of the study are to: 1) Define the relationships between RV steatosis, RV function, and exercise capacity; 2) Identify mechanistic drivers of RV steatosis including BMPR2 expression and lipid metabolism; 3) Examine lipid metabolism in PAH skeletal muscle as a potential driver of reduced functional capacity.\n\nIn Aim 1 (clinical relevance) the investigators will measure RV and left ventricle (LV) lipid in participants with heritable, idiopathic, and scleroderma- associated PAH. Participants will undergo the 6-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and will be followed for clinical events. A subgroup will undergo repeat MRS at four timepoints over three years to determine the natural history of steatosis.\n\nIn Aim 2 (mechanism), the investigators will perform metabolomic/lipidomic profiling of peripheral and coronary sinus plasma and measure BMPR2 expression to identify potential drivers of steatosis.\n\nIn Aim 3 (specificity), the investigators will perform MRS on skeletal muscle in Aim 1 participants and matched healthy controls to clarify the systemic effects of lipid metabolic defects in PAH."
