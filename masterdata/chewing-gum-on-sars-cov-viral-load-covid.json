CTB-ACE2, with efficient binding to both GM1 and ACE2 receptors, effectively blocks binding of the spike protein and viral entry into human cells. Oral epithelial cells are enriched with both receptors. In addition, ACE2 directly binds to the spike protein and inactivates SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, CTB-ACE2 chewing gum is being evaluated for impact on entry and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
