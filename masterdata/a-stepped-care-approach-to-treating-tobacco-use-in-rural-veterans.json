The project will investigate the feasibility of a stepped care approach to treating tobacco use that includes enhancements based on initial response to treatment to augment the investigators' existing tailored tobacco treatment intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "Rural tobacco users (cigarette smokers, smokeless tobacco users, and users of other forms of tobacco) from the Iowa City VA Health Care System will be proactively recruited using information obtained from the electronic medical record. All participants will receive the investigators' tailored, six session smoking cessation intervention developed over a series of projects funded by ORH. This includes a counseling protocol tailored to tobacco users' individual needs and associated risk factors as well as pharmacotherapy selected using shared decision making. Participants who are unable to quit initially will be provided with enhanced counseling based on self-monitoring and scheduled reduced smoking. Those who are able to quit using tobacco during the initial treatment phase will be given an extended, four-session counseling protocol that incorporates new content based on established interventions from positive psychology in an effort to reduce relapse."
