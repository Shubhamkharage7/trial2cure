            "briefSummary": "Accurate risk assessment is essential for the success of population screening programs and early detection efforts in breast cancer. Mirai is a new deep learning model based on full resolution mammograms.\n\nMirai is a mammography-based deep learning model designed to predict risk at multiple timepoints, leverage potentially missing risk factor information, and produce predictions that are consistent across mammography machines. Mirai was trained on a large dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the United States and found to be significantly more accurate than the Tyrer-Cuzick model, a current clinical standard.\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to prospectively quantify the clinical benefit (i.e. MRI/CEM cancer detection rate) of Mirai-based guidelines and to compare them to the current standard of care.\n\n1. Conduct a prospective study where patients who are identified as high risk by Mirai guidelines are invited to receive supplemental MRI within 12 months.\n2. Compare cancer outcomes between patients only identified as high risk by Mirai and patients identified as high risk by existing guidelines The secondary aim is to study the impact of new guidelines by race and ethnicity, to ensure equitable improvements in cancer screening."

These patients will be invited to receive a supplemental MRI examination currently considered the most sensitive test for breast cancer detection.\n  2.

A report of a routine screening mammogram or diagnostic mammogram, and availability of the DICOM images from that report with the PACS system.\n  2. Reports of all follow up screening and diagnostic studies documented on PACS.\n  3.
