To determine if the 3-dimensional (3D) subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) results can be used to estimate interstitial fluid pressures (IFPs) in breast tumor and its surrounding tissue.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if the malignancy of breast tumor can be predicted by the 3D SHAPE results.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo ultrasound without contrast. Patients then receive perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity) intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and undergo CEUS."
