            "briefSummary": "Approximately 1.5 million of the 44 million Blacks in the United States are carriers of the valine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 122 (V122I) in the transthyretin (TTR) protein. Virtually exclusive to Blacks, this is the most common cause of hereditary cardiac amyloidosis (hATTR-CA) worldwide. hATTR-CA leads to worsening heart failure (HF) and premature death. Fortunately, new therapies that stabilize TTR improve morbidity and mortality in hATTR-CA, especially when prescribed early in the disease. However, hATTR-CA is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and conventional diagnostic tools lack diagnostic specificity to detect early disease.\n\nThe overall objectives of this study are to determine the presence of subclinical hATTR-CA and to identify biomarkers that indicate amyloid progression in V122I TTR carriers. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that hATTR-CA has a long latency period that will be detected through subclinical amyloidosis imaging and biomarker phenotyping.\n\nThe central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 2 specific aims: Aim 1) determine the association of V122I TTR carrier status with CMRI evidence of amyloid infiltration; Sub-aim 1) determine the association of V122I TTR carrier status with cardiac reserve; Aim 2) determine the association between amyloid-specific biomarkers and V122I TTR carrier status; and Sub-aim 2) determine the association of amyloid-specific biomarkers with imaging-based parameters and evaluate their diagnostic utility for identifying subclinical hATTR-CA. In Aim 1, CMRI will be used to compare metrics associated with cardiac amyloid infiltration between a cohort of V122I TTR carriers without HF formed by cascade genetic testing and age-, sex-, and race-matched non-carrier controls. For Sub-Aim 1, a sub-sample of carriers and non-carrier controls enrolled in Aim 1 will undergo novel exercise CMRI to measure and compare cardiac systolic and diastolic reserve. Aim 2 involves measuring and comparing amyloid-specific biomarkers in V122I TTR carriers without HF with samples matched non-carriers (both from Aim 1) and individuals with symptomatic V122I hATTR-CA from our clinical sites. These biomarkers detect and quantify different processes of TTR amyloidogenesis and include circulating TTR, retinol binding protein 4, TTR kinetic stability, and misfolded TTR oligomers. Sub-aim 2 will establish the role of these biomarkers to detect imaging evidence of subclinical hATTR-CA disease."
