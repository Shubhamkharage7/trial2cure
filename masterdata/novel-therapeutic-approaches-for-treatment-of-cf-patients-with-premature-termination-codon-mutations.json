In the current study, the investigators propose to directly test the efficacy of tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) and Trikafta for W1282X CFTR therapy in the clinic in comparison to ivacaftor alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "Approximately 11% of CF patients have premature termination codons (PTC), causing truncated CFTR with little to no function. No approved therapies exist for patients with PTC mutations including W1282X, a unique mutation exhibiting partial CFTR activity even in its truncated form. CFTR modulators alone enhanced CFTR function in patient cells from W1282X/G542X CFTR. Several published studies have shown CFTR modulators alone and/or in combination with readthrough (RT) agents benefit W1282X CFTR. Clinical studies further support an aspect of this notion, where two W1282X patients showed beneficial effect to Ivacaftor treatment."
