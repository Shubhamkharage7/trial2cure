            "briefSummary": "The primary purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of how experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of COVID-19 status, may have impacted multiple domains of health-related quality of life and other areas such as COVID-19 specific psychological distress, and disruptions to health care, finances and social interactions. We will also evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support, perceived benefits under times of stress, and ability to manage stress may buffer associations between COVID-19 experiences and HRQoL. To meet these objectives, we have developed a 10-minute questionnaire that taps into these areas and is based on prior work addressing concerns of other pandemics or national crises. Participants will have previously consented to protocol PA15-0336 and have provided prior lifestyle data. This will allow us to connect the COVID-19 survey data with prior existing data.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., exposure, risk factors, testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family or friends); COVID-19-specific psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms); health, financial and social disruptions; perceived benefits and social support; and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in melanoma patients who participated in protocol PA15-0336.\n\nII. Evaluate the extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19-specific psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and social support, and HRQoL.\n\nIII. Evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support and perceived benefits moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific psychological distress and HRQoL.\n\nIV. Explore the association between prior lifestyle data collected as part of PA15-0336 and COVID-19-specific psychological distress and HRQoL.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete a survey over 10 minutes."
