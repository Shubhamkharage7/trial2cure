            "briefSummary": "Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is a serious complication of long-term hemodialysis (HD). Its pathogenic mechanism involves accumulation of \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22M) in the blood. \u03b22M is produced by most cells in the body and is metabolized in the kidney in healthy individuals. However, in HD patients with renal dysfunction, \u03b22M which is not removed entirely by HD accumulates excessively in the blood. Then it forms amyloid fibrils that are deposited in bones, joints, and soft tissues. The fibrils are further modified by advanced glycation end products (AGE), inducing local macrophage infiltration and production of cytokines leading to chronic inflammation and activation of osteoclasts. Consequently, severe complications with various symptoms are developed, which are collectively referred to as DRA.\n\nLixelle\u00ae is a whole-blood \u03b22M apheresis column developed to adsorb and eliminate \u03b22M selectively from the blood of DRA patients. The treatment is performed with Lixelle\u00ae connected upstream of the dialyzer in series on a HD circuit in every session. The Lixelle\u00ae column contains porous cellulose beads with covalently linked hexadecyl alkyl chain ligands, which selectively adsorb \u03b22M, via a molecular sieving effect because of its porous structure and hydrophobic interaction with ligands. Lixelle\u00ae has been used to relieve symptoms and prevent the progression of DRA in Japan since 1996, when health insurance coverage and reimbursement for the treatment were approved by Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. Improvement of the activities of daily living (ADL) and remission of arthralgia by Lixelle\u00ae treatment has been shown in several clinical studies.",
            "detailedDescription": "In a post-market study on Lixelle\u00ae conducted between 1994 and 1997 in Japan, all adverse events in 183 patients (13, 476 treatments) at 58 centers were collected. The most frequent adverse events were temporary hypotension and anemia, which are common in dialysis or any extracorporeal therapy. Since the maximum blood flow rate for Lixelle\u00ae is less than the average blood flow rate for the conventional HD in the USA, Lixelle\u00ae- treatment requires a longer treatment time to achieve the same Kt/V urea as the conventional HD in the United States. However, the longer dialysis time and the lower blood flow rate are not likely to increase the rate of adverse events. Adverse events (including Serious Adverse Events) will be collected at each treatment whenever they occur and will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\nThis is a prospective double-armed study of 2 years of Lixelle\u00ae-treatment. The study consists of the study arm of 2 years of Lixelle\u00ae-treatment in 30 DRA patients and the natural history arm of 2 years of conventional HD in 10 DRA patients as the descriptive reference.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of Lixelle\u00ae in patients in the USA. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the probable benefit of Lixelle\u00ae to increase the \u03b22M reduction rate in a single dialysis session.\n\nExploratory endpoints are to assess:\n\n1. the changes of DRA symptoms and ADL of the patients treated with Lixelle\u00ae using DRAQ (Dialysis-Related Amyloidosis Questionnaire)\n2. the changes of QOL of the patients treated with Lixelle\u00ae using KDQOL-SF (Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form)\n3. the pre-treatment \u03b22M levels at baseline, one and two years; and\n4. bone cysts at baseline and two years"
