However, many individuals are deficient in those compounds, leading to negative skin outcomes. Most products on the market today only supply one or two compounds that can benefit skin health. Hemptress has developed a multi-function oil designed to help with outcomes related to acne, aging, and eczema, among others.\n\nThis twelve-week trial will examine the effectiveness of Hemptress' test product. This study will be a two-group trial with 45 participants per group. One group will focus on understanding the test product's effects on skin aging symptoms. The other group will focus on understanding the test product's effects on acne and eczema. The trial will be hybrid, and the participants will follow the use instructions provided by the research team."

The software utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and measure specific skin attributes. The skin attributes/parameters evaluated will be Wrinkles, Spots, Pores, Texture, Redness and UV Damage. These parameters are evaluated using the captured images and the specialized algorithms employed by the VISIA software. The results are then used to generate a comprehensive analysis report, which includes both the quantitative measurements and qualitative assessments, along with any corresponding scores or ratings assigned to different skin attributes.
