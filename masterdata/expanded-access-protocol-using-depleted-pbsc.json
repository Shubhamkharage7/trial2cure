These patients are not eligible for other Children's Hospital of Philadelphia IRB approved protocols that utilize CliniMACs technology for T depletion.",

There is a higher rate of complications using cells from an unrelated or partially matched related donor. T cells within the donor cells may cause a complication called graft vs. host disease (GVHD). The goal of this study is to use the CliniMACs device to remove the T cells that cause GVHD, called T cell depletion."
