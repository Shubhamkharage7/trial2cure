            "detailedDescription": "Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and crossover design, overweight or obese postmenopausal women with elevated blood pressure (BP) or hypertension will receive CIT (6 grams/day) or placebo for 2 weeks, separated by a two-week washout period.\n\nThere will be a total of 5 laboratory visits. The 1st visit will take approximately 1 hour. The 2nd - 5th visits will take about 2 hours and 15 minutes. Visit 1 will be a screening visit, visits 2 and 4 will be considered baseline visits, and visits 3 and 5 will be following the participants' two weeks of supplementation. Arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral and femoral-dorsalis pedis pulse wave velocity) and endothelial function will be assessed at rest. Additionally, brachial artery blood flow, forearm muscle oxygenation, cardiovascular hemodynamics (stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance), and BP will be assessed at rest, during 6 minutes of rhythmic handgrip exercise at 30% of a predetermined maximal voluntary contraction, and 2 minutes of superimposed lower body negative pressure to increase sympathetic activity."
