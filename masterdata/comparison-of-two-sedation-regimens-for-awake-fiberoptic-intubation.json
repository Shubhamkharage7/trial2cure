            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different sedation drugs used for the awake fiberoptic intubation procedure. Benzodiazapines and narcotics (such as midazolam and fentanyl) are standard drugs used for sedation during awake fiberoptic intubation. Dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and fentanyl are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) procedural sedation. These drugs might be given to the patient regardless of their participation in the study.\n\nIn addition to midazolam and fentanyl study subjects will also receive either dexmedetomidine or a placebo (a salt solution that contains no drug). It is believed that dexmedetomidine will not slow down breathing as much as the combination of the valium-like drug and narcotic. In our study, we are trying to determine if this is the best drug for sedation during an awake fiberoptic procedure.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an observational study designed to evaluate effectiveness of two standard of care protocols used for patients with potentially difficult airway during awake fiberoptic intubation.\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomized into one of two groups. The first group will receive placebo, midazolam, and fentanyl (titrated to effect) to facilitate the intubation. The second group will receive dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and fentanyl (titrated to effect) to facilitate intubation. Both groups will have a transtracheal injection and/or direct topical application of lidocaine to decrease irritation of the trachea and vocal cords.\n\nAs the patients in the study all have potentially difficult airways, the usual precautions will be taken to minimize the risks to the patients. These include the availability of alternative airway devices (including LMAs and Intubating LMA systems). Doses of dexmedetomidine will conform to the recommended dosing schedules of between 0.3 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hour.\n\nAll the drug stated above are currently FDA approved and are used according to the standard of care.\n\nPatient medical records will be reviewed to determine the amount of fentanyl that was used to facilitate intubation as well as homodynamic stability during the procedure and oxygen saturation. A brief 5-minute survey will be conducted 24 hours after the surgery to access patient satisfaction with intubation procedure. Intubation conditions stated below will be recorded by the anesthesiologist during the procedure.\n\nThe intubating conditions (gagging, discomfort of patient, and oxygen saturation) and hemodynamic stability during the procedure will be recorded by the research assistant and the patient's satisfaction with the undertaking (after the surgery is completed) will be determined as well. The amount of fentanyl used to facilitate intubation will also be recorded."
