            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to use altered auditory vocal feedback to increase fluency in people who stutter and to examine changes in this effect over the course of a one month period occurring outside the laboratory setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Mumble Melody app applies voice transformations (or \"modes\") to a user's voice in real-time while they are speaking. The modes include Unaltered, Whisper, Reverberated, and Harmonious voice transformations. The Mumble Melody Longitudinal Study is a month-long online study in which we will be investigating the longer term effects of using the Mumble Melody app for people who stutter. During the course of a month, eligible participants will use the Mumble Melody app daily for however long, on whichever modes, and in whichever settings they wish. Additionally, we will be sending an online platform for participants to conduct weekly at-home testing sessions, in which they will be asked to record their voice during various speech tasks, both with and without the Mumble Melody app. During testing sessions, we will collect voice recordings from participants.\n\nStep 1: Participants will sign a consent form via Redcap. Participants will need an Apple device compatible with the Mumble Melody app.\n\nStep 2: Participants will receive an additional form via Redcap through which they can input information about what device they will be using for the Mumble Melody study, as well as shipping information to receive wired headphones and a headphone jack (which are necessary to use the app).\n\nStep 3: Participants conduct an initial screening session through an online platform, in which they respond to 3 90-second open questions and conduct a passage reading task. We will be collecting voice recordings as they speak within the sessions.\n\nStep 4: Participants' eligibility will be determined using the voice recordings received from step 3. The amount of stuttering-like events and total number of syllables within the recordings will determine if participants have a moderate to severe stutter, meaning they will be eligible for the study.\n\nStep 5: Eligible participants are shipped wired headphones and a headphone jack adapter\n\nStep 6: Participants will fill out an initial survey and optional OASES (Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering) assessment of through an online platform.\n\nStep 7: Participants conduct a baseline testing session. During this testing session, participants will answer survey questions, record answers to 2 90-second open response questions without using the Mumble Melody app, follow a step-by-step guide to download and set up the Mumble Melody app, record answers to 2 90-second open response for each of the 4 modes on the Mumble Melody app, and finally record answers to 2 90-second open response questions without using the Mumble Melody app.\n\nStep 8: Step 8: For the following 28 days, participants will be told to use the app as they wish. We will collect app usage logs, which provide timestamps indicating which mode was used and length of use. Participants will receive an additional monetary reward if they use the app for at least 5 minutes for 4 out of 6 days each week.\n\nStep 9: Participants conduct 4 testing sessions, one at the end of each week of the study (day 8, 15, 22, and 29). During each testing session, participants will answer survey questions, record answers to 2 90-second open response questions without using the Mumble Melody app, record answers to 2 90-second open response for each of the 4 modes on the Mumble Melody app, and finally record answers to 2 90-second open response questions without using the Mumble Melody app.\n\nStep 10: After the study, participants will be sent a final survey asking questions on their experience throughout the study and their feedback for the app."
