            "detailedDescription": "In a recent publication by the TODAY Group Study, it was reported that \"diabetes-related complications appear early in youth-onset T2D and accumulate rapidly at a mean age of 26.4 years,\" and 60.1% of participants developed at least one microvascular complication. The same has been reported in RISE Studies and was suggested that the rapid decline in \u03b2-cell function and its insensitivity to two of the most frequently used treatments for T2D in pediatrics is further aggravated by the rising prevalence in NAFLD. These alarming results indicate a pressing need for effective and innovative approaches at preserving \u03b2-cell function and reducing hepatic steatosis in obese youth in order to prevent disease progression and associated complications.\n\nThis study will provide mechanistic insights in support of a GLP-1 analog, Semaglutide, 2.4 mg weekly, therapy for prediabetes, new onset T2D and NAFLD in youth. The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (RCT) using Semaglutie (Wegovy up to 2.4mg) for 6 months followed by a wash-out period of 3 months."
