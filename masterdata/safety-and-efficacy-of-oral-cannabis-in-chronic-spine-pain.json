            "detailedDescription": "This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to elucidate the role of extended oral cannabis treatment in the alleviation of chronic spine pain and reduction of high-dose opioid use. This trial includes two study arms: Analgesia Arm and Reduction Arm. The Analgesia Arm uses a within-subject crossover design to determine whether daily treatment with an oral cannabis solution for 6 weeks significantly reduces spine pain compared to placebo. The Reduction Arm uses a parallel design to determine whether daily treatment with an oral cannabis solution for 13 weeks results in a greater reduction of pain and opioid intake than placebo treatment. It will also assess the impact of extended cannabis treatment on opioid craving and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in participants tapering their high-dose opioids."
