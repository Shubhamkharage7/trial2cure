            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the present study is to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a parent coaching intervention for parents of youth hospitalized for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt(s), or non-suicidal self-injury. Parents will receive either the parent coaching intervention (which includes safety planning and behavioral parenting skills training with a clinician and assistance with linkage to follow-up care by a case manager) or treatment as usual (TAU) for the inpatient unit. The long-term goal of the research is to determine if augmenting standard inpatient treatment with additional parenting intervention improves youth treatment response on suicide-related outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicide attempts). The goal of this pilot RCT is to collect preliminary data needed for a larger RCT, including feasibility, acceptability, safety, tolerability, engagement of the presumed mechanism of change (changes in parent emotions and behaviors), and signal detection of any changes in youth suicide-related outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The present study is a pilot parent coaching intervention (PI). The investigators will enroll N = 40 pairs of youth and parents enrolled in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient program. This program, called the Stanford at Mills-Peninsula Hospital (STAM), is jointly run by Stanford and Mills-Peninsula Hospital. All research procedures will be conducted by Stanford faculty and staff. Parents and youth who provide informed consent will be randomly assigned to receive the PI + standard Inpatient treatment or standard inpatient treatment only. Parents assigned to the PI + inpatient treatment will be offered 4 sessions of DBT-based parenting interventions which include safety planning, behavioral parenting interventions, and support for care linkage. Youth will participate in study assessments only and will not receive additional treatment as part of the study (i.e., they will receive treatment as usual). Study participation is optional and will not impact the family's ability to participate in the inpatient treatment. Youth will stay admitted to the inpatient program as part of standard clinical practices, regardless of whether or not they choose to participate in the study. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3-month follow-up, 6 month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. Both parents will be encouraged to take part in the intervention, however; the participation of only one parent will be required. The intervention will consist of 4 individual parent sessions, to be completed within one month of youth discharge from the hospital or of care linkage whichever coms first. Sessions will be 60 to 90 minutes in length and will be offered weekly. Therapists may see parents more than once a week if needed, as long as the total number of sessions does not exceed 4. Sessions will focus on safety planning and care linkage, Parent skills building, parent conflict resolution, and parent self-care using adolescent DBT handouts."
