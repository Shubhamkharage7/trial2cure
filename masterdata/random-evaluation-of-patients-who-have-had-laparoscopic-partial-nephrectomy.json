Patients must be initially scheduled RALPN as opposed to radical nephrectomy or other techniques for partial nephrectomy such as open surgery or pure laparoscopy without robot assistance.\n4. Patients with bilateral kidneys or a solitary kidney, so long as these are native kidneys as opposed to a transplanted kidney.\n5. Patients can have the common single renal artery and single renal vein, or they can have common variants such as two renal arteries and/or two renal veins.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients on hemodialysis.\n2. Patients who have had a renal transplantation.\n3. Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation prior to surgery (example anticoagulants include: aspirin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel, warfarin, fondaparinux, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban). However, patients who take aspirin 81 mg daily as their daily regimen will be included.\n4. Patients with bleeding disorders (example: hemophilia) and other documented coagulopathy (example: chronic liver disease) with INR greater than 1.0 at baseline.\n5. Patients who have had a prior surgical procedure, aside from percutaneous renal biopsy, on the kidney in the current operation.\n6. Patients with over 100 mL of estimated blood loss (calculated by anesthesia team using the suction canisters) prior to clamping of the renal hilum will be excluded.",
