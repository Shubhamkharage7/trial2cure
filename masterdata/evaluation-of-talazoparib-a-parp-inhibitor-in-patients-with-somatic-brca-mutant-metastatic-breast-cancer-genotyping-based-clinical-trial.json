            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved talazoparib for the participants' specific disease but it has been approved for metastatic breast cancer with a germline (inherited) BRCA mutation.\n\nTalazoparib is a study drug that inhibits (stops) the normal activity of certain proteins called \"poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases\" also called \"PARPs\". PARPs are proteins (made from genes which are part of your DNA) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are involved in the repair of DNA. PARPs are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in DNA when cells divide. If the mistakes are not repaired, the defective cell will usually die and be replaced. Cells with mistakes in their DNA that do not die can become cancer cells. Cancer cells may be killed by a study drug, like talazoparib, that stops the normal activity of PARPs. In clinical trials, the use of talazoparib and other PARP inhibitors have shown that these drugs can reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in some cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are examining how effective talazoparib is in patients with metastatic breast cancer with a BRCA mutation in their tumor."
