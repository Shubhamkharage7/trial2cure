This before-after comparison trial will be conducted in several LTC facilities to evaluate the effect access to System Sleep Quality Data has on documentation of sleep disorders or treatments and sleep quality change over time for AD/ADRD participants in the intervention group as compared to the control group.\n\nAll subjects will undergo sleep quality monitoring for 4-weeks. At the end of the first 2-weeks, research staff and LTC facility staff and medical providers will receive access to sleep monitoring data. We hypothesize that when real-time System Sleep Data is shared with LTC staff or healthcare providers, that sleep disturbances will be more readily detected, leading to timelier, better tailored treatment interventions for sleep disturbances, thereby improving sleep quality and decreasing daytime physical inactivity.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of a Non-Contact Sleep Quality Monitor System and determine the effect that sharing System Sleep Data with long-term care (LTC) staff and healthcare providers has on documentation and treatment of sleep disorders and change in AD/ADRD participant sleep quality. System Sleep Data will be collected for a total of 4-weeks. During the Intervention condition System Sleep Data will be shared for 2-weeks, while in the initial Control condition no System Sleep Data will be shared for 2-weeks. Healthcare providers can prescribe a non-pharmacologic sleep protocol and/or if they so choose, pharmacotherapy to manage sleep disturbances for subjects in either the Intervention or Control condition, in accordance with standard medical practice. The investigators hypothesize that when real-time System Sleep Data is shared with LTC staff or healthcare providers, that sleep disturbances will be more readily detected, leading to timelier, better tailored treatment interventions for sleep disturbances, thereby improving sleep quality and decreasing daytime physical inactivity."
