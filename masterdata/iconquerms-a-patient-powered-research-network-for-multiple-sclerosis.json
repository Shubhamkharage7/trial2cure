            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to create a Multiple Sclerosis Patient-Powered Research Network (MS-PPRN) that includes at least 20,000 people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who contribute data on their health and other topics. Survey data will be made available to research scientists who are studying MS and similar diseases. Our goal is to use this data to answer questions that researchers and people with MS have regarding the disease, including its causes, treatments, and other topics.\n\nThe MS-PPRN will be part of a national network for conducting research called PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. PCORnet is supported by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). As the MS-PPRN is part of PCORnet, the data collected in surveys you complete may also be shared with researchers studying other diseases within the PCORnet network.\n\nWhile the MS-PPRN is focused on enrolling people with MS, people without MS are also welcome to participate in this research study.\n\nThis study will be conducted online via the iConquerMS.org website. This is an ongoing study and will last for an indefinite period of time."
