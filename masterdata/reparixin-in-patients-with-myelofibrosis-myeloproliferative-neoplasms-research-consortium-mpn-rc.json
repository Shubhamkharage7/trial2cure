Eligible patients will receive oral reparixin three times daily on a 4-week cycle for a core study period of 6 cycles (24 weeks). After cycle 6, patients may continue receiving reparixin once daily on a 4-week cycle if at least stable disease (SD) is met by IWG-MRT criteria until loss of response, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient/physician withdrawal, or termination of study by sponsor."
