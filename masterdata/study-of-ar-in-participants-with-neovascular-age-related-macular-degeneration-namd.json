Two cohorts will be enrolled, for an approximate total of 10 subjects. Subjects in both cohorts will attend visits through Week 48 for assessment of safety and preliminary treatment effects.\n\nStage 2 is a 56-week (plus extension) double-masked, active comparator, randomized, parallel group evaluation of AR-14034 SR compared with aflibercept. Approximately 130 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 2:2:1 to AR-14034 SR lower dose, AR-14034 SR higher dose, or aflibercept dosed as labelled. Subjects will attend visits through Week 56 for assessment of safety and treatment effects. A 16-week open label extension phase will be conducted thereafter."
