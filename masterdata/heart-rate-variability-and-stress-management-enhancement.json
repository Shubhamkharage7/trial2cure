The Apollo wearable generates low volume sound waves that feel like a soothing touch to the skin. This study will assess whether slight modulation of heart rate variability (HRV) will result in a reduction in stress, improved recovery, and recovery in and around the hospital. Physicians will wear the Apollo device for heart rate variability modulation and complete questionnaires before and after use of the Apollo device for comparison of outcomes."
