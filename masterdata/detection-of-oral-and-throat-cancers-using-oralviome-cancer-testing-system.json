OSCC and OPC participants will be recruited from secondary care facilities, OPMD and cancer free participants will be recruited from primary care facilities.\n\nParticipants will complete health questionnaires and collect saliva samples using at home/ in clinic kits provided by Viome. The duration of study participation will be 1 clinic visit for cancer free participants, and up to 1 year for those with OSCC/OPC/OPMD."
