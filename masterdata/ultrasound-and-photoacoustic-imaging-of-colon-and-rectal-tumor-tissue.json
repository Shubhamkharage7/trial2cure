The study includes two parts. The initial exploratory portion will be conducted ex vivo with resected colon and rectal specimens immediately following surgical excision. Based on those findings, an endorectal probe will then be constructed to examine in vivo tumors. The investigators hypothesize that in vivo photoacoustic imaging will be capable of differentiating normal from malignant tissue."
