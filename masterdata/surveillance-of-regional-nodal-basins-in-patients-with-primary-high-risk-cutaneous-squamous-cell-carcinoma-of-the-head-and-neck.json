The study will enroll patients with tumors staged T2a and who are also immunosuppressed (from solid organ transplant, hematologic malignancy or autoimmune disease), T2b (sentinel lymph node negative), and T3 (sentinel lymph node negative). After two years of surveillance, outcomes regarding local recurrence, nodal metastasis, disease specific death, and overall survival will be compared with historical controls with the overall hypothesis that ultrasound surveillance will detect subclinical disease earlier and help improve outcomes."
