Participants will complete up to ten scheduled study visits with assessment of topical steroid response and dupilumab response (if uncontrolled with topical steroids). Skin samples will be collected at all study visits to determine the gene expression profiles and transcriptomic endotypes that underlie mild vs. moderate-severe AD disease. The investigators will also evaluate the lipidomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and microbiome profiles of AD skin endotypes associated with mild and moderate-severe AD disease. Non-AD participants will serve as a control population.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine if the type 2-high non-lesional skin (skin tape) endotype is associated with current mild versus moderate-severe AD disease."
