RLS-0071 is a novel peptide being developed for the treatment of AECOPD. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RLS-0071 in the treatment of adults with moderate exacerbations of COPD.",

The dosing regimen will be 3 times a day for at least 3 days and up to 5 days total if still hospitalized. Participants will be followed for efficacy and safety for 30 and 60 days after the final dose. RLS-0071 or Placebo will be given as add-on therapy to SOC management for acute exacerbations of COPD."
