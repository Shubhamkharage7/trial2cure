The investigators will use a randomized pre-post design that will consist of two data collection phases and a 5-week treatment condition. The heart rate variability biofeedback active condition is designed to increase heart rate oscillations (Osc+ condition) consistent with current best practices, while the sham control heart rate variability biofeedback condition is designed to decrease heart rate oscillations (Osc- condition).",
            "detailedDescription": "There are two primary aims of the study: (1) examine whether heart rate variability increases at rest in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury from pre-treatment to post-treatment following heart rate variability biofeedback; (2) to test whether heart rate variability recovery following a stressor improves in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury following heart rate variability biofeedback. Regarding the first primary aim, the investigators hypothesize that heart rate variability will be higher in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury following heart rate variability biofeedback compared to those in the control/sham condition where the investigators do not expect such improvement pre- to post-testing. For the second aim, consistent with previous work, the investigators hypothesize that heart rate variability recovery following a stressor will be faster in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury following heart rate variability biofeedback compared to a sham control condition. There are three secondary aims for this study: (1) to evaluate whether improvements in heart rate variability in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury following heart rate variability biofeedback are associated with improvements in physical symptoms common after head injury (i.e., headaches, dizziness, sleep disturbance); (2) to evaluate whether improvements in heart rate variability in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury following heart rate variability biofeedback are associated with improvements in emotional functioning (i.e., life satisfaction, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms); and (3) to evaluate whether improvements in heart rate variability in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury following heart rate variability biofeedback are associated with improvements in cognitive functioning (i.e., attention, inhibitory control)."

The heart rate variability biofeedback protocol will be based on Lehrer et al., 2013 and Yoo et al., 2022. This format will aid participants in implementing and learning breathing and heart rate variability biofeedback skills (Lehrer et al., 2020). All participants will wear an ear sensor to measure their pulse. The heart rate variability biofeedback will focus on autonomic balance through slow breathing at a resonance frequency of approximately 6 breathes per minute. The best approximate breathing pace for resonance frequency will be estimated and participant's resonance frequency will be provided and used for their homework and subsequent training sessions.",

Participants will be instructed that the purpose of this portion of the study is to decrease their breathing oscillations.

For the second session, the therapist will check in with the participant and discuss how the practice went. Participants will then select three strategies that they will practice for three five-minute conditions following a five-minute baseline. Sessions three, four, and five will include three conditions: a five-minute baseline and two strategies of their choice.
