Biospecimens collected through this protocol will be shared with collaborators in the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium to support projects funded through an NIH U01 grant. Participants will be enrolled when they present for clinically indicated surgical procedures for their possible tumor or pancreas resection or cyst resection, or at a clinically indicated follow-up appointment after their procedure.\n\nThis protocol supports this effort by providing investigators with access to a wide variety of pancreatic tissues and biospecimens for translational studies in pancreatic cancer. This protocol covers the collection of clinical data and biospecimens (blood; malignant, benign, or precancerous pancreatic tumor; and adjacent normal tissues) from patients with, or suspected to have, pancreatic cancer. Additionally, saliva and cyst fluid, may be collected in the future from patients with pancreatic cysts. These will be shared with the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium for further analysis."
