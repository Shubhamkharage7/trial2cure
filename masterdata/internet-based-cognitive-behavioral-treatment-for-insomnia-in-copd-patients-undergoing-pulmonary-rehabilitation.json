            "briefSummary": "This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare sleep and health-related functioning in Veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and insomnia receiving an Internet-based behavioral treatment for insomnia versus online insomnia patient education. Participants will undergo a sleep and health assessment that will be performed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-months later. Participants will be randomly assigned to either Internet-based behavioral treatment for insomnia or online insomnia patient education.",
            "detailedDescription": "Veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a vulnerable group for developing insomnia. Insomnia has been found to be associated with limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), lower physical activity levels, poor quality of life, greater COPD symptom severity, and reduced exercise performance. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an efficacious and durable non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia that provides guidance on changing unhealthy sleep-related beliefs and behaviors across a variety of illnesses. CBT-I not only improves sleep-specific symptoms of insomnia but also improves quality of life and daytime function, reduces ADL limitations, and improves condition-specific symptoms.\n\nThis study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare sleep and health-related functioning in Veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and insomnia receiving an Internet-based behavioral treatment for insomnia versus online insomnia patient education. Veterans 40 years and older, who received care from the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, and who have COPD and insomnia will be recruited for this study. Participants will undergo a sleep and health assessment that will be performed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-months later. Participants will be randomly assigned to either Internet-based behavioral treatment for insomnia or online insomnia patient education. Both the insomnia treatment and patient education will be provided remotely."
