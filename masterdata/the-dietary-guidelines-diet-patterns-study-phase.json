            "detailedDescription": "The U.S. Dietary Guidelines (USDG) form the basis of federal nutrition programs and policy and provide valuable guidance to health initiatives and industries. The updated 2015 USDG moved away from a focus on individual nutrients to a greater focus on dietary patterns. The USDG state that healthy eating goals can be met through a variety of dietary patterns, but present healthy diet in three main ways: 1) Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, 2) Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern, and 3) Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern. Currently, US adults are falling short of the nutrition recommendations (fruit/vegetable intake, greens/beans, whole grains, etc.) set forth by the USDG and measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). While the USDG are the basis of nutrition guidelines, the research informing these dietary pattern recommendations has largely been drawn from observational studies among mostly white populations. In addition, there has been very limited cultural-tailoring of these dietary patterns that would ensure that these diets are acceptable to diverse populations, in particular, African Americans (AAs) living in the south, who experience a disproportionate burden of chronic disease, especially type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Currently, US adults are not meeting nutrition recommendations (fruit/vegetable, whole grains, etc.) set forth by the USDG and measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI).\n\nFor this study, AA adult participants with overweight/obesity and \u2265three T2DM risk factors will be recruited to participate in the following aim:\n\nBased on the findings of our formative work, conduct a one-year intervention using revised culturally tailored materials to examine differences in HEI and T2DM risk factors among participants (n=198) randomized to one of the 3 dietary patterns. This will result in community-based strategies around presenting dietary guidelines in a way to effectively meet nutrition recommendations leading to significant impacts on health among AA adults."
