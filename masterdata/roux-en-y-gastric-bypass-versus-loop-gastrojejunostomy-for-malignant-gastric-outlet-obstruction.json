            "briefSummary": "This study is intended to investigate whether roux-en-y bypass surgery is superior to conventional loop gastrojejunostomy for Malignant gastric outlet obstruction in terms of tolerance to solid food intake. We hypothesize that roux-en-y bypass will be associated with improved solid food intake in the first 30 days after surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Malignant gastric outlet obstruction is when malignant tumor growth obstructs the gastric outlet at the level of the distal stomach or duodenum, causing food intolerance with nausea and vomiting. Most often, this signifies advanced neoplastic disease with associated poor prognosis for patients. Restoring patients to oral intake is important for palliative purposes. The current standard of care in patients requiring long-term alleviation of symptoms (\u22652 months) is performing a loop gastrojejunostomy. This involves creating an intestinal bypass to the site of obstruction in the duodenum or distal stomach. This procedure has long been criticized for its poor resultant function for patients, mainly due to poor tolerance to food intake that include frequent episodes of nausea and vomiting and inability to for solid food intake. The need for a durable solution to malignant gastric outlet obstruction that provides better tolerance to solid food intake is evident. The roux-en-y gastric bypass procedure has been performed for a variety of indications for decades, most commonly for weight loss but also with oncologic resections of the stomach in cases of gastric cancer. Laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass (R-Y bypass) has become the standard for this procedure in experienced hands and has been found to be safe in the short- and long term. The long-term function after R-Y bypass is generally favorable across published literature. No studies exist to compare loop gastrojejunostomy to roux-en-y gastric bypass in patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction."

The procedure establishes intestinal continuity that bypasses the distal stomach and duodenum. This is achieved by dividing the jejunum 30-40 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, bringing the distal end of jejunum up anterior to the transverse colon to be anastomosed to the back wall of the stomach (forming the Roux-limb). The proximal cut end of jejunum then gets anastomosed to the downstream roux-limb (forming the Y-limb). The benefits of this reconstruction include less chance of gastric contents travelling into the afferent limb and similarly, avoiding bile reflux from the afferent limb with associated bile gastritis.",
