Examples of these conditions include: severe sensory deficits, skin conditions, joint contractures, etc.\n* Have difficulty following multiple step directions\n* Have severe psychiatric problems or difficulty thinking clearly that would prevent me from participating in this study\n* Have skin issues that would prevent wearing the Myo-Pro device\n* Have had history of recurrent epilepsy, seizure or convulsion\n* Have a past or current history of treated ringing in the ears known as tinnitus or severe hearing problems.\n* Be taking any drugs that would increase my risk of having a seizure while undergoing brain stimulation. Study staff and physician will review my medications to see if I am taking any of these drugs. If I am taking one of these drugs, I will not be enrolled in this study.\n* Because of potential risk to the fetus, women of child-bearing potential will be required to have a pregnancy test before they can enroll in this study.
