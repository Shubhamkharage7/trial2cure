Its three aims will be accomplished through 1) a retrospective chart review of emergency department (ED) patients screened for diabetes, 2) a series of prospective qualitative interviews among ED patients with newly diagnosed diabetes who fail to follow-up for outpatient care, and 3) a simple randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of telehealth bridge visits to connect ED patients with newly diagnosed diabetes to outpatient primary care."
