The primary measure for determining potential impacts of the 2'-FL-containing dietary supplement on stool microbiota composition is stool abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a commensal intestinal bacteria. Additional measures related to determining potential impacts of the 2'-FL-containing dietary supplement on gut microbiota composition are stool levels of additional commensal intestinal bacteria and measures of intestinal microbial diversity."
