The primary objective is to compare sac-TMT plus pembrolizumab to TPC (pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus capecitabine) with respect to invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) per investigator assessment. It is hypothesized that sac-TMT plus pembrolizumab is superior to TPC with respect to iDFS per investigator assessment."
