Our proposal aims to improve a patient's ability to detect warning signs of pregnancy related death and seek medical care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pregnancy-related death (PRD) rates have risen 120-200% in the United States in the past two decades, and experts estimate that 40-60% of these cases are preventable. Improvement initiatives are predominantly hospital-based and rely on perinatal people recognizing their own symptoms and seeking care without ample support or education. We hypothesize that we can improve patients' self-efficacy and decision-making about when to seek care by helping them to self-monitor symptoms and by providing decision support. We propose to develop a mHealth-based, patient-reported outcome (PRO) and decision-support system to help mothers determine when to seek care for warning signs of PRD. Our project focuses on diverse populations facing postpartum disparities, particularly African- American and Spanish-speaking Latina women. This protocol involves a single-arm pilot trial assessing the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of MOMS/MAMA for improving knowledge and patient activation among postpartum patients."
