            "briefSummary": "The goal of the study is to understand if hospital-based violence interventions are effective for reducing youth violence among violently injured youth. This study will allow researchers to learn more about the intervention's effectiveness. The researchers also want to understand if the violence intervention impacts other behaviors, such as firearm use, drug use, aggression, risky behaviors, and rates of violent re-injury.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research study is to find out if a hospital-based violence intervention (Bridging the Gap) is effective for reducing youth violence. Researchers think that youth who receive the Bridging the Gap will see greater improvements than youth who do not receive the intervention. Approximately 300 youth patients and 300 adult caregivers will enroll in this study. Participants will be randomized into a study group (either Bridging the Gap or Treatment as Usual). If patients agree to the study but do not like the group they are assigned to, they can request to switch groups. Participants assigned to the Treatment as Usual intervention will receive a brief violence awareness brochure during their hospital stay. Participants assigned to the Bridging the Gap intervention will receive an in-hospital intervention and, once released from the hospital, will receive 3-months of community case management services with their families. The study team thinks that youth who receive the Bridging the Gap intervention will see greater improvements than youth who do not receive the intervention. Participation in this study will last up to 6 months."
