Both devices are approved by the FDA for this use, and have already been used by clinicians on patients undergoing transfemoral procedures. It is believed that the use of both devices in combination compared to the Perclose alone will shorten the time that it takes to 'seal' the artery, resulting in a shorter period of time that patients would need to lay flat."
