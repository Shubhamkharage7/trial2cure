            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeople who have had an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) have bone marrow or an immune system that is damaged. They get stem cells from a donor who is a relative. Researchers want to study stem cell donors and recipients to learn about the long-term effects of HCT. They want to learn how the stem cells change and how to improve their ability to fight cancer.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo provide long-term follow-up care for people who underwent or will undergo HCT. To collect data, blood, and tissue samples to learn about late complications after HCT.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 and older who will undergo HCT or underwent HCT and are surviving one year or more from the date of HCT. The stem cell donors for these recipients are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nRecipients will have 1 visit each year. They will have a physical exam. They will answer questions about their medical history and health. They will receive screening and surveillance testing. They will complete brief questionnaires.\n\nRecipients will have blood tests. They may have tissue biopsies or specimens (such as tissue in their cheek or skin or bone marrow biopsy).\n\nRecipients will give their current address and phone number, and the same data for one or two other people, who can get in contact with them.\n\nAfter the first visit at the clinic, some recipients may see a doctor close to home to get the necessary information and send it to NIH.\n\nDonors will come to the clinic for 1 visit. They will answer questions about their medical history. Blood samples will be taken.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Patients who survive more than 3 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) have a high probability of being cured from their underlying disease; however, mortality rates remain 4 to 9-fold higher than the general population for at least 30 years after HCT.\n* The most common causes of late mortality in HCT survivors include second malignancies, relapsed/recurrent disease, infections, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.\n* Guidelines for recommended screening and preventive practices for long-term survivors after HCT have been developed, and can be implemented to detect or prevent late complications after HCT.\n* Understanding the pattern of immune reconstitution and immune dysregulation after HCT may help to elucidate the root mechanisms of late complications.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To collect clinical data on patients and late complications after HCT\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients who underwent HCT for any indication and are surviving one year or more from the date of HCT OR patients who will be undergoing HCT on an ETIB protocol.\n* Related stem cell donors of patients meeting the above criteria who participated or will be participating as a donor of stem cells or leukocytes.\n* Age greater than or equal to 4 years\n* Any active disease relapse or new hematologic malignancy including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) are excluded from protocol enrollment.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Prospective, longitudinal study of the natural history of long-term survivors after HCT.\n* Clinical data on post-transplant complications and peripheral blood samples will be collected at yearly evaluations by the Principal Investigator, LAI, AI or representative investigator of the original HCT protocol.\n* If patient develops complications such as new cancers, relapsed disease, new hematologic malignancy or PTLD they are exempt from required evaluations, and followed for survival and causes of death (management of complications as per primary team).\n* As this is a longitudinal registry study without any planned intervention, there is no formal statistical analysis plan or accrual goal; descriptive data will be reported."
