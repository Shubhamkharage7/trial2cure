            "detailedDescription": "Patients with nasal defects from cancer, trauma, prior surgery, or birth often require complex reconstruction. Current techniques involve hand sketched skin templates and/or hand carved cartilage grafts that are formed intraoperatively for nasal reconstruction. This process is time consuming, heavily depends on the surgeon's skill, cannot be standardized, and is difficult to visualize with patients preoperatively. To overcome these barriers and shift surgical paradigms, we will use a regenerative medicine approach to nasal reconstruction to create patient specific and individualized results. We will leverage regenerative medicine techniques of 3D surface mapping, 3D printing and modeling, and new tissue preparation techniques for skin template creation and sculpting of cartilage grafting. Clinically this will improve patient specific outcomes, increase reproducibility, reduce operative times, and allow for an individualized approach to nasal reconstruction. This will be achieved by (1) establishing ideal diced cartilage graft parameters in the laboratory setting for moldable cartilage graft formation. This knowledge will be applied to (2) create diced cartilage grafts for nasal dorsum and tip reconstruction from 3D printed nasal molds. For nasal skin reconstruction, (3) 3D facial scans of patients' preoperatively will be used to generate patient specific templates for skin reconstruction. Ultimately, (4) these regenerative medicine techniques of cartilage and skin reconstruction performed with 3D planning can be shared in an interactive format with patients preoperatively. This will allow patients to be involved in the surgical planning of their nasal reconstruction to increase their autonomy and the individualization of their surgery."
