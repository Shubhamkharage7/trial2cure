Phase 1 is a first in human (FIH) dose escalation study in patients aged 18 years or older with clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) who have exhausted available standard therapy as determined by the investigator.\n\nPhase 1 is designed to determine the MTD and/or RDEs of NKT2152 as a single agent administered orally once daily. Depending on the tolerability and PK, additional dosing schedules may be tested. Phase 2 will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy of NKT2152 in ccRCC patients. Patients will be randomized to one of two dosage levels selected for further evaluation."
