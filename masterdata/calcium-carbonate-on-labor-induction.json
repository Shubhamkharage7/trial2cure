The investigators hypothesize that calcium carbonate is a low-risk preventative measure to decrease oxytocin induction time and dosage, decrease the rate of labor dystocia, decrease the rate of cesarean deliveries, and demonstrate no differences in maternal or neonatal safety outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators plan to assess (1) duration of induction with oxytocin administration, (2) rate of labor dystocia/failed induction, (3) rate of cesarean section, and (4) maternal/neonatal safety. Currently, calcium carbonate is used by clinicians in patients with varying characteristics, at varying doses, and at various times in their labor process based on their professional preference and experience. The investigators will implement a standardized treatment protocol for calcium carbonate use within a defined patient population who voluntarily agree to prospectively receive the intervention and then analyze predetermined safety and efficacy outcomes in comparison to a historical cohort of patients meeting the criteria for the defined patient population who did not have any documented calcium carbonate use during labor."
