Patients who sign the screening consent will undergo MRD assessment with the clonoSEQ\u00ae assay. If the assessment identifies the patient to be MRD negative, the patient will undergo a repeat MRD assessment \u2265 28 days later. If two consecutive MRD assessments indicate MRD-negativity, the patient will then sign the study intervention phase informed consent form and will undergo the rest of the screening process.\n\nEnrollment\n\nOnce the patient fulfills all eligibility criteria, the patient will be enrolled into one of two cohorts based on the type of therapy they are receiving at the time of enrolled:\n\nCohort A: Venetoclax monotherapy at time of enrollment.\n\nCohort B: Venetoclax with anti CD20 monoclonal antibody at time of enrollment (The latter includes patients who initiated anti CD20 monoclonal antibody with venetoclax and have since completed the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody portion of the regimen.)"

Given that MRD status is a dynamic endpoint which may improve with time, if a patient is screen failure based on MRD status (i.e. MRD positive at the 10-5 sensitivity), they may be rescreened to assess for study eligibility.\n* Patients must have achieved a complete or partial remission with the venetoclax-based regimen. Criteria for remission are per iwCLL 2018 guidelines. For this protocol, bone marrow biopsy/aspirate evaluation is not necessary to determine remission status.\n\nExclusion Criteria (both study phases):\n\n* Ongoing participation in a clinical trial that supplies venetoclax and/or anti CD20 monoclonal antibody\n* Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures.\n* Unable to understand the purpose and risks of the study and to provide a signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance with national and local patient privacy regulations).",
