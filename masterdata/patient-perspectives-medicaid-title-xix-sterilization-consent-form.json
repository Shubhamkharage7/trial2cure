            "briefSummary": "The goal of this survey and interview study is to learn about patient experience consenting for permanent contraception using the Medicaid Title XIX Sterilization Consent form. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* To explore patient perspectives on and understanding of the current consenting process for obtaining permanent contraception as it relates to the Medicaid Title XIX Sterilization consent form.\n* To explore patient experience with the current consenting process, and thoughts regarding the ideal consenting process including how it would differ from the one currently in place, if at all.\n\nParticipants will complete a 10-15 minute survey and be offered participation in an in-depth one-on-one interview.",
            "detailedDescription": "The United States has a long history of coerced sterilization which was influenced by the eugenics and population control movements of the early and mid-20th century, respectively. The Medicaid Title XIX Sterilization Consent Form was created in response to these forced sterilizations to protect patients, but in recent years there have been questions regarding whether these forms are instead creating barriers to care for already marginalized populations. Prior studies demonstrated decreased rates of completion of postpartum permanent contraception requests secondary to invalid consent forms and negative attitudes among OBGYNs, including concerns regarding the ethics behind the forms. To date, there is very limited literature exploring patient perspectives. This will be a mixed methods study in which bilingual surveys will be distributed via REDCap to patients seeking permanent contraception at Columbia University affiliated OBGYN practices and complete in-depth interviews exploring patient experiences consenting for permanent contraception, and what an ideal consenting process might look like to them."
