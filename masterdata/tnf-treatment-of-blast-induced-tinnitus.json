Additional tinnitus characteristics:\n\n   a) Tinnitus history: Onset associated with blast and/or noise exposure or associated with diagnosed TBI and/or concussion. Subjects will have blast exposure, noise exposure, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and/or concussion impact, defined as exposure/impact less than or longer than six months at time of enrollment.\n\n   (i) Participants enrolled with tinnitus associated with TBI and/or concussion must have received a diagnosis of TBI and/or concussion by a health care provider.\n\n   b) Stability: Constant (not pulsatile, intermittent, varying to a high degree in loudness or changing in location of perception). Fluctuating tinnitus reduces the reliability of test-retest measures for loudness.\n\n   c) Location of tinnitus perception: Unrestricted. Tinnitus may be unilateral, bilateral, or perceived in the head.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History or evidence of significant brain malformation, cerebral vascular events (such as strokes), neurodegenerative disorders affecting the brain (such as Parkinson's disease, ALS, Huntington's disease or Multiple sclerosis), or prior brain surgery.\n2. History of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n3. Active neoplasm such as lymphoma or solid tumors.\n4. History of neoplasm, excluding successfully treated squamous cell carcinoma or basal carcinoma of the skin or cervical cancer.\n5. Diagnosis of congestive heart failure.\n6. History of seizures or epileptic activity.\n7. Subjects with cardiac pace makers, other electronic implants (including cochlear implants), or intracranial or intraocular metallic particles.\n8. Subjects who currently have an active infection, including tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, and/or chicken pox.\n9. Scheduled to receive a live vaccine during study participation or received a live vaccine within 2 weeks prior to screening visit/procedures.\n10. Diagnosis of active neurologic disease, auto-immune disease, diabetes, or a weak immune system.\n\n    1. For the purposes of this protocol, \"active neurologic disease\" is defined as multiple sclerosis or any other disease involving demyelination disorder or any finding suggesting a demyelination disease or disorder. Migraines/migraine headaches are not a condition that would exclude a potential patient from participation in the study unless associated with a demyelination disease or disorder.\n    2. Autoimmune thyroid disease is not considered an exclusionary autoimmune disease for participation in this study.\n11. Ongoing treatment with one of the following contraindicated medications: abatacept or any other biologic therapy, cyclophosphamide or sulfasalazine.\n12. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with research team members or who are not likely to cope with the requirements of the trial.\n13. Subjects who have participated in a drug clinical trial within the last 30 days before the start of this one.\n14. Current substance abuse (defined as a score of 2 or greater on the CAGE Substance Abuse Screening Tool).\n15. Pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the study.\n16. Women who are lactating or are of child-bearing-age without use of contraception.\n17. Participation in greater than two previous clinical drug-trials for tinnitus.\n18. MMSE score \\< 24.\n19. Clinically significant out of range laboratory values (contact medical monitor to discuss).",
