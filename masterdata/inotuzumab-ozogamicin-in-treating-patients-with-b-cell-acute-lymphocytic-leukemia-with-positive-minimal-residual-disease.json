Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody called inotuzumab linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab ozogamicin attaches to B cell-specific CD22 cancer cells in a targeted way and kills them.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete morphologic remission with positive minimal residual disease (MRD) in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and MRD negativity rate by flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overall and after the first cycle, as well as safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this setting.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 day and then periodically every 6 months."
