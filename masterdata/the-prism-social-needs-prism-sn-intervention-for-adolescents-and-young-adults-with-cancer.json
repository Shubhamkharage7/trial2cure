The aims of this study are to:\n\n1. Determine if the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management - Social Needs (PRISM-SN) adapted intervention is feasible and acceptable, defined via program uptake and retention and patient-reported feedback.\n2. Explore whether PRISM-SN improves social outcomes at 12-week follow-up compared to usual care.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to receive usual psychosocial care or the PRISM-SN program. Participants on both arms will complete patient-reported outcome surveys at enrollment and 12-weeks later. Researchers will compare participants who received the PRISM-SN program to those who received usual care to see if the program improves psychosocial outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this randomized controlled trial, AYAs newly diagnosed with cancer will be recruited from two sites and randomly assigned to receive usual care alone or usual care with the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management - Social Needs (PRISM-SN) adapted program. PRISM-SN is a skill-based behavioral program that includes 4 core modules plus a newly developed social health module. Participants on both arms with complete a standardized patient-reported outcome survey assessing aspects of social and psychological functioning at enrollment and 12-week follow-up."
