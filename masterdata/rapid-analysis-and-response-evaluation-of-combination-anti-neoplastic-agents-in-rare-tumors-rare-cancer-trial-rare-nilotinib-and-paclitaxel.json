            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeople with rare cancers often have limited treatment options. The biology of rare cancers is not well understood. Researchers want to find better treatments for these cancers. They want to test 2 drugs that, taken separately, have helped people with non-rare cancers. They want to see if these drugs together can make rare cancers shrink or stop growing.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if nilotinib and paclitaxel will benefit people with rare cancers.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople age 18 and older who have a rare, advanced cancer that has progressed after receiving standard treatment, or for which no effective therapy exists.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have a pregnancy test if needed. They will have an electrocardiogram to check their heart. They will have imaging scans to measure their tumors.\n\nParticipants will repeat the screening tests during the study.\n\nParticipants will receive nilotinib and paclitaxel. The drugs are given in 28-day cycles. Nilotinib is a capsule taken by mouth twice a day. Paclitaxel will be given intravenously by peripheral line or central line once a week for the first 3 weeks of each cycle.\n\nParticipants will keep a medicine diary. They will track when they take the study drugs and any side effects they may have.\n\nParticipants may have optional tumor biopsies.\n\nParticipants can stay on the study until their disease gets worse or they have intolerable side effects.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up phone call about 30 days after taking the last dose of study drugs.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Rare tumors constitute a heterogeneous group of cancers associated with limited treatment options and poor outcomes. Due to their rarity, there are few good models for these diseases to support preclinical evaluation of new anticancer agents. To address these challenges, DCTD s Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) is generating patient-derived xenograft models of adult and pediatric rare cancers and has screened combinations of approved and investigational anticancer agents in these models.\n* Based on preclinical activity, drug combinations are being tested in patients with rare cancers in a series of connected Phase 2 clinical trials (Rapid Analysis and Response Evaluation of Combination Anti-Neoplastic Agents in Rare Tumors \\[RARE CANCER\\]); responses may trigger further evaluation of a treatment in that rare cancer type to further evaluate response rate and mechanism-of-action. Patients who progress will be offered another RARE CANCER trial.\n* The agents used in this trial are the BCR-Abl kinase inhibitor nilotinib and the anti-tubulin agent paclitaxel, which showed greater than additive activity in combination in preclinical xenograft models and subsequently demonstrated clinical efficacy (including partial responses) in patients with solid tumors on the Phase 1 trial 15-C-0086 (NCT02379416).\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n- To evaluate the proportion of patients with advanced rare cancers who have objective responses (OR) to treatment with nilotinib and paclitaxel\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\n* To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months on study agents\n* To identify genomic and transcriptomic determinants of response and resistance in tumor biopsy specimens\n* To examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that may be associated with response or resistance\n* To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination on biomarkers of cell death and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumor tissue and CTCs\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Study participants must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor meeting the RARECARE definition of rare tumor that has progressed on standard therapy known to prolong survival or for which no standard treatment options exist\n* Age \\>= 18\n* No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) or 5 half-lives of the agent, whichever is shorter; toxicity from prior treatment must have recovered to eligibility levels.\n* Adequate organ function; performance status ECOG 0-2\n\nStudy Design:\n\n* Nilotinib will be administered at 300 mg orally BID and paclitaxel will be administered IV at 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles.\n* A single-stage design will be used with a target accrual of 30 eligible patients. If at least 4/30 patients experience an objective response (PR or CR by RECIST 1.1), the combination of nilotinib and paclitaxel will be considered promising. The accrual ceiling is 34 patients."
