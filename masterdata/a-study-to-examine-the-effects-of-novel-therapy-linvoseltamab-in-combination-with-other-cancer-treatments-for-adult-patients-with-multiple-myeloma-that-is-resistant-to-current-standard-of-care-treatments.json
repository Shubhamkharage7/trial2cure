            "briefSummary": "This study is researching an experimental drug called linvoseltamab in combination with other drugs for the treatment of a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. Linvoseltamab has previously been studied as a single agent (without other cancer treatments) in participants with multiple myeloma that returned after prior therapies and needed to be treated again.\n\nIn the initial study, some participants treated with linvoseltamab had improvement of their myeloma, including complete responses (no evidence of myeloma in their bodies).\n\nThis study is the first time linvoseltamab will be combined with other cancer therapies.\n\nThe main goal is to understand if linvoseltamab can be given safely with other cancer treatments, and if so, what dose of linvoseltamab should be used for each combination.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* How many participants treated with linvoseltamab in combination with each of the other cancer treatments have improvement of their multiple myeloma\n* What side effects may happen from taking linvoseltamab together with another cancer treatment\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)"

In addition, all participants must have at least a 6-month washout from prior carfilzomib therapy.\n\nCohort 3: Prior treatment with lenalidomide is allowed if previously tolerated at the approved full dose. However, a participant cannot be refractory to any combination regimen that included 25 mg of lenalidomide. In addition, participants must have at least a 6-month washout from any prior lenalidomide therapy (including maintenance therapy).\n\nCohort 4: Prior treatment with bortezomib is allowed if previously tolerated at the approved full dose. Bortezomib-refractory participants may enroll in the dose finding portion provided they are triple-class refractory (PI, IMiD, anti-CD38 antibody). However, participants enrolled in the dose expansion portion cannot be refractory to bortezomib. In addition, all participants must have at least a 6-month washout from prior bortezomib therapy.\n\nCohort 5: Prior treatment with pomalidomide is allowed if previously tolerated at the approved full dose. Additionally, participants must undergo at least a 6-month washout following prior pomalidomide therapy before enrollment.\n\nCohort 6: Prior treatment with isatuximab is allowed if previously tolerated. Additionally, participants must undergo at least a 3-month washout following prior anti-CD38 antibody therapy before enrollment.\n\nCohort 7 and 8: RRMM with progressive disease and one of the following:\n\n* Received at least 3 lines of therapy including exposure to at least 1 anti-CD38 antibody, 1IMiD, and 1 PI or\n* Triple-class refractory disease (anti-CD38 antibody, IMiD, PI)\n\nCohort 9: each participant must have progressive RRMM and the following:\n\n* Received at least 3 lines of therapy and\n* Triple-class refractory disease (anti-CD38 antibody, IMiD, PI)\n\nGeneral Key Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
