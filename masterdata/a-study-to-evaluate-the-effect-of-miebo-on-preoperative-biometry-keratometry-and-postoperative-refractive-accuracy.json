Have any clinically significant ocular surface slit-lamp findings in the study eye and/or, in the opinion of the Investigator, have any findings that could interfere with trial parameters, including:\n\n   1. History of eye trauma\n   2. History of Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n   3. Active blepharitis or lid margin inflammation\n   4. DED secondary to scarring, irradiation, alkali burns, cicatricial pemphigoid, or destruction of conjunctival goblet cells (as with vitamin A deficiency)\n   5.

Use of any of the following ocular therapies in the study eye within 30 days prior to Visit 1: Vuity\u00ae, Qlosi\u2122, topical ocular steroid treatments, prescription dry eye therapy including varenicline nasal spray, or topical anti-glaucoma medication\n4. Had a LipiFlow\u00ae procedure, intense pulse light procedure, or any kind of other procedure affecting meibomian glands in the study eye within 3 months prior to Visit 1\n5.

Use of any eye drops (prescription or over-the-counter, such as artificial tears or Lumify\u00ae) and/orTrueTear\u2122 device (intranasal tear neurostimulator) in the study eye within 24 hours prior to Visit 1\n7. Have active ocular allergies or ocular allergies that are expected to be active during the trial period\n8. Have worn contact lenses within 1 month prior to Visit 1 or planned wear during the study\n9. Have undergone intraocular surgery or ocular laser surgery in the study eye within 3 months prior to Visit 1; have undergone refractive surgery in the study eye within 2 years prior to Visit 1\n10.

Female subjects of childbearing potential who are not using an acceptable means of birth control; acceptable methods of contraception include hormonal (oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal) contraception; mechanical (spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a diaphragm or condom) contraception; intrauterine device; or surgical sterilization of partner. For non-sexually active female subjects, abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of birth control; however, if the subject becomes sexually active during the trial, she must agree to use adequate birth control as defined above for the remainder of the trial.\n13. Have an uncontrolled systemic disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with the trial\n14. Have a known allergy and/or sensitivity to the investigational drug\n15.
