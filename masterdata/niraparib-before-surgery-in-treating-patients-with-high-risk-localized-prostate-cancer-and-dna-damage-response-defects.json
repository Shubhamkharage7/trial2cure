Niraparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the impact of neoadjuvant niraparib tosylate monohydrate (niraparib) therapy prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) on pathologic tumor stage, frequency of lymph node metastases and positive margin rates for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer with alterations in DNA repair pathways.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess 5-year biochemical recurrence in subjects with high-risk prostate cancer and DNA-damage response defects after prostatectomy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following completion of treatment, patients then undergo standard of care surgery.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years."
