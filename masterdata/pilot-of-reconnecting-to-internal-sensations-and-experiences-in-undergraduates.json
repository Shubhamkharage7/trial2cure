The intervention consists of four modules that focus on multiple aspects of interoception including: body awareness, body sensations/movement, eating, health and self-care, emotional awareness, and understanding the self in relation to others. The comparator condition is called \"Health Habits\" and is matched for time and attention; participants complete modules related to healthy habits such as financial planning, hygiene, stretching, and healthy eating. Variables of interest include self-report measures of interoception, eating pathology, suicidality, physiological measures of interoception (electrocardiograph; ECG; pain tolerance measured via algometer), and an implicit association test (IAT) with death and life stimuli (meant to measure implicit associations with suicidality). The population will be college students, with current or past suicidality or low interoception."
