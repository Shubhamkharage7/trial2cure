The medical, psychological, social and functional sequelae of dementia cause great stress to patients, their caregivers, and their family. The investigator proposes to examine effectivness of a home-based care coordination and management device, called Care4AD to help caregivers effectively coordinate, manage, and improve dementia care.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study the investigator will assess the effectiveness of a care coordination device (a supportive care device) called, Care4AD for reducing burden and stress of caregivers, enhancing patient adherence to scheduled tasks, and increasing Individuals with dementia activity (IWD). The investigator will conduct a 6-month prospective randomized control trial (RCT) of 100 persons with mild to moderately severe dementia to examine changes in caregiver's burden and stress and IWD's physical activity and adherence to scheduled ADLs. Feedback (e.g., reminders about completed/incomplete tasks) will be activated in the intervention group (IG) and de-activated in the control group (CG). The investigator will also use an ADL log and bi-weekly phone interview with a caregiver as gold standards to validate the detection of adherence to scheduled ADLs of interest. Furthermore, the acceptability, perception of benefit, and ease of use of Care4AD will be further assessed using technology acceptance model (TAM). We hypothesize that at 6 months, those in the IG compared to the CG will have less caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) (primary outcome), greater IWD adherence to scheduled ADLs (primary outcome), and higher IWD physical function and activity (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes will include caregiver coping (Brief Cope), self-efficacy (Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy), and preparedness (Preparedness for Caregiving Scale), and quality of life of IWD (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease scale)"
