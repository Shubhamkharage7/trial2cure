Tonation breathing techniques may help relieve pain in patients with stage I-III breast cancer who are receiving aromatase inhibitor.",

To study impact of active participation of patients in producing tones in combination with breathing technique, i.e., tonation breathing techniques (TBT) to reduce aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal symptoms.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients participate in tonation breathing techniques twice daily (or more if pain occurs) for 2 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaire at baseline and at 2 weeks."
