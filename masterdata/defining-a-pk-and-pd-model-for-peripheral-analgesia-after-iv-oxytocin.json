The main question it aims to define is the time course of change in pain score after a 5 minute heating of the skin administered at intervals during and following infusion of intravenous oxytocin in order to create a Pharmacokinetic and a Pharmacodynamic model for oxytocin-induced analgesia.\n\nParticipants will be asked to rate thermal heat temperatures before, during and after the intravenous infusion of oxytocin.",
