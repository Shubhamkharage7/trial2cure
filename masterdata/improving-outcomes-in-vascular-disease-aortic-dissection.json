Patients with uTBAD and no prior history of aortic intervention will be randomized within 48 hours to 6 weeks after index admission to one of the two initial strategies. Follow-up will be ascertained via a centralized call center and ascertainment of medical records, as well as remote blood pressure monitoring. Recommendations regarding medical therapy will be made to enrolling centers and feedback on the quality of medical care given, however, all subsequent care, with the exception of aortic interventions, will be at the discretion of the responsible clinical care team. Aortic interventions will allowable only as per protocol."

The LADs and documentation will be submitted within 2 years after publication of the primary results manuscript. Documentation will include copies of the case report forms; a list of derived variables and the formulas used to create them; and a codebook providing for each variable the variable name, coding conventions, and distribution of values. It will also include a list of data modifications made when creating the LAD, and a copy of the informed consent template, so that future use of the data will be consistent with the consent provided by the study subjects.The goal is to make data available to other investigators while protecting the rights and privacy of the subjects who participated in the studies. The SDCC will anonymize the datasets.",
