            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the physiological basis for the differences in weight regain among adults (25-59 years old) with obesity following participation in a behavioral weight loss program. Eligible participants will undergo a baseline evaluation after which they will enter an up to 20 week behavioral weight loss program with the goal of losing at least 7 percent of their baseline weight within 37 weeks. Participants who meet the weight loss goal will be asked to remain weight stable for 2 weeks after which they will undergo a clinical examination. They will then be observed for 1 year during which they will undergo 2 additional clinical examinations, one 4 months after completing the weight loss program, and the other 12 months after completing the weight loss program.",
