            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effects of a ketogenic diet on the progression and control of type 1 diabetes in children with newly diagnosed diabetes. The main questions to answer are:\n\n* Does a ketogenic diet prolong the honeymoon period of type 1 diabetes?\n* Does a ketogenic diet improve diabetes control?\n* Is a ketogenic diet safe, acceptable and sustainable in children with newly diagnosed diabetes?\n* What are the microbiome, inflammatory and metabolic changes linking diet to \u03b2-cell function?\n\nParticipants will receive a combination of free meals, groceries, micronutrient supplements, and intensive diet and diabetes education for 9 months.\n\n* Diabetes care devices will be connected for cloud-based data collection.\n* Bi-weekly data downloads and remote check-ins will assess dietary intake, satisfaction with diet and study procedures, and possible safety concerns.\n* During five study visits held at at baseline, 1, 5, 9 and 24 months, an intravenous catheter (IV) will be placed for collection of 5 blood samples before and up to 2 hours after a liquid test meal (protein shake) to assess insulin response. A stool sample will also be collected to assess microbiome changes.\n* Children and their caregivers will participate in a semi-structured interview, and online questionnaires to assess their experience with the diet and diabetes care, general well-being and quality of life.\n\nComparison will be made between a ketogenic vs standard diet.",
            "detailedDescription": "Type I diabetes is caused by an autoimmune destruction of insulin producing \u03b2-cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency. In the first months after diagnosis, a small number of \u03b2-cells typically remain and, by producing insulin, significantly improve diabetes control and reduce disease burden.\n\nPreliminary data suggest that this early disease stage entitled the \"honeymoon period\" might be extended by a ketogenic diet, which would provide a major therapeutic advantage and may reduce chronic disease burden.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that a ketogenic vs. standard diet will extend the honeymoon period and improve diabetes control in children, the researchers are conducting a study employing education and food deliveries of a ketogenic or standard diet to children and their families. Fifty-two children aged 5 to 12 years with newly diagnosed diabetes will participate. Children will be assigned by chance (randomized) to receive either a ketogenic or a standard diet for 9 months. Chances to be assigned to either diet are 50:50 like a coin flip, and 26 children will participate in each diet arm.\n\nParticipants will receive a combination of free meals, groceries, micronutrient supplements, and intensive diet and diabetes education throughout the 9 months. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and diaries will be used for cloud-based data collection. Bi-weekly data downloads and remote check-ins will be performed to assess dietary intake, satisfaction with diet and study procedures, and possible safety concerns. Participants are instructed to measure blood ketone levels with their home ketone meter anytime blood glucose levels exceed a safety threshold and to call the study physician for persistent low glucose levels or ketones above diet specific safety thresholds.\n\nStudy visits are held at at baseline, 1, 5, 9 and 24 months to collect height, weight, stool and blood samples for hormones, metabolites and inflammatory biomarkers. At each visit, an intravenous catheter (IV) will be placed to collect fasting blood samples, followed by a liquid test meal (protein shake) and collection of four additional blood samples from the IV over the course of two hours. Prior to each visit, participants will collect stool samples at home using provided kits. In addition, participants and their families will participate in a semi-structured interview, and online questionnaires to asses their food intake, experience with the diet, diabetes care burden and complications, and general well-being and quality of life."
