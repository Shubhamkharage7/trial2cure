            "briefSummary": "This randomized control trial aims to investigate whether writing about personal values helps enhance motivation to engage in physical activity, relative to general self-reflective writing. This study will help to (1) assess whether values clarification leads to increased motivation to engage in physical activity, greater stability in motivation, and improvements in engagement in physical activity and valued action, relative to engaging in self-reflection, (2) determine if the impact of values clarification on these outcomes vary depending on context (e.g., positive/negative affect, psychological inflexibility, stressful events), (3) explore whether values clarification procedures that employ distinct relational frames (hierarchical, conditional, distinction, and deictic) differentially impact motivation to engage in physical activity, and daily engagement in physical activity, and (4) explore whether the impact of values clarification vary depending on baseline self-compassion and/or intrinsic/extrinsic motivation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized control trial study aims to investigate the efficacy of a values clarification prototype mobile application intervention in increasing physical activity and enhancing motivation to exercise in a general, adult sample. Participants will be recruited using a variety of recruitment methods (e.g., Google Ads, posts on relevant online groups such as Facebook groups, posting flyers, and provider referrals). Interested participants will first complete an online pre-screening asking whether they are between the ages of 18 and 65, reside in the United States, want to increase their physical activity, own a device that can receive text messages, and have reliable internet access. Participants will also be asked about why they want to participate in the study, about their current level of physical activity and how they hope to change it, and about how they learned about the study. Those who meet the eligibility criteria in the pre-screening will be directed to review an online informed consent form. Those who indicate that they consent will be directed to provide their contact information (name, email, and phone number). A trained research assistant will call the participant to ask additional screening questions assessing all exclusion criteria (listed later in this registration). Eligible participants at this stage will be redirected to complete a baseline survey and then be randomly assigned to either the: (1) Experimental group with the values clarification mobile application or (2) the control group with the self-reflection mobile application. Participants will have access to the app hosted on Qualtrics for 28 days. They will first complete a tutorial, and then begin completing the daily surveys in addition to the writing prompts. Participants will receive daily text message reminders to use the app at a time that they specify. Four weeks after baseline, participants will be asked to complete a post-treatment survey and eight weeks after baseline, participants will be asked to complete a final, follow-up survey. Participants will be given the opportunity to use the alternative app at the end of the study."
