Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm which research has shown is related in part to obesity and diabetes.\n\nIt is anticipated that the participants treated in the metformin arm will have greater freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmias after ablation.\n\nEligible participants enrolled in the trial will be assigned to one of the treatment arms (no treatment or metformin) and have follow-up visits up to approximately 1 year after the ablation. Additionally, all patients will also receive education on lifestyle changes and exercise which are standard of care."
