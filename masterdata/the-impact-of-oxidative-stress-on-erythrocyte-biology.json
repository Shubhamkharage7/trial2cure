            "detailedDescription": "This prospective, phase II, crossover, single-blind, randomized transfusion order study will address if red blood cells from donors with a G6PD enzyme deficiency have a different lifespan once transfused into a patient with sickle cell disease than red blood cells from an otherwise normal donor. Results of this critical study will guide future research and donor testing policies to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate units of blood for their condition. Each patient randomized to the study will receive 2 blood transfusions, one from a G6PD deficient donor and one from an otherwise normal donor. Half the patients (8) will receive G6PD deficient blood first while the other half (8) will receive non-G6PD deficient blood first. Patients will have a wash-out period of at least 4 months before receiving the opposite type of blood transfusion. The blood transfusion order will be randomized. There is currently no standard of testing in place to screen blood donations for G6PD enzyme deficiency. It is believed that up to 10% of the antigen-matched donors for patients with sickle cell disease are G6PD deficient, and the lifespan is unknown in the sickle cell population."
