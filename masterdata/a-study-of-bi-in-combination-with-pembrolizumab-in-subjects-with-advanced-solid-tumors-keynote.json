Each of the 3 expansion cohorts will comprise a specific subset of subjects with advanced solid tumors (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and other tumor types known to be responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition).\n\nSubjects will initially receive 3 cycles of therapy with pembrolizumab in combination with BI-1206, either IV or SC.\n\nSubjects who show clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) at the Week 9 Visit may continue on combination therapy (pembrolizumab/BI-1206). Starting at Week 10, these subjects will receive additional cycles of pembrolizumab and BI-1206 every 3 weeks for up to 32 additional cycles or up to 2 years from their first dose of BI-1206 therapy or until progression."
