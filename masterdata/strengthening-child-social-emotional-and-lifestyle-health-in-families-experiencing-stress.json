            "detailedDescription": "Social-emotional difficulties and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are prevalent among children in the U.S. and are associated with negative health outcomes. These challenges are even more pronounced among families who deal with major stressors, such as parental trauma history and mental health difficulties, parental chronic illness (e.g., HIV), parental substance use, economic disadvantage, and racial discrimination. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a parent-based preventive intervention targeting parental self-regulation, stress reduction, and positive parenting, to promote child social-emotional and lifestyle behavior health, among families where the parents (a) have a child aged 3 to 9 years old, (b) have concerns about their child's behavior, mood, and/or lifestyle health, and (c) are experiencing major stressors. The intervention to be tested is based on Family Life Skills Triple P."
