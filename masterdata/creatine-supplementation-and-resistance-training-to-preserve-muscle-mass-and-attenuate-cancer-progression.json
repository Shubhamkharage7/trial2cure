            "detailedDescription": "This is a parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial to test the effects of 52-weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation with resistance training (Cr+RT) compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA+RT) with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) survivors receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We will evaluate muscle mass, health outcomes (fatigue, physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, quality of life), and markers or cancer progression (prostate specific antigen, cell-free DNA) at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will be carried out twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and we will utilize an established creatine monohydrate supplementation protocol for creatine and PLA delivery."

Creatine monohydrate supplementation increases availability of creatine and phosphocreatine in the skeletal muscle. Increased phosphocreatine enables greater buffering of adenosine triphosphate, an organic compound providing energy to cells, enhancing training volume (e.g., an individual can work-out harder and longer).This augmentation in exercise capacity amplifies training adaptations. Additionally, creatine monohydrate supplementation reduces levels of inflammatory markers, which are associated with severe muscle loss.",

In addition, the cancer exercise trainer will inquire about space availability in the home for completing resistance prior to developing the personalized prescription.
