            "briefSummary": "The investigators are developing a new, preventative physical therapy model of care for older adults called Mobility Checkup (MC). Proposed as an annual visit, the MC includes measurement of physical performance and education regarding the importance of maintaining mobility for overall health. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of and begin data collection for, a longitudinal study of the effectiveness of the Mobility Checkup with a small cohort. This activity will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment and implementation of this longitudinal effectiveness study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Healthy aging is defined as \"the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age\" and includes mobility. Mobility disability (i.e., the inability to walk 400 meters and climb a flight of stairs without assistance) is the most prevalent form of disability for older adults in the United States. Unlike blood pressure or body mass index, physical performance measures such as walking speed help identify and predict preclinical mobility disability, but are rarely used in routine medical care. This is a missed opportunity, particularly for older adults, who may experience a subtle decline in physical performance that leads to mobility disability.\n\nThe position of the American Physical Therapy Association is that all people should have an annual physical therapy visit to optimize movement and promote health, wellness, and fitness; and slow the progression of impairments of body functions and structures, activity limitations, and participation restrictions.\n\nRecommendations support preventive care for maintaining mobility. However, a model of care specific to preventing mobility disability in older adults is not common practice. Evidence suggests routine screening can predict mobility disability in older adults and that activity-based interventions prevent it.\n\nThe is year 1 of a longitudinal study that will determine the feasibility of an effectiveness study of a Mobility Checkup, an annual preventive visit within a model of physical therapy care. The Mobility Checkup prioratizes educating older adults on the value of physical performance as an indicator of health and aims to maintain mobility and reduce mobility disability among participants. Ultimately, this new model of care could result in a cost-effective tool to establish baseline physical performance and identify and prevent preclinical and mobility disabilities in older adults."

Participants are provided education structured into 4 elements. 1. They are told their performance scores 2. They are shown how their performance scores on each of the measures compare to age and sex-referenced normative values 3. They are provided information about what their performance predicts about their health 4.
