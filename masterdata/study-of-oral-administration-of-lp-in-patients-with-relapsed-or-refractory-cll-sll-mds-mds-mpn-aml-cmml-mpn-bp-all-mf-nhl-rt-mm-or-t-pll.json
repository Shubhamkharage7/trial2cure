Male subjects must refrain from sperm donation, from initial study drug administration until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.\n10. Subject must be able to understand and voluntarily sign and date an informed consent form (ICF), approved by an IRB, prior to any protocol-related procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA subject will not be eligible for study participation if he/she meets any of the following criteria.\n\n1. Subjects who have undergone autologous/allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy within 60 days of the first dose of LP-118, or subjects on immunosuppressive therapy post-HSCT at the time of Screening, or currently with clinically significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as per treating physician (Subjects in relapse after allogeneic transplantation must be off treatment with systemic immunosuppressive agents for at least 4 weeks. The use of topical steroids and/or up to 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent systemic steroids for ongoing GVHD is permitted.\n2. Subject has a history of other malignancies within past 12 months that are active and could result in competing risks. These cases shall be discussed with the Medical Monitor with the exception below.\n\n   * Subject with breast cancer or prostate cancer on endocrine therapy with stable disease;\n   * Continuation of maintenance therapy in patients with adequately treated malignancy\n   * Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri;\n   * Basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin;\n   * Previous malignancy confined and surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative intent.\n   * Cancer with expected survival of 2 years or more or that will not confound evaluation of LP-118 treatment\n3. Subject has received any of the following therapies within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of LP-118, or has not recovered to \u2264 Grade 2 clinically significant AEs of the previous therapy (excluding neuropathy):\n\n   * Any anti-neoplastic therapy including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, biologic or immunotherapy, targeted small molecule agents, etc. (corticosteroid therapy \\< 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent according to institutional guidelines to treat disease associated symptoms are permitted);\n   * For MF subjects who come off JAK2 antagonists, allow washout for 2 days as these subject's progress quickly after treatment discontinuation and remain eligible (steroids may be given during these two days to allow disease control).\n   * Subjects in need of immediate cytoreduction should be excluded.\n   * Any investigational therapy.\n   * Live vaccines\n4. Subject has received the following medications, therapies, or natural products within 7 days prior to the first dose of LP-118:\n\n   * Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) strong inhibitors (itraconazole, etc.), or substrates (Appendix 19);\n   * Subject has received strong Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inducers within 14 days prior to the first dose of LP-118 (Appendix 19);\n   * Grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Star fruit;\n   * There is a 28-day washout period required for subjects who have had prior CAR-T treatment if there is no evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or other adverse events related to the CAR-T treatment, per discussion with the Medical Monitor.\n5. Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would adversely affect his/her participation in this study. Any other medical or social condition deemed by the investigator to be likely to interfere with a subject's ability to participate in the study, place the subject at unacceptable risk or interfere with the interpretation of the results. For subjects who have required surgical intervention for any above diseases within the past 6 months, a discussion with the Investigator and the Medical Monitor is needed.\n6. Subject has baseline prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTcF) interval \u2265 480 ms (calculated per Fridericia's formula \\[QTcF = QT/RR (1/3)\\])), a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class \u2265 2 or associated other significant screening ECG or ultrasonic cardiogram abnormalities, per Investigator's judgement. For any subject with underlying RBBB or LBBB, cardiology review is needed to correct QTcF calculation using Sponsor recommended formula.\n7. Subject has significant a history of congenital long QT syndrome or Torsades de Pointes (TdP), uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to the first dose of LP-118.\n8. Subject exhibits evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not limited to:\n\n   * Uncontrolled active systemic infection (bacterial, fungal, viral);\n   * Known poorly controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C infection (active hepatitis B defined as HbsAg positive, or HbcAb positive with detectable HBV DNA load; active hepatitis C defined as HCV antibody positive with HCV RNA positive);\n   * Unexplained fever \\> 38.5\u00b0C within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug administration (at the discretion of the Investigator if the fever is considered attributed to the subject's malignancy or an explained infection may be enrolled).\n9. A female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n10. Subject incapacity to swallow oral medications, with any malabsorption condition, known dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs administered orally.\n11. Subjects with known and active central nervous system (CNS) involvement at Screening.\n12. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of LP-118 (see Investigators Brochure for a list of components).\n13. Subjects who are taking QT-prolonging drugs that are known to cause Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (See Appendix 17 for the list of medications that are associated with TdP). In the event a prohibited medication might cause TdP, the PI must first determine if the risk to benefit is in favor of the subject and then discuss with the Medical Monitor about that particular medication on a case-by-case basis.\n14. Major surgery within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.",
