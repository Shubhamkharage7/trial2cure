Clinical history and screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. If a subject is already on GlcNAc, a washout period of 1 month will be required prior to consent and randomization. Interested subjects who have a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of NGLY1-CDDG will be consented. Baseline data will be collected prior to randomization at treatment initiation. Subjects will then be randomized to placebo or GlcNAc. They will be administered weight-dependent doses of GlcNAc or an equivalent volume of placebo enterally for 6 weeks, followed by open label weight-dependent doses of GlcNAc for 6 weeks. A visit for evaluation and collection of lab samples will be conducted at 6 and 12 weeks."
