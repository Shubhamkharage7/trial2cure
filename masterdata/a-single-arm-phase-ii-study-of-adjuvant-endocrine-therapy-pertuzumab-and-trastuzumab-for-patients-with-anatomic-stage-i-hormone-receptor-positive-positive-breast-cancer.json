            "detailedDescription": "The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including laboratory evaluations, physical exams, questionnaires, and follow up visits.\n\n* Participants will receive HER2-directed treatment for 1 year and hormonal therapy for approximately 5 years.\n* It is expected that about 375 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug combination is being studied.\n\nThe drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both monoclonal antibodies, which are disease-fighting proteins made by cloned immune cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab + pertuzumab subcutaneous fixed dose combination (PHESGO) as treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. The FDA has also approved hormonal therapies as treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.\n\n."

ER- and PR-assays should be performed by immunohistochemical methods according to the local institution standard protocol.\n* HER2-positive by ASCO CAP 2018 guidelines, confirmed by central testing. See Appendix I for ASCO CAP 2018 HER2 testing guidelines.\n\n  * NOTE: DCIS components will not be counted in the determination of HER2 status\n  * NOTE: HER-2 status must be confirmed to be positive by central review prior to patient starting protocol therapy. Patients previously having had HER2 testing by NeoGenomics do not need to undergo retesting for central confirmation of HER2 status. A pathology report documenting testing by NeoGenomics should be provided at time of patient registration.\n* Bilateral breast cancers that individually meet eligibility criteria are allowed.\n* Patients with multifocal or multicentric disease are eligible as long as each tumor individually meets eligibility criteria, with the following exceptions: (1) central confirmation of HER2 status is needed only for any site of disease that is tested to be HER2-positive by local testing (unless original testing was done by NeoGenomics); (2) all areas that were locally tested for ER and PR status must be ER/PR positive (as defined above).\n* Patients with a history of ipsilateral DCIS are eligible as long as the patient has not received prior hormonal therapy. Patients with a history of contralateral DCIS are not eligible unless contralateral DCIS was diagnosed at least 15 years ago\n* \u2264 95 days between the date of protocol registration and the patient's most recent breast surgery for this breast cancer\n* Patients must have undergone definitive breast surgery for the current malignancy. All tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy), with either a sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection\n\n  -- All margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e. no tumor on ink). The local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology report. If all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed. Likewise, if all other margins are clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided the surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed. Radiation therapy to the conserved breast is required.\n* May have received up to 8 weeks of hormonal therapy as adjuvant treatment for this cancer. Patients should otherwise not have received prior hormonal therapy with the exception that hormonal therapy administered for less than 8-week duration at least 15 years ago is allowed.\n* Prior oophorectomy (including for cancer therapy) is allowed.\n* Patients undergoing breast conservation therapy (i.e. lumpectomy) must not have any contraindications to radiation therapy.\n* Patients who have participated in a window study (treatment with an investigational agent prior to surgery for \u22642 weeks) are eligible. Patients must have discontinued the investigational agent at least 14 days before participation in this study.\n* Men and women with any menopausal status \u226518 years of age\n* ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * ANC \u2265 1000/mm3\n  * hemoglobin \u22658 g/dl\n  * platelets \u2265 75,000/mm3\n  * AST and ALT both \\<5x institutional ULN\n  * Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 mg/dL. For patients with Gilbert syndrome, the direct bilirubin should be \\<institutional ULN\n  * Serum creatinine \u2264 2.0 mg/dL OR calculated GFR \u2265 30mL/min\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 50%\n* Post-menopausal patients must meet one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Prior bilateral ovariectomy/oophorectomy\n  * Age \u2265 60 years\n  * Age \\< 60 years with intact uterus and amenorrhoeic for \u2265 12 consecutive months prior to chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy exposure (medication-induced amenorrhea is not acceptable to meet this criterion)\n  * Age \\< 60 years hysterectomized and FSH and plasma estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range according to local policies prior to chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy exposure.\n* Willingness to discontinue contraceptive hormonal therapy, e.g. birth control pills, prior to registration and while on study\n* Premenopausal patients with intact uterus must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test, including women who have had a tubal ligation and women less than 12 months from their last menstrual period.\n* Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use one highly effective form of nonhormonal contraception or two effective forms of nonhormonal contraception by the patient and/or partner and continue its use for the duration of the study treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of antibody treatment and 3 months after the last dose of hormonal treatment.\n* Patients must be willing and able to sign informed consent.\n* Patients must be willing to provide archival tissue for research purposes.\n* If patient is English-speaking, must be willing to fill out patient questionnaires.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for this breast cancer prior to enrollment is prohibited.\n* Any of the following due to teratogenic potential of the study drugs:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (condoms, diaphragms, IUDS, surgical sterilization, abstinence, etc). Hormonal birth control methods are not permitted.\n  * Men who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (condoms, surgical sterilization, abstinence, etc).\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents for treatment of breast cancer, unless specific approval is obtained from the Sponsor-Investigator.\n* Locally advanced tumors at diagnosis, including tumors fixed to the chest wall, peau d'orange, skin ulcerations/nodules, or clinical inflammatory changes (diffuse brawny cutaneous induration with an erysipeloid edge)\n* Patients with a history of previous invasive breast cancer.\n* Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances:\n\n  * Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.\n  * individuals with the following cancer are eligible regardless of when they were diagnosed and treated: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin.\n* Intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active, unresolved systemic infection, renal failure requiring dialysis, active cardiac disease, prior myocardial infarction (asymptomatic changes on EKG suggestive of old MI is not an exclusion), history of CHF, current use of any therapy specifically for CHF, uncontrolled hypertension, significant psychiatric illness, or other conditions that in the opinion of the investigator limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nTime and Motion Substudy Eligibility:\n\n* Participant must be enrolled at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\n* Participant must not have discontinued pertuzumab following treatment cycle 1\n* Participant must be able to tolerate subcutaneous administration following cycle 1",
