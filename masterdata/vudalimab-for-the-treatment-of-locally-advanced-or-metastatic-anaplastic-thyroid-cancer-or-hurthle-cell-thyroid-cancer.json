Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as vudalimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the antineoplastic efficacy of vudalimab (XmAb2071) in anaplastic thyroid cancer, as measured by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who have received XmAb20717 therapy.\n\nII. To estimate 16-week progression-free survival (PFS-16) in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who have received XmAb20717 therapy.\n\nIII. To estimate overall survival (OS) in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who have received XmAb20717 therapy.\n\nIV. To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who have received XmAb20717 therapy.\n\nV. To calculate the duration of response (DOR) in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who have responded to XmAb20717 therapy.\n\nVI. To calculate the duration of clinical benefit (DoCB) in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who have received XmAb20717 therapy.\n\nVII. To assess the toxicity profile of XmAb20717 in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer, according to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To conduct correlative, translational research to identify markers associated with response to XmAb20717 (i.e., neo-epitopes) and to explore the immune microenvironment in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer and Hurtle cell cancer.\n\nII. To administer XmAb20717 to a small, exploratory cohort of patients with Hurtle cell thyroid cancer (HCC) to obtain pilot efficacy, safety, and correlative data for this population.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive vudalimab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years."

Women must also not donate eggs during this same period\n  * Contraception Requirements for Males: With a female partner of reproductive potential, males must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective method of contraception while receiving trial therapy and for 5 months following completion of trial therapy. Men must also not donate sperm during this same period\n  * With a pregnant female partner, males must remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom while receiving trial therapy and for 5 months following completion of trial therapy to avoid exposing the embryo\n\n    * A female subject is considered to be of reproductive potential (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) unless it is documented that she meets either of the following two criteria:\n\n      * Has reached a postmenopausal state (\\>= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause)\n      * Has undergone surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy for removal of uterus and/or ovaries)\n\n        * Sexual abstinence is permitted only if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception\n        * Highly effective methods of birth control include hormonal birth control (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, implantable, or intrauterine devices \\[IUDs\\]), IUDs (non-hormonal), male vasectomy, or any double-barrier method (combination of male condom and spermicide with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge)\n* Females of reproductive potential must agree to undergo a serum pregnancy test (i.e., human chorionic gonadotropin test) prior to start of treatment on day 1 of each cycle, and the result must be negative in order to initiate and continue treatment\n* Subjects (or subject's legally authorized representative if subject has impaired decision-making capacity) must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document for study-specific procedures and treatment, prior to registration on trial\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects must not have a known history of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to XmAb20717 or any of its excipients\n* Subjects must not have previously received XmAb20717\n* Subjects must not have received prior CTLA4 antibody or PD-1/PD-L1 therapy\n* Washout from prohibited anti-cancer therapy: Subjects must not currently be receiving anticancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, investigational anticancer agents, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologics, anti-cancer radionucleotides, other systemic anticancer agents, etc.)\n\n  * For subjects with HCC, all anticancer therapies (with the exception of surgery) must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the initiation of trial therapy\n  * For subjects with ATC, all anticancer therapies (with the exception of surgery) must be discontinued at least 1 week prior to the initiation of trial therapy\n\n    * Notes: There is no required washout from prior surgical procedures. Due to the aggressive nature of ATC, wherein the disease progresses extremely rapidly, a 2-week washout from prior anticancer therapy is not indicated for this patient population. A 1-week washout is selected for ATC (due to it being aggressive), while a 2-week washout is selected for HCC (due to it being less aggressive)\n* Washout from prohibited concomitant medication: Subjects must not have any condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids, prednisone equivalents, or other immunosuppressive medication. Corticosteroids, prednisone equivalents, and other immunosuppressive medications must be discontinued within 14 days prior to first dose of trial therapy (except that inhaled or topical corticosteroids or brief courses of corticosteroids given for prophylaxis of contrast dye allergic response are permitted)\n* Washout from prohibited concomitant vaccine: Subjects must not have received a live-virus vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial therapy. Subjects must not have received any other vaccine within 24 hours prior to the first dose of trial therapy. Note that while the majority of seasonal influenza vaccines (e.g., intramuscular route) do not contain live virus, the intranasal Flu-Mist is considered a live attenuated vaccine.\n* Subjects must not have a known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously adequately treated brain metastases may participate, provided they are clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of trial therapy\n* Subjects must not have a known or suspected active autoimmune disease (except that subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo; type 1 diabetes mellitus or residual hypothyroidism due to an autoimmune condition that is treatable with hormone replacement therapy only; psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or another autoimmune skin condition that is managed without systemic therapy; or arthritis that is managed without systemic therapy beyond oral acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; or celiac disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically-controlled)\n* Subjects must not have received an organ allograft\n* Female subjects must not be pregnant or intending to conceive from the time of informed consent through 8 months after the last dose of trial treatment. (These subjects are excluded because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events to the developing fetus)\n* It is unknown whether XmAb20717 is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, women who are breastfeeding are not eligible for enrollment\n* Subjects must not have evidence of any serious bacterial (including tuberculosis), viral (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \\[SARS CoV-2\\] and influenza), parasitic, or systemic fungal infections within the 30 days prior to the first dose of trial therapy\n\n  * NOTE: Tuberculosis, SARS CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019 \\[COVID-19\\]), and influenza testing are not required, unless clinically indicated or mandated by a local health authority\n* Subjects must not have a history or evidence of any other clinica",
