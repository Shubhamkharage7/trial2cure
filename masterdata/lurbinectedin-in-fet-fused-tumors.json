Ewing sarcoma is driven by the Ewing Sarcoma-Friend Leukemia Integration 1 Transcription Factor (EWS-FLI1). Lurbinectedin has been shown to inhibit EWS-FLI1 and Ewing Sarcoma-Wilms' Tumor Gene 1 (EWS-WT1) in preclinical models. Therefore, the goal of this study is to see if Lurbinectedin can be used to inhibit EWS-FLI1, EWS-WT1, or other FET fusion proteins to drive tumor responses in patients."
