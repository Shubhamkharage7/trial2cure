The study will use four transformational innovations for eliminating barriers to high quality mental health services for families of young children (2-5 years old) from low-income, under-resourced communities through a partnership with Head Start programs in urban and rural communities in Maryland: 1) test an adaptation of a validated group-based parenting skills and support program (Chicago Parent Program) developed in collaboration with African American and Hispanic parents from low-income communities, for use with individual families (CPPi) concerned about the participant's preschool children's mental health; 2) embed CPPi in a trusted community-based agency long committed to a 2-generation social service model of supporting families from low-income communities; 3) use human centered design strategies to co-create a CPPi referral and enrollment strategy with parents and staff that is welcoming, culturally appropriate, consistent with Head Start's service delivery processes, and eliminates the stigma associated with children receiving a psychiatric diagnosis (as is typically required for reimbursement in traditional child mental health settings); and 4) capitalize on the knowledge, experience, and holistic orientation of registered nurses (RNs) to implement CPPi in Head Start. Children's behavior problems collected at baseline and post-intervention data from the parent and teacher's perspectives. Parent satisfaction with CPPi is measured at post-intervention only."
