Baseline visit data will be collected retrospectively (chart review).\n\nThe Year 1 visit is defined as the visit that occurs 1 year (-2/+6 months) since the Baseline visit during which period the subject is wearing test lenses of the same design in both eyes, and a contact lens examination is performed. Year 1 data will be collected either retrospectively or prospectively (eye exam)."
