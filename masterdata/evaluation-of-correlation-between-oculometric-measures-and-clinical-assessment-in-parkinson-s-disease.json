This study aims to evaluate the correlation between oculometric measures and clinical assessment over time, as well as the potential to detect early change in clinical status using an oculometric assessment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an multicenter longitudinal study, in about 300 patients with idiopathic PD in several centers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlations between oculometric measures and clinical assessment, e.g. the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the MoCA score over time ,in subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and who provide a signed Informed Consent. In addition, the investigators aim to demonstrate that oculometric measures are able to detect patient deterioration faster than can be detected using the currently available clinical assessment tools. All patients will be assessed over a period of 12 months (5 assessments, at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 months). During this time period, every subject who consents will undergo a NeuraLight session including oculometric measurements and eye-tracking recordings using a novel software-based platform and an eye- tracking system (Tobii, CE-marked class B approved device) (approx. 30 minutes). The oculometric evaluation will occur for every patient every 3 months. All assessments will be performed during a clinic visit unless authorized to be conducted remotely. During the study, the sponsor will be blinded to the private details of the subjects."
