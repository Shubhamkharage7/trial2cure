Participants who want to start the FDA approved cabotegravir long acting injectable medication for PrEP will have the option participating in surveys and a review of their electronic health records. Medication will be administered based on FDA approved labeling guidelines and their PrEP care will be part of standard of care per CDC.\n\nPharmacists who want to provide the service to their patients will have the option of participating in surveys pre and post implementation."
