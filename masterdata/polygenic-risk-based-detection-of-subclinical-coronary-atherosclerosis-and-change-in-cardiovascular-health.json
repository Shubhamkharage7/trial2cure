Participants will be randomized into two equal groups: one group will receive their high polygenic risk result for coronary artery disease at baseline, and the other group will receive their result after study completion at 1 year. Change in cardiovascular health as measured by the American Heart Association Life's Essential 8 score from baseline to one-year will be compared."
