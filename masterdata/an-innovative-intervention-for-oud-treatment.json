            "briefSummary": "The Bridge Device (BD) is a neuromodulator medical device that has been cleared by the FDA for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment. Importantly, medical devices reviewed by the FDA are cleared (based on safety) rather than approved (based on efficacy), which means the BD did not need to demonstrate efficacy before it became commercially available. As a result, the device was not required to have a sham-controlled trial for FDA clearance and there is no active research, to the investigators' knowledge, that specifically addresses the degree to which opioid withdrawal can be treated through neuromodulation. To rigorously evaluate the efficacy of the BD for treating OUD, the investigators will enroll persons with active OUD, not currently receiving medications for OUD. Participants will be recruited and admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for a 2-3 week period. During participants' residential stay, participants will be stabilized for 7-11 days on four times daily morphine (30 mg, SC) and undergo a precipitated withdrawal challenge using the opioid antagonist naloxone, approximately \\>= 4 days of morphine maintenance. This is a standard practice for the investigators' study and allows the investigators to objectively assess dependence. The BD and study medication will begin following morphine stabilization. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions (1) active BD with placebo (BD/P), (2) sham BD with lofexidine (SBD/L), or (3) sham BD and placebo (SBD/P). Participants will use the BD for 5 days and will receive study drug for 7 days. Participants will be monitored for an additional 4 days after device removal to determine whether withdrawal resumes. Participants will undergo a second naloxone challenge after removal of the device/capsule completion to verify lack of opioid tolerance and will be encouraged to begin treatment with oral naltrexone followed by extended release naltrexone. Throughout the residential stay, all participants will be given referral to and assisted with engaging in outpatient treatment following study discharge."
