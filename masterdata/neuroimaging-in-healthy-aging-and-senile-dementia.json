The study involves imaging the brain to detect the presence of amyloid deposits (plaques in the brain). Amyloid is a protein that may be related to dementia of Alzheimer's disease (DAT).\n\nThis study will use radioactive tracers called C-11 Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) and F 18/ AV-1451 (Flortaucipir) which binds to beta amyloid and tau in the brain. These compounds are considered investigational, which means that they have not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
