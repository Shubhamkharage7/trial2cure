            "briefSummary": "Hypertensive disorders (HD), including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia, affect around 10-20% of pregnant women in the United States and are significantly associated with maternal mortality and morbidity, particularly in the postpartum period. The prevalence of HD is on the rise in the United States and has increased from 13% in 2017 to 16% in 2019 owing to an increase in advanced maternal age, obesity, and diabetes. There are major racial disparities in HD and subsequent maternal mortality and morbidity. HD affect more than 1 in 5 delivery hospitalizations of Black women. Black women with HD are also more likely than white women with HD to have more adverse postpartum blood pressure trajectories which leads to a higher incidence of hypertension related hospital readmissions (readmission for hypertension during the first 6-weeks postpartum: 16.9% among Black women vs. 9.5% among white women, p=0.02) and cardiovascular-related adverse events. However, most of the management recommendations have been centered around blood pressure targets during the antepartum period with significantly less attention paid to the postpartum period despite evidence showing that hypertensive disorders are the most common reason for postpartum readmissions and are associated with increased maternal mortality and morbidity and a significant cost burden.",
