            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine whether it is possible for people with lower limb amputation (LLA) to perform adapted tap dance, whether an adapted tap dance program would be enjoyable, and whether it may improve balance and balance confidence.\n\nThere is a lack of research investigating therapeutic interventions for people with lower limb amputation (LLA). Tap dance encourages balance and novel movements of the limbs, while providing auditory feedback from the feet that provide information about the foot's contact with the ground, which may help prosthesis users gain a better ability to understand where their prosthetic foot is in space. As with most forms of dance, tap is usually taught and practiced in a group setting, which encourages community involvement. It has been shown to be safer than many forms of dance due to low impact forces. It also, as a genre, can incorporate canes, chairs and partner work, providing the ability to modify steps/moves when required so that they remain practical, achievable and safe for people with mobility limitations, while still enabling participation. It therefore may be an accessible dance medium to help improve balance, balance confidence, and build community for people with LLA.\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* come to 1 hour dance classes, once per week, for 8 weeks.\n* do mobility tests before and after the program\n* complete questionnaires before, during and after the program. The total time for participation is approximately 8-10 weeks."
