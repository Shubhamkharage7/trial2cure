Participants will complete daily self-monitoring of eating behaviors (timing of meals and snacks; whether or not a binge occurred) throughout treatment. Treatment sessions involve a self-help component, which includes brief videos that participants watch at home. Treatment sessions also involve a guidance component (brief consultation), which is 15-30 minutes on a secure videoconferencing platform (e.g., Zoom) between the therapist and the participant. These sessions focus on clarifying material, reviewing self-monitoring and looking for patterns, and problem-solving maladaptive thinking patterns and binge behaviors.",
