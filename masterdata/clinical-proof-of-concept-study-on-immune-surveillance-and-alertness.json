This study involves twenty-four participants composed of healthy adults, who will be taking either a placebo or supplement at different times. Testing for immune status, cytokine levels, and immune responsiveness will be conducted to determine the acute impact of the supplement on immune function compared to a placebo.\n\nLong term effects and lingering effects will be tested using the same parameters, following a consumption period of one week, as well as a washout period of one week.",
            "detailedDescription": "Clinical-proof-of-concept study comparing the acute immune effects as well as the lasting and lingering effects of a dietary supplement, and a placebo. The dietary supplement is composed of whole Euglena gracilis algae, produced using a proprietary fermentation technique.\n\n24 subjects will participate in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over study design, wherein they will be taking placebo, or dietary supplement each separated by a 1-week washout period to evaluate rapid effects. Following which the subjects will also be taking placebo or dietary supplement continuously for 1 week each, to evaluate the long term and lingering effects.\n\nFor acute evaluation, blood samples are taken 1 hour after participants arrive, the dose is then administered. Samples are take 1 hour and 2 hours following administration. For long-term and lingering evaluation, blood samples are taken 1 hour after participants arrive. At all blood sample collections, a spit sample will also be taken for salivary IgA testing.\n\nA series of immune panels will be used to determine the acute impacts on immune surveillance, immune cell activation status, immune cell priming, and cytokine profiles. Ex vivo immune challenges and salivary IgA testing will be used to determine the direct impacts on immune cells."
