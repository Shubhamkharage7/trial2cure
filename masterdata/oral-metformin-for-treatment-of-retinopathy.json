            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nABCA4 retinopathy is a genetic disease in which the ABCA4 protein is absent or faulty. It can cause waste material to collect in the eye and may cause cells to die. The cell death can lead to vision loss. Researchers want to see if an oral drug called metformin can help.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if metformin is safe and possibly helps to slow the rate of ABCA4 retinopathy.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople age 12 and older who have ABCA4 retinopathy and have problems with their vision.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened under a separate protocol.\n\nParticipants will have a medical and family history. They will complete a questionnaire about their vision and daily activities. They will have a physical exam. They may have blood drawn through a needle in the arm.\n\nParticipants will have an eye exam. Their pupils may be dilated with eye drops. Their retina may be photographed.\n\nParticipants will have a visual field test. They will sit in front of a large dome and press a button when they see a light within the dome.\n\nParticipants will have an electroretinogram. It examines the function of the retina. They will sit in the dark for 30 minutes. Then their eyes will be numbed with eye drops. They will wear contact lenses that can sense signals from the retinas. They will watch flashing lights.\n\nParticipants will have optical coherence tomography. This non-invasive procedure makes pictures of the retina.\n\nParticipants will have fundus autofluorescence. A bright blue light will be shone into their eye.\n\nParticipants will take metformin by mouth for 24 months.\n\nParticipants will have study visits every 6 months. Participation will last for at least 36 months....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nABCA4 retinopathy is an autosomal recessive progressive retinal dystrophy that leads to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor degeneration, with consequent central visual loss. A treatment that either reduces the rate of lipofuscin accumulation or improves the clearance of lipofuscin in the RPE could potentially slow the degeneration associated with this disease. Metformin hydrochloride is a well-characterized, commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic medication that acts by suppressing liver gluconeogenesis and increasing peripheral insulin sensitivity.\n\nAn additional effect of metformin is to increase macroautophagy via the Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/AMP-activated Kinase (AMPK) pathway; stimulation of this pathway would be predicted to enable the RPE to more efficiently handle lipofuscin. This suggests an association between metformin use and slowing of retinal degeneration. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and potential efficacy of oral metformin in slowing the rate of change in photoreceptor degeneration in ABCA4 retinopathy.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the safety and potential efficacy of oral metformin in slowing the rate of change in photoreceptor degeneration in ABCA4 retinopathy.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: The difference in growth rate of square-root transformed area of EZ band loss (square-root AreaEZloss), from OCT, between the pre-treatment phase and 24 month metformin treatment phase.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Proportion of participants with a 30% reduction in growth rate of square-root AreaEZloss during the treatment phase compared to the pre-treatment phase, changes from baseline to Month 24 in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) total letters read, perimetry, and color fundus photography measurements and the change in rate of area of atrophy enlargement between the pre-treatment and 24-month metformin treatment phase."

Once participants \\>=17 years of age reach 2000mg metformin immediate release they will switch to an extended-release formulation (1000mg twice a day by mouth). Participants \\>= 17 years of age that cannot tolerate 2000mg will be permitted to reduce their daily dose to a minimum of 1000mg/day. Because metformin extended release is not FDA-approved for children under the age of 17, participants under 17 will remain on the immediate release formulation.

Participant must agree to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration.\n6. Any female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and be willing to undergo urine pregnancy tests throughout the study.\n7. Any female participant of childbearing potential must:\n\n   * Have had a surgical sterilizationa OR\n   * Completely abstain from intercourse OR\n   * Practice at least one form of contraceptionb during the study and at least one week after IP discontinuation OR\n   * Have a partner who had a surgical sterilization OR\n   * Have a partner who practices one form of contraception for the duration of the study and at least one week after the female participant discontinues IP.\n\nAny male participants must:\n\n* Have had a surgical sterilization (a) OR\n* Completely abstain from intercourse OR\n* Practice at least one form of contraception (b) throughout the study and at least for 3 months after IP discontinuation OR\n* Have a partner who had a surgical sterilization OR\n* Have a partner who practices one form of contraception for the duration of the study and at least 3 months after the male participant discontinues IP.\n\n  1.
