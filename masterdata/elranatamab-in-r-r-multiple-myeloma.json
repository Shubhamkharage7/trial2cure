            "detailedDescription": "This is an open label phase II study that will enroll patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after four or more lines of therapy who received idecabtagene vicleucel as standard of care.\n\nThe research involves study visits and receiving the study drug. Participants will receive the study drug, elranatamab, for up to 6 months and will be followed for as long as they remain in the study, until confirmed progressive disease (disease worsening), or until initiation of other myeloma treatment.\n\nElranatamab is a type of antibody (a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances) that works by binding to both T-cells (part of the immune system) and myeloma cells. The drug then activates T-cells to kill the myeloma cells. In this study we are researching whether multiple myeloma progresses after elranatamab administration. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved elranatamab as a treatment for any disease.\n\nIt is expected that about 32 people will take part in this research study."

Platelet transfusion support is permitted if completed at least 7 days prior to planned start of dosing.\n  * Hemoglobin \u22658 g/dL. Red blood cell transfusion support is permitted if completed at least 7 days prior to planned start of dosing.\n  * Calculated creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n  * Patient has adequate hepatic function, as evidenced by each of the following:\n\n    * Serum total bilirubin \\<2 mg/dL; and\n    * Serum aspartate transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) values \\< 2.5 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN) of the institutional laboratory reference range. Patients with elevated bilirubin due to Gilbert's syndrome may be permitted with PI approval (e.g. total bilirubin \\<3 mg/dL and normal direct bilirubin).\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. (Providing consents in as many languages as possible is encouraged)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with smoldering MM, plasma cell leukemia, POEMS syndrome, or amyloidosis are excluded from this trial.\n* Stem cell transplant within 12 weeks prior to enrollment or active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n* Active hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), HIV, or any active, uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. Active infections must be resolved at least 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular diseases, defined as any of the following within 6 months prior to enrollment:\n\n  * Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes (eg, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary angioplasty or stenting, symptomatic pericardial effusion);\n  * Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (eg, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or uncontrolled paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia);\n  * Thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events (eg, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis \\[unless associated with a central venous access complication\\] or pulmonary embolism);\n  * Prolonged QT syndrome (or triplicate average QTcF \\>470 msec at screening).\n* Any other active malignancy within 3 years prior to enrollment, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ.\n* Ongoing Grade \u22652 peripheral sensory or motor neuropathy.\n* History of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) or GBS variants, or history of any Grade \u22653 peripheral motor polyneuropathy.\n* Previous treatment with an anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) bispecific antibody.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because elranatamab is an anti-BCMA bispecific antibody agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with elranatamab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with elranatamab.\n\nKnown or suspected hypersensitivity to the study intervention or any of its excipients.\n\nParticipants who are receiving any other investigational agents for this condition (if appropriate only).\n\nLive attenuated vaccine must not be administered within 4 weeks of the first dose of study intervention.\n\nToxicity from previous anticancer therapy must resolve to baseline levels or to grade \u22641, except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nOther surgical (including major surgery within 14 days prior to enrollment), medical or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study.\n\nPrevious administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study intervention used in this study (whichever is longer).",
