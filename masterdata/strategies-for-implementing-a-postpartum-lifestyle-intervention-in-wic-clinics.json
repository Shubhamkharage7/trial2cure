In this effectiveness-implementation type III cluster-randomized trial, we will compare two implementation strategies for DPP delivery: an in-person health coach-led implementation strategy (standard 24 in-person sessions) vs. a multifaceted technology-assisted health coach implementation strategy (12 in-person sessions supplemented by technology tools).\n\nEighteen clinics will be randomized to the multifaceted technology-assisted health coach strategy and 18 to the in-person health coach-led strategy. A total of 900 postpartum participants (25 per clinic) will be recruited into the study and followed for 12 months for implementation and effectiveness outcomes. A post-intervention study visit will take place 6 months after the end of the 12-month intervention to evaluate the sustainability of the implementation strategies."
