            "briefSummary": "This is the first ever comparative effectiveness study of an antibiotic-sparing novel self-management intervention to prevent complicated urinary tract infection (UTI).",
            "detailedDescription": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common outpatient infection world-wide, and for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurogenic bladder (NB), it is the most common infection, secondary condition, cause for emergency room visits, and infectious cause of hospitalization. Despite its prevalence, attempts to ameliorate UTI among people with SCI are stymied by long-standing diagnostic challenges which arise from evidence gaps around \"gold standard\" diagnostic tests (urinalysis and urine culture) that have lower sensitivity and specificity for UTI in this population. A high prevalence of chronic inflammation leading to persistence of white blood cells (WBC) in the urine confounds the utility of WBC count, pyuria, and leukocyte esterase as biomarkers for UTI; nitrites in urine indicate the presence of only specific (but not all) organisms, many of which are present to a greater extent in the urine of people with SCI; and people with SCI have a high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. These physiologic changes render the gold standard diagnostic tests less useful for identifying UTI in persons with SCI.\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 1 Compare the effects of Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG (LGG\u00ae) + Saline bladder wash (BW) versus BW alone on USQNB-determined bladder (B1) and urine quality (B2) symptom burden (two co-primary outcomes) where participants self-manage in response to two trigger symptoms (cloudier and/or more foul-smelling urine).\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 2 Compare the effects of LGG\u00ae+BW versus BW alone (in response to the two trigger symptoms) on key secondary outcomes: number of days lost from rehabilitation, work, and/or school; number of days symptomatic; number of interactions with the health care system due to urinary symptoms; exposure to antibiotics (days, volume).\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 3 Compare the prophylactic effects of LGG\u00ae+BW versus BW alone on USQNB-determined bladder (B1) and urine quality (B2) symptom burden.\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 4 Compare the prophylactic effects of LGG\u00ae+BW versus BW alone on key secondary outcomes: number of days lost from rehabilitation, work, and/or school; number of days symptomatic; number of interactions with the health care system due to urinary symptoms; exposure to antibiotics (days, volume).\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 5 Compare satisfaction of participants who instilled LGG\u00ae+BW to satisfaction of those who instilled BW only and determine if dropouts are differentially attributable to either intervention being perceived by participants as \"not working\"."
