Part 1/Phase 1 of the study will be conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of CHO-H01 in subjects with relapsed/refractory CD20+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It will also determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D).\n\nPart 2/Phase 2a will assess the anticancer activity and safety of CHO-H01 plus lenalidomide in subjects with low-grade relapsed/refractory CD20+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "Phase I FIH study includes subjects with relapsed/refractory CD20 + non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who may benefit from treatment with CHO-H01. In Phase I of the study, the first 2 cohorts will follow a 2-step modified accelerated titration dose escalation design and subsequent cohorts will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation design.\n\nThe investigational medicinal product, CHO-H01, will be administered via IV infusion once weekly for 4 weeks in Cycle 1 and then once only (on Day 1) in each subsequent 21-day cycle until disease progression or for up to 6 cycles (19 weeks) of treatment.\n\nOnce the MTD/RP2D has been confirmed, Phase IIa of the study will be initiated. The purpose of Phase IIa is to assess anticancer activity and safety of CHO-H01 plus lenalidomide in low-grade relapsed/refractory CD20 + non Hodgkin's lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma (Grades 1-3a), marginal zone lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma."
