Participants will be given actigraphs to wear around their waists starting 3 weeks prior to bone marrow transplants until they are discharged from the hospital. Participants will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires and hand grip tests at three separate time points during their hospitalizations. All data gathered from these activities will be compared with patients' activity levels gathered from the actigraphs both before and during the hospitalization. This study is designed to determine the relationship between activity levels and length of stay, quality of life, and hand grip strength."
