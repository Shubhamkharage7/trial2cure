            "detailedDescription": "This pilot project is novel in that it (a) interweaves positive parenting practices, ethnic-racial socialization, and healthy lifestyle behaviors into a prevention program for Black and Latinx families, and (b) targets preschool-aged children using a brief, universal prevention approach, which increases potential for dissemination and scalability. The guiding hypothesis is that incorporating these components into a parenting intervention will lead to improvements in children's health as compared to a control condition. A type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design is used to simultaneously test intervention effectiveness while also gathering information on intervention delivery to inform future implementation trials. The specific aims are to: (a) test the preliminary effects of a preventive intervention on the social-emotional functioning and healthy lifestyle behaviors of Black and Latinx children, (b) identify the preliminary effects of the intervention on parenting outcomes, and (c) examine potential barriers and facilitators to intervention delivery."
