            "briefSummary": "Large for Gestational Age (LGA) infants have excess fat-mass (FM) proportion secondary to prolonged in utero exposure to an energy-rich environment. Our preliminary data suggest that excess FM proportion can be associated with oral feeding delay and a potentially modifiable therapeutic target to improve oral feeding outcomes. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of a short-term Fat-free mass (FFM)-indexed feeding on the oral intake volumes in LGA infants with oral feeding difficulties.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eligible subjects will be randomized to an innovative FFM-indexed feeding or the standard feeding for up to 2 weeks. The essential component of the FFM-indexed feeding will be the difference in milk prescription dosing that we propose to set the feeding volume to index FFM rather than total mass. In FFM-indexed feeding, there will be a permissive feeding volume restriction to 150 \u00b1 10 mL/kg (FFM)/day without increasing the milk calorie density or changing the type of formula milk, whereas the standard feeding will include a feeding volume goal of 150 \u00b1 10 mL/kg (body weight)/day. Infants will receive either breast milk or formula feedings per the standard feeding protocols. Body composition (PEAPOD system) and appetite-regulating hormones (ARH) levels of enrolled infants will be assessed at baseline (test-1) and at the end 2-week study intervention period (test-2). Subjects will be followed for clinical and growth outcomes until neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge and through 6 months of age. Growth will be followed through 6 months of age by retrieving anthropometric measurement records from pediatricians at well-child visits (2-, 4-, 6- and 6-month visits). Parents will be called at these time points to obtain a history of any further feeding difficulties."
