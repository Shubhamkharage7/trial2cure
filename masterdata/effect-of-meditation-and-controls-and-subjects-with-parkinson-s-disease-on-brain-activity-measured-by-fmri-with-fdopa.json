            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to use 18 F Fluorodopa positron emission tomography (FDOPA PET) to measure dopamine function, and utilize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in persons with Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe overall goal of this study will be to further the understanding of the effects of a novel meditation technique called orgasmic meditation (OM) on these neurophysiological parameters.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this study is to further the understanding of the physiological and psychological effects and dopaminergic function of OM in couple pairs in a control group and in couples in which one member has Parkinson's disease (PD). This study will utilize F-18 Fluorodopa (FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging which utilizes an experimental radioactive tracer called FDOPA which helps to evaluate the activity in the dopamine neurons in the brain. A secondary goal of this study is to determine whether undergoing OM meditation alters body or brain physiology, and to measure whether there is an effect on intimacy and sexual dysfunction in women with PD.\n\nThis study is designed to understand the changes that occurs when subjects undergo intense meditation or meditation induced by sensory stimulation and structured touch. This study is designed to allow researchers to understand the changes in couple-pairs that occur when subjects undergo a shared meditation practice. Since meditation practices are widely used by individuals, the Investigators hope that a better understanding of the effects of meditation practices will provide information regarding potential clinical uses.\n\n80 subjects will be enrolled (6 healthy couple pairs) and 30 couple pairs in which one female member has PD. The Investigators will also for a 10% attrition to enroll a total of 72 subjects.\n\nFor evaluation of the dopamine function, \\[F-18\\] Fluorodopa (FDOPA), dose (5-10 millicurie (mCi), \u00b1 20%) will be injected intravenously into an antecubital vein. Subjects will be premedicated with 200 mg of carbidopa orally approximately one hour prior to injection.\n\nFDOPA has been available for over 30 years but has not been previously approved for commercial use by the FDA. The Investigators will be obtaining the FDOPA from the University of Pennsylvania cyclotron that has produced FDOPA for many Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) It will also be beneficial to assess whether there are specific changes in levels of different molecules that are related to energy consumption and oxidative stress. Proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) has been previously performed in Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonian syndromes to evaluate in vivo concentrations of basal ganglia and cerebral cortex metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr)."
