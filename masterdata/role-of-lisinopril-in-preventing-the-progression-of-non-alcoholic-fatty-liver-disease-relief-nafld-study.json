            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates how well lisinopril may work in preventing the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a condition where there is an accumulation of fatty cells in the liver. NAFLD increases a person's risk of developing liver cancer. Liver fibrosis is the common finding of chronic liver diseases leading to reduced liver function. Lisinopril is a medication that is commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Lisinopril may help to decrease liver fibrosis. The purpose of this trial is to find out what effect, if any, lisinopril has on a patient's risk of developing liver cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis will demonstrate a change in PRO-C3, a marker of liver fibrosis, following 24 weeks of treatment with lisinopril.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Noninvasive measures of fibrosis and steatosis:\n\nIa. Change from baseline in PC3X (cross-linked multimeric PRO-C3);\n\nIb. Change from baseline in steatosis, as measured by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) or liver ultra-sound attenuation (LiSA), determined with transient elastography:\n\nIc. Change from baseline in liver stiffness as measured with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE); Id. Change from baseline in liver stiffness as measured with transient elastography; Ie. Changes from baseline in Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS); If. Change in inflammatory markers (caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18 \\[CK-18\\], NF-kappaB, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive lisinopril orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 24 weeks in absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo transient elastography during screening and on study. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study and may undergo a proton density fat fraction (PDFF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRE on study.\n\nPatients are followed up at 32 weeks after the start of study medication."

Changes in categorical variables will be analyzed using the Stuart-Maxwell test of marginal homogeneity.

Changes in categorical outcomes from pre- to post-treatment will also be categorized as improvement versus (vs.) no improvement (i.e. no change or worsening in steatosis grade), and logistic regression models will be used to examine association with baseline characteristics.",

For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Diastolic blood pressure \\>= 60 and =\\< 110 mm/Hg\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior or current use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) within 0-24 weeks prior to enrollment\n* Glomerular filtration rate =\\< 30 ml/min (for both male and female participants)\n* History of decompensated liver disease, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or high-risk variceal bleeding\n\n  * NOTE: Trace ascites documented by radiology is permitted\n* History of other causes of liver disease, including but not limited to alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, autoimmune disorders (primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or autoimmune hepatitis), drug-induced hepatotoxicity, Wilson's disease, iron overload, or alpha-1-antitryspin deficiency\n* History of liver transplantation\n* History of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis\n* History of weight reduction surgery in the past 2 years or planned during the study\n* Within 6 months prior to the date of the screening visit, there must be no history of the following cardiac events: unstable angina; myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty; transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident; emergency room visit or hospitalization for confirmed cardiovascular disease\n* Participants taking vitamin E \\>= 800 IU/day must be on a stable dose, defined as no changes in prescribed dose, new vitamin E-containing medications, or discontinuation for at least 180 days prior to the date of the screening visit and throughout study participation\n* Participants taking anti-diabetic medications must be on a stable dose for at least 90 days prior to the date of the screening visit and in the period between the date of the screening visit and enrollment\n* Current alcohol consumption \\> 21 oz/week for males or \\> 14 oz/week for females (1 oz/30 mL of alcohol is present in one 12 oz/360 mL beer, 4 oz/120 mL glass of wine, and a 1oz/30 mL measure of 40 proof \\[20%\\] alcohol)\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents, at the time of the screening visit, or in the prior 30 days, or within 5 half-lives of the prior investigational agent (whichever is longer)\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to lisinopril\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV patients may develop fatty liver as well as advanced fibrosis due to many causes including metabolic syndrome, hyperuricemia, HIV-related lipodystrophy, genetic polymorphisms, medications, and HIV itself. As the natural history of fatty liver in this population is largely unknown, these patients will be excluded from this study\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lisinopril is an ACE Inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lisinopril. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lisinopril\n* Systolic blood pressure \\>= 161 mm/Hg. Diastolic blood pressure \\>= 111 mm/Hg\n* Participants taking lithium",
