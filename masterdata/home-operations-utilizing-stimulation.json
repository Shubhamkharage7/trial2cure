            "detailedDescription": "The vagal nerve is a major component of the autonomic nervous system and mediates the physiological responses of major organs during moments of stress and learning, including brain areas that modulate cognitive performance. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been indicated to improve stress response and to enhance neuroplasticity by directly impacting brain structures critical for cognition. Historically, VNS methods required neurosurgery and were reserved for medically intractable epilepsy or other severe conditions. Today, vagal nerve stimulation can be performed with a minimal-risk non-invasive approach without surgery through a technique called transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation (tVNS). This project will utilize a home-operated stimulator in healthy young adult and healthy older populations to provide a proof of concept of practical home-use stimulation."
