            "briefSummary": "This is a two arm, pilot randomized control trial (RCT) in which 60 African American women (AAW), 40-64 years of age, with HbA1c \u22658% and multi-caregiving responsibilities will be recruited from communities in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and randomized to either: 1) an individual-based, social support, health educator-facilitated intervention to address multi-caregiving responsibilities (n=30), or 2) individual-based, health educator-facilitated diabetes education and skills training and general health education (n=30). All sessions will be delivered via telephone (i.e., landline, mobile device, smart device, etc.) by a health educator (i.e., nurse, social worker, Master's trained health educator) and is comprised of 12 weekly sessions and 3 booster sessions. Each session will last up to 60min. All study assessments will be administered by a Program Assistant at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this multi-caregiving intervention on improving outcomes among AAW, ages 40-64 years with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and multi-caregiving responsibilities using a pilot randomized design compared to diabetes enhanced usual care. The goals of the study will be assessed under the following specific aims:\n\nAim 1: To determine the feasibility of the multi-caregiving intervention as measured by recruitment, session attendance, retention, and treatment adherence in AAW with T2DM\n\nAim 2: To test the preliminary efficacy of the multi-caregiving intervention on glycemic and blood pressure control in AAW with T2DM compared to individual-delivered, health-educator led diabetes enhanced usual care at 6 months Hypothesis 1: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c at 6 months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care Hypothesis 2: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant reductions in blood pressure at 6 months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care\n\nAim 3: To test the preliminary efficacy of the multi-caregiving intervention on self-care behaviors and quality of life in AAW with T2DM compared to individual-delivered, health educator led diabetes enhanced usual care at 6 months Hypothesis 1: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant improvements in self-care behaviors (diet, physical activity, medication adherence, and blood glucose monitoring) at 6 months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care Hypothesis 2: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant improvements in quality of life (SF-12 scores) at 6 months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care\n\nIn the final 6-month assessment, study participants will be asked to participate in 30 to 40-minute, semi-structured interviews by telephone. Findings will help refine the intervention and emphasize elements that enhance participant uptake and motivation for sustained behavior change for the future R01."
