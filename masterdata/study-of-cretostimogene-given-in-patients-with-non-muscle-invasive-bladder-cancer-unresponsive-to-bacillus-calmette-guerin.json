Up to approximately 115 CIS bladder cancer patients with or without HG Ta or HG T1 papillary disease will be enrolled under the original protocol through Amendment 4, which will comprise Cohort C. Cohort C is closed to enrollment.\n\nUnder Amendment 5-1, Cohort P was added to enroll up to 70 patients with HG Ta/T1 papillary bladder cancer.\n\nUnder Amendment 6, the target number of patients enrolled in Cohort P was increased to 75. Cohort P is open to enrollment\n\nCohort C and Cohort P will be analyzed and reported separately. Patients will have had to fail prior BCG therapy which is defined as having persistent or recurrent disease within 12 months (Cohort C) or 6 months (Cohort P) following the completion of adequate BCG therapy for HGUC",

Patients with BCG unresponsive CIS are those unlikely to benefit from, and who will not be receiving, further intravesical BCG.

Specifically, the definition of BCG unresponsive CIS will also require the following:\n\n  * Pathologically confirmed relapsed or persistent CIS (with or without HG Ta or HG T1 disease) within 12 months of completion (last dose) of adequate BCG treatment for HGUC (e.g., CIS, HG Ta, HG T1, or a combination of these HGUC pathologies).\n  * Completion of qualifying BCG treatment (e.g., \"5+2\" minimum exposure) within 12 months of the initial qualifying dose of BCG (e.g., induction and initial maintenance or re-induction cycle must be completed over no more than a 12-month period of time).\n  * Pathological confirmation of BCG unresponsive CIS within 8 weeks of study enrollment.\n  * CIS specimen must be predominantly urothelial (transitional cell) and have less than 50% variant (e.g., sarcomatoid, squamous etc. component) histology.\n  * No maximum limit to the amount of BCG administered but maintenance BCG should be administered on a schedule consistent with the SWOG 8507 regimen (Lamm 2000).\n* Have all Ta and/or T1 disease resected and all CIS resected or fulgurated, as feasible, prior to study treatment (e.g., prior to Day 1 treatment).\n* Ineligible to receive radical cystectomy (medically unfit) or refusal of radical cystectomy according to Investigator assessment.\n* Demonstrate adequate organ function\n* Patients must be willing to comply with study mandated cystoscopies, urine cytology, urograms, biopsies, and other procedures (including TURBT or other resection for all Ta/T1 disease) for the duration of the study.
