All eligible participants will be initiated on OCR using the standard approved administration schedule of two 300 mg infusions separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 0 and 14) for a total of 600 mg, followed by 600 mg infusions at Month 6 and Month 12. At Month 12, participants will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of three Arms with randomized treatment beginning at Month 18: Arm 1: placebo infusions every 6 months; Arm 2: OCR infusions at Months 18 and 24 and then after Month 24 switch to placebo infusions every 6 months; Arm 3: OCR infusions every 6 months. The treatment period will be for a total of 48 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study of OCR treatment-discontinuation in patients with early RMS. All eligible participants will be initiated on OCR using the standard approved administration schedule of two 300 mg infusions separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 0 and 14) for a total of 600 mg, followed by 600 mg infusions at Month 6 and Month 12. At Month 12, participants will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of three Arms with randomized treatment beginning at Month 18: Arm 1: placebo infusions every 6 months; Arm 2: OCR infusions at Months 18 and 24 and then after Month 24 switch to placebo infusions every 6 months; Arm 3: OCR infusions every 6 months. The treatment period will be for a total of 48 months.\n\nThe study will consist of the following periods, with participants undergoing study assessments, including physical exams, neurological exams, EDSS, LCLA, SDMT, MFIS, MSQOL-54, PHQ9, EQ-5D-5L, and frequent co-registered research-quality MRI to sensitively assess for new inflammatory disease activity (new or enlarging T2 lesions), under schedules described in detail below. Biological sampling includes blood samples for functional immune profiling and stool samples for microbiome studies. Biomarker-based assessments are to include but not be limited to NfL and B cell levels.\n\nScreening Period:\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, all screening assessments, and procedures to establish eligibility will be performed. These may be completed during one or more study visits within the 30-day screening window. Biological sampling will include 2 samples obtained prior to initiation of OCR treatment.\n\nOpen-label Treatment Period:\n\nParticipants that meet all eligibility criteria for enrollment will be initiated on OCR using the standard approved administration and will be followed for 12 months under the standard of care clinical efficacy and safety monitoring described below. Biological sampling occurs at 6 months and then at 12 months, with 2 samples to be taken prior to randomization (14 days +/- 7 days of randomization and on the day of randomization). Participants who discontinue study therapy during the open-label treatment period are asked to return for the scheduled study visits at Month 6 and Month 12 only, if these have not already occurred.\n\nBlinded Treatment Period:\n\nAt Month 12, participants will be randomized (1:1:1) to either: (Arm 1) placebo infusions every 6 months; (Arm 2) continue OCR for another 12 months and then switch to placebo infusions; or (Arm 3) continue with OCR infusions every 6 months. The blinded treatment period will extend to Month 48 or until new disease activity is observed. All participants in the blinded treatment period will be closely monitored clinically and with frequent research 3Tesla (3T) MRIs using a standard protocol that assesses for the development of any new inflammatory disease activity observed following randomization. The development of such new inflammatory disease activity will represent the primary study endpoint. It will be defined as any one or more of the following: (1) one or more new clinical relapse(s) (see relapse definition) or (2) MRI evidence on frequent (every 3 months) serial scans of new disease activity. The central imaging analysis will identify incident new or enlarging MRI T2 lesions as compared to prevalent brain lesions documented in each participant from time of randomization (Month 12) and thereafter.\n\nFrequent biological sampling will include blood samples collected every 3 months and stool samples collected every 6 months through the 48-month end of study.\n\nUnblinded Follow-up period:\n\nFor participants who discontinue study therapy before Month 48, including those meeting the primary endpoint by manifesting new disease activity following randomization as defined above, blinded treatment allocation will be revealed and discussed, as described in section 3.5.1. Participants may receive OCR or other treatment and are to continue with study assessments per the schedule of events.\n\nFunctional immune response profiles of reconstituting B cells as well as non-B cells (T cells and myeloid cells) will be compared between participants who do, versus those do not, benefit from durable remission of relapsing biology, to identify cellular immune response profiles that may underlie the state of durable tolerance versus lack of durable tolerance.\n\nSafety Follow-up:\n\nParticipants who are treated with OCR through Month 48 will have a phone visit 6 months after their last dose. If there are safety concerns, the participant can be brought in for an unscheduled visit."

Examples of contraceptive methods include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone- releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices\n   3. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n   4. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply with study protocol\n2. History of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS), Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS), or Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS)\n3.

History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal antibodies\n9. Significant, inadequately controlled (e.g. diagnostic evaluations indicated or change in medications warranted) disease, such as cardiovascular (including cardiac arrhythmia), pulmonary (including obstructive pulmonary disease), renal, hepatic, endocrine, and gastrointestinal or any other significant disease that in the opinion of the investigator may preclude participant from participating in the study\n10. Functional status of NY Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or higher for heart failure at the screening visit\n11. Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial infection or other infection (including tuberculosis \\[TB\\] or atypical mycobacterial disease but excluding limited superficial fungal or viral infections of the skin or nails) or any severe episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with Intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to baseline visit\n12.
