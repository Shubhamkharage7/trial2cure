            "detailedDescription": "This Phase 1-2 study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of OR2805, a fully human IgG1 antibody that binds specifically to CD163, in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of three parts:\n\n* Part A: a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), maximum achievable dose, or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of OR2805 given alone or in combination with cemiplimab or docetaxel in a maximum of approximately 54 subjects.\n* Part B: an expansion phase in subjects with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with OR2805 as monotherapy at the RP2D or OR2805 in combination with cemiplimab or docetaxel. Up to approximately 20 subjects will be treated in each arm of the 3 Part B cohorts to further characterize safety and determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity.\n* Part C: a biology cohort of up to approximately 40 subjects at the RP2D to determine the mechanism of action and potential predictors of response and pharmacodynamic markers in subjects with liposarcoma, leiomyocarcoma, or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) or are not otherwise eligible for Part B. All subjects in Part C will undergo biopsies."

Subjects eligible for targeted therapies to EGFR, ALK, ROS, RET or NTRK (e.g., crizotinib) must have previously received and exhausted such therapies. Prior therapies may have been administered alone or in combination. Subjects must have received prior PD-(L)1-based therapy as the most recent prior therapy and demonstrated progression while on that therapy.\n\n   ii.

Subjects eligible targeted therapies to EGFR, ALK, ROS, RET or NTRK (e.g., crizotinib) must have exhausted such therapies. Prior therapies may have been administered alone or in combination.

Part C (biology cohort): subjects other than those with liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, or SCCHN must have experienced PD on an established standard medical anti-cancer therapy for a given tumor type or have been intolerant to such therapy, or in the opinion of the Investigator have been considered ineligible for a particular form of standard therapy on medical grounds and must have no available demonstrated curative or life-prolonging therapies. Subjects with liposarcoma must have dedifferentiated liposarcoma, have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, and require additional treatment. For leiomyosarcoma, subjects must have received at least 1 prior therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. For SCCHN, subjects must have received 1 prior line of chemotherapy and a PD-1- or PD-L1-targeted agent alone or in combination with chemotherapy unless contraindicated. No more than 2 chemotherapy regimens in the advanced setting for SCCHN are allowed. All subjects must have demonstrated progression on the most recent line of therapy.\n5. Subjects must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. Subjects in Part C must have at least one 1 lesion amenable to biopsy and that is not to be used for response assessment per RECIST v1.1.\n6. If not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, subjects must be willing to practice at least one of the following highly effective methods of birth control for at least a menstrual cycle (or partner's menstrual cycle, for male subjects) before and for 3 months after study medication administration: (1) true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, from sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex; (2) sexual intercourse with vasectomized male/sterilized female partner; (3) hormonal female contraceptive (oral, parenteral, intravaginal, implantable, or transdermal) for at least 3 consecutive months prior to investigational product administration (when not clinically contraindicated as in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers); (4) use of an intrauterine contraceptive device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system.\n7. Resolution of prior-therapy-related AEs (excluding alopecia and grade \u2264 2 peripheral neuropathy) to \u2264 grade 1 per CTCAE v5.0, and no treatment for these AEs for at least 2 weeks prior to the time of enrollment. Electrolyte and hormonal supplementation may be used to treat these AEs provided the subject is stable on these supplements.\n8. Minimum of 2 weeks since the last dose of other hormone therapy and 3 weeks since the last dose of other systemic cancer therapy or radiotherapy (\\> 4 weeks in case of nitrosoureas or radio-immuno conjugate therapy). Adjuvant hormonal therapy (for example tamoxifen) is allowed provided the original tumor diagnosis was more than 3 years before the first dose of study medication.\n9. Subjects must have adequate organ function.\n10. All subjects must be able to supply an archival tumor biopsy specimen. For Part C (biology cohort), subjects must consent to a newly obtained tumor biopsy (that can be biopsied based on Investigator's assessment) and to providing the acquired tissue for biomarker analysis. An additional on-treatment biopsy is required for subjects in Part C.\n11. Subject is able and willing to comply with the protocol and the restrictions and assessments therein.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another mAb.\n2. Subject has ECOG PS \\> 2.\n3. Life expectancy \\<12 weeks.\n4. Prior organ or stem cell transplant.\n5.

Subjects who have symptoms consistent with CNS metastasis, must have a negative MRI during in the screening period.\n7. Subject has a known history of a hematologic malignancy, malignant primary brain tumor, or another malignant primary solid tumor (other than that under study), unless the subject has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease for at least 3 years.\n8.
