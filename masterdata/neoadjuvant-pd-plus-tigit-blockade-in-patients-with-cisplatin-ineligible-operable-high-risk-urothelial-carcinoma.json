Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\<1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n\nd. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

With a female partner of childbearing potential, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of \\<1% per year during the treatment period, for up to 90 days after the final dose of the study drugs. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n2. With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period for 90 days after the final dose of the study drugs to avoid exposing the embryo.\n3. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n4. Men who would like to father a child after study treatment initiation should be advised regarding the conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility resulting from drugs used in this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Illness or condition that may interfere with a patient's capacity to understand, follow, and/or comply with study procedures\n2.
