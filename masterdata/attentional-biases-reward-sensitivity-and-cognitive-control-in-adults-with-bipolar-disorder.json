Two facial expressions (happy-neutral, sad-neutral, fearful-neutral, and neutral-neutral) from the same actor are presented simultaneously on each side of the screen. For each participant, happy, sad, fearful, and neutral facial expressions are randomly assigned to each side with each emotion category presented on each side with equal frequency. Each trial presents happy-neutral, sad-neutral, fearful-neutral and neutral-neutral facial expression in a new random order for each participant. Each trial begins with a central cross, followed by presentation of facial stimuli for 250-500 ms. Direction of gaze is measured with x and y coordinates. The latency and velocity of eye movement will be measured. Eye movements that are stable for more than 100 msec within 1\u02daof visual angle are classified as a fixation.
