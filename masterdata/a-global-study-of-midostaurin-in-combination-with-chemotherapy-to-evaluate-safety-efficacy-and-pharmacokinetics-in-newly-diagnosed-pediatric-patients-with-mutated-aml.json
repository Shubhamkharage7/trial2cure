            "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy in pediatrics patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The study has two parts: Part 1 to define the Recommended Phase 2 Dose, and Part 2 to evaluate safety and tolerability and efficacy of midostaurin. Both parts will consist of 2 induction blocks, 3 consolidation blocks, 12 cycles of post-consolidation consisting of continuous therapy with midostaurin, and a follow-up phase.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial is an open label, multi center single arm study to evaluate twice daily oral midostaurin with standard induction, consolidation chemotherapy with sequential midostaurin therapy for 5 treatment blocks (2 induction blocks, 3 consolidation blocks, followed by single agent midostaurin post consolidation therapy for 12 cycles).\n\nThe total maximum planned duration on treatment is 17 cycles (5 blocks and 12 cycles). A block is defined as the time from start of study treatment to the time of hematopoietic recovery, at the latest at Day (D) 42, or determination of persistent disease, whichever occur first.\n\nIn both Part 1 and Part 2, patients will receive the first course of induction chemotherapy according to local standard and duration is from 8 to 12 days. Upon FLT3 mutation confirmation, patients will receive midostaurin for 14 days. After determination of remission and hematopoietic recovery, patients will receive Block 2.\n\nIn Part 1:\n\n* Block 2 FLADx treatment duration is D1 to D6, and midostaurin from D8 to D21. Patients who achieve documented CR (and hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 2) will receive Block 3.\n* Block 3 consolidation HAM treatment duration is D1 to D4, followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 3 will receive Block 4. Patients who relapse will discontinue further study treatment.\n* Block 4 HA3E treatment duration is D1 to D5 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 4 will receive Block 5.\n* Block 5 HiDAC treatment duration is D1 to D3 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients who relapse will discontinue further study treatment.\n\nPatients in continuous remission with hematopoietic recovery will receive continuous post consolidation therapy of midostaurin, during 12 cycles (28 days per cycle).\n\nIn Part 1 of the study, patients in cohorts of 3 will receive sequential midostaurin administered at 30mg/m2bid. If the 30mg/m2 bid is well tolerated as measured by the Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT) rate during Bock 1, additional patients in cohort of 3 will be treated with sequential midostaurin at 60mg/m2 bid. When the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is confirmed, subsequent patients will be treated in Part 2 of the study at the RP2D.\n\nIn Part 2:\n\n* Block 2 HAM treatment duration is D1 to D4 and midostaurin from D8 to D21. Patients who achieve documented CR (and hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 2) will receive Block 3.\n* Block 3 consolidation HA3E treatment duration is D1 to D5, followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 3 will receive Block 4. Patients who relapse will discontinue further study treatment.\n* Block 4 HAM treatment duration is D1 to D4 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 4 will receive Block 5.\n* Block 5 HiDAC treatment duration is D1 to D3 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients who relapse will discontinue further study treatment.\n\nPatients in continuous remission with hematopoietic recovery will receive continuous post consolidation therapy of midostaurin, during 12 cycles (28 days per cycle). Patients who relapse will discontinue further study treatment."
