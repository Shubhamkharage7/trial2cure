At or near the time of discharge, enrolled participants will be randomized to receive the EGS-Delirium Recovery Model or usual care. The hypothesis is that, after 18 months, older EGS delirium survivors who are randomized to the EGS Delirium Recovery Model will experience more favorable cognitive, physical and psychological recovery in comparison to those randomized to usual care."
