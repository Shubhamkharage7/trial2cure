There are no readily available sources of longitudinal CSF, plasma or serum samples from people with ALS, ALS-FTD or similar neurodegenerative disorders or their family members for use in the identification of potential ALS biomarkers. Future research will examine potential biomarkers in blood and CSF collected over time to see if they change over time and can be used to diagnose and monitor people with ALS."
