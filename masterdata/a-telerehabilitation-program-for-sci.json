            "briefSummary": "This study evaluates a remotely supervised, home-based therapeutic program to improve upper-limb voluntary movement in adults with tetraplegia caused by incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI).",
            "detailedDescription": "Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) has been associated with serious reduction in functional independence. Despite compelling evidence that treatment intensity has a profound effect on motor recovery only a small fraction of SCI population are able to receive intensive in-clinic treatment. Difficulty traveling to the clinic, poor adherence to assignments and high cost are limiting factors. Currently, telerehabilitation programs are emerging as an alternative effective method of delivery for rehabilitation services. The literature and our preliminary findings support the model that augmentation of activity in spared corticospinal tract (CST) axons is a critical mechanism of motor improvement, and furthermore that CST activity can be increased by repetitive motor training and by electrical stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1). However, there is still lack of knowledge on safety, feasibility and efficacy of remotely- supervised home-based therapy programs that incorporates non-invasive brain stimulation and high intensity repetitive arm exercises. To address these questions, 36 adults (above 18 years) with cervical SCI will be randomly assigned to two groups in a 2:1 ratio (active stimulation group, n=24 vs control group, n=12) and receive daily treatment, 10 sessions, over 2-weeks. The anodal tDCS will be applied over primary motor cortex (M1) at an intensity of 2mA for 20 minutes and proceed with 60 minutes of repetitive arm and hand training. Primary outcome measure is change in Graded and Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP) from baseline to immediately after treatment and 4-weeks follow-up. The session will be supervised in real-time via videoconferencing."
