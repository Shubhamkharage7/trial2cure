Patients with hematologic malignancies are excluded, except for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who are considered stable and not on active treatment.\n* Any acute or chronic psychiatric problems, alcohol abuse, or substance abuse disorders that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the requirements of the study.",
