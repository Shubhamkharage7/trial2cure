            "briefSummary": "The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention designed to prevent nurse suicide. This randomized controlled trial will test the modified Interactive Screening Program (mISP) alone and the mISP combined with a program called MINDBODYSTRONG.\n\nThe mISP is a method of screening to detect clinicians at moderate to high risk for suicide and referring them for treatment through an encrypted anonymous on-line platform. MINDBODYSTRONG\u00a9 is an adaptation of a well-tested cognitive-behavioral skills building intervention (also known as COPE in the literature) that provides a cognitive-behavior theory-based approach to decrease depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation and improve healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors in at-risk populations. MINDBODYSTRONG\u00a9 will involve eight self-paced computerized sessions designed specifically for nurses and clinicians. Nurses will be recruited nationally through the professional nursing organizations and health systems.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will be the first to test the combination of the mISP with a new on-line digitalized version of the previously tested manualized version of the CBSB program (i.e., MINDBODYSTRONG\u00a9) for nurses. If found to be effective, the combined program will be able to be easily scaled to prevent suicide in nurses and potentially other high-risk populations of clinicians. Although CBT is gold standard evidence-based treatment for depression, only a small percentage of affected individuals receive it due to a shortage of mental health providers, which contributes to high depression relapse rates of 50 to 70%. A scalable digitalized intervention could be one key solution to bringing CBT skills to nurses at risk for suicide who could so benefit from them. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will determine the effects of the mISP, this adaptation of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention's (AFSP) Interactive Screening program (ISP), combined with the on-line version of the MINDBODYSTRONG\u00a9 program versus the HEAR program alone on depression, suicidal ideation, burnout, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, healthy lifestyle beliefs, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and job satisfaction in U.S. nurses."
