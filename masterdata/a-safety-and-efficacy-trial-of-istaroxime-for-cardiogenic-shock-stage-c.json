These patients look unwell, frequently with a sudden change in mental status, mottled and cool extremities, and delayed capillary refill, as well as signs of congestion and relative low blood pressure and signs of hypoperfusion (reduced oxygen to organs) which frequently require support with rescue therapies including inotropes, vasopressors, or mechanical devices.\n\nWindtree Therapeutics, Inc. has been studying istaroxime, which has the potential to treat patients in this condition without some of the disadvantages of existing therapies being used to treat patients with acute heart failure and CS.\n\nParticipants enrolled in this trial will receive standard of care (SoC) therapy for heart failure and CS. Additionally, half of the participants will be randomly chosen to receive istaroxime. Istaroxime has the potential to increase blood pressure and improve cardiac function."
