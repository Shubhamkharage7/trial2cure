As technology changes and we start to use new testing methods, it is necessary to compare results from old tests, equipment and devices and new tests, equipment, or devices and the reproducibility of these measurements to make sure we are getting accurate results. Reproducibility means performing the same test more than once to see if the same results can be achieved each time."

Measurements will be made by: using different assays to determine best conditions of measurement, or repeat testing on different days. Endothelial cells will be collected from a 20-gauge intravenous catheter. One to six 0.025\" J-wires will be sequentially inserted into the catheter. These measurements will allow us to determine: the reproducibility and variability of assays used, best timing of blood and endothelial cell collection and best blood volumes and endothelial cell collection wire passes to reliably perform routine assays. For imaging validation, algorithm development, and/or reproducibility testing, participants may undergo DEXA, MRI, or MRS testing to develop or improve analysis algorithms, to evaluate variability of the measurements, or testing different equipment that measure the same variable.",
