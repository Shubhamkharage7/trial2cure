Patients also undergo collection of blood samples before stem cell transplant, at 1-2, 2-3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after stem cell transplant, and at cGVHD onset. Patients may undergo skin and mouth biopsy over 15-30 minutes before stem cell transplant, at 2-3 and 12 months after stem cell transplant, and at cGVHD onset. Patients undergo digital pictures of the eyes, mouth and skin, and optical coherence tomographybefore stem cell transplant, at 2-3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after stem cell transplant, and at cGVHD onset. Patients without standard of care formal pulmonary function test undergo portable spirometry at 2-3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after stem cell transplant, and at cGVHD onset. Patients also complete surveys and have their medical records reviewed.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up periodically."
