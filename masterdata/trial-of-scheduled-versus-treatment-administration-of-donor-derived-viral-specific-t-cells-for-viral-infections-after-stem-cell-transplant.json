            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the use of viral specific T-lymphocytes (VSTs) to prevent or treat viral infections that may happen after allogeneic stem cell transplant. Allogeneic means the stem cells come from another person. VSTs are cells specially designed to fight viral infections that may happen after a stem cell transplant (SCT).\n\nStem cell transplant reduces the body's ability to fight infections. Viral infections are a common problem after transplant and can cause significant complications. Moreover, treatment of viral infections is expensive and time consuming, with families often administering prolonged treatments with intravenous anti-viral medications, or patients requiring prolonged admissions to the hospital. The medicines can also have side effects like damage to the kidneys or reduction in the blood counts, so in this study the investigators are trying to find a better way to treat these infections."
