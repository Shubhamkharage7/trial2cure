            "briefSummary": "The investigators hope to use MRI biomarkers to identify and characterize sensorimotor network disruption patterns associated with chronic pain and sensory deficits in CP. Investigators will use existing information in the medical record as well as subjective reports from interview, physical exam data, and anatomical and functional MRI data to non-invasively identify brain injury correlates of pain and sensory deficits.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background: Seventy percent of adults with cerebral palsy (CP) have chronic pain. Patterns in pain symptoms suggest that different individuals have different types of pain. People with CP have differences in brain structure and function, but links with pain mechanisms are not well-understood. Better understanding could help inform precision diagnosis and management of pain subtypes in individuals with CP.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary: Identify and characterize sensorimotor network disruption patterns associated with chronic pain and motor deficits in CP\n\nSecondary:\n\n* Improve understanding of anatomical brain network changes in CP associated with sensory deficits and pain\n* Identify non-invasive imaging-based neurobiomarkers applicable to sensory loss and pain in CP\n\nProcedures:\n\nStandardized online questionnaires: Participants (individuals with CP, controls, and/or caregivers) are first asked to complete standardized questionnaires reviewing pain symptoms, demographics, and medical history (CP-related and more generally). Online questionnaires replaced Structured Interview and Physical Examination procedures at the onset of COVID safety restrictions.\n\nReview of medical records: For consenting individuals, medical records will be requested and reviewed by the research team. Previously-acquired traditional MRI obtained for clinical purposes will be requested and reviewed to detect correlation between routine neuroimaging markers of perinatal brain injury and CP and pain. If of suitable quality, quantitative analysis methods (e.g. analysis of brain lobe and ventricular volumes for volumetric anatomical sequences, analysis of white matter volumes from DTI sequences) may be applied to prior images.\n\nMRI: Research unsedated MRI scans (outside of usual care) will be performed using a 3T Philips scanner at the F.M. Kirby Research Center. An MRI scanning protocol will be at the F.M. Kirby Research Center; the protocol will not last more than 1.5 hours. Acquisitions will include a triplanar survey, functional and anatomical multi-slice imaging of the brain as well as MRI of selected spinal levels. Protocols will be used that do not involve use of contrast agents and limit power/tissue absorption as well as otherwise remain within FDA and Kirby Center safety regulations. When possible, MRI will be performed within 3 months of initial survey/interview administration. If MRI is scheduled \\>3 months after initial survey/interview administration, a brief survey will be re-administered to screen for changes in pain/clinical status."
