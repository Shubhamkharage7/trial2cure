Biological characteristics of a person can include their genetics and social determinants of a person can include their education, income, and environment, all of which can impact their health. Information collected in this study may help increase early detection of lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the frequency of germline cancer susceptibility mutations in affected and unaffected individuals who have a personal or family history suggestive of high lung cancer risk.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the frequency of abnormal radiographic findings in high-risk individuals unaffected with cancer who undergo low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening.\n\nII. Use patient survey and medical record data to explore the associations between social determinants of health, biological risk factors, family history and lung cancer incidence.\n\nIII. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy for detection of lung cancer in a never-smoking population.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants complete a survey over 40-45 minutes at baseline and undergo collection of blood samples at a scheduled clinical or research blood draw. Participants' medical records are also reviewed. Participants not diagnosed with lung cancer (i.e. \"unaffected\"), undergo a low-dose computerized tomography (CT) scan over 20 minutes."
