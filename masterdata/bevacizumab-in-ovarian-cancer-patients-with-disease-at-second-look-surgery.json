            "detailedDescription": "Study Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of every 21-day study cycle.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nYour first study visit will be about 5-7 weeks after your second-look surgery so that you have time to recover. The study doctor will tell you when you will start having study visits.\n\nDuring all cycles:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing. If you can become pregnant and the doctor thinks it is needed, part of this routine blood sample may be used for a pregnancy test.\n\nDuring Cycle 3 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on), you will have an MRI or CT scan.\n\nLength of Treatment:\n\nYou may continue to receive bevacizumab for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\nYour participation on the study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit.\n\nEnd-of-Treatment Visit:\n\nWithin about 7 days after your last dose of bevacizumab:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing. If you can become pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a pregnancy test.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. However, it is considered investigational to use bevacizumab as treatment for cancer found during second-look surgery.\n\nThe study doctor will explain how the study drug is designed to work.\n\nUp to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson."
