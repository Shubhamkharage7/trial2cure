Patients with low KPS performance status related to co-morbidities but without symptoms related to the tumor will be eligible for enrollment.\n* Age less than 18 years old\n* Strict contraindication for both cross-sectional MRI and CT imaging with intravenous contrast (e.g., as per standard institutional protocols regarding renal insufficiency or MRI incompatible implanted devices; patients requiring pre-medication to prevent contrast reactions will be eligible for study)\n* Unable to grant reliable informed consent\n* Ongoing systemic treatment for desmoid fibromatosis",
