            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well bright white light (BWL) therapy works in reducing cancer-related fatigue and depression in patients with prostate cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) and who are undergoing treatment with antiandrogen therapy (ADT) combination therapy. Combination treatment including ADT plus chemotherapy and androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapy or ADT plus AR targeted therapies work by reducing testosterone. Most prostate tumor cells rely on testosterone to help them grow; therefore, ADT combination therapy causes prostate tumor cells to die or to grow more slowly leading to improved overall survival in men with advanced prostate cancer when compared with ADT alone. However, lower levels of testosterone is also commonly associated with worsening fatigue and depression. If prolonged and severe, these complications can alter patient treatment plans, impacting not just quality of life, but leading to inadequate cancer control. BWL therapy is a type of phototherapy that utilizes bright white full-spectrum light, either through a light box or light therapy glasses to help regulate circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a 24-hour cycle, including the sleep-wake cycle which can become disrupted in cancer patients undergoing treatment, leading to increased fatigue. Additionally, exposure to bright light may increase the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is associated with mood regulation. BWL therapy with AYOpro light therapy glasses may serve as a supportive care measure for men with advanced prostate to help reduce fatigue, as well as improve mood and overall quality of life during ADT combination therapy to maintain cancer care without suffering complications of therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate whether patient-reported fatigue by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue instrument at 3 months is lower in men with prostate cancer receiving immediate bright white light therapy as compared with delayed bright white light (BWL) therapy during ADT combination treatment (ADT + chemotherapy + hormonal intensification OR ADT+ hormonal intensification).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the difference in the following outcomes between men with prostate cancer receiving immediate bright white light therapy as compared with delayed bright white light (BWL) therapy during ADT combination treatment (ADT + chemotherapy + hormonal intensification OR ADT + hormonal intensification):\n\nIa. Mood by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 instrument measuring depressive symptoms; Ib. Geriatric assessments by the Cancer and Aging Research Group- Geriatric Assessment (CARG-GA) and Geriatric 8 (G8) instruments; Ic. Overall quality of life by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Prostate (FACT-P) instrument.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I (IMMEDIATE): Patients wear AYOpro BWL therapy glasses starting on day 1 of standard of care (SOC) ADT combination therapy for 12 months on trial.\n\nGROUP II (DELAYED): Patients wear AYOpro BWL therapy glasses starting 6 months after the start of SOC ADT combination therapy for 6 months on trial.\n\nPatients are followed for 52 weeks (total duration of the trial), or for 4 weeks including after removal from protocol therapy or until death, whichever occurs first."
