Children ages 8-11 who have a caregiver willing to participate with them will:\n\n* Attend 2 in-person study visits (about 1-1.5 hour each) that includes\n\n  * A survey for caregiver and child\n  * A brief computer puzzle challengetask while heart rate and sweat is recorded (child)\n  * A brief discussion about how the challenge went\n* Participate in a 6-session, online self-compassion course with other families (see back)\n* Provide feedback about how the course went",

Twenty-four children ages 8-11 and a primary caregiver will be recruited from a racially diverse school community to participate in 6 1-hour group intervention sessions over 6 weeks. Feasibility and acceptability data will guide program refinements; pre and post assessments will explore dimensional changes in anxiety/depression symptoms as well as potential physiological, relational/behavioral changes associated with SCCC participation."
