Patients are administered minimal sedation (2 mg of Versed and 25 mg of Fentanyl) and are given Virtual Reality (VR) goggles to wear for the duration of the procedure. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, effect, and safety of using VR goggles during endoscopic procedures to decrease sedation requirements, enhance patient satisfaction, and reduce recovery time."
