            "briefSummary": "Any time the words \"you,\" \"your,\" \"I,\" or \"me\" appear, it is meant to apply to the potential participant.\n\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine that can be given by inhalation (breathing it as a mist) to patients with solid tumors that have spread to the lungs from other parts of the body.\n\nThe safety and side effects of this drug will also be studied.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic and lung cancer, and other solid tumors. Its administration by inhalation is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.\n\nUp to 44 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of gemcitabine based on when you join this study. Up to 6 dose levels of gemcitabine will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects are seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine is found.\n\nEach study cycle is 28 days. You will take gemcitabine by mist 2 times each week for 4 weeks (28 days). Treatment will be administered at MD Anderson. A machine called a nebulizer will be used to make the gemcitabine mist. The study staff will provide you with protective materials and instructions on how to take the treatment. You will breathe the drug mist through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. The study staff will tell you which days you will receive the study drug. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may continue to receive the study drug for up to 12 cycles.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou may continue taking the study drug for up to 12 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. If you have developed a tumor outside of the lungs either before or while you are on study, and the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may have a local control procedure (such as radiation or surgery) that may help to control the disease while continuing to receive the study drug. You would sign a separate consent form explaining these procedures and their risks. If you and your doctor decide on a systemic cancer treatment by mouth or vein, you will no longer be able to receive treatment on this study. A systemic cancer treatment is designed to spread and treat cancer cells throughout the body.\n\nYour participation on the study will be over after your last follow-up phone call.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nWithin 3 days before Day 1 of every cycle:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver function.\n* You will have PFTs.\n* You will have your blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter.\n* If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.\n\nOn Day 8 of Cycle 1:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver function.\n\nYou will have a CT scan at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, and then every 3 cycles after that. The study doctor will tell you when you will have these scans. If you have a chest X-ray, MRI, and PET scan as part of standard of care while you are on study, the study doctor may use the results to check the status of the disease.\n\nTo avoid having to come to the study clinic too often, you may have blood draws done by your personal doctor.\n\nYou may be called by the study staff and asked about how you are doing and about any side effects about 1 day after your first 2 doses of the study drug, at the end of Cycle 1, and 1 time every 3 months after that until you leave the study or the study ends. These calls should last about 15-20 minutes each time.\n\nOther Information:\n\nEach day that you take study drug:\n\n* You will write down the date and the day of the study cycle in a dosing diary given to you by the study staff. You should bring the diary to all clinic visits.\n* You will be given a pulse oximeter to measure your heart rate and blood oxygen level. \u00b0You should record your results in the dosing diary.\n* You will use a small hand-held device to test your lung function before the dose and answer questions about side effects you may be having.\n\nYou will also be given an electronic device (such as a laptop or tablet) so that you can upload the information from the lung function tests and send it to the study doctor. You will only be able to access study specific material on this device. The study staff will show you how to use all of the provided machines. If the device is lost, stolen, or damaged, you will need to immediately report it to the study staff and you will be responsible for its replacement.\n\nYou should bring the nebulizer with you to all study visits.\n\nYou will be asked to return the nebulizer, pulse oximeter, lung function device, and electronic device when your participation on this study is over.\n\nEnd of Dosing Visit:\n\nWithin 30 days of your last dose of the study drug:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will have PFTs.\n* You will have your blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter.\n* You will have a CT scan."
