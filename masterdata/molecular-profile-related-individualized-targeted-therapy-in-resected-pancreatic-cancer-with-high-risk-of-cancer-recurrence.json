Patient must be presented at the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) and agree to receive the MTB-recommended therapy.\n12. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.\n\n    1. Patients presented at the MTB prior to signing consent are eligible to be on study. Patients do not need to be presented again at the MTB prior to starting therapy on trial unless six months elapse between consent and start of study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA potential study subject who meets any of the following exclusion criteria is ineligible to participate in the study.\n\n1. CA 19-9 non-producers, unless high-risk pathological features present.\n2. Receiving concomitant investigational agent(s) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n3. Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.\n4. Inability to ingest study drugs by mouth.\n5. Diarrheal bowel movements \\> 6 per day postoperatively on maximal medical therapy.\n6. Patient has active, untreated, or uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic intravenous therapy.\n7. Patient has undergone or planned major surgery other than diagnostic surgery (i.e., surgery done to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ) within four weeks prior to Day 1 of study therapy.\n8. Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug(s) or any of the excipients.\n9. Uncontrolled concurrent illness, including, but not limited to, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled and clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n10. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or any patient with childbearing potential not using adequate pregnancy prevention.",
