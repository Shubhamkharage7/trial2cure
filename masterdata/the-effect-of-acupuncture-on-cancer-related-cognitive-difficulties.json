Researchers will compare the effects of real acupuncture with those of placebo acupuncture and wait-list acupuncture. This study will also look at insomnia's link to cognitive difficulties.\n\nAll study participants (receiving real acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, or wait-list acupuncture) will complete study questionnaires and/or have cognitive testing at Weeks 0, 4, 10, 14 and 26. After the Week 26 visit, your participation in this study will end. If you are assigned to receive placebo acupuncture or wait-list acupuncture, you will have the option of receiving up to 10 real acupuncture treatments within the six months after the study finishes."
