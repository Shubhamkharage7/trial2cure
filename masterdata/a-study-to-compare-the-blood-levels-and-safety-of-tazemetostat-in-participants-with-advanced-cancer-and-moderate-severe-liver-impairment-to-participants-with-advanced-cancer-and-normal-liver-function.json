            "briefSummary": "This main aim of this trial will be to study the blood levels (known as pharmacokinetics) of the study drug tazemetostat.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of the study drug in participants with advanced solid tumors and moderate or severe hepatic (liver) impairment will be compared with participants with advanced malignancies and normal hepatic function.\n\nAn advanced malignancy is a cancer that has recurred (come back) after prior treatment or hasn't controlled with treatment.\n\nThe trial will also study the safety of the study drug in participants (how well it is tolerated).",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will be conducted in 2 parts for subjects with advanced malignancies and either normal liver function, or advanced malignancies and moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. Subjects in Part 1 of the study will receive a single oral, 800 mg dose of tazemetostat on Day 1 and Day 15. In addition, the subjects will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose) tablets to be taken twice daily from Day 5 to Day 14. Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained on Day 1 through Day 4 and again on Day 15 through Day 18. Part 1 ends on Day 18.\n\nSubjects continuing treatment in Part 2 will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose) tablets to be taken twice daily in repeated 28-day cycles beginning on Day 19 until Investigator-assessed clinical progression per standard practice, or unacceptable toxicity, or until another discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects must have an end of study visit for safety assessment 30 days after the last dose of tazemetostat or prior to initiation of a subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompanying procedure manuals (i.e., laboratory, pharmacy, ECG manuals). Such manuals will provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact subject safety."
