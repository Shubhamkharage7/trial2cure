            "detailedDescription": "50 scleroderma patients without evidence of lung disease who have been seen by an NJH Rheumatologist will be invited to participate. They will have their medical records reviewed to determine eligibility and then perform hand held spirometry and LCI testing. This measures evidence of small airway airflow obstruction and requires normal breathing while first on room air followed by inhaling a gas mixture of 100% oxygen. The Oxygen concentration in exhaled breathing and the number of breaths needed to return to room air concentration of Oxygen will be analyzed by a computer. Medical information from the EMR will be recorded and placed in a secure database, REDCap, for statistical analysis to determine if LCI results or other clinical features are predictive of which Scleroderma patients are most likely to subsequently develop evidence of Interstitial Lung disease (ILD) based upon yearly phone call interviews and EMR record reviews within 5 years of baseline testing."
