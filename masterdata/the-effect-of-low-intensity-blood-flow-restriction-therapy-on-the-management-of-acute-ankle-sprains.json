This study will evaluate the efficacy of using BFR therapy for the treatment of acute grade I and II ankle sprains. The investigators will evaluate clinical outcomes of range of motion (ROM) and strength testing of ankle dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion.\n\nThis will be a small, randomized control trial study. The investigators will enroll a total of 40 participants, 20 participants will undergo standard physical therapy for isolated lateral ankle sprains and 20 participants will undergo BFR therapy for an isolated lateral ankle sprain. Patients will be randomized into control and experimental group via block randomization."
