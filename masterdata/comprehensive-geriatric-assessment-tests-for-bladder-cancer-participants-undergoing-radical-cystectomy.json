Participants in this study will watch videos designed to teach them strategies to help lower their risk of experiencing negative side effects (such as mobility problems, issues with taking medication, and poor quality of life) before and after they have surgery. They will also be asked to fill out questionnaires.",

Participants in this study will watch videos designed to teach them strategies to help lower their risk of experiencing negative side effects (such as mobility problems, issues with taking medication, and poor quality of life) before and after they have surgery. The goal of this study is to educate people with bladder cancer and ask them to also fill out questionnaires about the education program and if they used any of the strategies that learn during the study.\n\nParticipants in this study will be divided into two different study groups (one group that watches educational videos before surgery and one group that watches educational videos before surgery and also receives geriatric services and follow up visits after surgery). Each participant will be randomized (randomly assigned) to one of two study groups. That means that there is a 50/50 chance (like flipping a coin) that each participant will end up in either group."
