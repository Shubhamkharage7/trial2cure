Sirolimus was initially considered as a treatment in IBM for its immunosuppressive action and beneficial effects in an experimental myositis mouse model.(11) Transfer of effector T cells from affected to healthy animals resulted in myositis, but the presence of Treg cells were protective against development of myositis. As Sirolimus, which acts to deplete effector T cells but preserving the Treg cells, was effective in this mouse model of myositis, it was therefore postulated that it may also be effective in IBM, not only for its effects on effector T cells and Treg cells, but also for its additional effects on protein degradation.",
