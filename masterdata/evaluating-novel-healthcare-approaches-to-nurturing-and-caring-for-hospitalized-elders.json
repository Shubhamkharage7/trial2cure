The main objectives of the trial are the following:\n\n1. To compare the effectiveness of FAM-HELP and HELP in reducing both the incidence of delirium and its severity.\n2. To compare the effectiveness of FAM-HELP and HELP in improving patient- and family-reported outcomes.\n3. To explore the implementation context, process, and outcomes of the FAM-HELP program in diverse hospital settings.",
            "detailedDescription": "Delirium is a common complication of hospitalization and major surgery for older adults, and it can lead to loss of independence and substantial healthcare costs. One approach to preventing delirium is through the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP). HELP personnel work to prevent delirium by providing orienting communication, assisting patients with walking and exercise, providing help with nutrition and fluids, implementing sleep protocols, and helping patients with vision and hearing aids.\n\nHowever, it is unknown whether involving family members in these activities along with HELP staff (i.e., \"FAM-HELP\") might be more effective with preventing delirium. The objective of this clinical trial is thus to compare the traditional HELP program with a family-augmented version of HELP (FAM-HELP) to determine which program is more effective with preventing delirium and related complications in older, hospitalized patients."
