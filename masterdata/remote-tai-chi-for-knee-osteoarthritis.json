            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pragmatic randomized trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of remote Tai Chi to treat knee pain in adults with knee osteoarthritis. The main questions the trial aims to answer are:\n\n* Does remote Tai Chi improve the extent to which pain interferes with physical, mental, and social activities (PROMIS-Pain Interference at 3 months, primary outcome), as well as knee pain and function (WOMAC subscales) and analgesic use (secondary outcomes)\n* Does remote tai chi decreases healthcare utilization?\n\nResearchers will compare remote Tai Chi added to routine care to routine care alone to see if remote tai chi works to treat knee osteoarthritis pain. Participants will participate in remotely delivered web-based tai chi sessions, twice a week for 12 weeks, or will continue to receive routine care. Participants will be followed for 12 months after randomization.",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators will conduct a 12-month embedded, pragmatic, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation, individually randomized group-treatment trial that will compare the effects of a 3-month twice weekly remotely delivered web-based Tai Chi intervention plus routine care versus routine care alone across four health care systems (Tufts Medical Center, Boston Medical Center, University of California Los Angeles Health, and Cleveland Clinic) in four geographic regions (Eastern Massachusetts, Southern California, Northeast Ohio (Cleveland Clinic), Southern Florida (Cleveland Clinic). Investigators will enroll a total of 480 diverse patients with a clinical diagnosis of Knee OA. Participants will be evaluated at baseline and 3 months, with additional follow-up at 6 and 12 months."
