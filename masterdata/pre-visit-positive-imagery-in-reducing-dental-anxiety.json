            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether pre-visit positive imagery has an impact in decreasing dental anxiety and fear in pediatric patients as well as increasing patient cooperation during treatment visits. Patients needing at least 1 composite filling with nitrous and local anesthetic will receive a picture book if they are selected in the experimental group, and no picture book if they are in the control group. Patients will be asked to be fill out a pre-operative survey and post-operative survey asking how they feel about treatment. Parents will also be asked to fill out a post-operative survey.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective randomized control trial. The study will be conducted at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry Pediatric Dental Clinic and Healthy Smiles for Kids of Orange County clinic. Established patients of record that are 4-6 years old who meet the inclusion criteria will qualify.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to two groups by flipping a coin and having pre-assigned envelopes in numeric order for each participant. The envelopes will be made ahead of time with heads representing Group 1 and tails representing Group 2. The envelopes will then be numbered and stored in a folder; once a participant consents to enroll in the study, the envelope will be drawn in numeric order determining the participants group number to ensure it is randomized, Group 1 will include patients receiving positive pre-visit imagery. Group 2 will be the control group and will not receive any form of positive pre-visit imagery. The positive pre-visit imagery group 1 will receive a picture book explaining their dental treatment appointment with pictures and some words. The picture book will be a hard copy and will be shown to them by a faculty advisor at USC and by the PI at Healthy Smiles for Kids. The patient's behavior will initially be assessed at their new patient or recall appointment based off the Frankl behavior scale. At the end of the treatment visit, patient behavior will be measured by the dental provider using the Frankl behavior scale. The dentists rating the behavior will be calibrated to ensure there is consistency in the Frankl scale rating and criteria for each score.\n\nPatients will also be asked to fill out a pre- and post-survey that allows them to express their level of dental fear and anxiety before and after the appointment using the Venham Picture Test. The total time commitment will be about 20 minutes and will be a part of their normal dental visit, no additional time is needed. Parents/caregivers will also be given a post-operative survey asking whether they felt the pre-visit positive imagery helped improve patient's behavior."
