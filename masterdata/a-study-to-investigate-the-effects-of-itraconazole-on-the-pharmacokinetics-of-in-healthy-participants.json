Potential participants will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 56 days prior to the first dose administration. Participants will be admitted into the study site on Day -1 and be confined to the study site until discharge on Day 33. Participants will return to the study site for PK sample collection on Day 37 and a follow-up visit and PK sample collection on Day 42.\n\nApproximately 16 participants will be enrolled in this study."
