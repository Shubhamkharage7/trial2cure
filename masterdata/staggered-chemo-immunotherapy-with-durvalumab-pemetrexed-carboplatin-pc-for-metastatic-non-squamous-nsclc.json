The study will focus on the efficacy of two alternative staggered dosing regimens.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial will evaluated two different schedules of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy while simultaneously measuring immune activation, immune resistance and host factors. Both arms will consist of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy with durvalumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin, but in arm 1 the chemotherapy will precede the immunotherapy by a week and in arm 2 the immunotherapy will precede the chemotherapy by a week. Staggering these therapies still allows concurrent administration while allowing some degree of temporal isolation to better understand the contributions by chemotherapy and immunotherapy in this setting. Host and laboratory factors will be measured during treatment. We hypothesize that staggered dosing of immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy can improve clinical benefit."
