The LINKED-BP Program study will recruit a total of 600 adults (30 from each practice) with elevated BP (120-129/\\<80 mm Hg) or untreated stage 1 hypertension (130-139/80-89 mm Hg) across 20 community health centers or primary care practices serving high-risk adults. This cluster-randomized trial consists of two arms: (1) enhanced \"usual care arm,\" wherein patients will be provided with Omron 10 series home BP monitors (HBPM) and will be managed by the patients' primary care clinicians as usual; and (2) the LINKED-BP Program or \"intervention arm,\" which will include training of patients on HBPM, Sphygmo BP telemonitoring app, and CHW visits for education and counseling on lifestyle modification. The intervention period for each study participant is 12 months."
