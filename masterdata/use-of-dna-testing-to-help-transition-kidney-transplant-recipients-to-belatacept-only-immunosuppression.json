The primary objective will be to determine if donor derived-cell free DNA (AlloSure) can be utilized to facilitate Belatacept monotherapy, and to determine if Belatacept is safe and effective as immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients. The secondary objective is to determine the utility of AlloMap as a predictor of immune quiescence and tolerance of immunosuppressive de-escalation to Belatacept monotherapy, and to evaluate the performance of iBox in predicting adverse outcomes in patients transitioned to Belatacept monotherapy"
