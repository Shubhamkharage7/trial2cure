            "detailedDescription": "Chronic low back pain (CLBP) and depression are top causes of disability in the United States. Veterans are more likely to have both; prevalence is increasing. When CLBP and depression occur together, patients report more functional limitations, unemployment, and higher healthcare spending, and treatment is less successful. Novel approaches simultaneously addressing pain interference and depression symptoms are needed.\n\nThis study will involve initial pilot feasibility testing of an intervention designed to help participants with chronic low back pain and depression both reduce pain interference and improve mood. This study will occur in two phases. The initial phase is a open-label single-arm pilot of the combined intervention (ketamine infusions followed by the brief behavioral intervention) in a small sample of Veterans (n=5). The objective is to develop and assess initial feasibility of study procedures and obtain participant feedback through semi-structured exit interviews. The second phase consists of a single-blind, two-arm, pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n=44, 22 per arm) which will (a) assess feasibility benchmarks and (b) collect outcome data that will be used to calculate sample size to power a larger RCT."
