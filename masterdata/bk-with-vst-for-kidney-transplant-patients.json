            "briefSummary": "This study measures the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of viral-specific T cells (VST) against BK Virus (BKV) in adult kidney transplant recipients. Participants are expected to be on study for 52 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Viral infections, or their reactivation in the immunocompromised host, remain serious complications that adversely affect outcomes of transplantation. These infections may be refractory to pharmacologic treatment and result in increased morbidity and mortality after transplantation. Furthermore, the available pharmacologic therapies can result in severe toxicities.\n\nOnce an infection occurs, adequate immune reconstitution is decisive for recovery from viral disease after kidney transplantation. The present trial will consist of the treatment of kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with severe BK infection as defined by a viral load \u2265 250 copies/mL and BKN, with virus-specific, antigen-selected T cells using the CliniMACS\u00ae Prodigy System. BK-specific T cells will be isolated from donor leukapheresis products using the CliniMACS\u00ae Prodigy. Prior studies on transfer of CMV-specific T cells have been shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, so the same methods will be used to transfer BK-specific T cells.\n\nThe main trial objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of BK-specific T-cell transfer in adult patients suffering from BK infections following kidney transplantation. The incubation with viral antigens (MACS Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) PepTivator) allows the enrichment of BK-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Increasing evidence of the safety and efficacy of CMV-specific T-cell is available. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of the specific manufacturing approach using the fully automated protocol of the CliniMACS\u00ae Prodigy for the isolation of CMV-specific T cells against CMV has been described and has demonstrated that these cells retain their biological properties. Based on the CMV data, the investigators believe BK-specific T cells will follow the same pattern.\n\nStudy Overview\n\nThis phase I, open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study will assess the safety and tolerability of transfer of BK-specific T cells isolated from a leukapheresis product. Secondary objectives will focus on the feasibility and efficacy of the BK-specific T-cell transfer. The Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be generated automatically by the CliniMACS\u00ae Prodigy using the CliniMACS Cytokine Capture System (IFN\u03b3) after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator\u00ae BKV LT \\& VP1 for enrichment of virus-specific T-cells in adult patients suffering from BK infections following kidney transplantation.\n\nSafety and tolerability will be assessed by determining the incidence and severity of acute infusion-related toxicities, incidence and severity of acute rejection of the kidney allograft, occurrence and time to newly occurring acute GVHD grade \u22651 until Week 12 after T-cell transfer, and aggravation of pre-existing acute GVHD grade \u22651 until Week 12.\n\nFeasibility of BK virus specific T-cells will be assessed by determining the successful production of BK-VST from donors on an intent-to-treat basis, measuring dropout rate and reasons for drop out as well as time from patient inclusion to administration of the IMP.\n\nEfficacy will be assessed by determining the number of patients and time to reaching \u22651 log decrease in BK viral load, number of patients with BK clearance, time to BK clearance, and number of patients with resolution of clinical BK organ disease by Week 12. Number of BK reactivations following BK viral clearance and overall survival (OS) will be determined at Week 52."
