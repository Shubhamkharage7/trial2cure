            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to look at the benefits of using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system compared with standard-of-care testing for patients with diabetes type 2 and diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and how this will improve wound healing.\n\nThe CGM system allows medical staff and patients with diabetes to monitor and make treatment decisions to improve glucose control, without the need for performing fingersticks. Hence, the use of CGM will decrease the painful and burdensome task of performing finger sticks several times per day and may prevent low blood glucose in patients with diabetes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goals of this study are to compare differences in patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) wound healing using continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and point of care testing (POCT) at 16 weeks post-hospital discharge. The study is important to support the limited data available to optimize glycemic control DFU healing and the use of CGM. Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and HbA1c \\> 8.5% admitted to general medicine and surgery services with diabetic foot ulcers will be approached for study participation.\n\nAfter completing the informed consent process, patients will be randomized 1:1 to glucose monitoring with real-time CGM (rt-CGM) or POCT. Before discharge, participants in the rt-CGM group will have CGM applied by the research team with instructions on how to monitor blood glucose (BG) with the CGM device. Participants enrolled in the POCT group will have the application of a blinded CGM that will monitor glycemic control, but results will not be visible to the participant, clinical team, or research providers. Participants will receive standard diabetes education. Participants will be scheduled for research visits at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. CGM sensors will be provided at these visits with a review of application, monitoring, and removal. Subjects in both groups will not receive specific guidelines on medication or other interventions. At the end of the 16-week study period, an assessment of final wound outcomes will be made by either the podiatry or infectious diseases collaborators (one of whom will have already been following the patient clinically) during one of the routine clinical visits. Photos of the ulcer site will be taken at the 16-week study visit, and the outcome will be reported by the treating wound care provider and adjudicated by a member of the study team who is blinded to the patient's clinical information and intervention arm. Participants will complete surveys to assess patient-reported outcomes relating to depression, CGM satisfaction, and self-efficacy."
