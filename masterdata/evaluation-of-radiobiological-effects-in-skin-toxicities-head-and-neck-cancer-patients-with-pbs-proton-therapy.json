            "briefSummary": "This purpose of this study is to examine skin reactions (called radiation dermatitis) that occur during pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. The researchers will test a unique technique called \"Spot Delete\" to see if it can reduce skin reactions for head \\& neck patients treated with PBS. The investigators will also use a special computer model to study how the energy of the proton beam (linear energy transfer) is related to these skin reactions. The study involves creating a treatment plan based on a CT scan, which helps guide the proton beam in the body.",
            "detailedDescription": "This purpose of this study is to examine skin reactions (called radiation dermatitis) that occur during pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. The researchers will test a unique technique called \"Spot Delete\" to see if it can reduce skin reactions for head \\& neck patients treated with PBS. The investigators will also use a special computer model to study how the energy of the proton beam (linear energy transfer) is related to these skin reactions. The study involves creating a treatment plan based on a CT scan, which helps guide the proton beam in the body. The clinical team uses this CT scan to find the best placement for the protons. The \"Spot Delete\" method prevents protons from stopping in the skin, which is thought to increase skin dose and thus risk and magnitude of radiation dermatitis. During the study, digital photos of patients' skin will be taken to assess the amount of dermatitis (redness, blistering, or peeling). Patients will be given a self-report questionnaire and medical staff will document the skin reactions in the patients' medical charts. The degree of skin reactions will be compared against historical occurrence rates, and the location of any skin reactions that occur will be compared against the predicted location from the computer model. This study carries the same risks as regular proton therapy. Proton therapy, like other cancer treatments, may cause side effects. Some common side effects include skin reactions (such as redness, dryness, itching, blistering, or peeling) in the treatment area. It is important to note that the \"Spot Delete\" technique aims to specifically address the skin reactions, so there might be a potential reduction in this particular risk."
