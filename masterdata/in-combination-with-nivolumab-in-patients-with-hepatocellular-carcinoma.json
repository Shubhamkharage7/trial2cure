The study consists of 2 phases, a Dose Escalation Phase and an Expansion Phase. Nivolumab will be administered, consistent with the US prescribing information, as a 30-minute IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-Day cycle. ABX196 will be administered as an IM injection 120 minutes (+/- 15 minutes) after the completion of the nivolumab infusion on Day 1 of every other 28-Day cycle (i.e., every 8 weeks)."
