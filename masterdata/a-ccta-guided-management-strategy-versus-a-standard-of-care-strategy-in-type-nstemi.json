The targeted population is expectedly heterogeneous and inpatient setting who are admitted and diagnosed with type 2 NSTEMI. Patients are randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 undergoes coronary 64-detector row computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and Group 2 receives conservative management and treatment for underlying conditions. The investigators will evaluate cross-sectional and time-varying clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics in association with clinical events. The exclusion criteria are an absence of information for follow-up of clinical events, and patients who have absolute and relative contraindications for CCTA. Absolute contraindications are a patient history of severe or anaphylactic reaction to iodinated contrast, inability to cooperate with scan protocols, hemodynamic instability, decompensated heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and renal impairment with GFR \\< 30. Relative contraindications include pregnancy, inability to tolerate heart rate-slowing medications or nitroglycerin, recent phosphodiesterase inhibitor use, severe aortic stenosis, bronchospastic disease, and patient's weight and height."
