If too many serious side effects are seen with the dose previously studied, some additional patients may be treated with a lower dose to make sure that this dose is safe.",
            "detailedDescription": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow with a 5-year survival rate of 47.5% for patients less than age 65 years and only an 8.2% survival for those 65 and older, based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. Despite some advances in treatment, most patients will relapse, and treatment remains limited, especially for patients that progress on the standard of care. The expected response rate to salvage chemotherapy is only 10-20% with a median survival typically of less than 6 months. The need for new, effective, and well-tolerated treatments is clear."
