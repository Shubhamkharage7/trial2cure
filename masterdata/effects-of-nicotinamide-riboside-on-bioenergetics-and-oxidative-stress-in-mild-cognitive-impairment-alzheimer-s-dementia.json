            "detailedDescription": "Mitochondrial function is mediated, in part, by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Unfortunately, decreases in NAD+ levels are associated with normal aging, and also with numerous diseases such as AD. Accumulating evidence suggests that NR can enhance mitochondrial function and help slow or reverse these age-related abnormalities. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have been performed using NR and related compounds to boost NAD+ level in human subjects with various diseases or animal models. However, no studies to date have investigated in vivo metabolic and bioenergetic changes (target engagement) associated with NR supplementation. In this project, we aim to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms and clinical effects of NR in patients with MCI and mild AD using in vivo novel neuroimaging techniques."
