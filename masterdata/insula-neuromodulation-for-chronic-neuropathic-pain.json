Electrodes for stimulation and recording will be implanted stereotactically along the anterior-posterior axis of the insular cortex. 'Responders' to trial stimulation and the optimal region of the insula for pain relief will be identified during this inpatient stage.\n\n'Responder' subjects who have positive analgesic effects from acute insular stimulation during the first stage will continue to the second stage. The second stage, clinical trial is conducted outpatient and will test chronic deep brain stimulation of the insula. The study design is randomized, sham-stimulation-controlled, double-blinded, and cross-over where subjects receive both active and sham stimulation. Furthermore, neurophysiological biomarkers of pain will be investigated by studying changes in neural activity."

Intravenous or subcutaneous heparin-derived compounds for the last 48 hours.\n8. Individuals who are not able or willing to tolerate prolonged hospitalization with continuous video EEG monitoring\n9. Subjects participating or have participated in another clinical trial to investigate or treat chronic pain in the last 30 days\n10. Subjects with risk factors for intraoperative or postoperative bleeding from a documented coagulopathy or if their serum coagulation studies (platelet count, PT, PTT, and INR) exceed the institutional laboratory limits.\n11. Subjects with brain tumors or any significant intracranial mass.\n12. Subjects with a history of seizure\n13. Any illness that in the investigator's opinion preclude participation in this study\n14. Pregnancy or lactation\n15. Subjects with a true allergy to opioid medications which would preclude PET imaging\n16. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity\n17.
