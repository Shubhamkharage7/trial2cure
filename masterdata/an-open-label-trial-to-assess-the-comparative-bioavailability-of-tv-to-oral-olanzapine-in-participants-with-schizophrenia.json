Participants on alternative olanzapine regimens (eg, 10 mg twice daily) may be considered for inclusion in the trial based upon the Investigator's clinical judgment.\n* Women may be included only if they have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test result at screening; they are surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or postmenopausal (postmenopausal status will be confirmed by a follicle-stimulating hormone screen according to the clinical laboratory standard value) for at least 1 year; or they are practicing a highly effective method of birth control and not planning pregnancy for at least 30 days before the trial, for the duration of the trial, and for 70 days after the last dose administration, if they are sexually active and of childbearing potential.\n* Men must be sterile; or if they are potentially of reproductive competence and have sexual relationship with female partners of childbearing potential, they must use, together with their female partners, highly effective birth control methods for the duration of the trial and for 70 days after the last dose administration.\n\nNOTE- Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History or known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma.\n* History or a complication of diabetes (hemoglobin A1c 6.5% or above and/or fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dL or above).\n* Evidence of significant hepatic disorder.\n* The participant is a pregnant or lactating woman or plans to become pregnant during the trial or within 70 days after the last dose administration.\n* Known hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to olanzapine (or unable to tolerate oral olanzapine dose) or any of the excipients of TV-44749 in any formulation, their related compounds, or to any metabolites, or any compound listed as being present in TV-44749 or oral olanzapine.\n* Presence of excessive pigment, bruises, scars, or tattoos around the potential injection area.\n* Personal or family history of arrhythmia, sudden unexplained death at a young age (before 40 years) in a first-degree relative, long QT syndrome, personal history of syncope, or history of uncontrolled high blood pressure. Participants with history of high blood pressure who no longer require treatment or participants who are treated with antihypertensive medications and whose blood pressure is currently well-controlled, may be enrolled.\n* Substance use disorder criteria for alcohol, drug, or any other substance dependence (with the exception of nicotine or caffeine) have been met within the past 12 months prior to screening as defined by the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013b).\n* A current clinically significant DSM-5 diagnosis other than schizophrenia.\n\nNOTE- Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information",
