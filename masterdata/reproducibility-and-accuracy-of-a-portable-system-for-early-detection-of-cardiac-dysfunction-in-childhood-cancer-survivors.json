The SphygmoCor\u00ae Xcel and Oscar 2\u2122 systems may help detect cardiac dysfunction earlier than other available screening tests because it can be self-administered outside of the clinic. This study aims to test the accuracy and practicality of these devices in the clinic setting and at home.",
