            "briefSummary": "While data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimate that 36.9% of patients with diabetes have CKD, only approximately 10% of patients are aware of their kidney disease. In its 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, the ADA recommends that all patients with type II diabetes (T2DM) undergo annual measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) has also proposed an update to the requirements for assessment of adults with diabetes including both an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and uACR. The goal of accurately identifying patients with T2DM and CKD is to help providers intervene at an earlier stage of kidney impairment, improve renal outcomes, and reduce associated healthcare costs.\n\nFailure to adopt these guideline recommendations has widespread implications, including underestimation of the burden of CKD in the T2DM population, delays in diagnosis of renal impairment, and ultimately, underutilization of therapies that could improve clinical outcomes. This single-center, 400-patient, randomized controlled trial will assess the impact of an EPIC Best Practice Advisory (BPA; alert-based CDS tool) on guideline-directed assessment for CKD using UACR in patients with T2DM who have not had a UACR in the past year.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a 400-patient single-center Quality Improvement Initiative in the form of a randomized controlled trial of an EPIC EHR BPA. The allocation ratio will be 1:1 for an EPIC BPA versus no notification with randomization by Attending Physician of Record, using odd or even provider ID number, to minimize cluster-effect. While the study will randomize patients by Attending Physician of Record, the observational unit will be the patient.\n\nThe study will use a BPA within EPIC that will integrate with the EHR medical history, visit diagnoses, and problem list to identify outpatients with a diagnosis of T2DM and without an established diagnosis of CKD. The BPA will then search the laboratory results section of the EHR for a UACR result within the last year. If the patient with T2DM has not had a UACR result within the past year, he or she will be randomly assigned to the BPA intervention group (alert group) or the control (no alert) group according the Attending Physician of Record's provider ID number. For patients randomly assigned to the BPA intervention group (alert group), an on-screen electronic alert will be issued during the outpatient clinical encounter that notifies the responsible provider that his or her T2DM patient should be evaluated for CKD with UACR. The provider then will be given on-screen options to either order a UACR or follow a link to learn more about CKD assessment in T2DM."
