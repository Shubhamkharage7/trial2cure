            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination treatment of romidepsin and oral azacytidine is safe and effective in patients with Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL). This study will compare the experimental combination treatment of romidepsin and oral azacytidine to single agent drugs already determined effective in patients with PTCL. For the purposes of this study, the single agent drugs already used to treat lymphoma are called investigator's choice (IC), meaning the investigator will choose which one of these drugs to administer. The IC drug options include romidepsin, belinostat, pralatrexate or gemcitabine given alone. Funding Source: FDA OOPD.",
            "detailedDescription": "Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) is a rare and heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) originating from mature (or post-thymic or 'peripheral') T- lymphocytes and NK cells. They are considered very aggressive and are often resistant to conventional chemotherapy.\n\nThis study employs a stratified randomization with equal allocation within strata of patients to receive oral 5-azacytidine (AZA) plus romidepsin (ROMI) versus pre-specified investigator choice (ROMI, belinostat, pralatrexate or gemcitabine), for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) PTCL. The dose and schedule of AZA/ROMI has been determined from a phase I clinical trial of the combination. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the progression free survival (PFS) among patients receiving the combination compared to single agent of choice."
