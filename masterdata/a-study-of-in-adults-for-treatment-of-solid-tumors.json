            "briefSummary": "ASP1002 is a potential new treatment for people with certain solid tumors. Before ASP1002 is available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how it is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose and check for potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with high levels of a protein called claudin 4. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. They will have been previously treated with available standard therapies or refused to receive those treatments.\n\nThere are 2 main aims of this study. One is to learn if people with certain solid tumors have any medical problems or side effects after receiving different doses of ASP1002. The other is to find a suitable dose of ASP1002 to use in future studies.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts.\n\nIn Part 1, different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP1002. Any medical problems and side effects will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP1002 to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP1002. A medical expert panel will check the results from this group and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP1002. The panel will do this for each dose group until all groups have taken ASP1002 or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nIn Part 2, other different small groups of people will receive ASP1002 with the most suitable doses determined from Part 1. This will help find a more accurate dose of ASP1002 to use in future studies.\n\nDuring both parts of the study, ASP1002 will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 days long and the infusion is given weekly. People in this study will continue treatment for up to 2 years (32 cycles) until: they have medical problems or side effects that prevent them from continuing treatment; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; they ask to stop treatment; they do not come back for treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic several times during each treatment cycle. They will receive ASP1002 infusions 3 times during each treatment cycle. Each infusion could take 15 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the dose. In addition to infusions, other checks will occur during the visit. During these visits, the study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002. At some visits, other checks will include a medical examination, laboratory tests and vital signs. Vital signs include temperature, pulse, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Also, blood and urine samples will be taken. Tumor samples will be taken during certain visits during treatment and when treatment has finished.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic within 7 days after stopping treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002. Other checks will include a medical examination, laboratory tests and vital signs. Then, they may visit the clinic at 30 days (1 month) and 90 days (3 months) after stopping treatment. At the 30-day visit, the study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002. People will have their vital signs checked and have some laboratory tests. At the 90-day visit, the study doctors will check for any medical problems and side effects from ASP1002 and people will have their vital signs checked. After this, people will continue to visit the clinic every 9 to 12 weeks. This is to check the condition of their cancer."

Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\n  * b. WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance from the time of informed consent through at least 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Female participant must agree not to breastfeed starting at screening and throughout the study period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Female participant must not donate ova starting at first administration of study intervention and throughout 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Male participant with female partner(s) of childbearing potential (including breastfeeding partner) must agree to use contraception throughout the treatment period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Male participant must not donate sperm during the treatment period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Male participant with pregnant partner(s) must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the duration of the pregnancy throughout the study period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Participant agrees not to participate in another interventional study while receiving study intervention in the present study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant weighs \\< 40 kg.\n* Participant has ongoing toxicity \\>/= grade 2 per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 considered clinically significant and attributable to prior antineoplastic therapies.\n* Participant has untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Participants with previously treated CNS metastases are eligible, if they are clinically stable and have no evidence of CNS progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study intervention and are not requiring immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids (equivalent to \\> 10 mg per day of prednisone) for longer than 2 weeks.\n* Participant has an active autoimmune disease. Participant with type 1 diabetes mellitus, endocrinopathies stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy, or skin disorders (e.g., vitiligo, psoriasis or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are allowed.\n* Participant has had a myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to the start of study intervention or currently has an uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant cardiac disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, complete left bundle branch block, obligate use of a cardiac pacemaker, long QT syndrome or right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock (bifascicular block).\n* Participant has a corrected corrected QT interval (QTcF) interval (single electrocardiogram (ECG)) \\> 470 ms within 7 days prior to the first study intervention administration on day 1.\n* Participant has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\< 45% noted in screening echocardiogram (ECHO). Any clinically significant findings from this ECHO should be discussed with the medical monitor.\n* Participant is known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, participants with HIV infection with CD4+ T cell counts \\>/=350 cells/\u03bcL and no history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infections within the past 6 months are eligible. Note: No HIV testing is required at screening unless mandated per local requirements.\n* Participant has any of the following per screening serology test:\n\n  * a. Hepatitis A virus antibodies immunoglobulin (IgM)\n  * b. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or detectable hepatitis B Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). Participant with negative HBsAg, positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and negative hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) are eligible if hepatitis B DNA is undetectable\n  * c. hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies unless HCV Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is undetectable\n* Participant has a history of drug-induced pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), currently has pneumonitis, or a prior history of ILD or non-infectious pneumonitis requiring high-dose glucocorticoids.\n* Participant has an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics within 14 days prior to study intervention administration.\n* Participant has received a prior allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplant.\n* Participant has had a major surgical procedure and has not completely recovered within 28 days prior to the start of study intervention.\n* Participant with recent positive antigen test for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) within 10 days prior to study intervention administration. Note: Participants who are asymptomatic after 10 days from the first positive antigen test may be enrolled.\n* Participant has received any investigational therapy or antineoplastic therapy or other immunotherapy within 21 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of study intervention. Note: Participants with prostate adenocarcinoma who do not have a bilateral orchiectomy should continue androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) during the study. A participant with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), receptor tyrosine kinase (encoded by the gene ROS1), or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation-positive NSCLC is allowed to remain on EGFR tyrosine receptor inhibitor, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitor or ALK inhibitor therapy until 4 days prior to the start of study intervention administration.\n* Participant requires or has received systemic steroid therapy or any other immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to ASP1002 administration. Participants using a physiologic replacement dose of corticosteroids equivalent to 10 mg per day of prednisone or less are allowed, as is receiving a single dose of systemic corticosteroids, or receiving systemic corticosteroids as premedication for radiologic imaging contrast is eligible.\n* Participant was discontinued from prior immunomodulatory therapy due to a grade \\>/=3 toxicity that was mechanistically related (e.g., immune-related) to the agent and deemed life-threatening.\n* Participant is expected to require another form of antineoplastic therapy while on study intervention.\n* Participant has another malignancy requiring active therapy; (other than those indicated in Inclusion Criterion No. 1).\n* Participants who have received prior anti-CD137 therapy.\n* Participant has received a live vaccine against infectious diseases within 28 days prior to initiation of study intervention.\n* Participant has any condition makes the participant unsuitable for study participation.\n* Participant has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to ASP1002 or any components of the formulation used.",
