The behavioral intervention will teach positive parenting through videos and quizzes that caregivers can access through a smartphone application. The program also gives parents and caregivers in-the-moment feedback their use of parenting strategies.\n\nThe main questions to answer are:\n\nIs parenting feedback provided by a smartphone application acceptable to caregivers? Is the phone application usable and acceptable to parents and caregivers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?\n\nIn the pilot trial, participants (parents/caregivers) will be randomly assigned to either (1) use the positive parenting intervention phone application (mobile Behavioral Parent Training: mBPT) or (2) use mBPT and receive brief, personalized phone prompts throughout their participation that target parenting behavior and intervention engagement."
