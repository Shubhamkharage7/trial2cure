            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates the effect of NBTXR3, radiation therapy, and pembrolizumab in treating patients with head and neck squamous cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). NBTXR3 may cause cell destruction when activated by radiation. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. And hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving NBTXR3, radiation therapy, and pembrolizumab may kill more tumor cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate tumor response of hafnium oxide-containing nanoparticles NBTXR3 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy (RT) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess unacceptable treatment-related toxicity of NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with R/M HNSCC.\n\nII. To assess the safety profile of NBTXR3 activated RT in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with R/M HNSCC.\n\nIII. To evaluate time-to-event outcomes of NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with R/M HNSCC.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To associate radiomic measurements with outcomes of treatment with NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\nII. To evaluate biomarkers of response in subjects treated with NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive hafnium oxide-containing nanoparticles NBTXR3 via injection intratumorally or intranodally on day 1. Beginning as early as day 3 and within 8 days of NBTXR3 injection, patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) every other day (QOD) or hypofractionated RT once daily (QD) over 1-2 weeks at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. Starting on the same day as radiation therapy, patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 2 years."

WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements but should still undergo pregnancy testing\n* Signed informed consent form (ICF) indicating that participant understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis other than HNSCC R/M with disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative intent\n* Less than 6-month time interval from prior radiation to the HN given as part of multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease\n* Prior radiation to the lung or liver target lesions\n* History of severe immune-related adverse events observed with previous immunotherapy (anti-PD-1/L1) or known sensitivity (grade \\>= 3) to any excipients\n* Has received any approved or investigational anti-neoplastic agent or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to NBTXR3 injection.\n\n  * Except anti-PD-1 therapy for patients assigned to cohort 2 (PD-1/L1 refractory), which will not require a washout window.\n  * A reduced washout window may be considered for therapies with short half-lives (i.e., kinase inhibitors) after discussion with Nanobiotix and investigator\n* Has not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to previous anti-neoplastic or immune-oncology therapy and/or interventions (including radiation) to =\\< grade 1.\n\n  * Participants with alopecia and =\\< grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible\n* Symptomatic central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis\n\n  * Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided that those lesions are radiologically stable (i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging at screening), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to NBTXR3 injection\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).\n\n  * Replacement therapy (i.e., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement \\[=\\< 10 mg prednisone\\] therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* At screening, past medical history of:\n\n  * Drug related pneumonitis\n  * Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)\n  * Unresolved organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia)\n  * Unresolved radiation related\n\n    * Pneumonitis\n    * Bronchopulmonary hemorrhage\n    * Abdominal hemorrhage\n    * Any grade 4 radiation related toxicity\n  * Unresolved gastrointestinal (GI) related events\n\n    * Diverticulitis\n\n      * Intra-abdominal abscess\n      * GI obstructions\n      * Abdominal carcinomatosis\n      * Any known risk factor for bowel perforation\n* Any live-virus vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases administered within 4 weeks prior to NBTXR3 injection\n\n  * Exception of other vaccines (e.g. pneumonia) is at the discretion of the treating physician after conducting a personalized risk assessment on a case by case basis\n* Prior allogenic stem cell transplantation or organ allograft\n* Known contraindication to iodine-based or gadolinium-based IV contrast\n* A history of prior malignancy other than the HNSCC.\n\n  * Subjects with a history of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, in situ cervical or breast cancer, prostate cancer in watchful wait, or those that have received curative therapy with no disease recurrence for \\>= 2 years may be enrolled\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with treatment\n* Known active, uncontrolled (high viral load) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection\n* Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Women of child-bearing potential and their male partners who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and up to 6 months, for females, and 220 days for males after the last dose of anti-PD-1.\n\n  * Acceptable methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year when used consistently and correctly\n* Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g., compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments",
