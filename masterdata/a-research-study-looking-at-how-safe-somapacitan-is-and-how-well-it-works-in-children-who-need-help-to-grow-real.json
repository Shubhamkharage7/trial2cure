Somapacitan is a new growth hormone medicine for treatment of low level of growth hormone. The study will last for about 3 years. During the study, the participants will be treated with somapacitan once a week. Somapacitan can be injected anytime during the day. The study doctor or nurse will show how to inject somapacitan, so that the participant knows how to do it at home."
