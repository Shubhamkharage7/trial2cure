            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn whether IBD patients have better disease outcomes and feel more empowered to manage their condition if they have access to text messaging with their clinical team and if their symptoms are more regularly monitored through text-based surveys.\n\nResearchers will compare participants who have access to text-based monitoring, communication and education to participants who have access to text-based education alone. Researchers will also examine if different social and other non-medical factors impact IBD symptoms and quality of life.\n\nAll participants will:\n\n* complete 5 brief on-line surveys over 12 months about their IBD and social risk factors,\n* receive IBD education content by text message up to 2 times a week.\n\nSome participants will also:\n\n* receive additional surveys by text to monitor their IBD progression,\n* have the opportunity to directly text message their IBD medical team.",
            "detailedDescription": "Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are chronic diseases with no cure. Patient activation, defined as having the knowledge, skill, and confidence to manage one's health, can improve outcomes in chronic diseases, including IBD. Tailored digital health interventions can facilitate proactive longitudinal care for IBD patients by improving patient activation, promoting self-management and remote monitoring and can be automated and implemented at scale.\n\nThe researchers are conducting a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored digital health intervention versus usual care to improve disease management and patient activation among teenage and adult patients with IBD. The researchers hypothesize the intervention will lead to higher patient activation, improved outcomes and quality of life and reduced health disparities among children and adults with IBD. Within the usual care arm, researchers will measure Social Determinants of Health at enrollment and evaluate associations between these factors and time spent in remission over a 1-year follow-up period.\n\nParticipants in both arms will complete electronic surveys at baseline and then quarterly thereafter for 12-months. The baseline survey will include: 1) basic demographic information, 2) social risk assessment (adapted from the Health-related Social Needs Screening Tool by the Centers for Medicare \\& Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) survey, this measure will be completed by the parent/guardian for pediatric participants), 3) patient reported outcomes for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (PRO-2-UC or PRO-2-CD), 4) IBD-related quality of life (Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ)), 5) IBD-related healthcare utilization, 6) IBD-related medication adherence and 7) patient activation measure (PAM Survey). All of these except demographic questions will be repeated at 12 months. Quarterly surveys at 3, 6, and 9 months will only include questions on IBD patient-reported outcomes and unplanned healthcare utilization (\\~8 questions) with the addition of medication adherence questions and the PAM at 6-months (12 additional questions).\n\nIn addition to these patient-reported data, providers and research coordinator at each site will perform chart abstraction to identify specific clinical disease-level factors (including disease severity and phenotype) and treatment-level factors (prior and current therapies).\n\nParticipants in both arms will receive texts approximately twice a week containing curated educational content. All participants will receive usual clinical care per discretion of their treating provider and will maintain usual healthcare interactions with the clinical team using their preferred method of interaction including phone or electronic communications within their Electronic Health Record (EHR).\n\nParticipants assigned to the intervention arm will receive enhanced electronic health care delivered through text messaging. This includes short monthly check in surveys to assess IBD disease progression. Survey cadence will increase to weekly for 4 weeks at a time if a participant reports severe symptoms. This also includes the opportunity to communicate with their clinical team through text messaging.\n\nAmong participants assigned to the usual care arm of the pragmatic trial, a cohort analysis will evaluate associations between social risk and IBD natural history and outcomes."
