The Sponsor may decide to open Stage 2 for any given group after review of safety and anti-tumor activity data from Stage 1.\n\nIn Stage 2, an additional 10 participants will be enrolled at the dose from Stage 1 as well as 20 additional participants at a second alternative dose. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 dose levels in Stage 2."
