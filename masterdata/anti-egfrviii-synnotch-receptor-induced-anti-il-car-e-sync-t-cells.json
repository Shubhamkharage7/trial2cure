            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of E-SYNC chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy in treating patients with EGFRvIII positive (+) glioblastoma. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so the CAR T cells will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine before treatment with CAR T cells may make the CAR T cells more effective.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety of IV infused E-SYNC T cells for the treatment of EGFRvIII positive (EGFRvIII+) glioblastoma (GBM) (both cohorts).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the feasibility of production and administration of E-SYNC T cells for the treatment of GBM (both cohorts).\n\nII. To determine the local priming of E-SYNC T cells by prospective evaluation of GBM tissue and peripheral blood (cohort 2 only).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine antitumor responses and survival after infusion of E-SYNC T cells.\n\nII. To evaluate development of immune responses against E-SYNC T cells favoring rejection.\n\nIII. To characterize the intratumoral immune landscape.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study utilizing E-SYNC T cells.\n\nCOHORT 1: Participants with newly diagnosed EGFRvIII+ glioblastoma with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT) unmethylated status who have completed initial radiation therapy will be assigned to cohort 1. Participants undergo leukapheresis for the creation of E-SYNC T cells at least 2 weeks after completion of their non-investigational, standard of care radiation therapy.\n\nCOHORT 2: Participants with EGFRvIII+ glioblastoma recurrence after initial chemoradiation who need surgery are assigned to cohort 2. Participants undergo leukapheresis for the creation of E-SYNC T cells more than 2 weeks after completion of their non-interventional, standard of care radiation therapy. Participants also undergo standard of care (SOC) surgical resection.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28, then every 4 weeks in weeks 8-24, every 8 weeks in weeks 32-48, every 12 weeks in weeks 60-96, every 3 months in months 24-36, and then annually in years 3-15."
