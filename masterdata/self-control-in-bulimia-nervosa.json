Specifically, the study team is investigating whether differences in behavior and brain activation in response to computer tasks after fasting and after eating a meal could help to explain the symptoms of bulimia nervosa. Data will be collected using questionnaires and a technology called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",
            "detailedDescription": "Treatment-resistant binge eating and purging may be perpetuated by self-control deficits linked to reduced activation in frontostriatal circuits. To date, however, neurocognitive studies of BN have not assessed the dynamic computational processes underlying inhibition or considered the fact that individuals with BN oscillate between two extremes-under-controlled and over-controlled intake. The proposed study combines neuroimaging with computational modeling to investigate the influences of acute fasting and eating (i.e., metabolic states) on how the brains of women with bulimia nervosa (BN) adaptively prepare for and exert inhibitory control. More specifically, the study has the following main objectives: 1) To determine whether eating and fasting affect adaptive inhibitory control and related frontostriatal activation abnormally in BN; 2) To identify associations of BN severity with state-specific frontostriatal activation and behavior."
