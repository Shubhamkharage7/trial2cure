            "briefSummary": "The aim of the 2 month randomized controlled trial is to investigate the feasibility of a novel progressive muscle resistance exercise in individuals with low bone mass.",
            "detailedDescription": "In 2008, medical cost of osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures was estimated to be $22 billion. This is further expected to rise because of an increase of 20% in population with osteoporosis, amounting to 12 million adults over the age of 50 years, by 2020, out of which 80% will be postmenopausal women. Unfortunately, benefits due to pharmacological interventions have plateaued. Consequently, there is a critical need to identify complementary therapies to enhance the treatment of low bone mass in older adults. The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of novel progressive muscle resistance exercise in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. Muscle will be assessed via imaging techniques and isokinetic dynamometer. Physical activity will be assessed via activity monitors. Blood will be collected to assess bone and muscle biomarkers. Balance will be assessed via clinical and biomechanical tests. Testing will be performed at 4 time points: baseline, 1 month, 3 month, and 6 months except imaging which will be done at the baseline and 6 months. The findings from this study will help us to understand the feasibility of resistive muscle exercise program in postmenopausal women with low bone mass."
