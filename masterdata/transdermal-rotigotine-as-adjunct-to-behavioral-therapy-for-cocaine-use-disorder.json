            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b pilot clinical trial to determine whether non-ergoline D3/D2/D1 dopamine (DA) receptor agonist rotigotine (RTG), in combination with treatment as usual, including individual or group behavioral therapy can a) reduce cocaine use and also b) increase brain activity in frontocortical areas of the brain, and, as a reflection of that - improve top-down cognitive control in persons with cocaine use disorder (CocUD).\n\nRotigotine is a marketed non-ergoline D3/D2/D1 DA agonist (RTG, Neupro\u00ae) in the form of a transdermal patch that is FDA-approved for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease and Restless Legs Syndrome. The premise of this project was based on apparent beneficial effects of RTG in a different human population characterized by executive function (EF) impairment. In light of the deficits in EF common in persons with CocUD, RTG may hold the potential for cognitive improvement in persons with CocUD who are in treatment as usual to both attend to and retain psychoeducation concepts better. In addition, rotigotine may help these individuals in recovery maintain goals better, where goal maintenance is a crucial integrative product of successful EF.",
            "detailedDescription": "Among different substance use disorders, stimulant use disorders are more consistently linked with impaired executive function (EF) of the brain, which is a set of cognitive skills like working memory that operate to enable self-control over behavior and long-term planning. Medications such as stimulants that increase function of the frontal cortex dopamine (DA) system can improve EF. However, stimulants such as amphetamine have abuse potential. Of interest is determining whether a multiple DA receptor medication like rotigotine could improve brain function in persons with stimulant use disorder who are in therapy, to help them retain educational concepts and strategies better. Rotigotine has been shown to improve cognition-related quality of life in persons with Alzheimer's Disease. This is a roughly six week trial of rotigotine (given in a skin patch) to determine whether it not only reduces cocaine use in persons in treatment for cocaine use disorder, but actually improves cognitive performance itself, and increases activity in the frontal cortex of the brain, compared to placebo. It is hypothesized that rotigotine will be specifically helpful for cognition and abstinence in those participants whose cognitive performance ability tested at baseline is below the median."

Comorbid PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder will be allowed.\n* Use of medications contraindicated for concurrent use along with rotigotine. These include dopamine antagonists such as antipsychotic medications (especially neuroleptics) or metoclopramide.\n* Subjects with evidence or history of any clinically significant medical disorder including biliary obstruction, hepatic disease, severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, or endocrine disease. However, controlled hypertension, controlled hypothyroidism, and cancer in remission over 5 years will not be excluded.\n* Have a history of seizures (excluding childhood febrile seizures) or loss of consciousness (e.g. from traumatic brain injury) for more than 30 minutes.\n* Have significant current suicidal or homicidal ideation or a suicide attempt within the past 6 months.\n* Be HIV positive by self-report or history.\n* Be pregnant or nursing or not using a reliable form of contraception if able to conceive. All females must provide negative pregnancy urine tests before study entry, at each visit during the study, and the end of study participation\n* Have any other illness, or condition, which in the opinion of the clinical co-investigator (Arias) would preclude safe and/or successful completion of the study.\n* Have metal fragments or other bodily metal (e.g., pacemaker) or significant claustrophobia that would put the subjects at risk for MRI scanning.\n* Be allergic to rotigotine.\n* Have taken any investigational drug within 45 days prior to baseline\n* Show clinically significant symptoms of cocaine or opioid withdrawal\n* Demonstrate intolerance to, poor adherence to, or extreme skin irritation by daily application of known placebo \"practice\" skin patches during the screening phase\n* Current/pending criminal charges that may result in incarceration within the next 60 days",
