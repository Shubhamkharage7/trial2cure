This study builds on the longitudinal collection of questionnaire data from pregnant and postpartum people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each closed virtual support group will meet weekly for 4 weeks using a video conference platform. Groups will be focused on grounding, thinking patterns, self-compassion and self-care. This approach will foster increase awareness of wellbeing as well as social support between group participants. Primary outcomes include the feasibility and acceptability of this group-based intervention for perinatal individuals."
