This natural history study is designed to address the lack of understanding of disease progression. Additionally it will identify clinical and biomarker endpoints for use in future clinical trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a longitudinal observational study of the natural history of SLC13A5 deficiency for up to 2 years. This study does not involve any therapeutic intervention. The study includes in-person clinical assessments and laboratory analyses including standardized clinical evaluations, neurocognitive and quality of life scales, video movement rating scale, laboratory measurements of blood and urine, EEG capturing wake and sleep, EKG. Additionally, remote assessments in 1st year (every 3 months) and 2nd year (every 4 months) of enrollment will be made and caregiver will be asked to keep a seizure diary for the duration of the study. Personnel having expertise to comprehensively evaluate biological pathways that are perturbed by SLC13A5 deficiency will analyze the collected data. Improved understanding of disease pathogenesis will guide therapeutics and reveal clinical and biomarker endpoints for use in future clinical trials."
