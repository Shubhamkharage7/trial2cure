            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot study to see whether a combination of two investigational drugs that target the immune system can be given to people with colorectal cancer before surgically removing the tumor. This study is also being done to see what side effects this combination of drugs has and what effect they have on colorectal cancer. The two monoclonal antibodies are balstilimab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, and botensilimab, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor. This study has 3 cohorts. Participants in Cohort A will receive a total of 2 doses of balstilimab and a single dose of botensilimab, both given intravenously (IV), before surgery. Participants in Cohort B and C will receive a total of 4 doses of balstilimab and a single dose of botensilimab, both given intravenously (IV), before surgery. Participants in Cohort C must have dMMR/MSI-High colorectal cancer.",

This is a single-center, open-label, pilot study in which patients will receive 2 or 4 doses of intravenous (IV) balstilimab (each dose approximately 2 weeks apart), and a single dose of botensilimab IV, prior to resection in patients with colon cancer. Following surgical resection, participants will return to the clinic for 1-2 post-op follow-up visits."
