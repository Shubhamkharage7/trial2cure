            "briefSummary": "The goal of this interventional clinical trial is to determine if low doses of gentle chemotherapy after bone marrow transplant may prevent relapse and promote an increase in survival and decrease in side effects in participants with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The main question it aims to answer is whether or not providing a new, gentler way of administering chemotherapy will help control leftover cancer with minimal side effects. This treatment involves decitabine and venetoclax. Participants will receive standard post-transplant care. Participants will be administered decitabine once per week with normal transplant follow up visits, and then will take a venetoclax pill about 6 to 8 hours later. Participants will meet their study team at the beginning, midway, and at the end of the trial to receive bone marrow testing. Participants will receive treatment until either one year of therapy, relapse, or recurrent dose limiting toxicity (DLT) despite dose reduction.",
            "detailedDescription": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. While 60-80% patients can achieve remission, a high rate of relapse mandates consolidative treatment. Unfortunately, 40% of AML patients and 30% of myelodysplastic syndrome patients will relapse after alloSCT, and those who relapse after transplant exhibit poor outcomes. As such, prevention of post-transplant relapse remains a key interest. Maintenance therapy with low-intensity chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy is one strategy that holds promise to reduce post-transplant relapse, controlling residual subclinical disease before frank relapse. As post-transplant maintenance strategies yield mixed results, standard of care maintenance therapy remains an unmet clinical need.\n\nThe combination of hypomethylating agents (HMAs), such as decitabine or 5-azacytidine, and the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax combination has transformed the management of transplant-ineligible AML patient improving median overall survival (OS) to 14.7 months compared to 9.6 months with azacytidine and placebo at the cost of more pronounced cytopenias (Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurring in 45%/38% and 42%/28% respectively).\n\nRecent work has demonstrated a mechanism by which HMAs cooperate with venetoclax, via priming AML cells for death via the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR transcription factor activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) is upregulated in a matter of hours after HMA treatment, and in turn activates Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 (PMAIP1) (NOXA) that degrades the BCL2-family member myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1), thus creating greater dependence in HMA-exposed malignant cells on BCL2 to avoid BAX/BAK mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), caspase release, and subsequent apoptosis. An irreversible step toward apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) by BAX/BAK oligomers, which releases caspase proteases into the cells, a commitment into apoptosis that is fundamentally counteracted by BCL2-family antiapoptotic proteins, e.g., BCL2, the target of venetoclax inhibition. This mechanism primes AML blasts for venetoclax-mediated toxicity.\n\nThrough rigorous pharmacological optimization, it has been shown that the decitabine 5 mg/m2 weekly with a single dose of venetoclax 6 hours after the decitabine can control disease with limited effects normal hematopoietic cells.9 This novel dosing regimen may maximize decitabine/venetoclax anti-leukemic activity while minimizing hematologic toxicity and represents an attractive regimen for post-alloSCT maintenance therapy."
