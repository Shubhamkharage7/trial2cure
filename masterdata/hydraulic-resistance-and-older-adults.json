The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the use of hydraulic exercise equipment decrease fall risk in older adults?\n* Does the use of hydraulic exercise equipment improve function in older adults?\n\nParticipants will be evaluated pre and post intervention for strength, fall risk using Berg Balance Scale, Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment, Timed Up and Go, and functional ability using the Lower Extremity Functional Scale. Participants will engage in an exercise program using 5 different pieces of hydraulic exercise equipment (Frei FACTUM\u00ae novus II line) 2x/week for for 6 weeks for 30-45 minutes each session. The equipment uses concentric movements only and works agonist and antagonist muscles with each machine (IE: push and pull, both concentric)."
