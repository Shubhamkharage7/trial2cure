The intervention takes place in a warm water therapy pool, twice a week for ten weeks and targets swim safety skills, upper extremity function and self care participation and performance.",

The intervention will target swim safety skills, upper extremity function and self care participation and performance in children with neuromotor conditions such as cerebral palsy. The study includes an intake evaluation session, twenty sessions of aquatic therapy (twice a week for 10 weeks) and a post evaluation session. This takes place in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nEach session will be a combination of land-based self care training and water-based upper extremity exercise and swim skill training. The intervention structure will include the following:\n\n1. Self Care Session: Doffing clothing, preparing for swimming\n2. Motor learning aquatic activities guided by individualized goals\n3. Self Care session: Towel dry, rinse off, dressing\n\nIndividualized activities will be planned according to the individualized goals written for each child participant."
