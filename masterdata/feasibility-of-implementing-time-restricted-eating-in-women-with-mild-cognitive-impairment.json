Data will be collected for 10 weeks. Baseline food timing, activity/sleep, metabolic health (fasting labs and anthropometric measures), and cognitive testing will be collected in the first two weeks. Subjects will then be invited to enroll in a TRE intervention for 8 weeks. Subjects will be educated about the potential health benefits of TRE, and then each subject will self-select a 10-hr window and consume all daily calories during this time frame. Subjects will text the time of their first and last daily calories for the duration of the study. At the end of the 8-week TRE intervention, metabolic, anthropometric, activity/sleep, and cognitive measurements will be collected."
