            "detailedDescription": "This pilot trial is part of a larger R61/R33 to test the effectiveness of brief video and text messaging interventions on PTSD and opioid misuse among recent survivors of sexual assault presenting for medical care. In the R61 phase, researchers are working with a sexual assault advisory board to develop the video and text interventions. The research team is partnering with 5-6 Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner programs across the United States to recruit 50 participants. In this pilot trial, researchers aim to test the feasibility of recruitment strategies, acceptability of the interventions among survivors, and preliminary effectiveness of the interventions at addressing PTSD and opioid misuse."
