The investigators also aim to determine the effect of cryocompression versus cryotherapy on patient tolerability and patient and staff satisfaction.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be randomized by patient to receive cryotherapy wraps plus compression therapy (cryocompression) versus cryotherapy wraps alone applied to the bilateral hands and feet. Participants will receive cryotherapy (+/- compression) for the duration of their taxane infusions. Participants will be asked to complete the FACT-NTX survey and a PNQ neuropathy surveys at each infusion visit to evaluate symptoms related to neuropathy. Participants will also complete a brief acceptability and tolerability survey at each visit. Lastly, a staff satisfaction survey will be administered at each visit as well. The investigators will test the hypothesis that the average final visit FACT-NTX11 scores in the cryotherapy group are noninferior to the cryocompression group with a noninferiority margin of 2.5 points. The investigators will routinely monitor for the following adverse events: frost bite, (unexpected) hospitalizations, and death."
