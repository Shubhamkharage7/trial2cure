TMAO is an attractive therapeutic target to improve vascular health and diastolic function toward preventing CVD in LT patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to better understand the role of TMAO in cardiovascular dysfunction patients with chronic kidney disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite medical and surgical advances, long-term survival in liver transplant (LT) recipients is compromised by an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) after transplant, the mechanisms of which are still not fully understood. Following LT, patients have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic CVD. Notably, atherosclerotic CVD is an established risk factor for diastolic dysfunction and incident heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). There is a critical need to better understand the biological mechanisms of LT related vascular dysfunction and establish targeted interventions that will reduce the risk of CVD in this patient population. In the general population, there is strong epidemiological evidence linking high TMAO levels with atherosclerotic CVD and heart failure, and that it can modulated rapidly by diet within two weeks. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to better understand the role of TMAO in cardiovascular dysfunction patients with chronic kidney disease."
