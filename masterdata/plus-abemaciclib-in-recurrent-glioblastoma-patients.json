Participants will be administered LY3214996 plus Abemaciclib prior to surgical resection of their tumor. If positive PK results are demonstrated in \u226550% of Phase 0 participants and at least 5 participants are enrolled into Phase 2, up to approximately 40 additional participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion cohort in order to achieve a total of 25 participants enrolled into Phase 2 (lead-in cohort + dose expansion)."

Known active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous \\[IV\\] antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis B or C \\[for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive\\]. Screening is not required for enrollment.\n7. Have history of central or branch retinal artery or venous occlusion with significant vision loss or other retinal diseases that cause current visual impairment or would likely cause visual impairment over the time period of the study.\n8. Participant has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\<30ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).\n9. Prior therapy with any CDK4/6 inhibitor or any ERK1/2 inhibitor. Prior therapy is defined as a therapeutic dosing.\n10. Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention within 30 days prior to enrollment or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer.\n11.
