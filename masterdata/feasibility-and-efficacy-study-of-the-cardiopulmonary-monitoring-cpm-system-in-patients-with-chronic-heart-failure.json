            "briefSummary": "The primary purpose for this study is to support the hypothesis (pilot data) that the use of the CPM system reduces the rate of HF related events and the related healthcare cost. The study will also measure the impact on quality of care and patient satisfaction. In order to support the primary objective, the study will compare the outcomes and costs for patients using the CPM system \\& have their data reviewed by a physician against those who are using the CPM system and not having their data reviewed.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is meant primarily to determine the clinical and financial efficacy of the CPM system in reducing HF events and their associated cost. Although patients will use an investigational device as part of this pilot, the device is passive and of minimal risk to the patient. No treatment changes will be decided on the CPM data solely. All CPM data will be confirmed with a symptomology assessment and the patient's care provider will make the final determination whether a change of treatment is appropriate or not.\n\nThere will be two groups, the study cohort and the control cohort. After informed consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized. The randomization will occur in the EDC and will be 2:1.\n\nThe study group will receive all aspects of the CPM monitoring system as a supplement to their normal care routine. They will have one visit at the beginning of the study and one visit 6 months later. Patients in the study group will receive the CPM device at visit 1 and use the CPM device once a day during the monitoring period of the study (6 months) and the data will be monitored by the ADI Care Team. During this period, the research team will monitor the patient's chart, recommended once every 2 weeks, looking for CHF outcomes (i.e. medicine changes, hospitalizations, ER visits, clinic visits). After the 6-month monitoring period, visit 2 will occur. The site research team will continue to monitor the patient's chart for an additional 4 weeks after visit 2 to capture clinical outcomes. Patients using the device will also have the phone number for ADI Tech Support. Patients will be instructed to call this number if they believe their device is malfunctioning or if they have questions on how to use it. Device malfunctions that can be fixed remotely are not classified as adverse events (unless they result in harm). Device malfunctions that require subject to return for an office visit are considered adverse events.\n\nThe control group will receive the CPM device, but its data will not be monitored. They will sign the consent form and go through the screening process as usual. They will participate in the same visits as the study group and use the device once daily, ideally in the morning (same as study group0. Their chart will also be monitored during the 6 month of device use and for 30 days after. They will not receive calls about their device data."
