Determine the effect of provision of quality-of-life (QOL) information versus usual care for standard of care surgery or SBRT treatment on decision regret.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the effect of provision of QOL information versus usual care for standard of care surgery or SBRT treatment on QOL measures.\n\nII. Determine the influence of socioeconomic status on the relationship between decision regret and QOL information associated with each treatment modality.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP A: Patients receive study QOL intervention fact sheet during the initial consult that occurs 4 weeks prior to the standard of care surgery or SBRT. Patients have an opportunity to review the QOL fact sheet in person and discuss any questions with the treating physician(s).\n\nGROUP B: Patients receive usual care during the initial consult that occurs 4 weeks prior to the standard of care surgery or SBRT.\n\nPatients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after standard of care surgery or SBRT."
