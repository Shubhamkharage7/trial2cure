Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study and for the duration of the study.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior treatment with osimertinib in the metastatic setting (outside of osimertinib given immediately prior to and during the enrollment period). Prior treatment with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or first-line metastatic setting is however allowed.\n* Prior immunotherapy and/or frontline EGFR-directed treatment in the metastatic setting. EGFR directed therapy in the adjuvant setting is permitted, as long as the disease-free interval between completion of adjuvant therapy with EGFR directed therapy and initiation of osimertinib is more than or equal to 1 year.\n* Disease refractory to osimertinib, given immediately prior to and during enrollment period.\n* A history of other malignancy with the exception of:\n\n  * malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 1 year before registration and the patient has no evidence of disease; or\n  * known indolent malignancies, or malignancies that do not require active treatment and are unlikely not alter the course of treatment of metastatic NSCLC per treating physician.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents or herbal medications\n* Presence of symptomatic central nervous system metastases or neurologically unstable CNS symptoms (unable to taper steroids). Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible.

Effusion controlled by presence of an indwelling pleural catheter is not exclusionary.\n* Decompensated heart failure or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (\\<50%)\n* Major surgery within 30 days prior to first day of study treatment (osimertinib + APL-101).\n* Poorly controlled diarrheal or gastrointestinal disorders (grade 2 or higher diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting at baseline).\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.\n* Unresolved grade 2 or higher treatment-related toxicities (with the exception of endocrine abnormalities as a result of immunotherapies that are being managed with hormonal supplementation). However, if the treating physician is under the impression that the toxicity under question is unlikely to affect study participation, patient eligibility can be discussed with the PI on a subject by subject basis. After enrollment to this study, osimertinib-related toxicities must resolve to \u2264 grade 1 before patient may begin combination therapy.\n* Presence of interstitial lung disease",
