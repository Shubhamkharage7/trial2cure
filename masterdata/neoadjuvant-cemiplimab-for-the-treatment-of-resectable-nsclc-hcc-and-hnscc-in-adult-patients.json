            "briefSummary": "This study is being done to better understand whether or not cemiplimab by itself and in combination with other treatments given prior to surgery will cause your tumor to respond in a beneficial way; whether the drug(s) are safe and what side effects they cause; and other details about how they function in the body. One of the treatments that will be combined cemiplimab is another experimental drug called fianlimab. In this form, cemiplimab and fianlimab will each individually be called \"study drug\" or \"study drugs\" when combined.\n\nCemiplimab (also known as REGN2810) and fianlimab (also known as REGN3767) are both a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins naturally found in your blood that fight infections. A monoclonal antibody is a special kind of antibody that is manufactured as a medication to target specific proteins in the body that may be involved in your cancer.\n\n* Cemiplimab is a drug that blocks the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1), a cell receptor on immune cells\n* Fianlimab is a drug that blocks the action of a protein called lymphocyte activation gene (LAG)-33 (LAG-3)"
