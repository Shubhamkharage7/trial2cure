The investigators will conduct this study in the community and work with two vegan soul food restaurants. The investigators propose to examine the effectiveness and implementation of community-delivered, 3-month NEW Soul program among participants (N=228).\n\nUsing a randomized design, the investigators will assess effectiveness of two delivery approaches: (1) In-person, live weekly classes with restaurant vouchers (intervention) or (2) restaurant voucher-only (active control).\n\nThe investigators will also conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of delivering the online intervention plus voucher vs. voucher-only with the outcome of cost/change in weight, healthy eating index, and quality adjusted life year.\n\nLastly, the investigators will examine the implementation of the NEW Soul study with participants and intervention staff."
