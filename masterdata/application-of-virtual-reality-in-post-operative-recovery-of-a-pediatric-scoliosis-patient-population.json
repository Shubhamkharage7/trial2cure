            "detailedDescription": "All pediatric patients (ages 13-18) at Connecticut Children's Medical Center undergoing corrective scoliosis surgery for idiopathic scoliosis are eligible and will be approached for consent and inclusion into the study. This is a prospective pilot study, and all enrolled patients will receive a virtual reality (VR) intervention using a commercially available device manufactured by Oculus. The VR software will simulate a low physical load environment, such as an underwater space exploration game. Starting on postoperative day 1, the prospective cohort will undergo a 20-minute VR session 30 minutes prior to each physical therapy session. There will be two physical therapy sessions scheduled daily for the participant. Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the VR session and after the physical therapy session. The following procedures will continue daily until the participant is cleared for hospital discharge. A retrospective chart review will also be performed on patients with idiopathic scoliosis who have undergone corrective surgery to serve as a historical control for the study. The retrospective arm of the study only includes patients who have not received a VR intervention."
