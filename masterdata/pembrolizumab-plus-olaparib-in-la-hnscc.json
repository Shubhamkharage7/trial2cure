            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using a combination of pembrolizumab and olaparib when given before and after standard chemoradiation therapy in treating locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab and olaparib are drugs that are approved for head and neck cancer treatment. However, FDA has not approved the use of these two drugs together in treating head and neck cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "Treatment outcomes are poor for patients with locally advance human papilloma virus (HPV) negative and high-risk HPV positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). One standard of care (SOC) for HNSCC is definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the addition of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death-1 (PD1) inhibitor, and olaparib, a Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose polymerization (PARP) inhibitor, before and after SOC CRT, which will be delivered in 70 Gray in 35 fractions with concurrent weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 over 7 weeks.\n\nTreatment will be offered in three sequential phases. In the induction phase, participants will receive one infusion of pembrolizumab and will take olaparib tablets for a total of 21 days. In the chemoradiation phase, radiation therapy will administered daily (excluding weekends) and cisplatin infusion will be given weekly. In the maintenance phase, pembrolizumab infusion will be done once every 6 weeks in additional to twice daily olaparib tablets for up to 8 treatment cycles that are 42-days per cycle."
