The specific aims of the current study are:\n\n1. To determine brain uptake, distribution, and kinetics of \\[11C\\]SY08 in healthy individuals.\n2. To determine brain uptake, distribution, and kinetics of \\[11C\\]SY08 in patients with alpha synuclein aggregates in the brain, including PD, DLB and MSA.\n3. To determine human dosimetry of \\[11C\\]SY08 in healthy individuals\n\nAn intravenous bolus injection of \\[11C\\]SY08 will be administered per subject for brain PET imaging."
