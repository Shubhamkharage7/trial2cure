            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in addition to standard of care in the treatment of tibial and metatarsal bone stress injuries in a military training setting.\n\nParticipants will all receive usual care and also be randomized to either active or sham photobiomodulation therapy. Effectiveness will be assessed based on time to return to duty and measures of pain and function.\n\n* Participants will receive care for a maximum of 6 weeks.\n* Participants will have follow-up through 4 months (or graduation/dismissal from training, whichever comes first).",
            "detailedDescription": "Trainees with a diagnosis of medial tibial or metatarsal bone stress injuries/stress fracture will be recruited. Patients that consent and enroll will be randomized to receive standard of care physical therapy with (1) photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) or (2) sham PBMT. Patients will receive treatment 3x per week for up to 6 weeks. The primary outcome will be the time to return to duty. Secondary outcomes will include additional time points (3-week, 6-week, 4-month) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS\u00ae) measures of pain and function, lower extremity imaging and various other measures outlined in the \"Outcome Measure\" section. Participants will be asked to report any mineral supplementation and to record daily activity in a log. Survival analysis will be used to evaluate return to duty between treatment arms with censoring beyond 4 months.\n\nLongitudinal hierarchical/multilevel models with random effects will be used to evaluate differences between treatment arms for the relevant outcome measures. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted predicting change in measures at the final follow-up relative to baseline, and will use linear generalized additive models."
