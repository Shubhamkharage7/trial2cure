            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test if cognitive interventions in those with diagnosed epilepsy can help lessen cognitive lapses and improve overall brain health.\n\nParticipants will participate in weekly, virtual group sessions led by a neuropsychologist for 12 weeks. After the 12-week mark, participants will be asked to practice what they learned for 9 more months. Participants will be asked to complete online questionnaires at certain times during the study. Researchers will compare this intervention group to another group that did not get the intervention to see if the intervention improves brain health. Participation in each of these groups will be randomly assigned. Participation in the study will last for one year.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this prospective, controlled, randomized study, investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention in improving daily function (primary outcome) in those with epilepsy. Investigators will also seek to understand how the cognitive intervention may impact objective and subjective cognitive function, quality of life, self-efficacy, locus of control, and mood (secondary outcomes).\n\nThe study team will accomplish these objectives by comparing participants that are randomly assigned to the cognitive intervention arm (12 weekly virtual group sessions led by a neuropsychologist followed by 9 months of \"self-study\" in addition to their standard care) to participants randomly assigned to the control arm (continuation of their standard care during the 12 months of the study). Investigators will measure the effects of the intervention using cognitive assessments, and health and quality of life questionnaires. Investigators will also collect human biospecimens of enrolled participants to assess the biologic impact of the intervention."
