This study will build on IMPACT Melanoma's ability to install, maintain, and now for the first time, target and publicize the use of dispensers for a teen population. The investigators will test scalable methods for improving the use of free sunscreen dispensers by testing DFS interventions compared with the addition of social media led by teen ambassadors. The investigators will evaluate the impact of the intervention in both parks and beaches in Boston, MA and Maine."
