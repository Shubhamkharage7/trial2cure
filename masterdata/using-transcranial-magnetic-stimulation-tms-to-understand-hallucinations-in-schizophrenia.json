            "briefSummary": "This study uses a noninvasive technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study how hallucinations work in schizophrenia.\n\nTMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, using a magnetic field to change activity in the brain. The magnetic field is produced by a coil that is held next to the scalp. In this study the investigators will be stimulating the brain to learn more about how TMS might improve these symptoms of schizophrenia.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study tests the hypothesis that hallucinations in schizophrenia are mediated by network pathophysiology, and that network pathophysiology can be quantified by the functional connectivity of a cerebellar-thalamo-cortical circuit. To accomplish this, participants will be recruited who are diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who experience auditory hallucinations.\n\nParticipants will undergo an initial screening session to complete informed consent and undergo baseline assessments of schizophrenia symptom severity. These assessments include reporter-based measures such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).\n\nParticipants will then undergo an MRI scan that includes structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). These rsfMRI imagines will be used to isolate individual resting state networks for targeting of rTMS modulation.\n\nParticipants will then undergo five days of twice daily rTMS sessions.\n\nOne week after the last rTMS session, participants will undergo follow-up MRI imaging and the same study assessments."
