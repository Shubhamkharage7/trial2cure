All of these molecules can undergo oxidation in the citric acid cycle. The intent is to study the 13C labeling pattern of these molecules in control and G1D subjects to determine if downstream products (such as 13C bicarbonate or 13C glutamate) due to oxidation in the mitochondria can be detected in brain or in blood by NMR analysis. While inside the instrument, the subjects may also undergo a 7T MR exam to correlate spectroscopy with brain structure."

People or patients with uncontrolled seizure disorder, defined as grand mal (not absence) seizure in the preceding 3 months.\n2. Pregnant females will be excluded. A serum or urine pregnancy test will be administered to all females of child bearing potential within 24 hours of administration of the tracer and MRI scan. The pregnancy test will be communicated in person by the study PI. Positive results in subjects 17 years old or younger will be disclosed to parent/guardian only.\n3. Subjects with typical implanted orthopedic metal in bone may be considered for inclusion in a 7T scan providing the implant is not within the volume of the radio frequency coil. The PI and the AIRC Medical Director will discuss each case and determine eligibility.\n4. Persons with ICD, pacemakers, neurostimulators and other such devices will be excluded.\n5. Persons with claustrophobia are excluded.\n6. Persons with questionable ferrous implants, bullets, BB's, and shrapnel will be excluded.\n7. Subjects who are not fluent in English will be excluded because immediate cooperation and the ability to respond to instructions from the investigators are necessary.",
