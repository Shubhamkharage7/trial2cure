            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a randomized controlled study for a home-based, virtually supervised, aerobic exercise intervention for Black men with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance. There is evidence that exercise may suppress cancer progression, but the evidence is preliminary and Black men with prostate cancer has been highly underrepresented in exercise clinical research despite their higher risk of cancer progression compared to White counterparts.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: Group A: Aerobic high-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus Group B: Usual Care. Randomization means a participant is placed into a study group by chance.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, survey questionnaires, blood tests, and follow-up visits.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last about 18 weeks.\n\nIt is expected that about 68 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe Prostate Cancer Foundation is providing funding for this research study."
