Otherwise, the assigned fixed dose is 20 \u00b5g. Drug is administered intravenously (IV) by continuous infusion over 45 (\u00b15) minutes.

A diagnosis of MS must be confirmed at the time of the screening visit.\n6. Processing Speed Test (PST) z-score between -1.0 and -2.5\n7. EDSS between 0.0 and 7.0, inclusive.\n8. Adequate vision and motor function to participate in assessment procedures\n9. Participants must be on a stable dose of a DMT for at least 1 year prior to entry into the study, and the dose should not change during the study unless a change is required by a clinically significant change in the participant's status.\n10. Females participating in the study must meet one the following criteria:\n\n    1. Surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) for at least 6 months or postmenopausal (postmenopausal females must have no menstrual bleeding for at least 1 year) or\n    2. If not postmenopausal, agree to use a double method of contraception, one of which is a barrier method (e.g., intrauterine device plus condom, spermicidal gel plus condom) 30 days prior to dosing until 30 days after last dose and have negative human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) test for pregnancy at screening. Contraception methods resulting in an overall failure rate of \\<1 % per year are required for women of childbearing potential.\n11. Males who have not had a vasectomy must use appropriate contraception methods (barrier or abstinence) from 30 days prior to dosing until 30 days after last dose\n12. Participants should be in reasonably good health over the last 6 months and any chronic disease should be stable.\n\nExclusion\n\n1. Evidence of significant CNS vascular disease on previous neuroimaging, including but not limited to cortical stroke, multiple infarcts, localized single infarcts in the thalamus, angular gyrus, multiple lacunar infarcts, or extensive white matter injury\n2. Clinically significant neurologic disease or condition other than MS, such as cerebral tumor, chronic subdural fluid collections, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or any other diagnosis that could interfere with assessment of safety and efficacy\n3. Previous history of seizures or seizure disorders.\n4. Evidence of clinically significant unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, or metabolic disease within the 6 months prior to enrollment. If there is a history of cancer, the participant should be clear of cancer for at least 2 years prior to screening. More recent history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma in situ (Stage 0) may be acceptable after review by the Medical Monitor.\n5. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of \\<45ml/min\n6. Poorly controlled diabetes (at the discretion of the Principal Investigator)\n7. Use of vitamin E \\> 400 International Units (IU) per day within 14 days prior to screening\n8. Use of valproic acid and/or lithium within 14 days prior to screening\n9. Routine or intermittent use of benzodiazepines in the last year (rare use in the last year is allowed as long as use during the study is not expected).\n10. Use of carbamazepine within 7 days prior to screening\n11. Use of teriflunomide within 90 days prior to screening\n12. Use of dalfampridine within 7 days of screening\n13. Current use of acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, and/or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole\n14.
