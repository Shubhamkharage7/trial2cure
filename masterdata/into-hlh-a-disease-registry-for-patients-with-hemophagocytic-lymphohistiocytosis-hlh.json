Despite available treatment options for HLH, approximately 30% of patients do not respond to therapy. Moreover, the standard therapy is constrained by its toxicities, and safer treatments are pursued.\n\nThere is an unmet need for a deeper understanding of the natural history, clinical/etiologic diversity, complications, and treatment outcomes of patients with HLH, specifically from North America. The proposed study, a collaboration between Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Texas Children's Hospital, and Sobi Inc. aims to establish a robust registry that will enable investigators to better define the natural history of HLH."
