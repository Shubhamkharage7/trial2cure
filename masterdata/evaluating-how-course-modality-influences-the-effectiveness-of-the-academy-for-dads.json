            "briefSummary": "The Cal-FIRE project is designed to offer the R3 Academy for Dads, a robust 24-hour program, to predominantly low-income adult fathers, ages 18 and over in the state of California. The R3 Academy is an evidence-based parenting curriculum that helps fathers strengthen their relationships with their child, with their spouse/co-parent, and at work. The program also includes two evidence-based components that address economic stability and an innovative approach to Case Management that fosters client self-direction. The R3 Academy curricula will be delivered in both English and Spanish through two modalities: 1) live classes and 2) livestream classes via a video conferencing platform. The Local Evaluation will examine how modality, or in other words attending a live class versus a livestream class, influences the effectiveness of responsible fatherhood education when it comes to father involvement and coparenting. The question of modality is a timely one. In the COVID-19 era, many programs have become exclusively online-but the potential impact on effectiveness is not well known. Data from this study will help illuminate what can be gained or jeopardized in a world increasingly moving toward modes of virtual engagement. Specifically, the current evaluation will explore potential similarities and differences related to the implementation of the two modalities and their influence of father outcomes. Specific research questions include:\n\nRQ1: How do live (control) and livestream (treatment) responsible fatherhood workshops compare on father involvement outcomes? RQ2: How do live (control) and livestream (treatment) workshops compare on father involvement outcomes? RQ3: Do program effects last beyond program completion?",
            "detailedDescription": "Fathers in this study are required to take an Eligibility survey. If they meet the required eligibility criteria, the survey will gather further information including screening factors associated with domestic violence that, if checked, will be flagged for further assessment by personal contact with our Case Management Supervisor. This form also will enable the registrant to identify which class format he wishes to attend-a live R3 Academy or a livestream workshop via a video conferencing platform. For the purpose of this study, the live or in-person modality is considered the control group and the livestream workshop is considered the treatment group. The R3 Academy curriculum is the same for each group, only the modality of curriculum delivery is different. Courses are a total of 24 hours and are split into either 6- or 12-week formats. Incentives for program completion include a $50 gift card that is offered to those who complete at least 90% of the program. In addition to the Eligibility survey, participants are asked to take a pre-survey before starting the class, a post-survey immediately following class completion, and a 4-month follow-up survey. If participants complete all three surveys they are eligible for an additional $25 gift card which they can receive even if they did not reach 90% completion.\n\nAs stated previously, entry into treatment or control groups is determined at enrollment. At the time of the impact analysis, propensity score matching (PSM) comparison groups will be formed-this statistical analysis will match up similar participants from each group to allow for comparison across conditions. PSM allows researchers to estimate differences between treatment and control groups in non-randomized samples. PSM will allow us to directly compare matched cases-meaning that the treatment and control groups will have a similar distribution of sociodemographic and sociocultural characteristics. This allows us to consider how outcomes vary between treatment and control groups, while accounting for the potential self-selection into different program groups. Participants will be matched across multiple metrics, including: racial/ethnic identity, sex/gender, income, education level, language of instruction, number of children, employment status, age, marital status, and residential status. As clients may choose one program delivery modality over another due to work, childcare availability, or time, measures will be included for work schedule, availability of social support, work flexibility, and work-family stress."
