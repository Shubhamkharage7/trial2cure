Humoral and cellular immune responses, both innate and adaptive, circulating virus, and changes in clinical laboratory measures will also be examined.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pharmacology studies have identified the potential for fenretinide to inhibit the binding of the DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to host nuclear importins (IMPs) IMP-\u03b1 and IMP-\u03b21, thereby impairing infection and replication. This Phase 2 study is to evaluate the effectiveness of fenretinide in an encapsulated oral formulation (ISLA101) against challenge with Dengue 1 Live Virus Human Challenge (DENV-1-LVHC) product, both prophylactically and therapeutically. Oral doses will be taken with a high fat meal to improve absorption, as fenretinide is known to have poor gut permeability attributed to its accumulation in lipophilic cell membranes."
