            "detailedDescription": "These patients are at high risk of SSI but given the rapidity with which they need their operations, interventions that take time are difficult or impossible to use in this patient population. This study will involve identifying patients with HELEF and applying PVI to their nares within 60 minutes before their surgical incisions are made and again approximately 12 hours after the first dose. The investigators will abstract information from the patients' medical records about their demographics, underlying illnesses, injury severity, the surgical procedures, and SSI for the 6 months following their operations and the investigators will see them during their routinely scheduled visit at about 6 months to ask them whether they were treated for SSI by providers outside of our system. For patients who do not return for follow up, the investigators will try to contact them to determine if they had signs or symptoms of SSI or were treated for SSI outside of our system."
