We will enroll patients who underwent mpMRI of the prostate as part of their standard clinical care, have PI-RADS 4, or 5 lesion(s) on mpMRI, and are scheduled to undergo fusion guided prostate biopsy. Subjects that sign the consent form will be randomized to undergo DCFPyL PET/CT imaging or no PSMA PET imaging prior to the prostate biopsy. In the PSMA scan cohort, decision for biopsy targets will be made based on the combination of the findings of mpMRI and PSMA scans. In the no PSMA scan (control) group, the biopsy will be performed based on mpMRI findings. Each patient will undergo 12 core systematic biopsy as the standard of care. Two additional biopsies for each mpMRI and PSMA PET and overlap lesion will also performed."
