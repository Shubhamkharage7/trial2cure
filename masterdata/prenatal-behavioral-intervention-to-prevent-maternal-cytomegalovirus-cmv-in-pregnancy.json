After enrollment, they will be randomized to either the CMV risk-reduction intervention or an attention-matched control stress-reduction group stratified by their CMV serostatus.\n\nWomen in both groups will attend an individualized behavioral skills session, watch a short video, receive a take-home packet, receive weekly text messages for 12 weeks that reinforce the experimental and control health messages, and attend follow-up visits at 6 and 12 weeks. Saliva, urine, vaginal, and blood specimens will be collected at enrollment and 6 and 12 weeks follow-up visits. Additionally, at-home saliva and vaginal specimen collection will occur at 3 and 9 weeks and once during the third trimester of pregnancy. At delivery, a saliva specimen will be collected from both the mother and infant, along with a remnant cord blood specimen."
