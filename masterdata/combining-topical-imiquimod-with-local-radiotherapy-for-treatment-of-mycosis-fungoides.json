            "briefSummary": "Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common subtype of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (MF) and presents as cutaneous patches, plaques, and tumors. Radiation therapy (RT) is a frequently pursued management option for CTCL, especially in patients with more advanced skin disease. Imiquimod stimulates a Th1 lymphocyte response with increased IL-2 and IFN-\u03b1, but also induces IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8, thereby bridging both innate and adaptive immunity. Dosing of both radiotherapy (RT) and imiquimod are based on standard-of-care doses/frequencies for CTCL. The reason imiquimod topical is given for a week before giving RT is to prime innate immune activity for when RT is delivered. It is believed that this serves as an adjuvant for the CD8+ antitumor response generated by RT. The primary aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination local radiotherapy and topical imiquimod approach for the treatment of conventional (CD4+) MF."
