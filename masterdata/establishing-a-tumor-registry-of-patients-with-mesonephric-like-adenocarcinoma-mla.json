To organize clinical information to support multifaceted queries of participant characteristics, treatment, and disease outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these characteristics with participant outcome.\n2. To have a single data repository kept on a secure platform that will integrate clinical information and research findings and serve as an archive for future research."
