This study will examine the impact of Harlem Strong Community Mental Health Collaborative, a community-wide multi-sectoral coalition in which a health insurer works with a network of community-based organizations, medical providers, and behavioral health providers to engage in a network-wide implementation planning process to: (1) problem-solve financing, access, and quality of care barriers, (2) support capacity building for mental health (MH) task-sharing for community health workers, (3) facilitate coordination and collaboration across MH/behavioral health, primary care, and a range of social services, including case management, housing supports, financial education, employment support, and other community resources to improve linkages to services, and (4) identify a set of common MH, social risk, and health metrics and strategies to integrate these metrics into data systems across the network for continuous quality improvement of the system. The long-term goal of our study is to develop sustainable model for task-sharing MH care that will be embedded in a coordinated comprehensive network of services, including primary care, behavioral/MH, social services, and other community resources.",

The research study will evaluate the impact using a Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness design to assess the effects of the Harlem Strong Collaborative on implementation and consumer outcomes. The investigators will also describe implementation outcomes and key informant interviews to explore impact of community engagement, organization variables, and provider factors on model impact. The long-term goal of this study is to develop a sustainable model for task-sharing MH care that will be embedded in a coordinated comprehensive network of services.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a stepped-wedge clustered randomized control study evaluating the effectiveness of a MH task-sharing intervention, that involves randomization and sequenced exposure to three implementation conditions: (1) online education and resources (E\\&R) about MH task-sharing (screening, education, and referral), (2) community-engaged multisector collaborative care model (MCC), where a neighborhood-based coalition will support implementation of MH task-sharing, and (3) community crowdsourced technology solution to support implementation (MCC+Tech)."
