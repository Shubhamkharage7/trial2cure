            "detailedDescription": "The main goal of this current study is to develop and optimize methods for increasing access to, uptake of, and engagement in MAT (Medication Assisted Treatment) among communities of color. Through a multilevel Community Based Participatory Research initiative and a rigorous RCT that incorporates elements of choice in participation, the study will examine whether adding a church-based telehealth MAT option to Imani (Imani + CTM) will improve outcomes for Black and Latinx people with Alcohol Use Disorder or Opioid Use Disorder)compared to Imani + Traditional MAT Referral and Linkage (Imani + Traditional MAT R\\&L) in the community. Individuals who do not choose to engage in MAT will continue in the Imani group program as usual. Imani (meaning Faith in Swahili) Breakthrough was developed in 2017 through a community based participatory research process. Imani Breakthrough is a faith-based, person-centered, culturally informed harm reduction recovery program that takes place in Black and Latinx churches in the community. This program provides an innovative approach to engaging vulnerable groups into Substance Use Disorder treatment by focusing on SAMHSA's 8 dimensions of wellness (social determinants of health), 7 domains of citizenship, culturally informed education, and referral to Medication Assisted Treatment defined as any Food and Drug Administration approved pharmacotherapy for treating Substance Use Disorder. The Community Based Participatory Research process, which incorporates learning from and partnering with the church and larger community (including providers and policymakers), aims to increase the community's understanding of Alcohol Use Disorder and Opioid Use Disorder, tackle Medication Assisted Treatment misconceptions, optimize IMANI implementation, and establish policy recommendations for the healthcare systems to better serve Black and Latinx with Substance Use Disorder.\n\nThe specific aims are:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of Imani + a church-based telehealth Medicine Assisted Treatment option (Imani + CTM) compared to Imani + Traditional MAT referral and linkage option (Imani + MAT R\\&L) on medication for addiction treatment initiation and engagement.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To assess whether there are changes in substance use over time for Imani+ CTM compared to Imani + Traditional MAT R\\&L.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To evaluate potential mediators and moderators (e.g., choice, SDOH) of improvements in primary SUD outcomes (initiation, engagement, and decreased substance use).\n\nExploratory Aim 1: To assess differences in the 7 domains of citizenship and 8 dimensions of wellness (social determinants of health) comparing those enrolled in a MAT condition to those NOT enrolled in a MAT condition."
