Aggressive surgical resection is the standard of care for resectable osteosarcoma recurrences limited to the lung. While previous studies testing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in osteosarcoma have shown limited efficacy, preclinical osteosarcoma studies demonstrate improved outcomes when ICIs are combined with radiation and administered with minimal residual disease. The proposed research will be a single-arm, safety pilot evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of Atezolizumab in combination with SBRT and surgery in patients with resectable, lung-only recurrence of osteosarcoma."
