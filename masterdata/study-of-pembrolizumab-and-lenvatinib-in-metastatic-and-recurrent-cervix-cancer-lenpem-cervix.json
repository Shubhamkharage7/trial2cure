Female participants:\n\n   * A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n   * Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\n\n   OR\n\n   Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of \\<1% per year), with low user dependency, or be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis), during the intervention period and for at least 120 days post pembrolizumab or 30 days post lenvatinib whichever occurs last. The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure (i.e., noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n   * A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum as required by local regulations) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention.\n   * If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.\n   * The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.\n8. Participants must have a PD-L1 diagnostic test of primary or recurrent archival tumor tissue.\n9. Participants may have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 mAb administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies.

Hepatitis B positive subjects\n\n    * Participants who are HBsAg positive are eligible if they have received HBV antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and have undetectable HBV viral load prior to randomization.\n    * Participants should remain on anti-viral therapy throughout study intervention and follow local guidelines for HBV anti-viral therapy post completion of study intervention.\n18. Participants with history of HCV infection are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable at screening.\n\n    - Participants must have completed curative anti-viral therapy at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n19. Have adequately controlled BP with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP \u2264150/90 mmHg with no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to randomization.\n20. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to enrollment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\n   Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.\n2. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 2 weeks prior to allocation.\n3. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention or radiation-related toxicities requiring corticosteroids.\n\n   Note: 2 weeks or fewer of palliative radiotherapy for non-CNS disease, with a 1-week washout, is permitted.\n4. Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention.

Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within seven days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n7. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past five years.\n\n   Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ, excluding carcinoma in situ of the bladder, that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n8. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.\n9. Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years except replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid)\n11. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n13.
