The goal of the study is to see if local anti-inflammation helps prevent re-thrombosis of the blood vessel and improvement in symptoms for up to 24 months after the initial DVT recanalization procedure."

Intracranial/intraspinal tumor within the last 365 days.\n24. Intracranial/intraspinal vascular malformation within the last 365 days.\n25. Intracranial/intraspinal aneurysm within the last 365 days.\n26. Active symptomatic COVID-19 infection that, in the Investigator's discretion, could impair follow-up or study outcomes.\n27. Severe hypertension on repeated readings (systolic blood pressure \\> 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\> 105 mmHg). This can be treated, and blood pressure must be stable before venous access is obtained (systolic blood pressure \\<140 mmHg).\n28. Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n29. Life expectancy \\< 2 years (e.g. due to active cancer).\n30. Major thrombus of the inferior vena cava (IVC) (occlusive or near-occlusive) extending at least one centimeter above the common iliac confluence.\n31. Inability to obtain venous access.\n32. Inability to recanalize the target vein segment with less than 30% residual obstruction due to thrombus.\n33. History of ipsilateral venous stent.\n34.
