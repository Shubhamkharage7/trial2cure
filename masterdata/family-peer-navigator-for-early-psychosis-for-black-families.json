Phase II will recruit 10 family member participants to complete a four-month open trial to refine the Family Peer Navigator model. During Phase III, a total of 40 Black/African American families will be recruited to participate in a randomized pilot trial of the Family Peer Navigator model against a low-intensive care coordination in two coordinated specialty care programs to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact."
