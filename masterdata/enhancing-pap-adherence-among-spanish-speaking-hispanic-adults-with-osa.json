This study will assess the feasibility of a linguistically and culturally adapted tele-management intervention (Automated Management, AM) for Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults with OSA.",
            "detailedDescription": "This feasibility study seeks to enhance long-term positive airway pressure (PAP) adherence among Spanish-speaking Hispanics, a group with known PAP outcomes disparities. This study will assess the feasibility, usability and 6-month effectiveness of a linguistically and culturally adapted efficacious tele-management intervention (Automated Management, AM) for Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (N=50). A prospective, randomized, parallel group, unblinded, feasibility trial is proposed. AM is a tele-management strategy that includes evidence-based components for improving shorter-term PAP adherence consisting of education, support and troubleshooting, and brief targeted motivational enhancement delivered by tele-messaging. The automated two-way, interactive communication is algorithmic based on PAP use and behavioral profiles defined at baseline. The innovative, technology-based interventions are designed to ensure access to sustained care that overcomes barriers such as distance/geography, transportation limitations or lost work/productivity time. As such, AM can provide equitable access to quality long-term PAP management that may mitigate known PAP adherence disparities for minority adults with OSA. If effective for long-term PAP adherence, these strategies may alter OSA care paradigms, improve outcomes and associated healthcare costs, and reduce disparities."
