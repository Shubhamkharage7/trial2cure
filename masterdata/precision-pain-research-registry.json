These may include some or all of the following at a given encounter:\n\n* National Institutes of Health Minimum Dataset for Research on Chronic Low Back Pain\n* Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire\n* Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29)\n* History of Medical Conditions Inventory\n* Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire\n* Pain Catastrophizing Scale\n* Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire\n* Non-Pharmacological Treatments Inventory\n* Pharmacological Treatments Summary\n* Drug Adverse Events Index\n* Physician Profile\n* Physician Communication Behavior Questionnaire\n* Physician Consultation and Relational Empathy Measure\n* Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18)\n\nThese instruments include measures that may serve as the independent or dependent variables in various substudies conducted by the registry over time, including observational studies (e.g., case-control studies, cohort studies) and randomized controlled trials.\n\nThe registry also maintains a biobank of biological specimens that have been collected from enrolled participants, including saliva and blood that may be used for DNA sequencing or biomarker analysis."
