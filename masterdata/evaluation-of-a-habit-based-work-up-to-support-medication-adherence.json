            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the impact of a medication-taking habit worksheet and discussion with a pharmacist in patients who are prescribed a new chronic medication for cardiovascular disease or depression. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the feasibility and acceptability of the workup from the perspective of the patients and the clinic?\n* What is the impact of the intervention on the formation of medication-taking habits compared to a comparison group who receive standard pharmacist counseling?\n* What is the difference in medication adherence beliefs and behaviors for the group receiving the habit workup compared to those receiving standard counseling?",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate a habit adherence workup delivered by pharmacy in primary care. The study population will include patients taking new medications for chronic conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and depression.\n\nThis study uses a sequential design which involves first evaluating 16 patients without the added habit worksheet, and then the second phase evaluates 16 patients with the habit worksheet. All participants meet with the pharmacist and are provided standard counseling on the new medications. All participants complete the pre and post survey.\n\nThe pharmacist will be trained on the medication habit workup worksheet which has the patient choose cues they will use to develop their medication-taking habit. These will include associating the new habit with hygiene habits like toothbrushing, other habits like making coffee or eating breakfast, or visual cues like setting medications out where they will be easily noticed when doing other habits like getting dressed. Patients will take their sheet with them as a reminder of their plan. Patients also will receive medication counseling. The encounters will occur in a private clinic room.\n\nAll participants will complete baseline and follow-up surveys, which will include space for open-ended comments."
