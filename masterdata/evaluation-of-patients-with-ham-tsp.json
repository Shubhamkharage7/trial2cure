The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of HAM/TSP by monitoring clinical progression of patients longitudinally. Additionally, we will attempt to define the virological and immunological changes of HAM/TSP.\n\nStudy Population:\n\nPatients with HAM/TSP who fulfill World Health Organization diagnostic criteria are eligible to participate in this protocol. Asymptomatic seropositive individuals and individuals with indeterminate HTLV-1 serology are also eligible to participate.\n\nDesign and Outcome Measures:\n\nA longitudinal assessment of clinical, virological and immunological progression in HAM/TSP will be accomplished through periodic testing and evaluation. Asymptomatic seropositive individuals, those with seroindeterminate HTLV-I serology and normal volunteers may serve as controls. Longitudinal standardized neurological examinations will be performed. Longitudinal samples of serum, plasma, and lymphocytes may be obtained from participants. Lumbar punctures may be performed on all participants. These samples will be used virological and immunological assays. A focus is on the relationships between the characteristics of viral infection, the immune response, and the genetic makeup.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objective\n\nHuman T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was first discovered in the search for retroviruses causing cancer in 1981. Shortly afterwards, HTLV-2 was also isolated. Although HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 share similar genome structure, routes of transmission, and replication pattern, they differ in epidemiology and disease associations. Human T-lymphotropic virus type-I-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a rare neurologic disorder that affects less than 5% of patients infected with the HTLV-I virus. Recently, a large body of literature supports other inflammatory manifestations, some neurological such as myositis, due to HTLV-1 infection. Studies of HLTV-2 clinical manifestations have largely been confounded by concomitant HIV-1 infection or IV drug abuse making the establishment of clear relationship with other manifestations such as neurological disease difficult. Most patients infected with HTLV remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime. The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of HTLV infection by monitoring participants longitudinally. Additionally, we will attempt to define the virological and immunological changes of these viral infections. In addition, this protocol may be used to screen for other VIS protocols.\n\nStudy Population\n\nIndividuals sero-positive for HTLV, individuals with indeterminate HTLV sero-status, and healthy volunteers are eligible to participate in this protocol. Some individuals sero-positive for HTLV may have associated diseases including but not limited to HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and HTLV associated inflammatory disorders.\n\nDesign \\& Outcome Measures\n\nA longitudinal assessment of clinical, virological and immunological progression in HTLV related disease will be accomplished through periodic testing and evaluation. Asymptomatic seropositive individuals, those with sero-indeterminate HTLV serology and healthy volunteers may serve as controls. Longitudinal standardized neurological examinations will be performed. Longitudinal samples of serum, plasma, and lymphocytes may be obtained from participants. Lumbar punctures may be performed on all participants. These samples will be used for virological and immunological assays. A focus is on the relationships between the characteristics of viral infection, the immune response, and the genetic makeup."
