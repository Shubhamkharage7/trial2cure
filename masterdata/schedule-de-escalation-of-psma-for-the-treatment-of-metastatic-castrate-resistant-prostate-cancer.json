            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how to improve the usage of Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen \\[PSMA\\]-617) for treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site), to other places in the body (metastatic) utilizing a treatment pause after 5 cycles of therapy versus standard continuous treatment for 6 cycles. Lutetium is a radioligand therapy (RLT). RLT uses a small molecule (in this case 177Lu-PSMA-617) that carries a radioactive component to destroy tumor cells. When lutetium is injected into the body, it attaches to the PSMA receptor found on tumor cells. After lutetium attaches to the PSMA receptor, its radiation component destroys the tumor cell. Giving 177Lu-PSMA-617 for 5 cycles versus 6 cycles may better treat patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 with Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria is non-inferior among patients randomized to treatment pause versus standard treatment in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have minimal residual disease on post-therapy single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after 2 to 5 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare time to subsequent treatment (TTST) in this patient population between randomized arms.\n\nII. To assess time to progression (TTP) between randomized arms in this patient population between randomized arms.\n\nIII. To assess overall survival (OS) in this patient population between randomized arms.\n\nIV. To compare toxicities in treatment pause versus standard treatment in this patient population.\n\nV. To assess changes in patient quality of life (QOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Radionuclide Therapy (FACIT-RNT) for each randomized arm.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 42 days for 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a near complete response may receive 1 additional cycle. Patients receive 68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen-11 (gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11) IV and undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and a bone scan during screening and on the trial. Patients also undergo SPECT/CT and blood sample collection on the trial.\n\nARM II: Patients receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 IV over 10-15 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 42 days for 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo clinical observation until documented first progression. After progression, patients resume treatment with 77Lu-PSMA-617 for another cycle. Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 IV and undergo PET/CT and a bone scan during screening and on the trial. Patients also undergo SPECT/CT and blood sample collection on the trial.\n\nARM III: Patients undergo clinical observation until documented first progression. After progression, patients receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 IV over 10-15 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 42 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 IV and undergo PET/CT and a bone scan during screening and on the trial. Patients also undergo SPECT/CT and blood sample collection on the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2 years or progressive disease."
