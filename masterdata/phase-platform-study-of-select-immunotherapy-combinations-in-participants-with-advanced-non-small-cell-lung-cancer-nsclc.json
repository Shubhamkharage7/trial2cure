The study includes two parts: part A, the combination-therapy safety lead-in phase to determine the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) for S095018, S095024, and S095029 in combination with cemiplimab and part B, the randomized dose expansion phase to assess the efficacy of S095018, S095024, or S095029 in combination with cemiplimab. Study treatment will be administered for a maximum of 108 weeks, or until confirmed disease progression per iRECIST and/ or until meeting other treatment discontinuation criteria."
