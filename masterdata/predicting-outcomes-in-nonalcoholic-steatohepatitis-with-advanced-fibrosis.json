            "briefSummary": "Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition with increased amount of fat, inflammation and scarring in the liver. In compensated cirrhosis, the liver is coping with this damage and maintaining its important functions. Decompensation occurs when the liver becomes unable to perform all of its functions adequately. Variceal hemorrhage (bleeding from abnormal vessels in the liver called varices), Ascites (abnormal build-up of fluid in the abdomen), and Encephalopathy (brain confusion as a result of the liver not being able to get rid of toxic substances) are three symptoms of liver decompensation.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to investigate better ways to routinely monitor the condition of patients with NASH with compensated cirrhosis and to better pinpoint the development of decompensation in the livers of these patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This clinical research study is done to investigate better ways to routinely monitor the condition of patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with compensated cirrhosis. The purpose of this study is to better pinpoint the development of decompensation in the livers of these patients (some symptoms are variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and encephalopathy, defined below).\n\nNASH is a condition with increased amount of fat, inflammation and scarring in the liver. In compensated cirrhosis, the liver is coping with this damage and maintaining its important functions. Decompensation occurs when the liver becomes unable to perform all of its functions adequately. Variceal hemorrhage (bleeding from abnormal vessels in the liver called varices), Ascites (abnormal build-up of fluid in the abdomen), and Encephalopathy (brain confusion as a result of the liver not being able to get rid of toxic substances) are three symptoms of liver decompensation.\n\nAside from current routine procedures including blood draws, this study will check to see how effectively adding three additional procedures will help predict development of liver decompensation. These additional procedures are Spleen Stiffness Measurement (SSM) during a special liver ultrasound called a Fibroscan, an imagining scan called Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) using a contrast agent called Gadoxetate Sodium to highlight cirrhosis, and an MRI scan called metabophenotype, which examines muscle composition of the liver."
