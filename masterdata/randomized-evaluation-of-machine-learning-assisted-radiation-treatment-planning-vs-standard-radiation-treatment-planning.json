            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized phase III trial to evaluate the effectiveness of MLAP compared to Standard of Care. Patients will undergo a randomization procedure with a variable allocation ratio where the first third of patients are randomized 3:1 in favor of SOC, the next third randomized 1:1, and the last third randomized 1:3 in favor of MLAP. This is done to give dosimetrists time to optimize the MLAP workflow. Since the treatment team may learn to improve their treatment planning process in the SOC arm through interactions with RapidPlan, as a sensitivity analysis, the primary and secondary goals will be re-analyzed including time of registration as a moderator of the treatment effect."
