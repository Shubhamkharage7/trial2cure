The study will test if PATH-Pain has better cognitive, affective, and functional outcomes than Attention Control Usual Care.",

This project will study the efficacy of 8 in-office acute treatment sessions (first 8 weeks) and 6 telephone delivered sessions (3 individual and 3 group) in the following months (from 9-36 weeks) of PATH- Pain vs. an equal number of sessions consisting of Attention Control Usual Care in improving cognitive, affective, and functional outcomes. Each therapy session will last approximately 50 minutes. Assessments will be conducted at study entry and weeks 5, 9 (end of acute treatment; includes assessment of cognitive functioning), 24, 36 (end of follow-up treatment; includes assessment of cognitive functioning) and 52 (includes assessments of cognitive functioning) after randomization. This is an efficacy trial, but by being delivered by certified mental health clinicians, it has a strong \"real-world\" focus."

If found helpful and participant agrees, a tablet application called WellPATH will be used to help the subject with emotion regulation techniques. The tablet will be given at the beginning of treatment and will be returned at the end of treatment. 3) Invite caregiver participation, when appropriate.\n\nSubjects in the PATH-PAIN group will receive 8 weekly sessions (first 8 weeks) with a study therapist and 6 monthly phone sessions (3 individual and 3 group) for 9-36 weeks.
