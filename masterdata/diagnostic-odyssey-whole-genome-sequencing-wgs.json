            "briefSummary": "The goal of this collaborative research is to study human genomes in children with suspected congenital disease, multiple-congenital anomalies and/or multi-organ disease of unknown etiology by understanding the potential value of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in establishing genetic diagnosis. The study will examine diagnosis rates, changes in clinical care as a result of a genetic diagnosis, health economics including potential cost-effectiveness of WGS and patient and provider experience with genomic medicine.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this collaborative research is to study human genomes in children with suspected congenital disease, multiple-congenital anomalies and/or multi-organ disease of unknown etiology, in order to understand the potential value of WGS in establishing a genetic diagnosis. The study will examine diagnosis rates, changes in clinical care as a result of a genetic diagnosis, health economics including potential cost-effectiveness of WGS, and patient and provider experience with genomic medicine. Other clinical information of the type collected by treating physicians and stored in electronic medical records will also be collected to aid in the interpretation of laboratory data. Participants will also be asked to consent for future access of the medical record, future research on biospecimens and data generated from genomic sequencing, and for the ability to re-contact.\n\nAs part of this effort, Nicklaus Children's Hospital plans to create a large integrated database that contains the DNA sequences of the participants' whole human genomes and additional health information regarding characteristics and health of the persons whose samples have been sequenced. Scientists can then use the database to try to link those traits, diseases, and other conditions to changes in the sequence of the genome. Nicklaus Children's Hospital plans to make the database available to its collaborators, such as RCIGM, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and other academic institutions which will use the database to find better, innovative ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer and other diseases. De-identified data from this study will be shared with the community at-large, including publications and public databases. In addition, participants will be given the option to allow biospecimens (i.e., residual blood, saliva, CSF, etc.) to be included in biorepositories at Nicklaus Children's Hospital and Rady Pediatric Genomics \\& Systems Medicine Institute (RCIGM).\n\nThe study will provide clinical laboratory-confirmed results related to the affected patient's phenotype, including optional incidental findings unless subjects opt-out for these additional results, to allow for these research findings to be used in clinical care. Furthermore, this study will aggregate data regarding standard clinical genetic testing as well as cost measures to not only identify differences in diagnostic rates, diagnostic accuracy, and times to diagnoses, but to determine the cost-effectiveness of this testing and subsequent changes in care management. Clinical utility will be defined as changes in care that follow directly from results of genetic testing (both positive and negative), including standard clinical tests and WGS. This data will be used to further examine the analytic, diagnostic, and clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this testing.\n\nWGS methods continue to improve and pediatric genomic medicine is a very new field of medical practice. This study will also inform investigators regarding best practices, both in terms of traditional medical outcomes and patient-centered outcomes. Consequently, this study will also act as a biorepository for samples and data as the ability to share genomic and phenotypic data amongst researchers is critical to progressing our understanding of the nascent field of pediatric genomic medicine.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\n1. Use WGS to identify new genetic diagnoses in children with multiple congenital anomalies, developmental delay, autism, seizures, intellectual disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic illness.\n2. Evaluate the diagnosis rate of genetic diseases by WGS in previously undiagnosed patients.\n3. Assess the clinical utility of WGS in the care and management of patients.\n4. Examine the health economics and cost-effectiveness of WGS.\n5. Evaluate the provider, patient and family experience with genomic medicine\n6. Collect biological samples and associated clinical data from pediatric patients who may have a genetic disease and their family members (the \"Phenome\").\n7. Create, analyze and store genomic data from the biological samples. Genomic data will include genomic (gDNA) sequences, RNA sequences, and/or other related 'omic data (including, but not limited to, pharmacogenomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics). Genomic data from WGS will include single nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural variants such as copy number testing, genomic rearrangements, gene expression , the \"whole transcriptome\" or more limited DNA sequencing panels of specific genes or of all exons of genes (the \"Exome\").\n8. Analyze and report clinically-confirmed genomic diagnoses and treatment guidance through use of new research technologies.\n9. Identify and study novel gene and disease processes."
