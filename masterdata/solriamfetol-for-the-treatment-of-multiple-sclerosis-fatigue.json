            "briefSummary": "Fatigue is a prevalent and disabling symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), affecting up to 90% of patients. Current treatments, including off-label prescriptions of wake-promoting agents, have shown limited effectiveness. Previous research indicates that these agents may be beneficial specifically for MS patients with concomitant excessive daytime sleepiness. This study uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Participants will undergo a 10-day lead-in with he medication/placebo, followed by two four-week treatment periods separated by a one-week washout. Outcomes will be measured primarily using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), with additional exploratory measures collected via a smartphone app that assesses fatigue through keystroke dynamics. This novel approach to fatigue measurement aims to capture real-time variations and provide more granular data than traditional self-report questionnaires."
