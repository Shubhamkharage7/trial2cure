            "detailedDescription": "For this study, the investigators will adapt and pilot an existing mHealth intervention (TRAC) to reduce alcohol use among rural AYAs as part of a randomized controlled trial. TRAC includes weekly phone sessions with an interventionist and incorporates smartphones for daily self-monitoring of alcohol use. Upon enrollment, participants will be randomized into either the intervention (TRAC) arm or control (education and daily self-monitoring) arm.\n\nResearchers will conduct the study in Kentucky, which leads the nation in cancer incidence and mortality, has a higher incidence of AYA cancers compared to other states, is 40% rural, and encompasses over 100 medically underserved areas. Participants will be recruited from the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center and its affiliate institutions.\n\nPreliminary data used for this study were collected from a study (PI: Lauckner, K01AA02530) testing the TRAC intervention with people living with HIV/AIDS, which has shown promising preliminary results, with high feasibility, acceptability, and encouraging preliminary outcomes."
