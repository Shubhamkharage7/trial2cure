The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer \\[is/are\\]:\n\nDoes psilocybin assisted therapy improve fear of cancer recurrence? Does psilocybin assisted therapy improve anxiety, depression, and quality of life?\n\nParticipants will complete a series of survey measures, participate in preparatory therapy. After prep therapy is complete, they will receive a moderately high dose of psilocybin in a monitored and supportive environment. After the dosing day, they will complete 4 sessions of integrative therapy and complete survey measures."
