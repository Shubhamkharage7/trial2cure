Not getting enough sleep can lead to health problems like heart attacks, diabetes, and even cancer. Since individuals with psoriasis have these same health problems, getting better sleep may help to keep them happier and healthier. This study will look at how individuals with psoriasis sleep and if their sleep is different than indivuduals without psoriasis.",
            "detailedDescription": "A growing body of literature has revealed that individuals with psoriasis are more likely to report sleep disturbance when compared to the general population. The cross-sectional study presented here will allow the investigators to objectively and rigorously measure sleep architecture in psoriasis patients and compare it to healthy controls, If sleep dysfunction is confirmed in this population, then clinical interventions such as screening for sleep disturbance or promoting sleep hygiene could lead to meaningful improvements in patients' health, longevity, and overall quality of life."
