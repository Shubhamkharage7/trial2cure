Some of these people may benefit from enrolling in the NIDCD intramural research program to receive their care. Enrolling will also allow investigators to collect participants clinical data and specimens for future research.\n\nObjective:\n\nThis natural history study has 2 goals: (1) to collect data and specimens that may be used for research; and (2) to evaluate participants who may be candidates for other research studies.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 2 years or older with a hearing, balance, and communication disorder. Those at risk or who are suspected of having such a disorder are also eligible.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. Their medical records will be reviewed.\n\nParticipants will agree to have their medical data used for research. Specimens such as blood or other tissue samples may also be used for research. All data and specimens will be collected during their routine care visits.\n\nAll tests done will be the normal care for each participant s condition. No tests will be done solely for research.\n\nSome of these tests may require blood or tissue samples. Some may use special tools to test hearing and balance. Some may test heart or lung function. These tests may also include different types of imaging scans.\n\nAll tests will be explained. Participants may ask questions at any time.\n\nParticipants may remain in this study for up to 2 years. If they need further care, they may sign a new consent.\n\n...",

This protocol will provide the administrative vehicle to enable the evaluation and provision of clinical care for patients with hearing, balance and communication disorders by the NIDCD CRP, Clinical Center, and consult services as well as to provide a repository of information on enrolled subjects to allow for hypothesis generation in future research. No investigational therapies will be administered in this study.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To provide a repository of data and samples collected from clinical data or specimens generated in the diagnosis and treatment of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, language, and other ENT disorders to allow for hypothesis generation in future research.\n* To evaluate patients to determine candidacy for intramural clinical studies"
