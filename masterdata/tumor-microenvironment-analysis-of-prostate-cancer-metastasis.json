The type of research performed on these tissue samples include genetic \\& molecular analyses.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall aim of this protocol is to collect prostate cancer tissue from males with metastatic prostate cancers in order to perform comprehensive profiling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) across sites of metastasis in males with metastatic prostate cancer. The TME is comprised of proliferating tumor cells, the tumor stroma, blood vessels, infiltrating inflammatory cells and a variety of associated tissue cells. This study will enable analysis of the prostate TME in the context of different sites of metastasis as well as a variety of clinical states of disease (i.e no prior androgen deprivation therapy, progression on abiraterone, progression on an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, or progression on chemotherapy etc). Furthermore, the expression and receptor density of prostate lineage antigens that can be targeted for development of novel therapeutics for prostate cancer will be evaluated in parallel."
