            "briefSummary": "Exercise is essential for building and maintaining bone mass and strength, but current exercise recommendations for how to achieve this lack detail on the optimal exercise prescription. Recent studies found that blood calcium level decreases during exercise, and that calcium is mobilized from bone to slow the decline. If this occurs repeatedly during exercise training, it could diminish the potential benefits of exercise to improve bone health. The proposed study will determine whether further research on pre-exercise supplemental calcium to minimize the decline in blood calcium level during exercise is warranted. This research is important for Veterans because they are at increased risk of hip fracture when compared with non-Veterans. Further, because osteoporosis in men is under-recognized and under-treated, providing male (and female) Veterans with more specific exercise and nutrition guidelines has the potential to enhance bone health, reduce fracture risk, and improve quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "Exercise is essential for building and maintaining bone mass and strength, but recent work has raised the possibility that current exercise recommendations for bone health may not be appropriate. There is strong evidence that a single bout of vigorous exercise has an acute catabolic effect in bone (i.e., increased resorption) that lasts several hours. This is mediated by a decrease in serum calcium (Ca) during exercise, which stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. PTH then activates bone resorption to mobilize Ca from bone, presumably to prevent the decrease in serum Ca from progressing to a harmful level. This cascade of events can be markedly attenuated by minimizing the decline in serum Ca during exercise via either intravenous or oral Ca administration. The timing of Ca supplementation relative to exercise is likely important, because it must be available for gut absorption during exercise. Interestingly, repeated pharmacologic stimulation of the PTH receptor with PTH analogs (teriparatide, abaloparatide) has anabolic effects on bone, suggesting that repeated exercise-induced increases in PTH could have a chronic anabolic skeletal effect, in addition to the acute catabolic effect, which may be apparent only after repeated exercise sessions. If this is the case, suppressing the PTH response with pre-exercise Ca supplementation may not be appropriate. In this context, this proof-of-concept study will include a short exercise intervention consisting of treadmill exercise at 70% to 80% of maximal heart rate, 60 minutes per day, 4 days per week, for 4 weeks. Serum markers of bone formation and resorption will be measured before, during, and for 24 hours after the 1st, 8th, and 16th exercise sessions to address two questions: 1) Does the acute catabolic response of bone to a single bout of exercise continue to occur with repeated exercise sessions (i.e., exercise training)? 2) Does exercise training also generate an anabolic PTH-mediated bone response, similar to the anabolic response to PTH analog therapy? If the answers to questions 1 and 2 are YES (persistent catabolic signal) and NO (lack of anabolic signal), this will support the need for the randomized controlled trial (RCT), which will evaluate whether taking Ca before exercise to attenuate the acute catabolic response improves skeletal adaptations to exercise training. The overarching goal is to improve the currently imprecise recommendations for exercise to improve and maintain bone health. This research is of high relevance to Veterans, who are at increased risk of hip fracture when compared with non-Veterans. Further, because osteoporosis in men is under-recognized, under-diagnosed, and under-treated, providing male Veterans with an effective non-pharmacologic therapeutic option to reduce fracture risk may help close this treatment gap. The potential impact of this research also extends beyond Veterans. It could lead to reduced risk of exercise-related bone injury (i.e., stress fractures) in active duty military personnel and athletes and to improved bone health in the general population."

The exercise will be treadmill walking at 70-80% of HRmax for 60 min/d, 4 d/wk, for 4 wk. The mode and intensity of exercise were selected because high-intensity weight-bearing exercise is recommended for bone health, and walking is the most common weight-bearing activity. Although \"high-intensity\" exercise for bone health refers to the intensity of bone-loading forces, %HRmax is a good proxy because peak bone-loading forces increase as walking or running speed increases. Exercise sessions will be supervised by the research team.\n\nThis exercise prescription was used in the studies of young and older adults that provided the scientific premise for the current study and resulted in robust PTH and CTX responses.",
