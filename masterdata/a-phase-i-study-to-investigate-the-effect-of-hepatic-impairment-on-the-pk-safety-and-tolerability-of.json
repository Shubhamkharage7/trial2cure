Eight participants with mild impairment (CP Class A); 8 participants with moderate impairment (CP Class B); 8 participants with severe impairment (CP Class C); and 8 to12 participants with normal hepatic function matched on a group level regarding age, body weight, and sex to the impaired participants are planned for study intervention with the goal of having at least 6 evaluable participants within each group. Study participants who self-withdraw after study intervention may be replaced to ensure that at least 6 participants per group are evaluable and complete the study per protocol. An evaluable participant is defined as having adequate plasma PK profile to meet the primary study objective. Child-Pugh scoring, detailed in Table 2, will be used to determine the level of hepatic impairment. Participants will be enrolled into the following groups based on their CP classification score as determined at screening: Group 1: Participants with mild hepatic impairment (CP Class A, score of 5 or 6).\n\nGroup 2: Participants with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to 9).\n\nGroup 3: Participants with severe hepatic impairment (CP Class C, score of 10 to 15).\n\nGroup 4: Participants with normal hepatic function.\n\nStudy Arms and Duration:\n\n* Planned screening duration per participant: up to 4 weeks.\n* Planned study duration (screening to follow-up) per participant: up to 16 weeks."
