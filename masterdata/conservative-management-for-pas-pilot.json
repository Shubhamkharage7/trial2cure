            "briefSummary": "Conservative in situ management is a promising alternative treatment to hysterectomy for patients with placenta accreta spectrum and may be safer and preferable for some patients. This study will assess feasibility of a future randomized clinical trial comparing these treatments and provide novel data to inform shared decision-making and cost-effective care for patients with this deadly pregnancy disorder.",
            "detailedDescription": "Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is an extremely morbid and increasingly common pregnancy condition that often results in massive obstetric hemorrhage. The standard treatment in the United States is hysterectomy, but this treatment is complex, morbid, and costly. A promising alternative for PAS treatment is conservative in situ management (CM), a strategy in which the placenta is left in the uterus. Unfortunately, there are insufficient data available to compare outcomes of these two treatments because past studies are limited by non-randomized study designs, minimal inclusion of patient values in making treatment decisions, and nominal consideration of economic barriers to care. A large clinical trial comparing PAS treatments is needed. But there are key logistic barriers to an adequately powered trial, including questions of whether patients will enroll and adhere to randomization allocation. This pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility of randomizing patients to CM versus hysterectomy for PAS.\n\nWhile pilot studies cannot make final assessments of safety and efficacy between interventions, safety and efficacy will be monitored, including those related to hemorrhage, transfusion, infection and re-operation."
