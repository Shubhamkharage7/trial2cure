            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether sacituzumab govitecan given before radical cystectomy works in treating patients with non-urothelial bladder cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan contains a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as TROP2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan before radical cystectomy may make the surgery more effective in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive sacituzumab govitecan intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-6 weeks after last dose, patients undergo radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-3 months after radical cystectomy and then every 3-6 months for 2 years."
