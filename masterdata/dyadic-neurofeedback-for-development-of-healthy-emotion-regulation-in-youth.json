            "briefSummary": "This study will examine the effect of a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dyadic neurofeedback protocol with mothers and their adolescent daughters. Mothers in the experimental condition will view a moving bar showing their daughters' brain activity on a computer screen while talking to their daughters.",
            "detailedDescription": "Adolescents with a family history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are at heightened risk for depression and other mental health problems related to poor emotion regulation (ER). The proposed study will test the efficacy of a real-time fMRI dyadic neurofeedback (DNF) protocol to promote healthy ER-related neurodevelopment in female adolescents with a maternal history of ACEs. The proposed study will use DNF to provide neurofeedback from the adolescent's anterior insular cortex (aIC) to the adolescent's mother as the mother and adolescent engage in an emotion discussion task together. Parents and adolescents (n=35 active DNF; n=35 control) will communicate via microphones and noise-canceling headphones while the adolescent is undergoing fMRI scanning. Specific aims of the current study are to determine: 1) the effects of aIC DNF on the developing ER network in adolescents with a history of maternal ACEs, 2) associations between parenting practices during DNF and reduced adolescent aIC activation, and 3) longitudinal effects of aIC DNF on adolescent internalizing symptoms."
