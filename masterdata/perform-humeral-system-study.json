Data will be collected for the commercially available PERFORM\u2122 Humeral System. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of the PERFORM\u2122 Humeral System devices after implantation over a standard follow-up period using Patient Reported Outcome Measures related to quality of life, pain and functional improvements, safety of the implants, as well as radiographic assessments. Safety and performance measures will be evaluated throughout the patient's participation in the study."
