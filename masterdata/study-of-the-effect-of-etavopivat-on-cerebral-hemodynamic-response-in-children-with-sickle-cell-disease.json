Cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen ejection fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) will be assessed FDNIRS/DCS in participants prior to, periodically throughout, and after 24 weeks of treatment with etavopivat. Approximately 12 participants will be enrolled.\n\nThe duration of study treatment will be 24 weeks. The study duration for individual participants may last up to 36 to 38 weeks and includes the Screening Period (up to 4 weeks before study treatment), the 24-week treatment period, a Safety Follow-up Visit at 4 weeks (+ 7 days) after the last dose of study drug, and an End of Study (EOS) visit approximately 8 weeks (\u00b1 7 days) after the last dose of study drug. A participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all phases of the study including the last visit or the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Events."
