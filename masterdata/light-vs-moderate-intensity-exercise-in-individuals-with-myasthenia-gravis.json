Participants will be enrolled into the NeuroWell exercise program, which is geared toward individuals with neurological disorders or injuries and led by Certified Exercise Physiologists (CEPs) at the HealthPartners Neuroscience Center. A total of 20 people with MG will be enrolled in this study and participate in a small group exercise program 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants will be randomized into two exercise groups: 1) Light intensity or 2) Moderate intensity. We hypothesize that individuals in the light intensity exercise group will be able to achieve the same improvement in outcomes as the moderate intensity group."
