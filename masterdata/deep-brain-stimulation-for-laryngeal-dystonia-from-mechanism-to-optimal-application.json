This study will enroll people who have a form of focal dystonia that affects their vocal cords called Adductor Laryngeal dystonia (ADLD). Participants will undergo Deep Brain Stimulation surgery to treat laryngeal dystonia as part of their clinical care. Before surgery, as part of the study they will have specialized testing to study the movement of the vocal cords, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While in the operating room, researchers will examine brain waves to better understand how faulty brain firing patterns lead to dystonia. After surgery, and activation of the deep brain stimulator, participants will repeat speech testing and vocal cord imaging as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."
