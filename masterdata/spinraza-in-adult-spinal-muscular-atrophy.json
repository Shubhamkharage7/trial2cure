Presence of a symptomatic severe active infection or illness during the screening period that is likely to impact the performance on the clinical assessments.\n5. Prior exposure to SPINRAZA\u00ae (nusinersen).\n6. Prior disorder, injury (e.g., upper or lower limb fracture) or surgical procedure which impacts the subject's ability to perform any of the outcome measure testing required in the protocol and from which the subject has not fully recovered or achieved a stable baseline.\n7.

Patients using intrathecal drug delivery devices, including investigational devices with an active IDE designation in the United States, may be eligible but require Study PI approval prior to enrollment.\n8. Any history of exposure to gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, or cell transplantation that was intended for the treatment of SMA.\n9. Ongoing medical condition that according to the Clinical Center Investigator would interfere with the conduct and assessments of the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., wasting or cachexia, severe anemia, etc.) that would interfere with the assessment of safety or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study procedures.\n\nFor Cohort 2 Inclusion criteria\n\n1. Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (PHI) in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations.\n2. Males and females with SMA type II or type III, aged 18 to 70 years at the time of enrollment.\n3. Genetic documentation of 5Q SMA homozygous gene deletion, mutation, or compound heterozygote.\n4.
