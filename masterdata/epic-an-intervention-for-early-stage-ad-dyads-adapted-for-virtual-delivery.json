Researchers will gather feedback from individuals about their experience to continue to improve programs for early-stage memory loss.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to help early-stage individuals who have early-stage memory loss or early stage dementia and their current or future care partners by providing education and skill-training programs, held via Zoom, designed to reduce stress and distress, increase well-being and quality of life, and plan for the future. About 160 early-stage dyads (person with early-stage dementia and his/her care partner) will be enrolled across the United States through Arizona State University.\n\nPeople who decide to voluntarily participate in this program, will be asked to:\n\n* Meet others with memory loss and their care partners.\n* Attend six group sessions via Zoom (2 hours \\& 30 minutes each) to learn strategies to help handle new situations, reduce stress, improve mood, communicate better with each other, and plan for the future.\n* Participate in one 90-minute individualized session via Zoom to address specific issues that may be unique to each dyad's situation.\n* Participate in three 2-hour confidential interviews that involve questions about background, mood, and quality of life.\n* Participate in interviews at the start, and again about 3 and 6 months, via Zoom, to help us to continue to improve the program.\n* Attend several monthly booster sessions after completion of the seven EPIC sessions.\n\nEach person will receive up to $45 for completing all follow-up interviews, or $20- 25 for each interview completed. All participants are offered the EPIC sessions shortly after their first interview or shortly after their 3-month interview. Some participants will also attend an additional free education workshop within one month of the initial assessment."
