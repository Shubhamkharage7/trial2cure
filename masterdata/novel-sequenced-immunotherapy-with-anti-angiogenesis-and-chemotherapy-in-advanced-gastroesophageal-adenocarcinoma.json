The patient has elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the course of the clinical trial (relevant for ramucirumab).\n* Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 6 months (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs) that in the opinion of the investigator poses unacceptably high risk as standard clinical practice when combined with pembrolizumab.
