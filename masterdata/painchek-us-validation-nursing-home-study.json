            "briefSummary": "Pain is common amongst people living with dementia. However, as people's dementia worsens their ability to self-report pain diminishes because of limitations in their cognition and communication abilities. As a result pain in people with moderate to severe dementia often goes under-recognised and undertreated.\n\nPainChek\u00ae is a technology-enabled, observational pain assessment tool, in the form of a mobile application designed specifically to assist healthcare professionals and professional caregivers assess pain in people with moderate severe dementia. In this study the investigators aim to assess the performance of PainChek\u00ae in assessing pain in nursing home residents with moderate to severe dementia compared to the Abbey Pain Scale.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design: This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study with the primary objective to validate PainChek\u00ae for assessing pain in subjects with moderate-to-severe dementia compared to the Abbey Pain Scale (APS).\n\nIn addition, the study data will be used to demonstrate test-retest reliability of the PainChek\u00ae device.\n\nStudy Objectives: PainChek\u00ae has been calibrated and successfully validated against the Abbey Pain Scale in Australia and the United Kingdom. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the validity of this calibration in the US intended use population.\n\nAs secondary objective, this study will the test-retest reliability of PainChek\u00ae as compared to the Abbey Pain Scale (APS).\n\nAs an additional exploratory objective, the association between respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) and pain scores detected by PainChek\u00ae and APS will be investigated.\n\nData generated in this study will be used in support of a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) De Novo submission.\n\nClinical Sites: The study will include between 5 and 12 nursing homes in the US.\n\nStudy Procedures: The study is entirely observational and follows the patient's standard of care (SOC).\n\nEach participating site will assign raters providing pain assessments for the study. Each rater will be requested to assess pain of enrolled subjects using either the PainChek\u00ae device (PainChek\u00ae raters) or the Abbey Pain Scale (APS raters). Raters from all participating sites will be trained on the assessment tools by PainChek.\n\nConsent to participate in the study will be requested from legally authorized representatives (LARs) of subjects with moderate-to-severe dementia potentially eligible to participate in the study. Following consent signature by the subject's LAR, subjects will be enrolled in the study. Weekly pain ratings of enrolled subjects will be done concurrently by two independent raters using PainChek\u00ae and the Abbey Pain Scale (APS). Pain assessments will be done twice (at rest and post movement) at each session. At the end of both the at rest and post movement pain assessments, the subject's respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) will be measured using a fingertip pulse oximeter. In addition, the study coordinator will document changes in clinical status of the resident between each encounter.\n\nRaters will be blinded to each other's assessment, to prior pain assessments on the same subject and to subject's clinical status as assessed by the study coordinator. Each subject is planned to be assessed up to 10 times for maximum study duration per subject of 16 weeks."
