            "briefSummary": "Given the high numbers of cesarean deliveries being performed today, there has been interest in optimizing surgical techniques. Several recent reviews have summarized the evidence for various steps of cesarean delivery, but surprisingly in many cases there is little scientific evidence on which to base the choice of surgical technique.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure performed in the United States, with over 1 million procedures performed per year. Based on recent Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Vital Statistics Report (2021) 32.1% of all births in the United States were via cesarean delivery. Given the high numbers of cesarean deliveries being performed today, there has been interest in optimizing surgical techniques. Absorbable staples, made from a combination of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, are a relatively new option for skin closure at the time of surgery. This study is a randomized trial that will investigates two cesarean skin closure techniques-subcuticular, polyglecaprone suture (Monocryl), and absorbable subcuticular polyglycolic acid staples (INSORB)-to determine if one is associated with better scar cosmesis."
