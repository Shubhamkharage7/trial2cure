The main question it aims to answer is if the software is effective in diagnosing more than mild Diabetic Retinopathy (mtmDR) in patients with known diabetes using digital funduscopic images, acquired from each of the participating fundoscopy devices and based on one macula centered image per eye.\n\nParticipants:\n\n* will have an eye exam in which photographic images of each eye will be taken by a novice operator, using four different FDA approved/registered fundoscopy cameras. These images will be sent to and analyzed by the AEYE-DS software device.\n* will have additional eye imaging taken using a different FDA approved desktop camera system by a professional ophthalmic photographer. These images will be sent to an independent reading center for analysis.\n* will have dilation drops put in their eyes (either during or after the imaging with the fundoscopy cameras), wait about 30 minutes for the pupils to dilate and continue the eye imaging exams.\n\nThe outcome results with the AEYE-DS Software will be compared to the analysis of the eye images processed by the reading center to see if the investigational software device was accurate in its diagnosis."
