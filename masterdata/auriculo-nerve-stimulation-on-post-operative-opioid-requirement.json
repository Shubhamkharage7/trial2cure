            "briefSummary": "The NSS-2 BRIDGE\u00ae device (NSS stands for Neuro-Stimulation System) is a disposable device that stimulates the branches of cranial nerves and of the superficial cervical plexus innervating the ear. Because the stimulation of the nerves of the ear by the NSS-2 BRIDGE\u00ae device (NBD\u00ae) has been shown to modulate pain pathways in rodents, decrease abdominal pain in adolescents with inflammatory bile syndrome and due to the results of our preliminary pilot study, the investigators hypothesized that this technique may also be effective in reducing the requirement for postoperative opioids and provide a non-pharmacological alternative to perioperative opioid use.\n\nTo establish the role that the stimulation of the nerves of the ear may have in reducing postoperative opioid requirement, the investigators are proposing to conduct a randomized, placebo controlled study in patients undergoing open abdominal or pelvic surgery requiring at least 5 days of hospitalization. Subjects who have signed an informed consent will be randomized in 2 groups (active NBD\u00ae group or inactive NBD\u00ae group).\n\nFurthermore, since preoperative and postoperative mood disorders have been shown to increase postoperative pain levels and opioid requirement by up to 50%, the investigators further hypothesize that the stimulation of the ear nerves by the NSS-2 BRIDGE\u00ae effects may be in part mediated by a reduction of the level of anxiety, depression and catastrophizing as assessed using validated questionnaires.",
            "detailedDescription": "It is established that the perioperative prescription of opioids, including doses prescribed after discharge from the hospitals, is an important contributor to the current opioid epidemic. Although many factors have been implicated including history of addiction, mood disorders and the type of surgery, the quantity and duration of opioid treatment play an important role in a patient's development of opioid use disorder (OUD). Despite recommendations by the majority of surgery and anesthesiology professionals to limit the perioperative use of opioids, and to favor the use of non-opioid analgesics, OUD remains a serious concern. Consequently, developing alternative techniques to minimize the perioperative use of opioids is critical in the fight against the current opioid epidemic.\n\nAuriculotherapy, a form of acupuncture is an ancient technique used to treat many conditions, including pain. Its mechanism of action is believed to be primarily via the stimulation of the branches of the vagal, trigeminal, glossopharyngeal, hypogastric, facial and superficial cervical plexus nerves innervating which secondarily modulate the pain pathway and the limbic system at the level of the brainstem, spin and central nervous system. However, the use of auriculotherapy has been limited in part by the requirement for long and specific training and the lack of well-designed clinical trials demonstrating its effectiveness.\n\nThis study design is based on the high frequency of OUD following surgery for cancer and the positive results from our exploratory Institutional Review Board (IRB)- approved, randomized and placebo-controlled pilot study that assessed the effects of the NSS-2 BRIDGE\u00ae device on perioperative pain and opioid requirement in different surgical oncology models. This was a study that included subjects undergoing both open and laparoscopic procedures of different types of surgeries for abdominal cancer."
