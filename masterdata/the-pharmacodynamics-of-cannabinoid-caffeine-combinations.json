            "briefSummary": "Cannabis and caffeine are two of the most commonly consumed psychoactive substances in the world, with many consumers reporting positive impacts on energy, alertness, and focus. Preliminary evidence has suggested that cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating cannabinoid found in cannabis, may mitigate the negative side effects of caffeine (e.g., feeling jittery) without impacting positive or desired effects. CBD also shows potential in reducing undesirable acute effects (e.g., anxiety) of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary intoxicating cannabinoid found in cannabis. Despite these promising findings, little is known about the potential effects of THC, caffeine, and CBD in combination. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover study will assess the effects of combinations of THC, CBD, and caffeine (i.e., THC only; THC + caffeine; THC + CBD + caffeine) on subjective energy, arousal, and cognitive performance."
