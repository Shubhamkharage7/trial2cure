The main purpose of this study is to understand whether there are differences in the cerebral blood flow, and oxygen metabolism affected by different types of anesthesia.

All eligible subjects will be asked to provide informed consent before participating in the study.",

The main purpose of this study is to understand whether there are differences in the cerebral blood flow, and oxygen metabolism affected by different types of anesthesia. Subjects who require clinical anesthesia for a clinical MRI and for whom the use of anesthetics for the exam are in clinical equipoise are asked to join the study. All eligible subjects will be asked to provide informed consent before participating in the study.\n\nTreatment:\n\nThose who meet eligibility criteria, and who undergo the informed consent, will have their MRI extended by up to 7.5 minutes for up to 5 times. Standard-of-care anesthesia safety, dose and monitoring will not be changed. During their MRI, the additional images acquired will teach us about cerebral blood flow and cerebral venous oxygenation. Participants will also have non-invasive monitoring of their hematocrit immediately following the exam.\n\nSafety Assessment:\n\nThe experiment will occur in the standard-of-care clinical MRI environment. All patient safety and monitoring will remain in place. Throughout the induction, maintenance and recovery from anesthesia, all procedures will occur in the standard of care environment and will be overseen by trained clinical personnel.\n\nEfficacy Assessment:\n\nStructural, and/or cerebral blood flow and/or metabolism MRIs will be collected from all subjects."
