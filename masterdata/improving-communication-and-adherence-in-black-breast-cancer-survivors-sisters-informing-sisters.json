We developed and piloted the Sisters Informing SistersSM (SIS) intervention (survivor-led skill-building sessions and culturally tailored materials to activate Black breast cancer survivors in their medical encounters) and obtained promising findings. This project will compare in a two-arm RCT the impact of SIS vs. enhanced usual care (treatment recommendation summary form) on patient-centered communication and systemic treatment adherence; SIS tools may be integrated within existing clinical and support services."
