            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests whether the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) procedure is safe and effective in treating patients with intermediate grade prostate cancer. MRI-guided TULSA ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that uses an ultrasound device guided by MRI imaging to deliver high-energy sound waves, producing very high temperature to ablate (destroy) tumor cells in a targeted manner. The MRI-guided TULSA procedure may help patients avoid surgery and help improve prostate cancer patients' quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To perform the TULSA procedure for safety and efficacy outcomes in men aged 45 to 80 years with biopsy-confirmed, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate-risk prostate cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess patient-reported metrics for quality of life (QOL). II. To assess return to normal activity. III. Compare economic benefit as noted from Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo MRI-guided TULSA. Patients may also undergo digital rectal exam (DRE), cystoscopy, biopsy, bone scan, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), and/or multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) at screening.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months."
