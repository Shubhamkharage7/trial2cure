            "briefSummary": "Neck pain is a common complaint among active duty military personnel, and can have tremendous impacts on quality of life and participation in duty-related activities. Treatments for spinal pain in military personnel are typically multimodal, relying upon physical therapy, pharmacological agents, spinal manipulation, and psychotherapy. However, there does not exist a wide body of evidence to support many of these treatments in active-duty military. The Cervigard neck collar was designed to treat posture-related neck pain with minimal effort and time required for treatment by the patient. However, this has yet to be tested experimentally. The objective of this study is to evaluate the treatment effect and safety of a novel device for the treatment of neck pain using self-reported pain and function measures, as well as objective radiological measures of cervical lordosis and head posture. Participants will be randomized to be fitted with and receive the Cervigard neck collar either immediately, or 6-weeks after being screened. Participants will complete neck pain and function questionnaires, and have cervical X-Rays collected at screening, treatment, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks (for the immediate group). Participants will be instructed to wear the collar every day for the duration of the trial. Self-reported neck pain and function measures will be collected, as well as cervical X-Rays, protocol adherence measures, and adverse events. The intervention is expected to reduce neck pain/discomfort, improve function, and improve cervical lordosis."
