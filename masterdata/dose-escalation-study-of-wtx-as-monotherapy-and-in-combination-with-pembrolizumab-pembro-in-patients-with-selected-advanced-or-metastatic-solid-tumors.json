Part 1 of the study is dose escalation of WTX-124, both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 2 is comprised of four arms in which WTX-124 will be administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab to patients with advanced or metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma or advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma."
