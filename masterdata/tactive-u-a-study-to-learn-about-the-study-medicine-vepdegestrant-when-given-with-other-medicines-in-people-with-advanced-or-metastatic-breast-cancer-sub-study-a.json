ARV-471 will be given by mouth, at home, 1 time a day. Abemaciclib will be given by mouth, at home, 2 times a day. We will examine the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help us determine if the study medicines are safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will continue to take ARV-471 and abemaciclib until their cancer is no longer responding, or side effects become too severe. They will have visits at the study clinic about every 4 weeks.",
