The primary strategies include a technology supported strategy (low touch) in which text messaging and online videos are used for asynchronous viewing compared to a Community Health Worker-led synchronous (group and individual) strategy (high touch). Prior to implementation, one-time interview and focus groups will be conducted with clinic providers and staff. In addition, a subsample of subjects will be enrolled into a prospective cohort to complete a survey during pregnancy and a survey postpartum. The aims of the study are 1) to evaluate and compare adoption of the program delivery with text technology messaging vs. delivery by Community Health Workers (CHW), 2) to examine implementation fidelity , 3) to evaluate and compare the impact of the strategies on key clinical outcomes, 4) to examine sustainability (continued adoption) following the CHW-led strategy implementation period and conduct an economic evaluation of the two-implementation strategies."

Subjects will also receive SMS messages in between videos at least weekly to keep them engaged and reinforce the video content delivered.

The sessions delivered during pregnancy aim to improve diet, physical activity and stress management, enhance prenatal breastfeeding support, and build social support.
