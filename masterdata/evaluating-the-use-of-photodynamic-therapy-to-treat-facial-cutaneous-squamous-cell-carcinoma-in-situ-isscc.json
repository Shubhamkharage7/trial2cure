            "detailedDescription": "In the study, participants will be asked to complete the following:\n\n* Provide basic personal information (including date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity)\n* Provide their medical/ surgical history and perform a medical exam (including but not limited to physical exam, skin type, vital signs, height, weight and urine pregnancy test collection)\n* Follow study rules such as avoiding certain medications and treatments\n* Allow photographs of the area of skin cancer being treated on the face\n* Provide information on any medications, treatments or reactions that started after the study began\n* Allow two treatments on the skin cancer area of the face using a light-sensitive cream used in combination with a light source\n* Allow clinical documentation of the treatment, such as how well the treatment was tolerated, any skin reaction or side effects\n* Allow surgery to remove the skin cancer area from the face for Laboratory testing\n\nTo qualify for this trial, participants must:\n\n* be an adult (18 years of age or older)\n* give voluntary written consent\n* have a recently diagnosed (less than six months from first visit) skin cancer area on the face that meets surgery size requirements\n* be willing to follow study instructions and complete study requirements, including not using non-approved lotions and creams on the treatments areas\n* (if female) not be pregnant before and during the study and agree to use acceptable forms of birth control\n* confirm they are not sensitive to any of the study treatment ingredients\n\nAll surgery samples collected from the participants towards the end of the study will be sent to a laboratory for testing. All photographs of the treatment area collected during the study will be used as study data.\n\nAll participants have the right to refuse further participation in the study at any time."
