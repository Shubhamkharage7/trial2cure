However, limited information is known about AD in Asian and African American populations because most molecular studies have focused on Caucasians with AD.\n\nThis trial will determine differences in inflammatory responses to dupilumab between Caucasian, Asian, and African American patients with AD.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this study is that ethnic differences in both immune and stromal cells contribute to variability in AD presentation and response to anti-interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) inhibition with dupilumab."
