The study is also to determine the benefit of Cellworks Ventura\u2122 reports on physician and molecular tumor board treatment recommendations across a large set of relapsed or refractory pan-cancer indications.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to survey physicians and molecular tumor board perspectives of the benefit of Cellworks Singula\u2122and Cellworks Ventura\u2122 reports in facilitating treatment decisions in pan-cancer patients.\n\nCellworks reports aim to provide NGS-based therapy recommendations to aid the decision-making of patients, physicians, and molecular tumor boards.
