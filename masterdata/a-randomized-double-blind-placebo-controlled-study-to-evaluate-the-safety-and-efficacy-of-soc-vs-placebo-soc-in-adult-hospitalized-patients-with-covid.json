            "briefSummary": "COVID-19 patients who develop severe disease often develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a result of a dysregulated immune response. This in turn stimulates a pro-inflammatory cascade (\"cytokine storm\") as well as emergency myelopoiesis.\n\nThis proinflammatory cascade is activated when viral-mediated cell damage occurs in the lungs, resulting in the release of damage-signaling alarmin molecules such as S100A8/A9 (Calprotectin), HMGB1, Resistin, and oxidized phospholipids. These damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized by the pattern recognition receptor Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) found on macrophages, dendritic cells and other innate immune cells and result in additional release of pro-inflammatory molecules. Several recent studies have shown that S100A8/A9 serum levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients positively correlate with both neutrophil count and disease severity. Taken together the DAMP-TLR4 interaction forms a central axis in the innate immune system and is a key driver of the pathological inflammation observed in COVID-19. We hypothesis that targeting the initial step in the signalling pathways of these DAMPs in innate immunity offers the best hope for controlling the exaggerated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nEB05 has demonstrated safety in two clinical studies (\\>120 patients) and was able to block LPS-induced (TLR4 agonist) IL-6 release in humans. Given, this extensive body of evidence we believe EB05 could ameliorate ARDS due to COVID-19, significantly reducing ventilation rates and mortality."
