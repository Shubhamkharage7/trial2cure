The study will enroll 20 patients across 4 cohorts (CRC, gastric, PDAC, and HCC/intra-hepatic-/extra-hepatic-, gall bladder adenocarcinomas) diagnosed with histologically confirmed GI cancers. These patients will have already completed all Standard of Care (SOC) treatments (including neoadjuvant, surgery, local therapies, and/or adjuvant therapy as applicable), as defined by the treating primary physician or research team, with curative intent but have a positive SignateraTM tumor-informed ctDNA test and NED radiographically by standard imaging within 28 days prior to enrollment and within 1 year of completing all curative-intent therapy. All patients will be treated with intravenous (IV) atezolizumab 1200 mg IV and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on Day 1 of 21-day cycles until disease recurrence, ctDNA POD, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal of consent with a maximum 12 month total duration of study therapy. Atezolizumab and bevacizumab drug will be provided."

The exception (permitting inclusion) would be if any standard of care treatment was deferred due to valid medical reasoning based on the investigator's discretion or patient's preference.\n3. Active or history of autoimmune disease or immune deficiency, including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or multiple sclerosis (see Appendix 6 for a more comprehensive list of autoimmune diseases and immune deficiencies), with the following exceptions: o Patients with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are on thyroid-replacement hormone are eligible for the study. o Patients with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on an insulin regimen are eligible for the study. o Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are eligible for the study provided all of following conditions are met: - Rash must cover \\< 10% of body surface area; - Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical corticosteroids; - No occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high-potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months\n4.

Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia, or any active infection that could impact patient safety\n25. History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, or active GI bleeding within 6 months prior to study treatment. o If GI bleeding was from a lesion or a condition that was appropriately treated and patient is deemed to be low risk for recurrent GI bleed per investigator judgement, enrollment will be allowed.\n26. Serious, non-healing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture\n27. Subjects with previous malignancies (separate from the malignancy for which patient is being enrolled) are excluded. Exceptions include another malignancy for which a complete remission was achieved at least 5 years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period. Other exceptions include malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS rate \\> 90%), such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non melanoma skin carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, Stage I uterine cancer or others based on the physician/investigator's discretion.\n28. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n29. Any other disease, active infection, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n30. Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab\n31. Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n32. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies\n33. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 \\[IL-2\\]) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment\n34. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF-alpha agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions: o Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after Principal Investigator confirmation has been obtained. o Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n35. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n36. Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab or bevacizumab formulation\n37. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab or 6 months after the final dose of bevacizumab.\n\n    Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test result within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n38. Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium \\> 1.5 mmol/L, calcium \\> 12 mg/dL or corrected serum calcium \\> ULN)\n39. History of leptomeningeal disease\n40. Uncontrolled tumor-related pain\n41. Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently); Patients with indwelling catheters (e.g., PleurX) are allowed.\n42. Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Brain scans are not required to be performed at screening but can be done at the clinician's or investigator's discretion depending on clinical history. Asymptomatic patients with previous definitively (with curative-intent) treated CNS lesions that are believed to have no evidence of residual disease per investigator judgement are eligible, provided that all of the following criteria are met: - The patient has no history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage; - The patient has not undergone stereotactic radiotherapy within 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment, whole-brain radiotherapy within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment, or neurosurgical resection within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment.; - The patient has no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease. - If the patient is receiving anti-convulsant therapy, the dose is considered stable.",
