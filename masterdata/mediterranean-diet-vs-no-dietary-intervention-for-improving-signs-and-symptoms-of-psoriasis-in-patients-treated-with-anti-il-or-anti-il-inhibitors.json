There is a two week medication washout period in between the 1st and 2nd visits. This washout only applies if participants are using a prohibited psoriasis medication (such as topical steroids or oral psoriasis medications, like methotrexate). During the washout period, participants will have to stop the prohibited medication(s). If participants are not using any prohibited medications, then the 1st and 2nd visits can be combined and participants will only have 3 total in-person visits. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance; like flipping a coin) to either the Mediterranean Diet or no dietary intervention. After 4 weeks on the diet, participants will start treatment with either Anti-IL-17 or Anti-IL-23 therapy. The biologic treatments will prescribed by the participants regular dermatologist and not as a part of the study."
