This activity will be used to continuously support delefilcon A (sphere, toric, and multifocal) soft contact lens regulatory requirements and standards.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study includes a Baseline visit and a Year 1 visit.\n\nThe Baseline visit is defined as the first office visit where an eye care professional provided an in-person office biomicroscopy exam to the subject before or during which a DAILIES TOTAL1 sphere, toric, or multifocal soft contact lens prescription was released. The Baseline visit will be retrospective. All assessments at baseline will be obtained from chart reviews.\n\nThe Year 1 visit is defined as the visit that occurs 1 year (-2/+4 months) since the Baseline visit during which period the subject is wearing prescribed lenses and a contact lens examination is performed. The Year 1 visit can be either retrospective or prospective in subjects 7 to less than 18 years of age. For subjects 18 years of age and older, the Year 1 visit will be retrospective."
