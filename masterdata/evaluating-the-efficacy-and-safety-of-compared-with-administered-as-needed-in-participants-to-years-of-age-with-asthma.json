Screening period (7 to 28 days)\n2. Treatment period of 52 weeks\n3. Safety follow-up period (7 to 14 days after the end of treatment \\[EOT\\] visit)\n\nParticipants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to BDA MDI 160/180 micrograms (\u03bcg) or AS MDI 180 \u03bcg treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio on top of their own usual maintenance therapy during treatment period.\n\nThis study will also include a pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study with single visit scheduled after the safety follow-up visit in the main study. During PK sub-study, single dose of open-label BDA MDI 160/180 \u03bcg will be administered."
