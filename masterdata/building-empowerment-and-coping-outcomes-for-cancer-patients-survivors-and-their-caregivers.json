This study examines three new online peer mental-wellness support program for cancer patients, survivors or their caregivers. Each program teaches evidence-based skills, in the context of that groups lived experience, to manage the emotional impact of cancer. This study examines the impact of that program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cancer has a psychological, emotional and social impact beyond a patient's physical health. These problems often ripple beyond the individual with the diagnosis, to their broader community, and also beyond a cancer treatment course into survivorship. As a result, there are a wide range of socioemotional needs in those who have been impacted by cancer. Further, these emotional impacts have a direct impact on morbidity and mortality of cancer. A new peer mental-wellness support program, called Color Cancer Connect (CCC) supports cancer patients, survivors and their caregivers by teaching them evidence-based skills to manage the emotional impact of cancer. This study will examine all three programs (i.e., patient, survivor, caregiver) to gather data to measure the impact of the program on emotional well-being, quality of life and health behaviors."
