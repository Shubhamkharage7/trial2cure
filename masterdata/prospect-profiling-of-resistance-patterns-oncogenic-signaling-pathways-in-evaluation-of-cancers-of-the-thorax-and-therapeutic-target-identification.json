We will examine how the presence of factors that drive cell growth, antagonize apoptosis, or confer resistance in other ways may counter the effect of systemic therapies and/or promote rapid tumor recurrence. In this way, we will identify new, previously unappreciated potential therapeutic targets while also identifying which targets are most likely to increase resistance to therapy and worsen prognosis.",

To develop a therapeutic target -focused (TTF) profiling platform and to use it in vitro to identify potential therapeutic targets associated with therapeutic resistance and to develop novel approaches against these potential targets.\n2. To use tumor tissue TTF profiling along with genome wide mRNA profiling, serum phosphopeptide profiling and plasma DNA profiling to identify and evaluate molecular targets and pathways that contribute to therapeutic sensitivity or resistance, prognosis, and recurrence patterns in patients with operable non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)."
