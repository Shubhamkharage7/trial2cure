(is located in the mid-face at the site of the embryologic fusion plates and is generally believed to be associated with more aggressive skin cancers).\n* Patients with BCCs on locations that may compromise an organ function should the tumor enlarge (for example, eyelid).\n* Tumor located on a site that precludes attachment of the RCM device or inability to tolerate imaging procedure (i.e. remain relatively still for multiple short durations of 3- 4 minutes over a total time of 20-30 minutes)\n* Lesions that previously received therapeutic intervention\n* Inability to give informed consent",
