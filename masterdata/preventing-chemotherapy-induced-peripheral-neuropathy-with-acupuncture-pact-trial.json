            "detailedDescription": "This study randomly assigns patients with breast cancer who are starting a chemotherapy program that includes a Taxane to one of two groups:\n\n* The Acupuncture Group will receive acupuncture treatments for 12 weeks during chemotherapy treatment.\n* The Relaxation Exercise Group will receive a program of weekly videos accompanied by a relaxation exercise. Both programs will last 12 weeks.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete questionnaire 12 weeks after the completion of the acupuncture or relaxation exercise program, so participants be on this research study for up to 24 weeks (6 months).\n\nIt is expected that about 80 people will take part in this research study."
