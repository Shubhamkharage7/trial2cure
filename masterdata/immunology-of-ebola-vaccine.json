            "briefSummary": "In this study 30 healthy adult participants will receive a single dose of an Ebola vaccine. Blood samples, fine needle aspirates, core biopsies, and bone marrow aspirates will be collected prior to and following vaccination to assess immune responses in the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow over multiple time points.",
            "detailedDescription": "Ebolaviruses (EBOV), cause Ebola Virus Disease, a condition characterized primarily by hemorrhagic fevers with remarkably elevated mortality rates. The genus Ebolavirus encompasses five distinct viral species, namely Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV), Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Ta\u00ef Forest virus (TAFV).\n\nMore than 20 human outbreaks have been reported world-wide since the identification of EBOV in the late 1970s. The most common geographical region affected by EBOV outbreaks is Central Africa, with two of the most notable outbreaks occurring in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995, and Gulu, Uganda in 2000. Outside of Africa, EBOV infections have been reported in countries like Philippines, Italy, United Kingdom, United States of America, and others. Of particular significance is the 2014-2016 West African ZEBOV outbreak, which is known as the most extensively recorded outbreak to date with over 28,000 reported infections and a 40% approximated mortality rate. The outbreak significantly surpassed all preceding ZEBOV outbreaks in terms of geographical coverage, number of impacted individuals, and its disruptive influence on conventional societal activities.\n\nFatal ZEBOV infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms and high fever followed by multi-organ failure. While case-fatality rates vary between outbreaks and among the Ebola viruses, ZEBOV has been associated with up to 90% lethality. While specific treatment strategies including convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, and/or direct- acting antiviral agents are being pursued, it is unlikely that treatment directed at the individual will be sufficient to control outbreaks. Hence, it is important to investigate prophylactic vaccines that confer protection against Ebola viruses in at-risk populations to prevent future outbreaks. Understanding the durability of these vaccines is of paramount importance.\n\nThe recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based Ebola vaccine (rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP) was approved in 2019 as a single dose in the prevention against Ebola virus disease (EVD). Protection is primarily conferred by antibodies targeting the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP), and ZEBOV-GP Immunoglobulin G (IgG) memory B cells (MBCs) can be detected in the blood 6 months following vaccination.\n\nIt is not fully understood, however, whether a single dose of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP effectively generates germinal center (GC) responses that result in durable immunological memory.\n\nThe immune responses that ensue following vaccination consist of a series of highly orchestrated events in GCs of secondary lymphoid organs. The nature of these interactions ultimately dictates the quality and longevity of the immune response generated following vaccination. Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) and MBCs are the end products of the GC reaction. Previous studies of human B cell immune responses to rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccination have focused on the blood compartment. This strategy ignores the critical compartments of draining lymph nodes (dLNs), where GCs are formed, and bone marrow, the major reservoir of BMPCs.\n\nThis study aims to directly examine the GC response induced in the dLNs after vaccination with rVSV\u0394G- ZEBOV-GP. The researchers will directly probe ZEBOV-GP-specific GC B cell responses and determine how long these GCs persist after a single vaccine dose. The researchers will determine the frequency of antigen-specific BMPCs that home to bone marrow after vaccination, and whether these BMPCs persist up to 1 year after a single dose. The researchers will determine the frequency of antigen-specific MBCs generated after vaccination. Across all compartments, the researchers will analyze the B cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity and the degree of somatic hypermutation (SHM) induced by vaccination. This study will determine the degree to which a single dose of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP generates durable GC responses and long lasting humoral immunological memory."

GenBank sequence records will be made available at https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/ or accessed using NCBI's E-utilities application programming interface (API). SRA sequence records will be made available using the SRA Toolkit API (https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki) or on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform clouds (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-cloud/). Upon release, publicly accessible sequence data are searchable by accession number in website interfaces. NCBI also indexes the data to support text-based searches (e.g., by organism name) in websites and APIs."
