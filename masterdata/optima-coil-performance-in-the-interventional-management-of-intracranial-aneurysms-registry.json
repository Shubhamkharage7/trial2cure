Imaging will be analyzed by a designated core neuroimaging lab to assess procedural success and aneurysm occlusion rates.

Imaging will be analyzed by a designated core neuroimaging lab to assess procedural success and aneurysm occlusion rates.\n\nThe core lab will consist of 4-5 physicians, 2-3 from within HCA Healthcare, and 2-3 from outside of HCA Healthcare. Core lab physicians will be blinded to patient characteristics for HIPAA compliance. Physicians within the core lab will not be principal investigators enrolling patients in the study.\n\n600 subjects with intracranial saccular aneurysms (maximum dimension \u2264 24 mm), ruptured or unruptured, treated with the OptimaTM Coil System.\n\nAs this is a registry, there will be no formal hypothesis testing of the study endpoints, and no formal sample size / power calculations will be performed.\n\nApproximately 600 subjects will be enrolled in the registry at up to 12 clinical sites in the US. Data analyses will be performed and led by the study PIs, Site PIs, and Sub-investigators.\n\nExpected descriptive statistics will include baseline patient demographics, procedural characteristics, radiographic parameters, safety outcomes, clinical and efficacy outcomes. Pilot univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be performed on the intention-to-treat cohort to identify predictors of adequate and complete aneurysm occlusion."
