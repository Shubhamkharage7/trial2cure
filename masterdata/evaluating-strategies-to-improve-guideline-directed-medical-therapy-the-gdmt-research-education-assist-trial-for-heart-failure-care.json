            "briefSummary": "Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with high mortality and adverse events (hospitalization or urgent outpatient visits for HF), along with diminished quality of life. Despite convincing data that evidenced-based, guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) improve mortality and heart failure-related events, there remains insufficient utilization of these life-saving drugs (evidence-based beta-blockers (EBBB), angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI)/ angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with HFrEF. The primary objective of this study is to implement and evaluate a multifaceted, interdisciplinary intervention to improve GDMT use, reduce mortality, and reduce future heart failure events in patients with HFrEF.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a cluster randomized study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving GDMT in patients with HFrEF. Clinicians stratified based on practice specialty, location, and pharmacist referral habits will be permuted block randomized to achieve 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution across the following arms respectively: (1) usual care, (2) multi-pronged clinical decision support (CDS) inclusive of a patient portal message about GDMT, an interruptive advisory upon chart entry as a notification to clinicians on GDMT consideration and a Best Practice Advisory (BPA) that includes a GDMT order set, and (3) multi-pronged CDS as in #2 but replacement of GDMT order set with referral to integrated clinical pharmacist co-management. Secondarily, each of the 5 clinical practice sites of roughly equal HFrEF patient loads were assigned to receive either an early or delayed education rollout. Exploratory analyses will look to determine the independent and incremental benefits of education with other interventional approaches."
