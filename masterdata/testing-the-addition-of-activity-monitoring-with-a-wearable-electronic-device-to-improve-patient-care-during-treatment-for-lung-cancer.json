To demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring daily step counts during a course of chemoradiotherapy in the setting of a multi-institutional trial.\n\nII. To examine the association between baseline activity level and clinical outcomes related to treatment tolerance, quality of life, chemoradiotherapy adverse events, and physical function preservation.\n\nIII. To demonstrate associations between daily step counts and short-term hospitalization risk.\n\nIV. To explore predictors of step count decline during chemoradiotherapy among clinical factors and radiotherapy plan parameters.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore patterns of care regarding adjuvant immunotherapy administration following definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nII. To examine the association between baseline activity level with progression free survival and overall survival.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Usual Care\n\nARM II: Usual Care + Continuous physical activity monitoring via a wearable device.\n\nPatients randomized to undergo activity monitoring will use a wearable device from the time of study enrollment until four weeks after the completion of thoracic radiotherapy."
