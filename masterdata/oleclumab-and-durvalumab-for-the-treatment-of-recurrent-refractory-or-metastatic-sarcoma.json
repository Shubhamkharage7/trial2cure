Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as oleclumab and durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the tumor response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\]) at 4 months in patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma. (Cohorts 1 and 2) II. To determine the event-free survival (EFS) rate at 4 months after initiation of the treatment in patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma receiving novel immunotherapeutic agents. (Cohort 3)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 weeks after initiation of the treatment in patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma receiving novel immunotherapeutic agents.\n\nII. To estimate the tumor response (Immune-related Response Criteria \\[irRC\\] and RECIST) in patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of receiving novel immunotherapeutic agents in patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma.\n\nIV. To estimate the median PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma receiving novel immunotherapeutic agents.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine expression of biomarkers (including but not limited to CD73, PD-1 and PD-L1) in pre \\& post treatment (tx) samples.\n\nII. Quantification and characterization of the immune infiltrate (and other histologic and immunohistologic changes) from tissue samples prior to treatment initiation and post treatment (biopsy at week 6).\n\nIII. Identification/quantification of immunologic changes (CD4+, CD8+, Teff, Treg cells and NK cells) in peripheral blood.\n\nIV. Determining an immunoscore based on baseline tumor sample (identification of molecular response/resistance patterns/future therapy options).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive oleclumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 5 doses, then every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients also receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks. Cycle repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3 months for up to 5 years."

Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (e.g. male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progesterone-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action \\[excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective\\]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills.\n\n* Copper T intrauterine device\n* Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system: e.g., Mirena\n* Implants: Etonogestrel-releasing implants: e.g. Implanon or Norplant\n* Injection: Medroxyprogesterone injection: e.g., Depo-Provera\n* Combined pill: Normal and low dose combined oral contraceptive pill\n* Patch: Norelgestromin/ethinylestradiol-releasing transdermal system: e.g., Ortho Evra\n* Minipill: Progesterone based oral contraceptive pill using desogestrel: Cerazette is currently the only highly effective progesterone-based\n\n  * Life expectancy of at least 6 months\n  * Ability to understand the purposes and risk of the study and has signed a written consent form approved by the investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee\n  * Weight \\>= 35 kg\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior therapy with anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1 (including durvalumab) or anti-CD73\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune disease (including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Wegener syndrome) within the past 2 years. Subjects with childhood atopy or asthma, vitiligo, alopecia, Hashimoto syndrome, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years) are not excluded\n* Untreated central nervous system metastatic disease, leptomeningeal disease, or cord compression. Subjects previously treated central nervous system metastases that are radiographically and neurologically stable for at least 28 days and do not require corticosteroids (or any dose) for symptomatic management for at least 14 days prior to first dose of durvalumab and oleclumab are permitted to enroll\n* Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study\n* Receipt of any conventional or investigational anticancer therapy within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable. In addition, local treatment (e.g., by local surgery or radiotherapy) of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable beyond the first cycle with prior consultation and in agreement with the principal investigator (PI)\n* Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0 grade 0 or 1 with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values listed per the inclusion criteria. Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by any of the investigational products may be included (e.g., hearing loss) after consultation with the medical monitor\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first of durvalumab or oleclumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra-articular injection)\n  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., computed tomography \\[CT\\] scan premedication)\n* History of primary immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation, or previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis\n* True positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n* Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational products (NOTE: Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine during the study and 180 days after the last dose of investigational products)\n* Major surgery (as defined by the investigator) within 4 weeks or thoracotomy for pulmonary metastases within 2 weeks prior to first dose of treatment or if still recovering from prior surgery. Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable\n* Other invasive malignancy, within 2 years except for noninvasive malignancies such as cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast that has/have been surgically cured\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events (AEs) from durvalumab or oleclumab, or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent\n* Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results\n* Patients with a history of pneumonitis (active within past 6 months) or interstitial lung disease\n* Subjects with a history of venous thrombosis within the past 3 months\n* Subjects prior history of myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or stroke in the last 3 months",
