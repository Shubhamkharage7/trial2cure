A pocket-sized manual will be provided with 4 units corresponding to session topics, and diary pages to record glucose responses to food and physical activity (PA). Session 1: Introduce GEM, identify personal motivation, learn about foods that cause glucose to go high (high glycemic load (GL) foods) and those that do not (low GL foods), learn how physical activity affects glucose, and begin monitoring how these choices affect glucose. Session 2: Replacement, substitution, and portion control to reduce consumption of high GL foods. Session 3: Increasing PA and reducing sedentary behavior, esp. after a meal. Session 4: Ways to continue lifestyle changes over a lifetime, handle relapses, and thank loved ones for their support. Text message reminders may be sent to participants between sessions to prompt diary entries and for encouragement.",
