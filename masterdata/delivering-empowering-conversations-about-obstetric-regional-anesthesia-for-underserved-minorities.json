The goal of this study is to share disparity data with underserved minority groups being admitted to the labor and delivery unit for obstetric care, to reduce mistrust and misconceptions regarding obstetric anesthesia care, and to bridge the cultural gap between patient beliefs and safe anesthetic care and to empower patients through transparency and provide them with the information necessary to make informed decisions about their care, to improve health literacy, and to ultimately improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients admitted to Labor and Delivery Unit at MSH will self-identify race/ethnicity as part of the standard admission process (Documented in EPIC). Patients who elect for epidural placement for labor epidural analgesia will be approached by an Anesthesia Team Member to be enrolled in a minimal risk study. Participants who self-identify as a racial/ethnic underserved group (as defined by the NIH) will be randomized to receive routine care with a disparities discussion or routine care alone (in a Block Randomization format). Self-identified white participants will receive routine care and serve as a secondary comparison group. The disparities discussion will be performed following epidural placement when the patient is comfortable. During the postpartum period at patient follow-up (within 24hrs postpartum), an 18-point questionnaire evaluating outcomes and patient satisfaction will be administered."
