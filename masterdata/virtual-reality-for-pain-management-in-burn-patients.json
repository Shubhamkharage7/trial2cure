The participants who are randomized to receive the virtual reality intervention will also receive opioids, which is the standard of care and is known to be effective. Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups. The first group will receive VR during their painful procedure (e.g., wound dressing changes, physical therapy etc.) in addition to the standard of care. The other group will receive standard of care (and no VR)."
