Participants with hypertension should be under treatment at study entry to ensure blood pressure control. Those requiring 3 or more antihypertensive medications should be discussed with the PI.\n* Have poorly controlled diabetes defined as HbA1c values of \\> 7.5%. Participants with preexisting, well-controlled, diabetes are not excluded.\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded.\n* Participants with history of pancreatitis within 1 year of study or history of chronic pancreatitis.\n* Participants in accelerated or blast phase, or patients who have ever been documented to be in blast phase CML, are excluded.\n\nThe definitions of excluded CML phases are as follows:\n\n1. Blastic phase: presence of 30% blasts or more in the peripheral blood or bone marrow.\n2. Accelerated phase CML: presence of any of the following features:\n\n   * Peripheral or marrow blasts 15% or more\n   * Peripheral or marrow basophils 20% or more\n   * Thrombocytopenia \\< 100 x 109/L unrelated to therapy\n   * Documented extramedullary blastic disease outside liver or spleen\n3.

However, participants with clonal evolution as the only criterion of accelerated phase have a significantly better prognosis.
