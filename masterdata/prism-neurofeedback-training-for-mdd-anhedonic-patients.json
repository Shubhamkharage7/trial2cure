What are the initial guidelines for integrating PRISM neurofeedback training for MDD therapy with MDD Anhedonia?\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms, Active, or Sham.\n\nDuring the study, participants will perform the following:\n\n* Complete clinical assessments using questionnaires, an MRI scan, and tasks that probe reward responsivity, learning, and motivation.\n* Perform at least 10 sessions but optimally 15 (+/-3) neurofeedback training sessions (performed twice a week on nonconsecutive days for 5-8 weeks).\n* Complete the same clinical assessments, post-NF training MRI scan, and tasks same as in the screening/baseline stage.\n\nResearchers will compare the sham and treatment arm to evaluate if the neurofeedback effect reduced MDD symptoms in MDD patients with Anhedonia."
