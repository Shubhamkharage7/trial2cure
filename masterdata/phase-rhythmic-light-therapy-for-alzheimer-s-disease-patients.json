Following a baseline week, participants will experience his/her assigned lighting condition for two hours in the morning for 8 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, a final round of assessments will be obtained. Study assessments (except for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) will be collected at the end of each week, for a total of 8 assessments.",
            "detailedDescription": "The tailored lighting intervention used to promote circadian entrainment will provide high circadian stimulation during the day produced by narrowband blue light peaking at 470 nanometers (nm). A comparison lighting intervention (i.e., placebo lighting), a narrowband red light peaking at 630 nm, will be used as a control. Both the red and the blue light devices will also provide either the 40 hertz (Hz) flicker (RL) or the random flicker (placebo RL). For the random flicker (placebo RL), the duty cycle will be delivered with a random interval determined by a Poisson process with an average interval of 40 hertz (Hz)."
