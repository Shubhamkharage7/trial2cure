            "briefSummary": "REDHART2 is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effects of Anakinra on peak aerobic exercise capacity measured with a cardiopulmonary test after 24 weeks in patients with recently decompensated systolic heart failure and increased systemic inflammation.",
            "detailedDescription": "The REDHART2 (REcently Decompensated Heart failure Anakinra Response 2 Trial) study is a phase II clinical trial of anakinra or placebo to determine improvement in aerobic exercise capacity (by measuring maximal oxygen uptake (VO2)) in patients with recently decompensated systolic heart failure (HF). The recently completed pilot REDHART study showed anakinra treatment for 12 weeks led to a significant improvement in peak aerobic exercise capacity, whereas anakinra treatment for 2 weeks did not, and no significant changes were seen in placebo. The REDHART2 study is designed to expand and confirm the beneficial effect of sustained anakinra treatment (24 weeks) on peak VO2, and to explore the potential effect size on hospital readmissions for HF. The rationale of Interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade with anakinra in heart failure stems from the evidence of a) reduced adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure in animal models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI); b) reduced incidence of heart failure in patients with ST-segment elevation AMI; c) enhanced IL-1 activity in patients with heart failure, d) quenching of the acute inflammatory response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure, e) direct cardiodepressant effects of IL-1 in animal models, f) improved exercise capacity in pilot studies including patients with stable systolic heart failure, stable diastolic heart failure, and, recently decompensated systolic heart failure in the pilot REDHART study. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to active treatment, such that patients will be twice as likely to receive anakinra versus placebo."
