To identify the factors predictive of longer term magnitude of limitations after extremity fractures (using PROMs)\n2. To assess minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB) in PROM scores\n3. To define recovery trajectories of PROMs i.e. range, normative limits and score thresholds\n\nIII) Linking PROMIS\u00ae: Linking of PROMIS Measures to Legacy Measures in an Orthopaedic Patient Population\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Administer and collect responses to the PROMIS PF/UE and PAIN INT and the four orthopaedic legacy measures in the same group of orthopaedic trauma patients.\n2. Apply the methods of item-response theory (IRT) linking to establish a common standardized metric.\n3. Develop equations for conversion of a PROMIS PF/UE and PAIN INT score to each of the specified legacy measures and vice-versa."
