The primary aims are to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, image quality, and radiation exposure of DA-CT as a potential noninvasive alternative to the gold standard of flexible bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of tracheomalacia. The results from this pilot study will help to estimate sample size for a larger-scale study with more precise estimates of DA-CT diagnostic potential."
