The test will be administered on one occasion to patients with a clinical diagnosis of lupus or incomplete lupus and clinical and laboratory features assessd contemporaneously. This trial includes a pilot study of approximately 10 subjects from 2-3 sites to assess whether the delivery times of LuGENE\u00ae laboratory results do not exceed more than 7 business days."
