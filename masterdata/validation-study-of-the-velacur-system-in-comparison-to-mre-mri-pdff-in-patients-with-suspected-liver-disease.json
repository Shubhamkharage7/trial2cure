The main aims is to:\n\n* Validate the use of Velacur and elastography cut offs in a patient cohort with all types of chronic liver disease, against MRE results for fibrosis staging.\n* Validate the use of Velacur and attenuation cut offs in a patient cohort with all types of chronic liver disease, against MRI-PDFF results for steatosis staging.\n\nParticipants will Study participants will attend 1 study visit, in which measurement of liver stiffness with Velacur and FibroScan, will be performed by a certified technician. As part of Visit 1, Patients will also complete an MRI exam which will include both MRE and MRI-PDFF measurements (MRI imaging can take place within 28 days of the Velacur scan).",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be a prospective, open label, validation study of the Velacur system in comparison to MRE and MRI-PDFF in patients with liver disease or suspected liver disease.\n\nApproximately 100 subjects may be enrolled in this study. Participants should span all levels of fibrosis and steatosis.\n\nThe study is comprised of: Screening Period (up to 8 days) and Visit 1. There are no safety follow-up visits in this study.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to compare the results of Velacur against MRE and MRI-PDFF results for liver stiffness and steatosis. As part of prior studies, using MRE as the gold standard, clinical cut-off for Velacur have been developed. The primary objective of this study is to validate these cut-offs to see if Velacur can correctly classify patients.\n\nSecondary objectives include correlating the stiffness and attenuation results of Velacur with other clinical measures of fibrosis and steatosis such as Fib-4, and correlations with other clinical measurements collected through clinical care or clinical trials, such as Enhance Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test, FibroScan, MRI, or ultrasound based shear wave elastography (SWE) as they are available."
