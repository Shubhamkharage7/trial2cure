            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study of pirtobrutinib with obinutuzumab for participants with CLL or SLL. Eligible participants will receive 6 cycles of pirtobrutinib alone followed by an additional 6 cycles of pirtobrutinib-obinutuzumab combination therapy. All participants will stop treatment after 12 cycles in total (approximately 1 year).\n\nIf CLL progresses and requires treatment after 1-year of therapy, participants will receive retreatment with pirtobrutinib only. Participants will be followed for up to a total of 10 years. Up to 60 participants will take part in this study.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pirtobrutinib for continuous treatment of CLL that has relapsed or become refractory to other treatments. Pirtobrutinib is not approved for the first-line treatment of CLL/SLL nor for fixed-duration therapy. The FDA has approved obinutuzumab for the treatment of CLL.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, electrocardiograms, imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or CT scans), blood tests, saliva tests, bone marrow biopsies, and/or lymph node biopsies (if feasible).\n\nLoxo Oncology at Eli Lilly and Company is supporting this study by providing pirtobrutinib and research funding."
