            "briefSummary": "This study will investigate the combination of Ytrium-90 (Y-90) Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) followed by Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Y-90 SIRT alone or SBRT alone are standard procedures used in the treatment of liver cancer. This study will assess the combination of Y-90 SIRT and SBRT and obtain preliminary information about the side effects and safety of the combination therapy. Additionally, this is the first time that Y-90 PET-CT imaging will be included in planning for SBRT.",
            "detailedDescription": "Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is a technique where radiation is internally delivered to a tumor. In SIRT, small radioactive beads are deposited in the liver through a large blood vessel (hepatic artery). SIRT that uses the radioactive material Yttrium-90 is called Y-90 SIRT.\n\nStereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a technique where radiation is externally delivered to a tumor. In SBRT, a machine produces a beam of radiation that targets the tumor from outside the body.\n\nAfter receiving Y-90 SIRT, participants will be evaluated to estimate how much radiation was absorbed by their tumors during Y-90 SIRT. Y-90 PET-CT imaging will be used to help plan SBRT, which will target areas of tumors that did not receive as much radiation as expected during Y-90 SIRT.\n\nSince patients treated with Y-90 for any liver malignancy can benefit from the Y-90+SBRT combined treatment approach we have decided to open up the protocol to all eligible patients and not HCC alone."
