A female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening (at or within 45 days of study enrollment) and within 72 hours of the start of study treatment (Section 4.7) and must agree to further serum or urine pregnancy tests during the study\n8. A female participant must be (as defined in Appendix 17.3):\n\n   1. Not of childbearing potential, or\n   2. Of childbearing potential and practicing at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (see Appendix 17.3).

A male participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage of ejaculate to another person during the study and for a period of 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment. If the male participant's partner is a female of childbearing potential, the male participant must use condoms (with or without spermicide), and the female partner of the male participant must also be practicing a highly effective method of contraception (see Appendix 17.3).\n\n    NOTE: If the male participant is vasectomized, he still must wear a condom (with or without spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), but his female partner is not required to use contraception.\n12. A male participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction during the study and for period of 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment.

Contraindication to any concomitant medication, including those medications administered for infusion reaction, antiviral, antibacterial, anticoagulation, tumor lysis, or hydration prophylaxis given prior to therapy.\n5. Patient has any of the following:\n\n   1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive with 1 or more of the following:\n\n      * History of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining conditions cluster of differentiation (CD4)count \\<350 cells/mm3\n      * Detectable viral load during screening or within 6 months prior to screening\n      * Not receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy\n      * Had a change in antiretroviral therapy within 6 months of the start of screening\n      * Receiving antiretroviral therapy that may interfere with study treatment as assessed after discussion with the Medical Monitor\n   2. Hepatitis B infection (ie, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B virus (HBV)- DNA positive). Patients with resolved infection (ie, patients who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen \\[anti-HBs\\]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of HBV DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. In the event the infection status is unclear, quantitative viral levels are necessary to determine the infection status; see Section 10.3.5.2.1 for further required assessments.\n\n      EXCEPTION: Participants with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.\n   3. Active hepatitis C infection as measured by positive HCV-ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing.\n\n      Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positivity must undergo HCV-RNA testing (Section 10.3.5.2.2). If a participant with history of chronic hepatitis C infection (defined as both HCV antibody and HCV-RNA positive) completed antiviral therapy and has undetectable HCV-RNA 12 weeks following the completion of therapy, the participant is eligible for the study.\n   4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) \\<50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for participants with known or suspected of having COPD or asthma, and participants must be excluded if FEV1 \\<50% of predicted normal.\n   5. Moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years or uncontrolled asthma of any classification. Note that FEV1 testing is required for participants with known or suspected asthma, and participants must be excluded if FEV1 \\<50% of predicted normal.\n6. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the experimental agents used in study.\n7. Female patient refuses to discontinue breastfeeding her infant during study treatment or within 5 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment.\n8. Participant plans to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n9. Presence of the following cardiac conditions:\n\n   1. New York Heart Association stage III or IV congestive heart failure\n   2. Myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft \u22646 months prior to study enrollment\n   3. History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, not believed to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration\n   4. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities\n   5. Unstable or uncontrolled disease/condition related to or affecting cardiac function (eg, unstable angina)\n10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection, venous thromboembolic disease, hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis, active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease with the exception of vitiligo, type I diabetes, and prior autoimmune thyroiditis that is currently euthyroid based on clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, or psychiatric illness/social situations within 2 weeks that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n11. Active malignancy other than SMM requiring treatment in the past 24 months. Malignancies treated within the past 24 months that are considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence are allowed.\n12. Have any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the well-being of the patient or the study or prevent the patient from meeting or performing study requirements.\n13. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity will not be enrolled on this trial.",
