The investigators hypothesize that facilitating access to contraception through our intervention will ultimately result in increased feelings of autonomy around these decisions and use of hormonal contraception.",

Importantly, the navigator can assist participants in overcoming specific environmental barriers (transportation, cost, clinical access) and personal barriers (knowledge and confidentiality concerns) before, during and after the clinical encounter."
