            "briefSummary": "The overall objective of the proposed pilot project is to explore health literacy and barriers to management of PCOS across the lifespan and determine whether the cardiometabolic risks of PCOS extend beyond menopause. The investigators hypothesize that barriers to PCOS management exist and cardiometabolic risks for this population are magnified by aging and menopause.",
            "detailedDescription": "This proposed research serves to provide preliminary data to determine how the metabolic consequences of menopause are exacerbated in women with PCOS. In addition, the investigators will identify barriers to lifestyle management strategies for women with PCOS across the lifespan. The findings will provide preliminary data to inform future interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk among postmenopausal women with PCOS. Understanding literacy skills and barriers to PCOS management will facilitate the development of personalized, therapeutic strategies and clear communication between patient-health care provider. Furthermore, these practices will help women with PCOS become more involved in their health care decisions and improve women's health.\n\nTherefore, our specific aims are twofold:\n\nAim 1. Explore and contrast health literacy and barriers to lifestyle management among reproductive-aged and postmenopausal women with PCOS. Using semi-structured, qualitative interviews and REDCap surveys, the investigators will assess differences in health literacy, self-efficacy, and barriers to lifestyle management practices in groups of women with PCOS who are of reproductive age or post-menopausal.\n\nAim 2. Assess and compare the metabolic risk of women with PCOS to age and BMI-matched, postmenopausal controls. The cohort of post-menopausal women with PCOS in Aim 1 and a cohort of age and BMI-matched post-menopausal women who have no history of hyperandrogenism/PCOS will complete measurement of cardiometabolic risk factors, androgen profile and body composition via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry."
