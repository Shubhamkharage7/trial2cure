            "detailedDescription": "For safety reasons, consolidative hfRT will start from 6.5Gy x 2 fractions and dose escalate to 10Gy x 2 fractions in a 3+3 design. Consolidative hfRT will be delivered one to two months after finishing definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT) and concurrently with adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy using durvalumab in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nAt the final determined consolidative hfRT dose level, a total of thirty-two subjects with pathologically documented stage III NSCLC treated with dCRT will be enrolled for data analyses.\n\nFollow-up assessments will occur every 3 months during durvalumab therapy for the first two years, then every 4-6 months after 2 years from study registration until confirmed disease progression or death. Primary endpoints include the safety of boost hfRT and concurrent anti-PD-L1 therapy adjuvantly following dCRT, and the 12-month progression-free survival to compare with historical results."
