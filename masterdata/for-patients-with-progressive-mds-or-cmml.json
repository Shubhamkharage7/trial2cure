            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase Ib clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD6738 as a treatment for any disease.\n\nAZD6738 is a a drug being studied as a potential treatment for individuals with Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia. It targets a specific pathway in cells that repairs damage to DNA, specifically by blocking a protein called ATR. ATR notices when there is injury to DNA, which is the blueprint that allows cells to function and replicate, and works to repair that damage. Studies done in a laboratory setting and cell lines suggest that MDS and CMML cells rely specifically on the ATR pathway to fix DNA damage and survive; by inhibiting ATR with AZD6738, MDS or CMML cells appear to selectively accumulate DNA damage and die, but healthy cells appear to be less sensitive to this target. This suggests that inhibiting ATR may be a way to selectively target MDS or CMML cells.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking to first investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD6738. The investigators will also evaluate whether AZD6738 has any effect on tumor growth, measure the activity of AZD6738 in the bone marrow, and study how AZD6738 is cleared by the body."

Note these include common azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, and other medications listed in the concomitant medications section. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n  * Exposure of other drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 may be reduced and additional monitoring may be required (see Appendix G).\n  * The use of herbal supplements or 'folk remedies' (and medications and foods that significantly modulate CYP3A activity) should be discouraged. If deemed necessary, such products may be administered with caution and the reason for use documented in the CRF (see Appendix G).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious and active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, active inflammatory bowel disease, unstable respiratory or cardiac conditions, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmia, active bleeding diathesis (e.g. haemophilia or von Willebrand disease), uncontrolled seizures, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months:\n\n  * Unstable angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction.\n  * Congestive heart failure (NYHA \u2265 Class 2) or known reduced LVEF \\< 50%.\n  * Unstable conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication e.g. third-degree heart block.\n  * Unstable ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic controlled atrial arrhythmias in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are eligible).\n  * Symptomatic carotid stenosis, TIA, haemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke.\n  * Cardiac procedures such as CABG, angioplasty or vascular stenting within 6 months of dosing.\n* Patients with relative hypotension (\\<90/60 mmHg) or clinically relevant orthostatic hypotension, including fall in blood pressure of \\> 20 mm Hg.\n* Resting corrected QT interval (QTc) \\>470 msec for females and \\>450 for males (Fredericia formula). Patients with known factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation such as a personal/immediate family history of long QT syndrome are ineligible.\n* Active untreated or concurrent malignancy that is distinct in primary site or histology, excluding: non-melanoma skin cancer, noninvasive colonic polyps, superficial bladder tumors, cervical cancer in-situ, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Patients may be receiving maintenance hormonal therapy for prior breast or prostate cancer. Other malignancies that were treated with curative intent at least 3 years prior to study screening and without evidence of active disease will be allowed.\n* Female patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD6738 is chemotherapy agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AZD6738, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.\n* HIV-positive participants, including those on combination antiretroviral therapy, are ineligible, both because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD6738, as well as an increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Screening for patients without suspected disease is not required. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Patients who are known to have active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C based on serologic status. Screening for patients without suspected disease is not required. Patients treated with viral suppression are eligible.\n* Patients who have been vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug.\n* Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or previous significant bowel resection, with clinically significant sequelae that would preclude adequate absorption of AZD6738",
