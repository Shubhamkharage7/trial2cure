DS-8201a and pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle. The initial dose administered for DS8201a will be 3.2 mg/kg Q3W. Escalation to the next dose (5.4 mg/kg Q3W) will be based on acceptable safety signals based on the earlier dose cohort.\n\nUpon completion of dose escalation with the recommended dose of escalation (RDE) established, the dose expansion part of the study will begin. The dose expansion part will include 4 cohorts: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) breast cancer participants with prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), HER2 low breast cancer participants with prior failed standard treatments, HER2-expressing NSCLC participants who have not received any prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or HER2 agents, and HER2-mutant NSCLC participants who have not received any prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or HER2 agents."
