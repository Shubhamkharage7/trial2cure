            "briefSummary": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 16% of the world's total deaths. The number of cases is expected to increase as our population ages. Heart disease also results in large economic burden. It costs the United States about $219 billion per year. Some patients have symptoms that aren't helped by drugs or other medical treatments. These patients will need a surgery that is called cardiac artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. CABG helps to improve chest pain which is one of the most common complaints of heart disease, and has life-prolonging potential. A limitation of CABG is that it results in increased inflammation. These patients also report high levels of anxiety and depression. Depression and anxiety in the several days surrounding surgery are related to several important things. These include worse health outcomes, worse quality of life, increased risk of death, and increased health care cost. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a kind of therapy. ACT is adaptable, easy to access, and effective in brief formats. ACT has been gaining evidence for its use in many patient samples. Few studies have used ACT with heart disease patients. No known studies currently exist that have used ACT within the few days surrounding CABG surgery. To address this need, the investigators will conduct a two-arm feasibility randomized control trial (RCT). Patients will be randomized to one of two groups. The first group will complete a brief, 2-session telehealth ACT intervention. The second group will be a control group. The control will consist of treatment as usual. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of this brief ACT intervention delivered in the peri-operative period. The investigators will also examine preliminary efficacy of the ACT intervention. The investigators will examine anxiety, depression, psychological inflexibility, well-being, and cardiovascular health-related quality of life. The investigators will also examine the intervention's impact on inflammation by measuring two inflammatory markers. The results from this study will also lay the groundwork for larger or multiple site RCT studies."
