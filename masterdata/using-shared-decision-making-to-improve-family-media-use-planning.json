Stratified randomization will be used to assign families to the intervention (MDPT) or control (delayed MDPT) condition. Families assigned to the intervention condition will be asked to complete the MDPT within 2 weeks of randomization and will be sent a second survey one week after plan completion. Participants in the control condition will complete a condition-specific subset of these questions three weeks after baseline. Participants in both conditions will complete a follow-up survey assessing media use and health behaviors two months after their second survey.\n\nThe primary outcomes will be change in adolescent and parent media use practices, and key mediators will be core components of shared decision making process (i.e., informed, clear on values, engaged in planning and decision making), implementation readiness (i.e., self-efficacy) and within-family communication. Two-month follow-up surveys will provide preliminary data about maintenance of behavioral changes."
