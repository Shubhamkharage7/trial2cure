            "detailedDescription": "The aim of the proposed pilot study is to investigate safety and tolerability of moderate term, repeated exposure of Pulsed Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (PLIFUS) in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nDue to the lack of options for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, investigations into alternative noninvasive treatments are warranted. PLIFUS has been shown to safely modulate neuronal tissue, and is non-invasive and painless. Several human studies have shown that the use of PLIFUS can suppress somatosensory evoked potentials and induce functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) responses.\n\nOnce the subject is enrolled in the study, the subject will be scheduled for a standard brain MRI scan at BWH if they have not had one in the last 3 months. The subject will be asked to keep track of their seizure events in the Daily Seizure Log Diary from the screening visit until 6 months after the last treatment session.\n\nThe treatment period will include 6 treatment sessions total. These will occur 2 days per week for 3 weeks, each lasting approximately 1-2 hours, starting 1 month after seizure logging begins."
