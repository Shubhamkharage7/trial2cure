The researchers will compare giving the usual maintenance therapy (lenalidomide) with giving daratumumab as maintenance therapy, and they will look at which drug gives participants a better health-related quality of life during treatment. The researchers will measure participants' quality of life using various questionnaires. This study will help researchers find out whether this different approach of giving daratumumab as maintenance therapy is better, the same as, or worse than the usual approach."

Recommendation is for 2 effective contraceptive methods during the study and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose. Adequate forms of contraception are double-barrier methods (condoms with spermicidal jelly or foam and diaphragm with spermicidal jelly or foam), oral, depo provera, or injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and tubal ligation.\n* A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).\n* Females of childbearing potential who have not previously taken Lenalidomide must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days as required by Revlimid REMS\u00ae).\n* Females of childbearing potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS\u00ae program.\n* Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a female of childbearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy.

Permitted concurrent therapies include:\n* Bisphosphonates/RANK ligand inhibitors (denosumab)\n* Plasma cell leukemia\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding females. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide, lactating females must agree not to breastfeed while taking lenalidomide.\n* Risk for adverse events to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with daratumumab is unknown, as such lactating females must agree not to breastfeed while on daratumumab.\n* Patient has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) \\<50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for subjects suspected of having COPD and subjects must be excluded if FEV1 \\<50% of predicted normal).\n* Patient has known moderate or severe persistent asthma, within the last 2 years, or currently has uncontrolled asthma of any classification (refer to Appendix D). (Subjects who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed to participate in the study.)\n* Uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes that is not being managed by a physician. Once care for diabetes or hypertension is established, patient is eligible for the study.\n* Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen \\[anti-HBc\\] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen \\[anti-HBs\\]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR. If Hep B PCR positive then patient will screen fail. They must first be treated and have a sustained virologic response \\[SVR\\], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy after which they can be re screened.\n* Seropositive for hepatitis C must be screened using Hepatitis C PCR. If Hepatitis C PCR is positive then the patients is excluded (If antibody positive and PCR negative they will be eligible but must have PCR testing every 3-6 months for 3 years; If Hep C PCR positive then patient will screen fail. They must first be treated and have a sustained virologic response \\[SVR\\], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy after which they can be rescreened).\n* Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years prior to study enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of non-melanoma skin cancer, or an in-situ malignancy.\n* Previous diagnosis of another malignancy with any evidence of residual or active disease.\n* Uncontrolled or detectable HIV viral load excluded. (Patients seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and/or those who are taking antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS with undetectable viral load will be eligible. Patients must have PCR testing every 3-6 months for 3 years and be compliant with antiretroviral treatment.)\n* Prior organ transplant requiring immunosuppressive therapy\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant\n* Patients requiring continuous, systemic immunosuppressive therapy\n* Patients with myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia\n* Patients with conditions that would prevent absorption of the study drug\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to uncontrolled infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise compliance with study requirements\n* Unresolved prior treatment related AE \u2265 grade 2 except for alopecia and neuropathy\n* Neuropathy \u2265 Grade 3 at baseline\n* Contraindication to required concomitant anticoagulation or antiviral prophylaxis\n* Major surgery within 1 month prior to enrollment\n* Patients who were previously exposed and who developed severe adverse events, hypersensitivity or desquamating rash to either thalidomide or lenalidomide\n* Patients who speak a language that does not have an EORTC QLQ-C30, MY20 or PRO-CTCAE version translated into their language (Available languages include Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hugarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Protugese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Ukranian).\n\nAdditional exclusion criteria for patients interested in the nutrition intervention (declining the sub-study will not preclude patients from enrollment into primary study):\n\n* Legume allergy\n* Severe allergies such as anaphylactic shock to nuts (specifically cashews).
