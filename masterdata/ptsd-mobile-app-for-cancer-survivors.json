The information learned by doing this study may help us to develop some target treatments for PTSD symptoms in survivors of stem cell transplant.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomized to a mobile app or usual care. An assessment will be made after 4 weeks and a determination made of adding more intensive treatment. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire 4 times over a period of 6 months, at the time your participation is complete."
