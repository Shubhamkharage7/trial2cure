This is a retrospective and prospective, observational, medical chart review study for at least 6 standard of care visits up to 1 years after a subject consents for study participation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Endoscopic bariatric therapies such as intragastric balloons, space occupying EBTs, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), primary obesity surgery endolumenal (POSE), and small bowel interventions including gastrointestinal bypass sleeves, etc. are recommended alone or in conjunction with other weight loss treatment modules for patients who cannot or do not want to undergo conventional bariatric surgery or other therapies for obesity (with BMI \u226530 kg/m2) or BMI \\>27 with comorbidities.\n\nThis research is being done in order to find out if endoscopic bariatric therapies work as well as, or better or worse than, other currently available treatment modules to achieve weight loss.\n\nThe study is to create a registry to analyze a longitudinal observational cohort of patients who have undergone endobariatric procedures. We will collect information through standard of practice visits and through chart review.\n\nLaboratory data, patient characteristics, imaging, histology will be collected. In certain patients - after specific consent extra blood may be collected for research purposes."
