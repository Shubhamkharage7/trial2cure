            "briefSummary": "This phase II clinical trial evaluates whether a modified modality of conditioning reduces treatment-related mortality (TRM) in patients who undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for a hematological malignancy. HSCT is a curative therapy for many hematopoietic malignancies, however this regimen results in higher rates of TRM than other forms of treatment. In recent years, less intense conditioning regimens with radiation and chemotherapy prior to HSCT have been developed. Radiation therapy uses high energy sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors while chemotherapy drugs like fludarabine and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This study evaluates whether a two-step approach with lower-intensity regimens of these treatments prior to HSCT reduces the rate of TRM.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the 2 year cumulative incidence of TRM in patients undergoing reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) haploidentical (HI) HSCT in this protocol.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the 2 year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients undergoing RIC HI HSCT in this protocol.\n\nII. To assess the consistency and pace of engraftment. III. To assess the pace of T cell and B cell immune recovery. IV. To assess the incidence and severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nRADIATION-BASED COHORT: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) on days -11, -10, -9, and -8, undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice a day (BID) on days -10 and -9, undergo donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Patients begin tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil IV on day -1. Patients then undergo HSCT on day 0. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCHEMOTHERAPY-BASED COHORT: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -11, -10, -9, and -8 and melphalan IV on days -10 and -9. Patients undergo TBI and DLI once on day -6. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2 and begin tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil on day -1. Patients undergo HSCT on day 0. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years."

This is an adjustment to account for healthy patients who meet the spirit of this protocol but have histories that result in higher than guideline HCT-CI points. An example is a patient with a solid tumor malignancy in their remote history (adds 3 points to HCT-CI total) where the treatment for the malignancy occurred years to decades before and there has been complete recovery of toxicities\n* Patients must be willing to use contraception if they have childbearing potential\n* Patient or patient's guardian is able to give informed consent\n* Patients should have a life expectancy of \\>= 6 months for reasons other than their underlying hematologic/oncologic disorder\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with evidence of another malignancy, exclusive of a skin cancer that requires only local treatment, should not be enrolled on this protocol\n* Patients should not be:\n\n  * Human immunodeficiency virus positive\n  * Have active involvement of the central nervous system with malignancy. This can be documented by a normal neurological exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, and/or a negative cerebral spinal fluid analysis\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding",
