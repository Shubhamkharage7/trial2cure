            "detailedDescription": "The current project aims to design and implement an 8-week Virtual Reality Adventure Therapy Exergaming (V-RATE) intervention focused on women veterans. A randomized controlled trial using a repeated measure design with a 1-month follow-up assessment will be employed. The project addresses two specific aims:\n\nAim 1. To examine the effects of an 8-week V-RATE intervention on physical health (i.e., BMI, physical activity, sedentary behavior, heart rate variability) among women veterans. We hypothesize that after controlling for socio-demographic variables and physical activity history, individuals in the V-RATE group would exhibit more improvement in the physical health indicators after the intervention compared to individuals in the control group. We further hypothesize gains would be maintained or enhanced at 1-month follow-up measure.\n\nAim 2. To examine the effects of an 8-week V-RATE intervention on mental health outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, cognitive function, health-related quality of life), among women veterans. We hypothesize that after controlling for socio-demographic variables and physical activity history, individuals in the V-RATE group will exhibit more improvement in the mental health indicators after the intervention compared to individuals in the control group. We further hypothesize gains maintained or enhanced at 1-month follow-up measure."

The V-RATE program will be focused on creating a safe and immersive environment supportive of physical activity. The treadmill enables an individual can walk and run at self-paced speed, moving in 360-degrees (i.e., forwards, sideways, and backwards) without risk of falling. The core feature of the self-paced treadmill is a concave walking platform with an adjustable waist hardness that enables a safe, smooth, natural gait while adults with elevated BMI engage in an immersive walking and running motion. During the V-RATE intervention, participants will self-pace their locomotor action (walking/running/bending/ jumping) while they wear the VR headset and experience immersive VR adventure games using the Omniverse VR system.",
