            "briefSummary": "This is a two-phase study that compares performance growth pre-implant with current hearing aid (HA) technology versus post-implant with a cochlear implant (CI) in children with either asymmetric hearing loss (AHL) or single-sided deafness (SSD). Post-implant performance with a CI alone is expected to outperform pre-implant performance with a HA. The study also evaluates the effectiveness of bimodal hearing defined as a CI in the poor ear and a HA in the better ear for AHL or a CI in the poor ear and normal hearing in the better ear for SSD compared to pre-implant performance. The study examines factors contributing to CI outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is conducted as a multicenter, prospective, two-phase clinical trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of cochlear implantation in children with asymmetric hearing loss (AHL) or single-sided deafness (SSD). A hearing aid (HA) phase occurs over a minimum of 4 mos prior to obtaining a cochlear implant (CI). A CI phase occurs over the 15-month period after initial activation of the CI. The AHL/SSD groups are tested for change in performance pre- to post-implant. Investigators also collect longitudinal data over 12 months (matching the 3 to 15 month post-implant timeframe) from normal hearing (NH) participants to provide additional information about outcome trajectory due to development alone. The NH participants are matched to AHL/SSD participants on age, gender and parent education. Post-implant performance with a CI alone is expected to outperform pre-implant performance with a HA. The study evaluates the effectiveness of bimodal hearing defined as a CI in the poor ear and a HA in the better ear for AHL or a CI in the poor ear and normal hearing in the better ear for SSD compared to pre-implant performance. The study examines factors contributing to CI outcomes."
