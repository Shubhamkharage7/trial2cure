            "briefSummary": "In partnership with the Veterans Affairs (VA) Palo Alto Health Care System and Stanford University, this study aims to evaluate clinical outcomes, assess implementation feasibility, and health economics of MDMA-assisted therapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Through a randomized comparison of MDMA-assisted therapy versus Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), a VA gold standard treatment for PTSD, the proposed study will set the stage for understanding the potential use and application of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD within the VA system.",
            "detailedDescription": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life, and can result in diminished cognitive and psychosocial functioning, fractured relationships, inability to maintain employment, substance use disorders, high-cost healthcare utilization, increased depression, and suicide risk. People who suffer from PTSD relive their traumatic experience(s) through nightmares and flashbacks, have difficulty sleeping, and feel detached or estranged. Symptoms can be severe and long lasting.\n\nMany available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them. This indicates a need to assess treatments targeting durable remission of PTSD. An extensive list of medications, namely antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and sleep aids, are frequently prescribed off-label but are minimally effective in reducing PTSD symptoms.\n\nMDMA-assisted therapy is a novel treatment package that combines psychotherapeutic techniques with the administration of MDMA as a pharmacological adjunct intended to enhance certain aspects of therapy. The subjective effects of MDMA create a productive psychological state that enhances the therapeutic process. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non-profit research and educational organization working as a clinical trial sponsor to obtain approval for the prescription use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct to therapy in patients with treatment-resistant PTSD. Data from a series of Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of MDMA-assisted therapy conducted by MAPS provide preliminary evidence that chronic PTSD, independent of cause, is treatable with up to three sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy and associated non-drug preparatory and integrative therapy sessions.\n\nCognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a cognitively-oriented approach to treating PTSD developed in the late 1980's by Dr. Patricia Resick. Significant research on CPT has been conducted in the VA system nationally. Across a number of studies, a meta-analysis found the number of subjects that no longer meet PTSD criteria after receiving a full course of CPT ranged from 30% to 97%, and 51% of subjects receiving CPT achieved loss of diagnosis compared to waitlist, self-help booklets, and treatment as usual control groups. There are various task forces and active efforts to deploy CPT more broadly in the VA. The comparison of CPT and MDMA-assisted therapy for treatment of PTSD is very timely given the tremendous need to treat PTSD throughout the VA system, making this comparison all the more pertinent.\n\nPTSD carries a high public burden, both economically and socially, by increased healthcare utilization, use of social services, lost wages, and disability payments. Given the chronicity of PTSD, low treatment compliance evidenced by high dropouts, and limited recovery with current medications contributing to serious outcomes, PTSD patients exhibit an unmet medical need. Currently, the VA serves approximately nine million Veterans and the conservative estimate of those with PTSD is 25%, or over two million Veterans. The potential importance and benefits of this novel treatment to Veterans, doctors, researchers, and the VA system cannot be underestimated. The clinical effectiveness, implementation evaluation, and economic assessment conducted in this study will provide critical information and understanding of the feasibility of utilization in the VA system."

Subjects are encouraged to experience and express fear, anger, and grief with less likelihood of feeling overwhelmed by these emotions. MDMA seems to engender internal awareness that even painful feelings that arise are an important part of the therapeutic process. In addition, feelings of empathy, love, and deep appreciation often emerge, along with a clearer perspective of the trauma as a past event, a more accurate perspective about its significance, and a heightened awareness of the support and safety that exists in the present.",

The summary scores were found to be reliable and valid measures of these dimensions in a group of depressed outpatients. The Q-LES-Q-SF measures were related to, but not redundant with, measures of overall severity of illness or severity of depression within this sample. These findings suggest that the Q-LES-Q-SF measures may be sensitive to important differences among depressed patients that are not detected by the measures usually employed.
