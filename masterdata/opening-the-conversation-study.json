            "briefSummary": "Young adult survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer face a number of challenges, including interrupted life plans. As many as two-thirds of these young survivors experience negative effects of cancer and cancer treatment on their reproductive health, including sexual function and ability to have children. These are among the most distressing aspects of life after cancer for young survivors and their partners, and when left unaddressed, lead to poorer mental health and quality of life. Yet, surprisingly, evidence-based programs are not available to help young couples manage this aspect of life after cancer. In this study, we will adapt and evaluate an intervention designed to help young couples cope with and communicate about cancer-related reproductive and sexual health concerns.",
            "detailedDescription": "The specific aims of the study are:\n\nAim 1 (Phase I). Systematically adapt an empirically supported couple-based skills training intervention to help young breast and gynecologic cancer (BGC) survivors and their partners jointly manage the reproductive and sexual health consequences of cancer.\n\nAim 2 (Phase II - Quantitative). Evaluate the efficacy of the intervention and hypothesized mediators by conducting a randomized trial. We will evaluate the efficacy of the newly adapted intervention, Opening the Conversation (OC), on survivors' and their partners' reproductive and sexual distress as well as the relationship, sexual, and psychosocial health outcomes. We will determine whether dyadic coping and communication mediate intervention effects on survivors' and partners' reproductive and sexual distress.\n\nAim 3 (Phase II - Qualitative). Evaluate couples' experiences within and across conditions to gain in-depth knowledge of intervention components that influence hypothesized mediators and outcomes."
