            "briefSummary": "Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are neural crest-derived tumors of the nervous system that are often inherited and genetically heterogeneous. Genetic screening is recommended for patients and their relatives, and can guide clinical decisions. However, a mutation is not found in all cases. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) to map gene(s) involved in pheochromocytoma, and 2) identify genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma of various genetic origins.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas are tumors originated from neuroectoderm cells located in the adrenal or extra-adrenal paraganglia, often leading to increased secretion of hormones known as catecholamines. These tumors represent a potentially curable cause of hypertension and are malignant in about 10-15% of the cases. Approximately 40% of patients with pheochromocytomas and/or paraganglioma have an inherited mutation. In addition, some patients and/or their relatives that are mutation carriers can develop other tumors as part of inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes. Therefore, detection of the susceptibility mutation is important for diagnosis and follow up. However, the susceptibility gene mutation cannot be identified in all cases. Studies that aim to identify novel susceptibility genes for pheochromocytoma are required.\n\nThe fist aim of this study is to identify novel pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes. Characterization of such gene(s) can improve our understanding of the pathogenesis pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma and have an impact in diagnosis, therapeutic planning and genetic screening of relatives.\n\nThe second aim of this project is to characterize relationships between mutations and clinical features that can provide insights into clinical surveillance and screening of at-risk individuals."
