            "detailedDescription": "Elderly participants with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) are often frail and malnourished. Both chemotherapy and disease burden are associated with a decline in muscle mass leading to decrease in physical strength and cardiovascular fitness. Limited efforts have focused on decreasing morbidity at time of chemotherapy and surgery and improving functional capacity. Exercise during chemotherapy has been shown to improve chemotherapy related symptoms and quality of life in participants with breast cancer participants. In surgical patient populations, preoperative rehabilitation (prehabilitation) has been shown to improve walking capacity, decrease hospital length of stay, perioperative complications, and cost. However, whether multimodal prehabilitation improves the functional capacity and perioperative outcomes of EOC and PDAC participants undergoing NACT compared to standard of care is unknown. Investigators aim to evaluate if prehabilitation in participants with EOC and PDAC undergoing NACT improves physical fitness/ functional outcomes, perioperative outcomes, nutritional status, and quality of life compared to standard of care."
