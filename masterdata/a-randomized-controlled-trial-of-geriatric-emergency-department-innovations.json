Half of the patients will be cared for by a standard ED team plus the GEDI team, while half of the patients will receive usual ED care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hospitalization is common for older adults in the Emergency Department (ED) but it carries significant risks including the development of delirium, falls, and nosocomial infections. The Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital attempts to identify and address health related risks for older adults without exposing them to the risks of hospitalization,. GEDI is a unique program consisting of a multidisciplinary team of Transitional Care Nurses (TCN), social workers, pharmacists, occupational therapists and physical therapists who perform ED-based geriatric assessment and care coordination.\n\nTo determine the impact of GEDI on health services use and Health Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing GEDI compared to usual ED care(which often involves hospitalization)."
