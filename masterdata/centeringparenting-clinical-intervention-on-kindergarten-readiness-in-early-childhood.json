            "briefSummary": "Disparities in health begin in early childhood. Early life experiences influence brain development and have significant implications on future health and developmental outcomes. Low-income children are at greater risk of developmental delays in large part due to a lack of an enriched environment. Disparities in early childhood development increase risk for stunted academic achievement throughout the life course. Primary care is a universal exposure in early childhood and therefore is also a significant entry point for promoting optimal child development.\n\nThere is a need to provide effective, low-cost, and scalable interventions in primary care to support early childhood development.The CenteringParenting intervention is designed to reduce negative health and developmental outcomes within a model of group routine child health care. To date, there is no evidence of the benefits of the CenteringParenting intervention on school readiness, or improvements in parental behaviors that support optimal developmental milestones and achievement. The intent of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the CenteringParenting intervention on school readiness in early childhood, as measured by language development at 24 months, (in addition to health care utilization, child routine care maintenance, parenting stress, caregiver behaviors and attitudes).",
            "detailedDescription": "Children raised in environments with limited stimulation and lack of exposure to positive interactions are likely to have developmental delays in expressive and receptive language, vocabulary, social skills, behavior-all factors critical for school readiness. Children who enter kindergarten underprepared are more likely to struggle academically and experience lower school achievement, and ultimately impaired opportunities for economic and social mobility as adults.\n\nThe CenteringParenting intervention is designed to reduce negative health and developmental outcomes within a model of group routine child health care. This bundled intervention supports healthy parent-child interactions and early learning through education and experiential learning within a group well-child visit model. The intervention reduces social isolation and creates a community of support for caregivers, as well as utilizes a positive parenting approach to empowering parents with knowledge and skills to support optimal child development. The CenteringParenting intervention includes written materials provided at an annual clinical visit, as well as specific training for the facilitators/providers. To date, there is no research evidence of the benefits of the CenteringParenting intervention on school readiness, or improvements in parental behaviors that support optimal developmental milestones and achievement.\n\nStudy Design: A multi-site, cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of the CenteringParenting clinical intervention on kindergarten readiness, as measured by expressive and receptive language and vocabulary at 24 months of age.\n\nObjective Hypothesis: Compared to those receiving standard routine health care, the CenteringParenting intervention will result in improved language development at age 2 years and increased parental behaviors to encourage reading, talking and playing.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, assess the effectiveness and implementation of the CenteringParenting intervention. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the fidelity of the implementation of the CenteringParenting intervention. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate caregivers' experience and engagement with the CenteringParenting intervention model and explore the relation between degree of engagement and development stimulating behaviors.\n\nPrimary outcomes are: expressive and receptive language and vocabulary based on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) and Preschool Language Scale-5 (PLS-5) 5th Edition Parent Questionnaire. The secondary outcome is: parental behavior based on the Stim-Q (a reliable and valid measure of cognitive stimulation provided in the home)."
