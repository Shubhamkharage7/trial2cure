The incorporation of clinical decision support technology will be utilized to identify tailored opportunities for each CV risk reduction based on guideline recommendations for individual patients. Clinicians will be presented prompts with patient-specific recommendation(s) for further optimization of cardioprotective agents. These prompts will be conveyed by a Study Coordinator to responsible clinicians. The follow-up clinical prompts will be based on auditing of updated clinical parameters and medication use.",
