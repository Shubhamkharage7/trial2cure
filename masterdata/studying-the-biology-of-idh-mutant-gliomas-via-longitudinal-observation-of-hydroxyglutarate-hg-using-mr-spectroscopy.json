            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nGlioma is a type of brain cancer. Some of these tumors have gene mutations. These mutations can cause a substance called 2-HG to build up in the brain. This makes the tumors more aggressive. Researchers want to better understand 2-HG buildup in the brain. They hope this can help them design better ways to test for gliomas.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo monitor the level of 2-HG in the brains of people with gliomas that have mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 18 and older with gliomas with mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical and cancer history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nReviews of their symptoms and ability to perform normal activities\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nMRI scan\n\nSamples of their tumor from a past surgery\n\nDocumentation of their diagnosis and mutation status\n\nParticipants will have an initial evaluation. This will include repeats of screening tests. It will also include:\n\nNeurological exam\n\nMRS and MRI scans of the brain: Participants will lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. A coil or soft padding will be placed around their head. They will have a contrast agent injected into a vein. Pictures will be taken of the brain.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up visits every 2-6 month for the rest of their life. Visits will include scans.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor. Genes coding for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), a metabolic enzyme, are frequently mutated in gliomas, particularly lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). IDH mutation causes a unique tumor biology, including the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite, which in turn causes genomic hypermethylation and tumorigenesis.\n* Despite having a better prognosis compared to their IDH WT counterparts, IDH-mutant LGGs undergo a slow but unremitting higher-grade transformation (HT) and eventually become high grade gliomas (HGGs). A subset of patients with transformed HGGs develop a hypermutator phenotype (HMP), possibly related to previous treatment with alkylating agents and radiotherapy. The timeline for the development of HT and HMP is unpredictable and there is no known way to prevent them from happening, largely due to a lack of understanding their biological mechanisms and lack of a non-invasive approach for potential early detection.\n* Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain can detect 2-HG in a tumor harboring IDH mutation. There has been an increased interest in using quantitative 2-HG by MRS as a biomarker for IDH-mutant gliomas. This clinical study will allow a longitudinal monitoring of quantitative 2-HG by MRS in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas. We hypothesize that a significant increase in 2HG level is correlated with HT and/or HMP. The change in 2-HG level in conjunction with evaluation of tumor cellularity and other metabolite markers such as choline, creatinine and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) will likely to provide insights into metabolic alterations that may correlate with HT/HMP and potentially provide the predictive biomarker for early detection of HT.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To monitor the quantitative levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) longitudinally in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas via proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).\n\nEligibility:\n\n* IDH 1 or 2 mutation confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n* Age greater than or equal to18 years, KPS greater than or equal to 60%\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is prospective observational study. We will recruit at least 250 eligible patients in the next 5 years.\n* The relationship between the occurrence of HT and the changes in 2-HG level using the proportional hazard model."
