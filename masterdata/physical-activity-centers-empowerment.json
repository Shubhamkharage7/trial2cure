Seventy-two subjects will be recruited to conduct a pilot two-group, randomized repeated measures study.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research is to improve the quality of life for underserved cancer survivors by increasing physical activity. A physical activity intervention will be tested for feasibility with African American cancer survivors. The project will serve as a foundation for intervening with other underserved cancer survivors.\n\nFeasibility will be measured as intervention Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance, following the RE-AIM framework. Survey and biomarker data will be collected at baseline, 3 and 9 months later. These time points will facilitate exploration of changes pre- and post-intervention, and to determine if effects are maintained 6 months after completing the intervention. Our primary hypothesis is that the intervention will be feasible to deliver."
