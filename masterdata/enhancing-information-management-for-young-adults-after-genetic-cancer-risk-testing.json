The platform will give patients and their clinicians access to continuously updated information about both pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS).\n\nThe name of the intervention used in this research study is:\n\nNest portal (electronic platform for patients and clinicians)",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of the electronic platform Nest is to help patients understand and manage genetic test results and recommended care and to help clinicians with access to results and recommendations, facilitating orders, and documentation. The portal has two parts, one for participants and one for clinicians.\n\nFor the first phase of the study, participants will give their feedback on the Nest portal's content and processes that will guide refinement of the portal. The Pilot phase will test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.\n\nThe research study procedures include a baseline survey, using the portal after receiving a brief orientation from the study team, a follow-up survey, and then a 30-minute interview.\n\nParticipants will be in this research study for up to 2 hours.\n\nIt is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe electronic platform is being developed by Nest Genomics."
