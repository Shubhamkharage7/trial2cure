Individuals currently completing rehabilitation programs and individuals from the community who meet study criteria are invited to participate. After consenting and enrolling in the study, participants complete 2 study sessions: a baseline session, and a follow-up session either at time of completion of rehabilitation program or 3 months later if not in a rehabilitation program. During the study sessions, participants will complete paper-and-pencil and computerized tests of cognition (including metacognitive tasks)."
