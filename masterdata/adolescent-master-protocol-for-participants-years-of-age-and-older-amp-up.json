A group of uninfected perinatally-exposed young adults from a similar sociodemographic background and age distribution will be enrolled for comparison.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are:\n\n* To identify infectious and non-infectious complications of HIV disease and toxicities resulting from long-term ART, including disease progression, immune dysfunction, viral resistance, end-organ disease, and mortality.\n* To define the impact of HIV infection and ART on the long-term clinical outcomes of young adults, including:\n\n  * Metabolic abnormalities and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including glucose and lipid metabolism, blood pressure, and body composition.\n  * Sexually transmitted infections (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital warts and HSV) among males and females, and cervical HPV-associated pre-cancers and cancers and Mycoplasma genitalium and other vaginal microbiota among females.\n  * Reproductive health, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes including mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n* To define the impact of perinatal HIV infection, its concomitant risk factors and ART on long-term neurocognitive and behavioral health outcomes, including:\n\n  * Mental health and neurocognitive functioning.\n  * Health care behaviors, including adherence to ART, participation in health care services, and transition to adult clinical care.\n  * Risk behaviors, including sexual behavior and substance use.\n  * Independent living skills, and vocational and education achievement necessary for successful transition to adult functioning and quality of life."
