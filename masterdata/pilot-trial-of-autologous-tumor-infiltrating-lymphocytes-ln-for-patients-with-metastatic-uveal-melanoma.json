Transient use of steroids, e.g. in the perioperative period, is not an exclusion.\n* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Patients who have active medical illness(es) that would pose increased risk for study participation, including: active systemic infections requiring systemic ABX, coagulation disorders, or other active major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, or immune systems.\n* Patients who have received a live or attenuated vaccination within 28 days prior to the start of NMA-LD pre-conditioning regimen.\n* Patients who have any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as severe combined immunodeficiency disease \\[SCID\\] and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \\[AIDS\\]).\n* Patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\<45% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification \\> Class 1.\n\n  * Patients \u2265 60 years of age and who have a history of ischemic heart disease, chest pain, or clinically significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias must have a cardiac stress test.\n  * Patients with any irreversible wall movement abnormalities are excluded.\n* Patients who have a smoking history or signs or symptoms of obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease and have a documented forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of \u2264 60% of predicted normal:\n\n  * If a patient is not able to perform reliable spirometry due to abnormal upper airway anatomy (i.e., tracheostomy), a 6-minute walk test may be used to assess pulmonary function.\n  * Patients who are unable to walk a distance of at least 80% predicted for age and sex or demonstrates evidence of hypoxia at any point during the test (SpO2 \\< 90%) are excluded.\n* Patients who have had another primary malignancy within the previous three (3) years (with the exception of carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervix, or bladder; localized prostate cancer; and non-melanoma skin cancer that has been adequately treated).\n* Active, uncontrolled systemic infections, including COVID-19, within 30 days of surgery or NMA-LD. An uncomplicated bacterial UTI treated successfully with symptom resolution is not an exclusion.\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product within 21 days of the initiation of NMA-LD.\n\nEligibility Designation for Lymphodepletion\n\nPatients meeting eligibility criteria above between Day -21 and Day -8 prior to the planned initiation of lifileucel will be enrolled to the therapeutic portion of the protocol.\n\nAll patients' eligibility criteria, including repeating cardiopulmonary function tests as necessary, will be reassessed within several days prior to the scheduled lymphodepletion in all cases.\n\nPrior to beginning the NMA-LD preparative regimen the following requirements must be met:\n\n* Patients must meet all eligibility criteria at the time of NMA-LD.\n* Full resolution of any active infection should be documented\n* Critical evaluation of changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, coagulopathy, or immune problems and other major illnesses that may have developed or worsened must be documented\n* Patients with symptomatic, recurrent, pleural effusions that require drainage should not proceed to lymphodepletion without prior placement of a temporary in-dwelling pleural drain\n* All active medical issues must be addressed by Investigator or designee. Re-evaluation with additional imaging or testing may be required\n\nSubsequent delays of lymphodepletion up to 14 days due to logistical issues such as production of lifileucel and/or major weather events will not constitute protocol violations and out of window assessments will not need to be repeated unless there is a change in clinical status.",
