            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to develop a standardized assessment for patients treated for venous malformations (VM).\n\nVenous malformations result from the abnormal development of veins which may result in pain, swelling, bleeding, functional impairment, disfigurement, and psychological distress. The impact of VM on patient quality of life varies based on the location and size of the malformation.\n\nA patient reported outcome (PRO) is a patient's own account of patient's health condition. PRO measures are valued to clinicians, as many treatment effects are known only to the patient. No studies to date have analyzed the validity of existing PRO measures for VM patients.\n\nCurrent assessment does not include all symptoms or take in to account the relevance of VM location. Past studies show a discrepancy between treatment outcomes reported by patients and physicians. Therefore, there is a need to develop VM-specific PROs to better understand the effectiveness and benefits of treatment for VM."
