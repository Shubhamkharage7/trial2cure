            "briefSummary": "Women over the age of 60 years have an estimated 10 to 15 % risk of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). This is believed to be due to hormonally induced changes in the vaginal flora associated with menopause. After menopause, there is a chemical changes in the vagina that may predispose to bacterial infections.\n\nThe role of vaginal estrogen creams to restore vaginal atrophy and prevent urinary tract infections has been well characterized. Vaginal testosterone (VT) application use in postmenopausal breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors have been shown to improve vaginal pH, vaginal atrophy symptom scores, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness. Although testosterone has been used to improve sexual function in postmenopausal women, the effects of VT on vaginal flora and recurrent UTIs are unknown.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether topically applied vaginal testosterone cream is more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections and to ascertain the effects of topical estrogen on the vaginal pH and flora.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nWomen over the age of 60 years have an estimated 10 to 15 % risk of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). This is believed to be due to hormonally induced changes in the vaginal flora associated with menopause. After menopause, there is a chemical changes in the vagina that may predispose to bacterial infections.\n\nThe role of vaginal estrogen creams to restore vaginal atrophy and prevent urinary tract infections has been well characterized. Vaginal testosterone (VT) application use in postmenopausal breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors have been shown to improve vaginal pH, vaginal atrophy symptom scores, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness. Although testosterone has been used to improve sexual function in postmenopausal women, the effects of VT on vaginal flora and recurrent UTIs are unknown.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether topically applied vaginal testosterone cream is more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections and to ascertain the effects of topical estrogen on the vaginal pH and flora.\n\nMethods:\n\nThis will be a multi-center randomized, double- blind placebo-controlled study. Participating clinic sites include Maimonides Medical Center and Northwell Health. Subjects will be one hundred postmenopausal women presenting to a gynecology, urogynecology or female urology clinic with a history of three or more microbiologically confirmed symptomatic episodes of urinary tract infection during the either the previous year or two or more within six months.\n\nPatients will randomly assigned to one of two regimens: one group will receive VT cream to be used once each night for two weeks followed by twice-weekly applications for eight months, and the other group will receive a placebo cream to be used in the same manner. Demographic data, vaginal exam including vaginal swab to assess vaginal flora, vaginal pH measurement and vaginal atrophy index measurement will be collected at the initial study visit, again at a study visit at 4.5 months and another at 9 months.\n\nAnticipated Results and Conclusion:\n\nIt is anticipated that vaginal testosterone cream will reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women when compared to placebo. It is expected that vaginal testosterone will improve vaginal atrophy and flora, thus, decreasing the frequency of urinary tract infections. Future aims of the study will focus on immune-dynamics associated with vaginal testosterone administration."
