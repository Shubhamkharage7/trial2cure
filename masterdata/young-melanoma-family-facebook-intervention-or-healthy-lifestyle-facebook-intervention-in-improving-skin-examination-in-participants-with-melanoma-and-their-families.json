Young Melanoma Family Facebook intervention or Healthy Lifestyle Facebook intervention may help improve total cutaneous examinations, skin self-examinations, and sun protection among first degree relatives of young onset participants and the participants themselves.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To examine the efficacy of the Young Melanoma Family Facebook intervention versus the Healthy Lifestyle Facebook intervention on total cutaneous exam (primary outcome), skin self-exam frequency and comprehensiveness, and sun protection practices (secondary outcomes) of first degree relatives (FDRs) of young melanoma survivors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To examine the efficacy of the Young Melanoma Family Facebook intervention on patients? skin self-exam frequency and comprehensiveness and sun protection habits.\n\nII. To examine the mechanisms of intervention efficacy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPHASE I: Researchers refine content for the Facebook intervention condition and conduct usability testing.\n\nPHASE II: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants join a secret Young Melanoma Family Facebook Group and view post messages focusing on skin cancer for 12 weeks.\n\nARM II: Participants join a secret Healthy Lifestyle Facebook Group and view post messages focusing on healthy lifestyle for 12 weeks.\n\nPHASE III: Dissemination planning.\n\nAfter completion of study, participants are followed up at 6 months."
