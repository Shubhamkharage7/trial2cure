            "detailedDescription": "The International PNH Interest Group (IPIG) PNH Registry is an international, observational database collecting real-world health information about PNH patients over time. The registry is owned and managed by IPIG, a not-for-profit network of international PNH experts dedicated to improving care and treatment for PNH patients. Several pharmaceutical partners are collaborating with IPIG to fund the registry, which will provide data to support their post-approval regulatory commitments.\n\nThe IPIG PNH Registry aims to collect data about all PNH patients including clinical outcomes, patient reported outcomes and health resource usage, as well as long term safety data for patients treated with anti-complement therapies.\n\nThe IPIG PNH Registry is comprised of a 'core' PNH disease registry collecting a defined set of core variables on all patients with PNH. In addition, there are several product-specific 'silos' initiated by marketing authorization holders including patients treated with PNH-specific therapies. The silos collect both the core dataset and additional variables to address specific objectives or requests from regulatory authorities (e.g. post-authorization safety data).\n\nData is collected at enrollment and at 6 monthly intervals during follow-up.\n\nThis clinical trial information was submitted voluntarily under the applicable law and, therefore, certain submission deadlines may not apply. (That is, clinical trial information for this applicable clinical trial was submitted under section 402(j)(4)(A) of the Public Health Service Act and 42 CFR 11.60 and is not subject to the deadlines established by sections 402(j)(2) and (3) of the Public Health Service Act or 42 CFR 11.24 and 11.44)."
