The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Do these treatments reduce PTSD symptoms in LGBTQIA+ patients?\n* Do these treatments help improve quality of life and reduce depression in LGBTQIA+ patients?\n* Do stress from stigma and discrimination and drug/alcohol use change the impact of the treatment on PTSD symptoms?\n* Are LGBTQIA+ patients satisfied with these treatments? Do these treatments work differently among different groups within the LGBTQIA+ community?\n* Do LGBTQIA+ patients complete these treatments?\n\nStudy participants will receive one of these two PTSD treatments. Participants will complete assessments before and after receiving treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will compare two PTSD treatments that are known to work: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and STAIR Narrative Therapy (SNT). PTSD treatments have not been tested among LGBTQIA+ people. The study is trying to learn which treatment(s) work the best for LGBTQIA+ people in real world settings. This study will help guide clinical decision-making and the selection of PTSD treatment by health care organizations, clinicians, and patients based on what works best for LGBTQIA+ people.\n\nThe study will investigate which treatments work better in reducing PTSD symptoms among LGBTQIA+ people. The study will identify if minority stress (e.g., experiences of stigma and discrimination) and use of drugs or alcohol will moderate the effects of the interventions on PTSD symptoms. This study is investigating if both treatments improve depression symptoms and improve quality of life, and which treatments patients complete. The study is also examining if these treatments are effective for all individuals in the study, and if the effects of treatment are different among: 1) cisgender sexual minority men, cisgender sexual minority women, gender expansive or non-binary individuals, transgender women, transgender men, 2) participants who live in urban versus rural or suburban areas, and 3) racial and ethnic minority LGBTQIA+ participants."
