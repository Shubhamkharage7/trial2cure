The study will test an intervention called I-TRANSFER-HF, which differs from usual care by combining early home health nurse visits and outpatient medical appointments.\n\nThe study is interested in two questions:\n\n1. Is I-TRANSFER-HF better than usual care at preventing heart failure patients from returning to the hospital within 30 days?\n2. Are there parts of I-TRANSFER-HF that are easy or hard to implement in the real world?\n\nThe researchers will answer these questions by testing the intervention among pairs of hospitals and home health agencies across the country. During the study, the hospital-agency pairs will be asked to implement I-TRANSFER-HF. The researchers will then compare the results from before and after I-TRANSFER-HF was adopted. They will also interview people from these hospitals and agencies to see how I-TRANSFER-HF is being implemented under real-world conditions."
