Investigators will study participants with dipping and non-dipping hypertension. All participants will partake in all experiments. First, investigators will assess sleep in the participants' home environment using unattended polysomnography. Participants will then complete a 5-day overnight forced desynchrony laboratory protocol to uncover circadian rhythms (Constant Routine). The second experiment is a randomized crossover protocol. Two trials (Overnight Sleep and Rested Wakefulness) will be completed in randomized order to separate the effects of sleep on non-dipping blood pressure while assessing nighttime cardiovascular mechanisms. Finally, investigators will pilot test if 2 weeks of sleep regularization impacts 24-hour BP."
