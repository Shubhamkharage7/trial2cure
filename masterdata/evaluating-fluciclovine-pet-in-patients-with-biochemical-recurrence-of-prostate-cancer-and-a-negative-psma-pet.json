To evaluate the detection rate of local recurrence of prostate cancer on Fluciclovine PET in patients with BCR and a negative or equivocal PSMA PET obtained within 30 days prior to the Fluciclovine PET.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the correct localization rate of Fluciclovine PET in patients with positive scans.\n\nII. To distinguish the detection rate by site of recurrence (local recurrence in the prostate bed, lymph node involvement, or distant metastatic disease), and stratify by PSA level at the time of the scan and tumor grade\n\nIII. To evaluate the change in management based on the results of Fluciclovine PET, relative to intended management based on the result of negative PSMA PET alone, prior to obtaining the Fluciclovine PET.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients will be imaged with Fluciclovine PET within 30 days of the negative or equivocal PSMA scan.\n\nA short questionnaire inquiring about the intended management will be sent to the referring physician at two timepoints: 1) the first is at the time of screening, prior to the Fluciclovine PET; and 2) the second is after the availability of the results of Fluciclovine PET.\n\nChange in intended management will be recorded. Participants will be followed for 6 months and will be managed by their treating physician as per standard-of-care."
