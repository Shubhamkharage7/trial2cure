            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of venetoclax and how well it works when given with combination chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, cytarabine, filgrastim and idarubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving venetoclax together with combination chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose MTD of the combination of fludarabine, cytarabine, filgrastim (GCSF), idarubicin (FLAG-IDA) + venetoclax for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Phase 1b).\n\nII. To determine the overall activity of this combination in patients newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory (AML) (Phase 2).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the preliminary assessment of efficacy by response to revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria and time to response variables including overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR).\n\nII. Determine biomarkers that may be predictive of venetoclax activity.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.\n\nINDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-14, fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 2-6, cytarabine IV over 4 hours on days 2-6, idarubicin IV over 15-30 minutes on days 4 and 5, filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7, or pegfilgrastim SC after day 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive venetoclax PO on days 1-7, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 2-4, cytarabine IV over 4 hours on days 2-4, filgrastim SC on days 1-7, or pegfilgrastim SC after days 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may also receive idarubicin as in Induction Therapy during 1 cycle of Consolidation Therapy per the treating physician.\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive venetoclax PO on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days."
