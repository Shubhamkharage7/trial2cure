Participants with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by any of the investigational products may be included (eg, hearing loss) after consultation with the PI.\n5. History of primary immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation, or previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n6. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational products\n7. Major surgery (as defined by the investigator) within 4 weeks prior to first dose of treatment or if still recovering from prior surgery. Biopsy as per study protocol is allowed\n8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring Aes from the study agents, or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent.\n9. Participants with cognitive impairment, including adults with cognitive impairment such as trisomy 21 or similar conditions are not specifically excluded from participation, such that appropriate written informed consent is obtained from the parent or legal guardian and they are able to complete with the study protocol requirements and treatment.\n10.
