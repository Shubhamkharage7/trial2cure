Total energy and nutrient intake is estimated by summing intakes from each food based on the selected portion size, reported frequency of consumption, and nutrient content of each food item. Anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory dietary patterns are calculated using the energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (DII) score to represent the inflammatory potential of an individual's overall diet, using data from FFQ responses. Higher DII scores represent more pro-inflammatory diets while lower (i.e., more negative) DII scores represent more anti-inflammatory diet.",
