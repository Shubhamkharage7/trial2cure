            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about treatment for people with B-cell lymphoma that did not respond to treatment or that has gotten worse after treatment. The aim of this trial is to answer the following questions:\n\n* If it is realistic to give people radiation treatment before they receive a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment for their cancer\n* If it is safe to give people radiation treatment before they receive a CAR T-cell treatment for their cancer",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of low-dose radiation therapy in the bridging period between chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell collection, manufacturing, and infusion (vein-to-vein) in patients with relapsed and refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.\n\nEmerging cellular immunotherapies including CAR T-cell therapy have produced remarkable outcomes for this population. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) for the management of people with relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma. Unfortunately, many patients undergoing liso-cel infusion will suffer progression or relapse with devastating consequences. The object of this study is to identify a novel means to enhance liso-cel activity to improve overall outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of radiation therapy targeting selected sites as bridging therapy prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy and liso-cel infusion will be effective at improving responses for patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma.\n\nResults from this study will provide key justification to expand this therapeutic approach into a larger phase II clinical trial powered to examine the efficacy of this approach."
