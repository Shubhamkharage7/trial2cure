            "briefSummary": "This is study is comprised of three approaches. First, the investigators will conduct a retrospective cohort study to determine factors associated with COVID-19 severity and complications and understand COVID-19 outcomes, including all-cause mortality, post-discharge events, and impacts of rehabilitation services (third aim). The second aim is a mixed-method study and follows COVID-19 patients with repeated surveys to determine patient-reported functional outcomes, health recovery, and rehabilitation needs after COVID-19. The investigators will recruit patients and their informal caregivers for interviews to assess their function and rehabilitation needs.",
            "detailedDescription": "The long-term consequences of COVID 19 are not well understood, particularly in the Veteran population. This study will describe and quantify the long-term consequences of COVID-19, including impairment in physical and psychosocial function and health-related quality of life. Additionally, it will determine the impact of chronic lung disease (CLD) and other comorbidities on severity and recovery after COVID-19 infection and the association of social determinants of health with severity and recovery.\n\nInitially, a retrospective national cohort of VA patients who test positive with SARS2 will be identified. Baseline clinical history will be analyzed with outcomes that include severity of COVID 19, all-cause mortality, and post-discharge events.\n\nSubsequently, a mixed methods, prospective cohort study will include both qualitative (interview) and quantitative components (surveys). The investigators will identify patients with COVID-19 and recruited for qualitative interviews following hospital discharge or diagnosis. Patient caregivers will also be eligible to participate in study interviews. Interviews will occur once at various times ranging 2 weeks to 1 year since a patient's COVID-19 diagnosis. Surveys will be completed at 3 time points, 2-8 weeks after diagnosis or discharge to home, and then 6 months and 12 months later. Surveys will include the EQ-5D-5L profile for health-related quality of life, and the WHODAS 2.0 score for a global assessment of overall physical and psychosocial function. Investigators will also identify a comparator cohort of patients who have been diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in the setting of a negative COVID-19 test. Surveys will be administered at the same interval and analysis will determine if COVID-19 has different and more severe health impacts than other causes of lower respiratory tract infection."
