            "briefSummary": "The aim of this study is to investigate the modulation effects of Baduanjin (BDJ), a simple and innovative mind-body exercise, on cognitive function, resting state functional connectivity, and brain morphometry in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The results obtained will provide novel insights for improving the prevention of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported perception of memory or cognitive problems, is receiving increasing attention as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since SCD manifests before the onset of clinical impairment, it might be the optimal stage/window of time at which to intervene with preventative therapies for AD and age-related dementia before the progressive neurological loss and irreversible cognitive impairment.\n\nRecently, mind-body interventions have demonstrated their potential in preventing cognitive decline. Nevertheless, these mind-body therapies encompass a family of complex practices, each with different characteristics and focus. Therefore, they may be associated with different mechanisms and treatment effects. Baduanjin (BDJ) is an innovative and simple mind-body exercise consisting of eight simple movements that can be easily practiced at home with video guidance, thereby making it a more suitable option for older adults with cognitive decline than other more complex exercises.\n\nWe believe that this study will 1) significantly improve the prevention of MCI and AD and directly benefit patients suffering from these highly prevalent disorders, 2) enhance the investigators' understandings of the neurobiology through which mind-body interventions affect cognition and health, and 3) advance the investigators' understandings of the pathophysiology and development of SCD, AD, and age-related dementia."
