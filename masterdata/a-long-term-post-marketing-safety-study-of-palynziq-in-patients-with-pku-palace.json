Subjects for whom a clinical decision has been made that they will receive pegvaliase to treat their PKU within 30 days following the date of enrollment (incident-users) or have previously started treatment with pegvaliase at the date of enrollment (prevalent-users) are eligible for participation in this study.",

Once the subject has been enrolled, the investigator (ie, subject's primary physician) will be asked to provide information about the subject's medical history, treatment(s) received to manage their blood Phe levels, treatment with pegvaliase, and concomitant medication use. The investigator will also be asked to provide evaluation of the following safety concerns: Acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction, Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Serum sickness, Severe hypersensitivity reaction, Severe or Persistent arthralgia, Severe injection site reaction, Hypophenylalaninemia and other protocol-defined safety events, following the initiation of pegvaliase therapy. There are no protocol-mandated visits or procedures associated with this study. Enrolled subjects should be followed per routine clinical practice at the institution based upon their diagnosis, with clinical outcomes assessed at regular intervals (typically every month during the induction and titration phases of pegvaliase treatment and every 6 months once the maintenance phase is reached). No experimental treatment or assessments are planned as part of this observational study. An Independent Adjudication Committee (IAC) will periodically review protocol-defined safety events, including Acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction and Serum sickness."
