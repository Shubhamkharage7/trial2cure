This new treatment, in the form of online yoga videos, may be more preferred for some patients and allow for higher compliance with home exercises aimed at treating anterior knee pain.",
            "detailedDescription": "Adolescent atraumatic anterior knee pain is a common yet cumbersome diagnosis that is currently managed with home exercises and physical therapy. The goal of this project is to test the compliance and efficacy of an alternative treatment in the form of yoga available in an online video format. This study will help further the treatment understanding of one of the most common patient clinical presentations, atraumatic anterior knee pain in adolescents. This is a cumbersome patient presentation that is frustrating for both the patient and treating team in that there is no concrete treatment algorithm that works for everyone. Online yoga videos may be more preferred for some patients and allow for higher compliance with home exercises aimed at treating anterior knee pain. With this study, the investigators hope to ensure that the yoga videos provide equal, or more, pain relief and flexibility at the completion of the program.\n\nIt is hypothesized that patients completing the yoga program will have equivalent or greater flexibility, compliance, and pain relief when compared with current treatment recommendations for anterior knee pain.\n\nThis study aims to assess the success of a video-based eight-week home yoga program at improving compliance, increasing flexibility and functionality of knee movements. Compliance will be tracked through recorded access to the specific YouTube videos hosted through the CTPO YouTube Channel. Anterior knee pain patients will be given a link to two yoga videos and will be asked to do them at home, or wherever convenient for 8 weeks, 3-4 times a week."
