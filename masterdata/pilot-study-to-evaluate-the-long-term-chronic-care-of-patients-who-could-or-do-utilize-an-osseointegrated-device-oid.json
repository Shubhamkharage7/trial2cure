We will also evaluate the long-term effects of OID use on secondary outcomes measures (hearing performance, quality-of-life, social interaction, communication, physical functioning, etc)",
            "detailedDescription": "Hearing impairment is highly prevalent and independently associated with cognitive decline. Little is known about the various types, degrees, and configurations of hearing loss and how it relates to uptake of a hearing intervention and possible long-term benefits of using the intervention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the comparative effectiveness within an observational study design to determine the long-term effects of hearing intervention, in the form of osseointegrated devices (OID), among patients with either conductive, mixed, or single-sided hearing loss. Participants will be followed for 3 years (36 months) to answer the following aims:\n\nAim 1: To compare the effect of OID intervention versus no audiological intervention on rates of decline in global cognitive function (primary outcome measure) in 18-85 year-old well-functioning and cognitively-normal older adults with hearing loss. We hypothesize that there will be a significant difference in cognitive function between patients that utilized OID hearing intervention compared to no audiological intervention.\n\nSecondary Aims: To compare the effect of OID intervention on secondary outcomes of hearing, social, mental, physical, and cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that there are significant differences in secondary outcomes between patients that utilized OID hearing intervention compared to no audiological intervention."

It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. The SF-36 is the most widely-used health survey throughout the world because it is both brief and comprehensive, readily available, psychometrically-sound, and of proven usefulness in measuring health status and monitoring health outcomes. Eight domains of health can be estimated from the SF-36 (physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, general mental health perception, role limitations due to emotional problems, emotional well-being, general health perception). Each domain is evaluated on a range of 0 (worst) to 100 (best) with a global median of 50.",
