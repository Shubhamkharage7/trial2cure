Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses are coded as single-digit numbers expressing the severity level selected in each dimension. For instance, 'slight problems' (e.g. 'I have slight problems in walking about') is always coded as '2'. The digits for the five dimensions are combined in a 5-digit code. The EQ- 5D-5L index value is derived by using the vendor supplied calculator to convert each 5-digit EQ- 5D-5L profile.\n\nThe EQ VAS corresponds to a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale ranging from 'the best health you can imagine' to 'the worst health you can imagine'.\n\nA higher number is a better outcome.",
