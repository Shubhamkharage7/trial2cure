            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved azacitidine and venetoclax as a treatment option for AML. However, the combination of these two drugs with SL-401 has not been FDA approved.\n\nThe combination of SL-401, azacitidine and venetoclax has not been FDA approved for BPDCN. However, SL-401 has been FDA approved for BPDCN.\n\nThe combination of SL-401 and azacitidine has not been FDA approved for BPDCN.\n\nIn this research study, the study drug SL-401 will be combined with the standard dose of azacitidine (for MDS patients) or azacitidine/venetoclax (for AML and BPDCN patients). The goal of this research study is to try and determine the safest, highest dose of study drug, SL-401, in combination with azacitidine or azacitidine/venetoclax that can be given to patients with AML, BPDCN or high-risk MDS. SL-401 works by stopping or slowing the growth of cancer stem cells, which are the undeveloped cells which can develop into cancer cells. The goals of this research study are to look at if this combination works to help treat your cancer and if there is any lasting effect of this combination. This study will also look at how the SL-401, in combination with azacitidine or azacitidine/venetoclax, affects certain proteins in your blood and bone marrow. SL-401 has been given to patients with AML, and MDS in the past, but this is the first time it will be given in combination with another drug."
