Preliminarily data will be derived for the primary endpoint target lesion revascularization to enable future planning of larger comparative effectiveness research.\n\nSecondary objectives of the study are to document procedural success following the use of IVL in common femoral lesions, disease stage change, as well as disease-specific health status in the real-world."
