The investigators are also evaluating, within those with MCI, whether the hearing tests are associated with neurocognitive functioning. The investigators are interested in learning whether changes in cognition in those with MCI can be detected using tests of how the brain processes sound. The investigators hypothesize that participants with MCI will score worse on both hearing tests and neurocognitive tests than participants without MCI. Participants are asked to complete multiple types of hearing tests, take a series of neurocognitive tests, and complete a few questionnaires."
