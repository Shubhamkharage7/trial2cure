RCTs of AF screening in the general population have shown that screening can effectively detect AF earlier, and helps to identify candidates for appropriate anticoagulation that may lead to improvement in clinical outcomes.",

Screening will be done at a single time point. Patients randomized to screening will undergo a 30-second ECG using the Kardia Mobile device (AliveCor Inc, Cupertino, CA) paired with an iPad (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Patients randomized to usual care will not receive a screening ECG. Primary outcome will be detection of newly diagnosed AF by screening vs usual care."
