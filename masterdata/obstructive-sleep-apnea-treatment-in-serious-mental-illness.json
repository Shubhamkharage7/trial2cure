            "briefSummary": "Serious mental illnesses (SMI) like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two of the most disabling and costly chronic illnesses worldwide. A high proportion of adults with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have sleep disorders, like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated compared to the general population. This study aims to examine feasibility, acceptance, and impact of OSA treatment and how it affects cognitive function in people with SMI.",
            "detailedDescription": "Sleep disturbances are central to many psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with clear implications for cognition, brain health, physical health and aging. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is typically underdiagnosed and undertreated due to impairment from psychiatric symptoms, limited resources, and stigma. In turn, consequences of untreated OSA in SMI are dire: in particular, worsening cardiometabolic health, cognitive decline, and death. Few studies have examined the impact of treatments for obstructive sleep apnea on cognitive problems in a high-risk group, such as older adults with SMI. The goals of the proposed study are to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment for OSA, and its impact on cognitive and cardiometabolic outcomes as well as biological processes over a 3-month period. In order to determine eligibility, participants will be asked to complete a diagnostic test either at home or overnight in-lab. If diagnosed with sleep apnea, the participant will be offered a 3-month treatment with an automatic PAP. In addition, eligible participants will complete weekly check-ins with study staff and a series of detailed interviews, physical and neuropsychological tests, instrumental and clinical assessments, and blood draws every month for a total of 3 months."

In the perceived risk category, individuals answer questions about their perceived vulnerability to health risks. In the outcome expectancies, individuals answer questions regarding the potential behavior to reduce those risks, and in the treatment self-efficacy, the participant rates the level of validity of the statements on a 4-point scale regarding their perceived ability to perform behavior. Each of the 3 categories has a 4-point ordinal scale (1= irrelevant, 4 = extremely relevant) ranging from very low to very high. The mean of the 3 subscales are calculated.
