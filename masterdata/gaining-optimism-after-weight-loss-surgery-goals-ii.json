The investigators will enroll and randomize 58 participants. Study participation includes attending four study visits (two at baseline, one at 10 weeks, and one at 24 weeks). Participants will be randomized either to a 10-week physical activity intervention that includes once-weekly phone calls, a written manual, and a Fitbit activity tracker, or provision of the Fitbit alone. Primary outcomes include the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in physical activity and other psychological, behavioral, and physiological outcomes at 10 and 24 weeks compared to the control."
