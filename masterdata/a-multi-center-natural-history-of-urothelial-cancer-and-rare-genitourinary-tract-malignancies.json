            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nTumors in the genitourinary tracts can occur in the kidney, bladder, prostate, and testicles and can have common and rare histologies. Some cancers that occur along the genitourinary (GU) tract are rare. Some GU tumors are so rare that they are not included in treatment studies or tissue banks. This makes it hard for researchers to determine standards of care. Researchers want to learn more about common and rare GU tumors.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about urinary tract cancers.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 18 and older with urinary tract or GU cancer such as bladder, kidney, testicular, prostate, penis, or neuroendocrine cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with questions about their medical history. Their medical records will be reviewed.\n\nParticipants will have a physical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will complete a survey about their family cancer history. Clinical photographs will be taken to document skin lesions.\n\nParticipants may have imaging scans of their chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have a contrast agent injected into their arm.\n\nParticipants will get recommendations about how to best manage and treat their cancer. They can ask as many questions as they would like.\n\nParticipants will provide existing tumor samples if available. They may have optional tumor biopsies up to twice a year. For needle biopsies, the biopsy area will be numbed and they will get a sedative. A needle will be inserted through their skin to collect a tumor sample. For skin biopsies, their skin will be numbed. A small circle of skin will be removed.\n\nSome blood and tumor samples may be used for genetic tests.\n\nParticipants will have frequent follow-up visits. If they cannot visit NIH, their home doctor will be contacted. They will be followed on this study for life....",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nRare histological variants of the genitourinary (GU) tract include bladder/urachal adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma; variants of urothelial carcinoma including plasmacytoid, sarcomatoid; renal tumors including sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma and renal medullary carcinoma; penile cancers; micropapillary, giant cell, lipid rich, clear cell and nested variants, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma and mixed patterns; small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate, testicular Sertoli or Leydig cell tumors, and papillary and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\n\nSome GU tumors occur so infrequently that they are not systematically captured by currently available registries, treatment protocols or tissue banks. The rarity of these tumors limits the sufficient numbers of patients needed in larger randomized clinical studies to characterize standard treatments or disease course.\n\nSystematic and longitudinal collection and annotation of clinical history, tissue samples, imaging studies, and other pertinent information in participants with these rare tumors will yield future knowledge and help with the development of subsequent prospective studies to optimize diagnosis and treatment paradigms for less common GU tumors.\n\nObjective:\n\nCharacterization of the natural history of urothelial and rare GU tract malignancies\n\nEligibility:\n\nParticipants \\>= 18 years of age diagnosed with urothelial or rare GU tract malignancies.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis will be a long-term multi-center study to comprehensively study participants with rare GU tumors\n\nMedical history will be collected and participants followed throughout the course of their illnesses, with particular attention to patterns of disease presentation, recurrence and progression, response to therapies, and duration of responses.\n\nTissue samples and blood will be obtained from participants during this study.\n\nA broad spectrum of scientific experiments, including genomics and immune monitoring will be performed.\n\nWe anticipate accruing 1000 participants on this protocol"
