            "detailedDescription": "In this project, the investigators aim to test the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) system as a standalone versus coach-assisted intervention with the goal of achieving reach and scalability. Aim 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UseIt! mHealth system as both a standalone and coach-assisted intervention compared to a control app condition. Aim 2 is to assess target (parent management training/cognitive behavioral therapy skill acquisition and use) engagement and validation. Aim 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the components of the UseIt! mHealth system. The investigators plan to recruit an anticipated total of 324 families for the study. Families will be randomly assigned to Group 1 (standalone app), Group 2 (coach-assisted), or Group 3 (control app condition). Parents will use the app for four months before the administration of the post-treatment assessment. Parents will be trained to use the UseIt! mHealth system over the phone. The coach for the Group 2 condition will be a bachelor's level paraprofessional with a degree in psychology or an allied discipline (e.g., social work) who will provide support to parents. The system is very user friendly and families can be trained in approximately 30 minutes. Assessments will take place at Baseline, Post (4 months from baseline), and 6-month follow-up. All assessments will be conducted online (Qualtrics survey links sent via email by research staff) and take approximately 1 hour to complete."
