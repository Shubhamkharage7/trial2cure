            "briefSummary": "This study will include patients with mature T-cell lymphoma (MTCL) that has been treated with at least one type of chemotherapy, but is not responding or coming back after the previous treatment.\n\nThis clinical trial uses a drug called Brentuximab Vedotin. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Brentuximab Vedotin for sale in the United States for certain diseases. Brentuximab is still being studied in clinical trials like this one to learn more about what its side effects are and whether or not it is effective in the disease or condition being studied.\n\nBrentuximab Vedotin is a type of drug called an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs usually have 2 parts; a part that targets cancer cells (the antibody) and a cell killing part (the chemotherapy). Antibodies are proteins that are part of your immune system. They can stick to and attack specific targets on cells. The antibody part of Brentuximab Vedotin sticks to a target called CD30. CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells (including non Hodgkin lymphoma) and some normal cells of the immune system. The cell killing part of Brentuximab Vedotin is a chemotherapy called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). It can kill cells that the antibody part of Brentuximab Vedotin sticks to. Brentuximab Vedotin has also been shown to kill cancer cells with levels of CD30 that cannot be seen by traditional methods.\n\nThis study is being done to test if the study drug has an effect on Mature T cell Lymphoma with such low levels of a target called CD30 and how your disease respond to the study drug.",
