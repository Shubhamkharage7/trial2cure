Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving radiation therapy with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if rituximab concurrently with radiation followed by maintenance rituximab offers a superior benefit over radiation alone. Specifically looking at the progression free survival.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy five days a week for 2.5 weeks (12 treatments) and receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours weekly with the start of radiation for 4 weeks and then every 2 months for up to 4 additional doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy five days a week for 2.5 weeks and then undergo observation.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months, every 6 months for 2 years, yearly for 3 years, and then every 2 years for 10 years."
