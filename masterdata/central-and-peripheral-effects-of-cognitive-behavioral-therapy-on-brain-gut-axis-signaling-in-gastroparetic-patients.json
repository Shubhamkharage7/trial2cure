            "briefSummary": "This is a single-center pilot study to be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital. The purpose of this study is to examine the non-pharmacological impact of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on gastroparesis symptoms and other clinical co-comorbidities such as pain, depression, anxiety, and catastrophizing. CBT trial patients will undergo careful phenotyping pre- and post- intervention with brain MRI, autonomic function test (AFT), gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES), and nutrient drink test (NDT) to determine the impact of CBT on these metrics in patients with gastroparesis. Characterization of these relationships or lack thereof can help guide future development of more targeted approaches and optimize treatment strategies for gastroparesis.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized, controlled trial will examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on gastroparesis symptoms (including pain related brain circuitry). CBT reduces pain intensity, negative affect, and disability among patients with chronic pain, though there is a good deal of individual variability in treatment effects. Treatment gains following CBT are maintained or enhanced at 6 to 12-month follow-up. This study will examine the brain circuitry underlying these effects. In addition, as measures of gastroparesis symptoms and pain are correlated with other, more general, measures of negative affect (e.g., depression, anxiety), we will evaluate the specificity of the hypothesized effects by running the proposed statistical models both with and without inclusion of these conceptually overlapping factors. Based on pervious findings and published data, we expect that treatment-associated changes in pain and depression will likely share 10-20% of their variance.\n\nTreatment sessions will use active, structured techniques to alter distorted thoughts, with a focus on acquiring and practicing cognitive and emotional modulatory skills. CBT is based on a pain self-management paradigm, and involves the identification and reduction of maladaptive pain-related cognitions (i.e., catastrophizing) using techniques such as relaxation, thought-stopping, distraction, etc. CBT prominently emphasizes in-vivo practice during each session, and features home practice using written exercises. In particular, cognitive restructuring is used to help patients recognize the relationships between thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Patients learn to identify, evaluate, and challenge negative thoughts. In our protocol, each of the 8 weekly sessions will last for approximately 90 minutes and will be conducted or supervised by a trained psychologist. Following CBT, negative emotions are no longer closely linked to pain, suggesting that CBT provides patients with the skills to modulate and buffer their negative emotions such as catastrophizing.\n\nSubjects will undergo pre- and post-treatment testing through a variety of methods including brain MRI with associated physiological data, autonomic function test (AFT), gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES), and nutrient drink test (NDT) to determine the impact of CBT on these metrics in patients with gastroparesis. Characterization of these relationships or lack thereof can help guide future development of more targeted approaches and optimize treatment strategies for gastroparesis."
