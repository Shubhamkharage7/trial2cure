            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot trial is to examine the preliminary effectiveness of MDMA-facilitated bCBCT for improving chronic PTSD and relationship functioning in a sample of veterans and their intimate partners seeking care within the VA San Diego Healthcare System.",
            "detailedDescription": "The pilot study is a single site, open-label study assessing the preliminary effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of MDMA-assisted therapy in combination with brief Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy in a sample of 8 veterans diagnosed with PTSD and their intimate partners (N = 16) within the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS). Therapy teams will deliver the 8 session bCBCT intervention combined with two full-day MDMA sessions for the Veteran diagnosed with PTSD. The veteran with PTSD will be given 80 mg of MDMA HCl with a 40 mg MDMA HCl supplemental dose in the first session and 100 mg of MDMA HCl with a supplemental dose of 40 mg MDMA HCl in the second. The intimate partner will be present for the MDMA sessions (unless they decline or it is clinically contraindicated) but will not receive MDMA. The couples will complete one preparatory session and at least two Emotion Focused Integrative sessions (five max). The PTSD+ veteran will receive telephone check-in calls every other business day for one week following each MDMA session. The first MDMA session occurs in the morning the business day after the preparatory session and the second MDMA session occurs in the morning within 5 business days after bCBCT Session 7. The Emotion-Focused Integrative Sessions take place the morning after each MDMA session. Outcomes examining PTSD symptom severity and relationship functioning will be evaluated for preliminary effectiveness. The study's screening, enrollment, and baseline phase lasts from pre-screen to baseline (approximately 12 weeks, +/- 2 weeks). The treatment period lasts from bCBCT Session 1 to bCBCT Session 8 (7 weeks + 6 weeks). The follow-up period lasts from the post-treatment assessment to study termination (24 weeks +/- 30 days)."

If able to become pregnant (i.e., assigned female at birth, fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile), must have a highly sensitive negative pregnancy test at study entry and prior to each Experimental MDMA Session, and must agree to use adequate birth control through 10 days after the last Experimental MDMA Session. Adequate birth control methods include intrauterine device (IUD), injected, implanted, intravaginal, or transdermal hormonal methods, abstinence, oral hormones plus a barrier contraception, vasectomized sole partner, or double barrier contraception. Two forms of contraception are required with any barrier method or oral hormones (i.e., condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermicide, oral hormonal contraceptives plus spermicide or condom).

Both partners agree to not begin a new form of mental healthcare during the screening or treatment phases of the trial, without first discussing with the PI in consultation with the study physician.\n\n    1. It is acceptable for participants to continue ongoing non-PTSD focused or non-couple-based mental healthcare, if it is not increased in frequency or specifically excluded by the study protocol.\n    2. All ongoing therapies should be documented by the site and discussed with the study physician prior to enrollment to avoid confounding treatment effects. In some instances, the study physician may request that the participant delay enrollment until their planned course of therapy is complete, and an integration period has elapsed.\n    3. Participants may continue with PTSD focused and/or couple-based mental health care during the screening period prior to Baseline and following treatment period prior to study termination if they have approval from the study PI and their study provider (as applicable).\n\n    Medical History - PTSD+ veteran only unless otherwise noted\n13. At Pre-Screening, have at least moderate PTSD symptoms in the last month based on PCL-5 total score of 40 or greater (index).\n14.

May have alcohol or substance use disorder if participant is not in withdrawal or requiring detox. Participants/couples must have a plan, agreed upon by investigator, therapy team, and study physician, to reduce use of alcohol or other substances and to manage symptoms without self-medicating. Enrollment will require that, in the judgment of the investigator, therapy team, and study physician, the plan for decreasing substance use is realistic and has a good chance of succeeding in order to prevent substance use from impacting the safety or effectiveness of the investigational treatment.

May have a history of or current Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2) if additional screening measures rule out underlying cardiovascular disease, if the condition is judged to be stable on effective management, and with approval by the study physician.\n19.

Any participant who is not able to agree or adhere to a plan to reduce use and manage symptoms will not be enrolled\n14. Present with current serious suicide risk, as determined through psychiatric interview, responses to C-SSRS (scores of four or greater), and clinical judgment of the investigator; however, history of suicide attempts is not an exclusion. Any participant who is likely to require hospitalization related to suicidal ideation and behavior, in the judgment of the investigator, will not be enrolled. Any participant presenting with the following on the pre-screen C-SSRS will be excluded:\n\n    1. Suicidal ideation score of 4 or greater within the last 6 months of the assessment at a frequency of once a week or more\n    2. Any suicidal behavior, including suicide attempts or preparatory acts, within the last 6 months of the assessment. Participants with non-suicidal self- injurious behavior may be included if approved by the study physician\n15.

This includes, but is not limited to, a history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or aneurysm. Participants with other mild, stable chronic medical problems may be enrolled if the study physician and PI agree the condition would not significantly increase the risk of MDMA administration or be likely to produce significant symptoms during the study that could interfere with study participation or be confused with side effects of the IMP. Examples of stable medical conditions that could be allowed include, but are not limited to Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), etc. Any medical disorder judged by the investigator to significantly increase the risk of MDMA administration by any mechanism would require exclusion.\n19.

Participants with a history of atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or any other arrhythmia associated with a bypass tract may be enrolled only if they have been successfully treated with ablation and have not had recurrent arrhythmia for at least one year off all antiarrhythmic drugs and confirmed by a cardiologist\n23.
