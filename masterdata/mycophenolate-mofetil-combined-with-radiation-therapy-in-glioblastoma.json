Eight participants in Phase 0 will receive MMF for one week before undergoing an already planned biopsy or re-resection (surgical removal) of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma (GBM/GS). A small portion of the tumor, removed as part of clinical care, will be used for testing in this study. Sixty additional participants will be enrolled in the Phase 1 component of the trial (30 with recurrent GBM/GS and 30 with newly diagnosed GBM/GS). The goal of the Phase 1 component is to find the dose of MMF that works best without causing severe side effects (the maximum tolerated dose) when combined with radiation in recurrent GBM/GS and with radiation and chemotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM/GS. Participants in Phase 0 who meet the eligibility criteria for the Phase 1 component may participate in both phases."
