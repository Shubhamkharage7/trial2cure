There is no investigational product injection during this study The exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate the anatomical characteristics of both anterolateral thighs in healthy adult and healthy pediatric populations (2 to 17 years old) by ultrasound scan before and while applying a force similar to the ZENEO\u00ae triggering force.\n\nIn the healthy adult population, anatomical characteristics of one shoulder (deltoid) and one upper arm (biceps and triceps) will also be evaluated by ultrasound scan before and while applying a force similar to ZENEO\u00ae triggering force.\n\nOnly ultrasound procedures will be performed using an investigational ultrasound system. All subjects will be asked to undergo 1 on site visit (Study Visit) during which the eligibility assessment and the ultrasound scans will be performed.",
