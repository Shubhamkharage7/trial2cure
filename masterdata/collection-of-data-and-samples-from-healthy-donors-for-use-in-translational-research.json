            "briefSummary": "Increased numbers of white blood cells called eosinophils can cause disease. To investigate this disease, researchers need blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, skin and/or bone marrow samples to compare to samples from patients with this problem. Some of the samples will be used for genetic testing or future research.\n\nThis study will last for about 10 years and will include a maximum of 50 paid volunteers ages 18 to 65.",
            "detailedDescription": "This protocol is designed to provide data and samples from paid volunteers for use in translational studies of eosinophilia and parasitic diseases. Donors meeting standard normal donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to undergo research procedures (infrared thermography and/or esophageal string test) and/or to donate blood, body fluid and/or tissue samples obtained using conventional techniques. The investigational nature of the studies in which their data and/or samples will be used, as well as the risks and benefits of the procedures, will be explained to all volunteers, and a signed informed consent document will be obtained. Volunteers will be compensated according to an established schedule based on the duration and discomfort of the donation. Samples provided through this protocol will be used solely for in vitro research and will be assigned a unique product number. The study investigators listed on this protocol will serve as the custodians of the code that links the product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the data and specimens collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol and will be described in general terms only, since it involves several IRB-approved LPD protocols. Because some of these protocols require normal controls without a history of asthma or allergic disease, all subjects will undergo a standardized allergy/asthma history at enrollment. Serum immunoglobulin levels and a basic RAST panel may be performed on sera from some normal donors, and some normal donors may be asked to undergo pulmonary function testing."

If warfarin or heparin was recently discontinued, a subject can be enrolled, but no bone marrow procedures will be performed until the PT is \\< 15.5 seconds and the PTT is within normal range. For other agents that interfere with blood clotting without prolonging the PT, a 7- day washout period will be required before bone marrow sampling, skin biopsy or lumbar puncture.\n\nAdditonal exclusion criteria (cerebrospinal fluid):\n\n-Previous diagnosis of central nervous system pathology (including tumors,\n\ninflammatory conditions, infection, seizure disorder, spina bifida)\n\n* History of spinal surgery with hardware placement\n* History of any spinal surgery or injections of the lumbosacral spine\n* Headache on the day of donation\n\nAdditonal exclusion criteria (skin biopsy):\n\n-History of keloid or abnormal scar formation",
