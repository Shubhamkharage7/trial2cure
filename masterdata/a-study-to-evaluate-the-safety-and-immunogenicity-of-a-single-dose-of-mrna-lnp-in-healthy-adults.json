            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 1, single-site, open-label, comparator-controlled dose escalating study of an intramuscularly (IM) administered mRNA-LNP vaccine encoding for (Vaccine Research Center) VRC H1ssF 3928 of up to 50 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 to 49 years, inclusive. This study is designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of one dose of H1ssF 3928 mRNA Vaccine. Eligible participants will be sequentially enrolled into dosing groups (10 mcg, 25 mcg, and 50 mcg, selected optimal dose) to receive the H1ssF 3928 mRNA Vaccine at the specified dose. A separate group of 10 participants will receive licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4). Subjects receiving IIV4 will be followed for safety but only their immune responses will be compared to those of participants receiving H1ssF 3928 mRNA Vaccine. Dosing of H1ssF 3928 mRNA Vaccine will commence at the lowest dose (10 mcg) and only escalate to the next highest dose if safety concerns are not identified. Up to ten subjects will be enrolled per dosing cohort. Reactogenicity and adverse event (AE) information through Day 7 and clinical laboratory results through Day 8 from the first three dosing groups will guide the selection of an optimal dose group to include 10 subjects who will receive the optimal dose of mRNA-LNP. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of a single dose of VRC H1ssF 3928 mRNA-LNP vaccine administered IM in healthy adults, 18-49 yrs, at doses of 10 mcg, 25 mcg, and 50 mcg.",

Dosing of H1ssF 3928 mRNA Vaccine will commence at the lowest dose (10 mcg) and only escalate to the next highest dose if safety concerns are not identified. For each VRC H1ssF 3928 mRNA-LNP (Lipid Nanoparticle) dosing group, the first two subjects enrolled will be considered the sentinel subgroup. After the two subjects in the Low Dose sentinel subgroup are enrolled and given their vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a review of the reactogenicity and safety data collected through Day 3 for both subjects. Approval by the reviewing group will allow for continued enrollment of the remaining Low Dose Group subjects to complete enrollment of 10 participants. After Low Dose Group enrollment is completed, enrollment will be stopped pending an Safety Review Committee (SRC) review of the reactogenicity and adverse event (AE) information through Day 7 and clinical laboratory results through Day 8 for all Low Dose Group subjects. Approval will allow dose escalation and initiation of enrollment of the Medium Dose Group sentinel subgroup. After the two subjects in the Medium Dose sentinel subgroup are enrolled and given their vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a safety review of the sentinel subgroup as specified for the Low Dose Group. Approval will allow for continued enrollment of Medium Dose Group subjects to complete enrollment of 10 participants. After the Medium Dose Group enrollment is completed, enrollment will be stopped pending an SRC review of the reactogenicity and adverse event information through Day 7 and clinical laboratory results through Day 8 for all Medium Dose Group subjects. Approval will allow dose escalation and initiation of enrollment of the High Dose Group sentinel subgroup. After the two subjects in the High Dose sentinel subgroup are enrolled and given their vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a safety review of the sentinel subgroup as specified for the Low and Medium Dose Groups. Approval will allow for continued enrollment of High Dose Group subjects to complete enrollment of 10 participants. After the High Dose Group enrollment is completed, enrollment will be stopped pending an SRC review of the reactogenicity and adverse event information through Day 7 visit and clinical laboratory results through Day 8 for all High Dose Group subjects. Reactogenicity and AE information through Day 7 and clinical laboratory results through Day 8 from the first three dosing groups will guide the selection of an optimal dose group to include an additional 10 subjects who will receive the optimal dose of mRNA-LNP.

The secondary objective of this study is to assess serum antibody responses to a single dose of VRC H1ssF 3928 mRNA-LNP vaccine administered IM in healthy adults at doses of 10 mcg, 25 mcg, and 50 mcg in comparison to a standard dose of IIV4."

Are in good health\\* and do not have clinically significant medical, psychiatric, chronic or intermittent health conditions including those listed in Exclusion Criteria (Section 1).\n\n   \\*As determined by medical history, medication use, and physical examination to evaluate ongoing chronic medical or psychiatric diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would not affect the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. These medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations, emergency room \\[ER\\] or urgent care for condition \\[excluding musculoskeletal conditions\\], or invasive medical procedure and no adverse symptoms that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose or in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening or treatment of continued symptoms of medical diagnosis or condition. Note: Low dose topical, corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria (see Section 1) as well as herbals, vitamins and supplements are permitted.\n6.

(Periodic abstinence \\[e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods\\] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception).\n    * Acceptable forms of primary contraception include monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving the study product, tubal ligation, intrauterine devices, birth control pills, and injectable/implantable/insertable hormonal birth control products.\n    * Must use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception or true abstinence for at least 30 days prior to receipt of study product and at least one acceptable primary form of contraception or true abstinence for at least 30 days following receipt of study product.\n12. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum HCG pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine HCG pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the study vaccination.\n13. Male participants receiving VRC H1ssF_3928 mRNA-LNP must agree to refrain from donating sperm and to use contraception until Day 60 after vaccination.\\*\n\n    * Acceptable contraception includes abstinence from intercourse with a female of childbearing potential or use of a male condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage of ejaculate to a female during the intervention period for at least 60 days after study vaccination.\n    * Males in the immunogenicity comparator group do not have to refrain from sperm donation or abstain from intercourse or agree to use a male condom for purposes of this study.\n14.

Have an acute illness\\* or fever (body temperature \\> / = 38.0 degrees Celsius/100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), as determined by the site Principal Investigator (PI) or appropriate sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.\n\n   \\*An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining is allowable if, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess safety parameters as required by the protocol.\n2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study participation.\\*\n\n   \\* Including acute, subacute, intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial.\n3.
