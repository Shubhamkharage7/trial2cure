We will accrue a total of 40 patients. Patients will be treated with nivolumab (3mg/kg) and ipilimumab (1mg/kg) IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses and cabozantinib 40mg daily. Then patients will be treated with nivolumab 480mg IV Q 4 weeks and cabozantinib 40mg daily until progression or intolerable toxicities or patient's withdrawal. A lead-in group of 6 patients will be closely monitored for DLT. If stopping criteria (\\>3 patients develop DLTs) is met then, treatment will be switched to Nivolumab plus Cabozantinib omitting ipilimumab."
