The SUDC Registry and Research Collaborative will analyze cases of sudden unexpected deaths in these children to understand risk factors and causes, and develop preventative measures.",
            "detailedDescription": "* Review the child's death, medical and family history by our study pathologists (including forensic, pediatric, cardiac and neuropathologists) to determine whether a possible, probable or definite cause of death can be identified and whether additional studies might be helpful in determining a specific cause of death.\n* For case investigations that are open/active, the registry offers cardiac pathology, and neuroimaging/neuropathology consultations.\n* For those cases determined to be unexplained/undetermined- access to genetic analysis (whole exome sequencing) when viable samples are available. Additional genetic analysis opportunities for biological parents and some family members. For more information, please see our Genetics Frequently Asked Questions.\n* Study the risks that lead to sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC).\n* Provide families with a review of their child's death through a case review report.\n* Identify at-risk individuals with the hopes of gaining knowledge to establish prevention strategies to reduce the chances of sudden unexplained death in the future."
