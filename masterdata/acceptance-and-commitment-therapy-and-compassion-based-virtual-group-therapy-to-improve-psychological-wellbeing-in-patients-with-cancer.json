            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests how well acceptance and commitment therapy and compassion based virtual group therapy works to improve psychological wellbeing, such as compassion, understanding, and flexibility, in patients with cancer. Receiving a cancer diagnosis, undergoing cancer treatment, and living with cancer- or treatment-related symptoms have often been found to be associated with elevated distress and decreased quality of life for individuals, even when the disease is stable or in remission. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has demonstrated considerable benefits on individuals' quality of life, psychological flexibility, and amelioration of psychological distress following a cancer diagnosis and in the face of uncertainty, loss, and challenges associated with cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess if participants perceive compassion and understanding by the provider who facilitates the virtual group intervention.\n\nII. To assess if participation in the ACT-based group intervention is associated with increases in patients' self-reported psychological flexibility as well as amelioration in psychological and physical distress.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess if participation in the ACT-based group intervention is associated with increases in patients' self-reported mindfulness, self-compassion, meaning and purpose, and posttraumatic growth.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients attend acceptance and commitment virtual group therapy sessions over 1.5 hours each, once a week for 6 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month."
