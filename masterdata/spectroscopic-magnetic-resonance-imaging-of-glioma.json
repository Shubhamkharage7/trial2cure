            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to develop and test new Magnetic Resonance Imaging methods that can improve the characterization of brain cancer and facilitate improved clinical care of these participants. More specifically, investigators are interested in applying novel spectroscopic and quantitative MR methods that give information beyond what is produced by a clinical brain MRI study and to understand the clinical correlates of the imaging findings. Investigators have tested these sequences in healthy volunteers. The investigators now wish to test these sequences in brain cancer participants in order to understand how these sequences can best be applied in a clinical setting.\n\nTo acquire these data, investigators intend to perform additional MRI acquisitions on participants who are scheduled to receive a clinical MRI at the UMN Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR), a facility located at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR). Since these MRIs are required for the participants' clinical care, the participant will not be making additional visits to the CCIR. Based on published data and pilot experiences reported from other institutions, the sequences are well-tolerated. The only imposition for the participant is that the participant will spend additional time in the scanner after completion of the imaging required for clinical care. An informed consent form describing the additional MR sequences performed will be presented to the participant."
