Isopropyl alcohol may be a part of the preparation pads. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study solution but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with the study solution to learn if the study solution has any real effect.\n\nInhalation of the study solution may help to control your nausea. Future patients may benefit from what is learned. There may be no benefits for you in this study.\n\nYour participation is completely voluntary. Before choosing to take part in this study, you should discuss with the study team any concerns you may have, including side effects, potential expenses, and time commitment."
