This study will be a single subject crossover design where one group of 14 children with partial hand deficiencies will be evaluated on several metrics using their existing prosthetic treatment for one month and the Point Mini system for two months. Metrics include: in-clinic functional measures, subjective assessments, bilateral hand use, and prosthesis wear time."
