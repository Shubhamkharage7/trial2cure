Investigators want to determine the impact of both interventions on the child's development and behavior, and caregiver implementation of strategies.",
            "detailedDescription": "Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, can be associated with a wide range of developmental needs. Behavioral challenges are common, and can impact learning, overall achievement, relationships, inclusion in schools, and community integration.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine whether JASPER (Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement and Regulation) can improve caregiver implementation of behavioral strategies, caregiver self-efficacy and confidence, and child development.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to receive either the JASPER intervention or a caregiver psychoeducational group. Participants in the JASPER intervention will receive 10 weekly virtual educational sessions utilizing JASPER therapy modules through 1:1 parent-child coaching sessions. Caregivers in the comparison group will receive 10 weekly modules containing a psychoeducational curriculum. The outcome measures will assess caregiver responsiveness, child joint engagement with caregiver, caregiver self-efficacy, and child behavior, language, and adaptive skills."
