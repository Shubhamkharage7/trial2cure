Exploratory Hypothesis 1- As adolescents mature, they will have a decrease in pain sensitivity to experimental pain which will be related to changes in sex hormone levels.\n\nExploratory hypothesis 2- Female adolescents with greater pain sensitivity, lower testosterone levels and with a family history of pain would be at a higher risk to develop chronic pain",

In the study session, psychophysical assessments of thermal and pressure stimuli will be performed and sex hormone levels will be analyzed. In addition, demographic, social, pubertal maturation, behavioral and psychological factors will be collected via questionnaires.\n\nIn the optional follow-up portion, participants can complete short surveys every 3 months and/or return for study visits every year depending on the participant's availability. The study visits will include the same procedures as the baseline study visit. Additional surveys regarding new symptoms of pain will be completed. In some cases, participants will meet a pediatric physician who will determine if the participant meet the criteria for any pain syndrome (for research purposes only)."
