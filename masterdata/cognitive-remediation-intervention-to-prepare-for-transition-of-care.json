            "briefSummary": "Randomized Controlled Trial (RTC) testing the efficacy of a telehealth adaptation of the Cognitive-Remediation of Executive and Adaptive Deficits in Youth (C-READY) intervention to prepare adolescents with sickle cell disease for transition of care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cognitive impairment is a pervasive debilitating feature of sickle cell disease (SCD), with over 50% of children demonstrating early neurodevelopmental delays, ultimately influencing ability for adolescents with SCD to engage in effective decision-making needed for successful transition into adulthood. The negative effect of cognitive impairment on transition to adult self-care is further compounded by health-related disparities and poor social determinants of health. Transition to self-care among youth with SCD may be facilitated by cognitive remediation. One potential avenue to disseminate cognitive-based interventions to disadvantaged neighborhoods is through telehealth administration. This study will examine the efficacy of C-READY on adaptive and self-management skills in youth with SCD, where there is a critical need to enhance self-efficacy/self-care skills for successful transition into adulthood. Additionally, this study overcomes the barriers of transportation that preclude vulnerable patient populations from returning to the clinic for in-person interventions by offering the intervention in their homes via telehealth. C-READY is a manualized, individualized intervention delivered over the course of 4 weeks in 8, 60 minute one-on-one telehealth sessions between the youth and trained therapist. Caregiver involvement and accountability is promoted by weekly phone sessions in between the 8 primary sessions. The emphasis C-READY is on promotion of independence with adaptive skills necessary for transition of care to adult healthcare, such as managing medications, pain management, sleep hygiene, and/or daily health-related routines; the objective is to identify and focus on goals that best promote those skills. Thus, we will conduct a two-arm, wait-listed randomized control trial among 120 patients with SCD (ages 10-18 years), 60 participants per group; half randomized to the intervention arm, and half to the waitlist arm. The primary outcome is transition readiness skills, with secondary outcome measures of cognitive abilities and neuroimaging metrics. We hypothesize that youth with SCD who participate in C-READY will show improvement in transition readiness skills and show greater improvement in cognitive performance. We also hypothesize that participation in C-READY will improve functional brain connectivity and increase compensatory neural mechanisms. In sum, this study will be the first step in developing highly accessible and scalable evidence-based intervention to improve transition of care, enhance self-care, and ultimately improve overall quality of life in youth with SCD."

Our plan includes presentation at national and international meetings and publications in peer-reviewed medical journals.
