This customized, endovascular approach has the potential to decrease hospital length of stay, pulmonary complications, and in-hospital mortality.",

Diameter \\>5.5 cm if asymptomatic, or 5.0 cm with enlargement of \\>0.5cm in 6 months.\n     2. History of growth \\>0.5 cm per year\n     3. Any size if ruptured or symptomatic\n  2. Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU)\n\n     1. \\>2.0cm in depth\n     2. Any size if contained ruptured or symptomatic\n\nGeneral Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Less than 18 years of age\n* Life expectancy less than 12 months based on the surgeon's assessment\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on becoming pregnant within 60 months\n* Inability or refusal to give informed consent\n* Unwilling or unable to comply with the follow-up schedule\n* Less than 30 days beyond primary endpoint for other investigative drug or device study\n\nMedical Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known allergy to the device components (i.e. stainless steel, polyester, solder, gold, or nitinol)\n* History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material that cannot be adequately premedicated\n* Systemic or local infection that may increase the risk of endovascular graft infection.\n* Baseline eGFR \\<30mL/min (calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) and not on hemo- or peritoneal dialysis. If the patient is currently on dialysis, or is currently planning on initiating dialysis, then they may undergo repair.\n* History of connective tissue disorders.\n* Body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta.\n* Major surgical or interventional procedure unrelated to the treatment of the aneurysm planned \u226430 days of the endovascular repair.\n* Unstable angina, defined as a progressive increase in symptoms, new onset at rest or nocturnal angina, or onset of prolonged angina.\n* Irreversible coagulopathy\n\nAnatomical Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aortic transection due to acute trauma.\n* Aortic dissection.\n* Infectious (\"mycotic\") etiology of the aortic disease.\n* Significant occlusive disease or tortuosity precluding delivery of the device components.\n* Proximal Landing zone \\<20mm in length. The proximal landing zone can be within zones 2 through 8, with least 20mm of proximal seal and fixation in aorta or Dacron.\n* Proximal neck, defined as the thoracic aorta distal to the native left carotid artery, measured outer wall to outer wall on a sectional image (CT) \\>41 mm in diameter or \\< 18 mm in diameter\n* Distal landing zone \\<20mm in length if the landing zone is in the aorta, or \\<20mm if the landing zone is in the iliac arteries or in Dacron (in the event the patient has had a previous or concomitant aortic or aorto-iliac reconstruction).\n* Untreatable branch vessel stenosis.\n* Anatomy that would not allow maintenance of at least one patent hypogastric artery.\n* Signs that the inferior mesenteric artery is indispensable (i.e. angiographic visualization or a large IMA, filling of SMA via collaterals, stenosis of celiac or SMA or oblique views) and the indispensible IMA is not amenable to treatment with a graft branch or fenestration.\n* Branching, duplication, aneurysm or untreatable stenosis of the celiac, SMA or renal arteries that would preclude implantation of the investigational devices.",
