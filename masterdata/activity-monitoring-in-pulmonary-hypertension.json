Participants will undergo activity monitoring for 12 weeks once a year for 4 years. Patient-reported outcomes will be collected including quality of life (emphasis-10, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF), and SF-36 surveys), medication changes, hospitalization, and death. This study aims to enroll 500 participants. The objectives of this study are to establish the clinical utility of daily activity tracking in patients with pulmonary hypertension and to identify clinical factors associated with reduced daily activity."
