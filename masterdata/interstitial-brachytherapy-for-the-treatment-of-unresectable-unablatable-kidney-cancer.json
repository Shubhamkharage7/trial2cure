            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects of interstitial brachytherapy and to see how well it works in limiting the growth of large kidney cancer masses in patients with kidney cancer that have refused or are unable to undergo surgery or ablation (unresectable/unablatable). Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, temporarily introduces a radiation source into or near the tumor to eradicate the tumor cells. Giving brachytherapy may potentially reduce the size of the kidney cancer mass that would otherwise not be amenable to surgical management and translate into lower risk of spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and feasibility of renal interstitial radiation therapy (interstitial brachytherapy). (Safety Lead-In) II. To evaluate local control of renal interstitial brachytherapy. (Expansion Phase)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate treatment response of the primary tumor. II. To evaluate 12 month distant progression free survival. III. To evaluate the 12 month volumetric growth of the primary tumor mass. IV. To determine biomarkers predicting response and resistance to radiation treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo interstitial brachytherapy for 1-2 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who undergo 2 fractions may receive both fractions in the same day or on 2 separate days over 2 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for at least 3 years."
