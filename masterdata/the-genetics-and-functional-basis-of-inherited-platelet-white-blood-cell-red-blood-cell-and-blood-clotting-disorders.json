            "briefSummary": "Blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, as well as a fluid portion termed plasma. We primarily study blood platelets, but sometimes we also analyze the blood of patients with red blood cell disorders (such as sickle cell disease), white blood cell disorders, and disorders of the blood clotting factors found in plasma.\n\nBlood platelets are small cell fragments that help people stop bleeding after blood vessels are damaged. Some individuals have abnormalities in their blood platelets that result in them not functioning properly. One such disorder is Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Most such patients have a bleeding disorder characterized by nosebleeds, gum bleeding, easy bruising (black and blue marks), heavy menstrual periods in women, and excessive bleeding after surgery or trauma. Our laboratory performs advanced tests of platelet function and platelet biochemistry. If we find evidence that a genetic disorder may be responsible, we analyze the genetic material (DNA and RNA) from the volunteer, and when possible, close family members to identify the precise defect.",
            "detailedDescription": "After volunteers and family members agree to participate, they are seen in the Outpatient Research Center by the Principal Investigator or another physician. A detailed history is obtained, a physical examination is performed, and blood is obtained for further tests. Occasionally patients and family members are requested to return for additional tests. If an abnormality is identified with tests conducted in our research laboratory, we advise the volunteer to have the studies repeated in a laboratory certified to conduct tests on patients."
