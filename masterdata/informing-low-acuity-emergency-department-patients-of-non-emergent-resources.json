In this campaign, patients will be assigned to receive or not receive outreach following ED discharge that is aligned with the goal. Outreach will occur via a text message, as well as information added to the patient's after visit summary, and will include one or more calls to action that make patients aware of other Geisinger resources and avenues through which they can seek care outside of the ED. These may include, but are not limited to, walk-in urgent care, virtual urgent care, primary care provider (PCP) appointments, and/or other ways in which to contact Geisinger. The study will assess whether ED use differs across patients in different outreach conditions. It will also examine whether patients followed through on the message-specific calls to action in the messages differently across conditions."
