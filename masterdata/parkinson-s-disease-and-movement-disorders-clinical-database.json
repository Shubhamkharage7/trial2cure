These data may be used for any study examining the relationship between treatment and clinical symptoms of patients with PD and related disorders. The main uses of the data are to:\n\n* Determine the long term effects of Parkinson's disease and related conditions, including predictors of its motor and non-motor symptoms\n* Identify genetic and other neurobiological factors related to the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and related disorders and their course\n* Improve our understanding of how best to identify, diagnose, and manage motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and related conditions Evaluate biological markers of disease or response to therapy\n* Identify patients who may be candidates for participation in trials of new medications.\n* Identify patients who may be interested in participating in educational or developmental activities\n\nParticipants are seen annually for the first 4 years, biennially thereafter. The participants continue in the study until study end, withdrawal, or death on study."
