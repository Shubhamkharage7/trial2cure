The study will evaluate the potential benefit of training on speech recognition performance, psychosocial and cognitive function.",
            "detailedDescription": "Optimizing Speech Recognition and Cognitive Outcomes for Older Cochlear Implant Users with Auditory-Brain Training is evaluating the performance of older cochlear implant users completing a customized auditory-cognitive brain training program. The goal is to determine the effectiveness of training based on speech recognition, neural responses, cognitive, and psychosocial function. Successful training could result in improved outcomes for communication and cognition, new client-centered care models, and better consumer access to effective training.\n\nSpecifically, investigators will assess two training programs to determine whether participants can improve speech understanding and speed, attention and memory, and communication in daily life. Thirty participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: auditory-brain training or non-auditory brain training. Participants will complete two hours of training online at home or office. Participants will meet virtually with a clinician weekly to discuss progress.The study will help determine the best training methods for older adult cochlear implant users."
