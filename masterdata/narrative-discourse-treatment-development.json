            "briefSummary": "Discourse impairments are breakdowns in meaningful communication beyond the level of single sentences and have a functional impact on the lives of Veterans with TBI, disrupting return to work, communication re integration, socialization, and quality of life. The few prior attempts to treat discourse impairments have been small case studies and resulted in no change or limited gains. The proposed study evaluates the feasibility of a novel narrative discourse treatment that builds upon these prior attempts by addressing breakdowns in both story content and story organization using a theoretically-driven approach. If feasible, as demonstrated by tolerability and acceptability to participants, and later shown to be effective, the proposed discourse treatment has the potential to improve daily communication, which provides a gateway for Veterans with TBI to increase meaningful participation and improve functioning in major life domains.",
            "detailedDescription": "Discourse intervention in TBI is a nascent area of research, and, to date, there have been only a few studies that have attempted to improve discourse ability in TBI. These prior attempts have been small case studies, produced no change or limited gains, and did not include Veterans with TBI. The proposed project is an early stage discourse treatment development study that will evaluate the feasibility of a novel narrative discourse treatment protocol that builds upon these prior attempts with an all-Veteran participant sample. The first part of the study will consist of initial manual development for the discourse treatment protocol and refinement.\n\nThe second part will involve a treatment feasibility trial to obtain information regarding the tolerability, acceptability, and fidelity of the proposed discourse treatment and preliminary data on treatment delivery and assessment methods as well as preliminary information about treatment effects. Forty participants will be randomized to either the discourse treatment group or Treatment as Usual control. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and at 1-month follow-up."
