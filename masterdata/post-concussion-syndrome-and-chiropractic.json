            "briefSummary": "This proof-of-concept trial will explore the effects of manual chiropractic adjustments on nervous system function in individuals with post-concussion syndrome. This study will aim to recruit 10 individuals to receive 6 weeks of chiropractic care with 3 assessment periods. The participants will undergo a baseline assessment, mid-trial assessment, and post-trial assessment. The participants will wear an electroencephalography (EEG) cap for a neural assessment during an event related potential. They will wear electrical diodes to measure electrocardiography (ECG), impedance cardiography (ICG), and electrodermal activity (EDA) throughout the study and during an orthostatic challenge. Additional sensors will be placed on the participant to measure interlimb symmetry patterns during gait while walking on a treadmill.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants enrolled in the study will take a screening questionnaire to first determine eligibility. Once qualified, each individual will undergo a physical exam by a state licensed chiropractor to determine if there are any contraindications to undergo chiropractic care throughout the duration of the study. Each participant will receive 6 weeks of chiropractic care and will be assessed at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the Dr. Sid E Williams Center for Chiropractic Research. Each participant will perform a number of tests to determine the evaluated function of their nervous system. In total, 3 different tests will be performed by the participant during an assessment visit that will take approximately 2.5 - 3 hours. During the assessments, each individual will be wearing electrical diodes to continually monitor ECG, ICG, and EDA. The specific assessments will be as follows:\n\n1. Wearing an EEG net and then perform an event related potential after a baseline recording\n2. Performing an orthostatic challenge while measuring ECG, ICG, and EDA\n3. Wearing motion sensors while walking at a comfortable pace on a treadmill to evaluate interlimb symmetry and gait dynamics"
