            "briefSummary": "The increasing morbidity and mortality of the opioid epidemic has necessitated a reevaluation of current addiction treatment paradigms: medications for opioid use disorder, such as buprenorphine and methadone, are effective in decreasing one's risk of death and disability from opioid use, but are underutilized and often difficult to access. The 5000 Emergency Departments (EDs) in the US are potential additional locales for medication initiation, but currently only a small minority of ED patients with opioid use disorder are started on medications. This study will refine and pilot an intervention called Talk About It which aims to foster patient-centered care, 'meet patients where they are' for addiction treatment, and increase treatment initiation and adherence via facilitating Shared Decision-Making in the ED around these potentially life-saving options.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants (ED patients with untreated opioid use disorder) will be enrolled and followed prospectively before and after an ED-wide intervention training clinicians to use \"Talk About It,\" a paper-based conversation aid designed to foster shared decision-making about the decision to start methadone and buprenorphine.\n\nOutcomes will include the initiation of medications, treatment adherence, and patient-reported outcomes."
