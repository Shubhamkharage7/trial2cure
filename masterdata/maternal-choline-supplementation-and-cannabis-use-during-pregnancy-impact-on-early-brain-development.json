            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine if providing a nutritional supplement, phosphatidylcholine, to pregnant women who have used cannabis products during the current pregnancy improves the offspring's brain-related development during the first 18 months. Participating pregnant women will receive either phosphatidylcholine or a placebo from approximately 16 weeks gestation through birth. The primary outcomes are the child's brain responses to sound at 4 weeks corrected age, and infant behaviors at 3 months and 18 months corrected age as reported by the primary caregiver. Secondary outcomes include motor, socio-emotional, language and cognitive development.",
            "detailedDescription": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a form of choline, a nutrient that is sometimes referred to as Vitamin B4 or Vitamin J. Choline is for normal growth everywhere in the body, including in the brain. PC is a naturally occurring substance and can be found in many different kinds of food including milk, liver, and eggs so most people get enough choline. However, when a woman is pregnant and her baby is growing many new cells, more PC may be needed. Research has suggested that the presence of adequate amounts of choline during pregnancy and breastfeeding can help ensure healthy fetal brain development and may have long-lasting positive effects on cognitive function. Problems in behavioral and cognitive development into childhood have been reported in children of mothers who used cannabis during gestation. Alternatively, two studies of maternal choline levels during pregnancy have reported beneficial effects of higher levels on childhood behavioral and cognitive development. This study assesses whether a higher dose of choline taken during pregnancy will have positive results on offspring development.\n\nParticipants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 1028 mg of choline daily throughout pregnancy, until delivery. Vital signs will be taken, potential side effects will be assessed, and study medication will be given at each visit. Blood samples will be taken at enrollment, and approximately at weeks 16, 22, 28, 34. Children will be followed and assessed until 18 months of age."
