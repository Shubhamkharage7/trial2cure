A successful study may provide preliminary evidence that helps improve future patient care through targeted diagnostics, prognosis, and/or treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to assess the role of serial ctDNA analysis as integrative biomarker in patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer undergoing treatment with curative intent. This is a single arm prospective tissue/blood collection from patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment and Surgery as well as surveillance, plan to accrue up to 50 patients. Primary objective is to determine the proportion of ctDNA positive in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer and to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with ctDNA positive versus ctDNA negative.\n\nPatients who consent to the study will participate in pre-study exams and tests to find out if they can take part in the study. This includes, but is not limited to, a doctor's visit with medical history and physical evaluation, blood work, pregnancy test for those capable of becoming pregnant, and imaging tests.\n\nThe study itself will include the patient's regular treatment for pancreatic cancer which may include 4 to 6 months of chemotherapy, chemo-radiation, surgery to remove pancreatic cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy and follow up for 2 years. Blood will be drawn at regular time points during this study for ctDNA detection. The tumor tissue at diagnosis will be collected to develop a personalized and tumor informed PCR test."
