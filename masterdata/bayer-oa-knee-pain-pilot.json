Participants be evaluated in clinic, obtain a knee MRI, undergo embolization of the symptomatic knee, and follow up in clinic at 1, 6, and 12 months after embolization. A second MRI is obtained 6 months after embolization. Participants will keep a record of their pain level and treatment and answer questionnaires at each visit.\n\nIn addition, this study aims to determine the effects of knee artery embolization on the amount of opioid (pain reliever drugs) needed to manage osteoarthritis-associated pain and change in quality of life."

This picture will be used to see if there are any abnormal vessels at the knee, such as abnormal blood flow, abnormal vessel connections (between the veins and arteries), or new blood vessel growth. Once the targeted artery at the knee is confirmed, the doctor will inject enough particle embolic (Embozene) to slow or stop the blood flow in the geniculate artery.
