It is considered a common skin condition characterized by pimples and occurs when follicles are clogged leading to the formation of acne lesions. In this study, we want to evaluate the impact the skin balancing gel cream has on the skin microbiome on individuals who have mild to moderate non-cystic acne. We will be assessing the changes it has on specific microbiota (Cutibacterium acnes for example) and whether it is tolerated well on acne prone skin."
