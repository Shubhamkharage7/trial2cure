This clinical trial is being conducted to learn more about if wearing a Smartwatch and having access to its data improves physicians' sense of well-being and if data measured from Smartwatches contain a 'signal' that predicts well-being",
            "detailedDescription": "We will conduct a randomized controlled trail to evaluate if wearing a Smartwatch improves overall well-being among physicians, and if so, in which dimension of well-being (e.g., fatigue, stress, overall quality of life, burnout). Additionally, we will explore if data from Smartwatches can predict subsequent well-being among physicians.\n\nStudy Aims:\n\n1. To determine if wearing a Smartwatch and having access to its physiological data (e.g., sleep, step count, activity, breathing reminders) improves well-being, and if so which well-being dimensions.\n2. To determine whether continuous physiological measures (measured from Smartwatches) contain a 'signal' that predicts physician well-being, and if so in which dimensions."
