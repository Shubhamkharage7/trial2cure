The investigators will measure both how the participants feel about their voices and how their voice actually sounds to see if the app is effective.",

The immediate objectives are to understand the needs of TGGD individuals in voice care,and identify barriers to creating a pilot app with evidence-based educational content for VCMT and to evaluate subjective and objective voice outcomes of TGGD participants with app use compared to standard behavioral intervention with a speech pathologist."
