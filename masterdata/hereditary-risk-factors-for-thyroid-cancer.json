Researchers are studying thyroid cancer in children and families, with a particular interest in understanding genes and other factors that may put individuals at risk for developing thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules.\n\n* In this study, family and medical history information is collected alongside a blood or saliva sample for genetic studies.\n* Individuals with a past or present childhood thyroid cancer/nodule or a thyroid cancer suspected to be inherited in their family are invited to participate.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research study is to learn more about risk factors for inherited thyroid cancer.\n\nThe investigators would like to use the participant DNA to look for alterations in genes. The investigator will perform DNA sequencing and other genetic studies to identify errors in the genes that may contribute to the formation of thyroid nodules and cancer."
