The risk of treatment delays according to tumor type and race will be measured by both ePRO and electronic health record (EHR) tools. Data from this study and the association of social determinants of health could be useful to flag patients at risk of delay and due timely intervention for modifiable treatment barriers. The prediction of the risk of treatment delay will be helpful to design another study using electronic tracking systems to prevent cancer treatment delays. The long-term goal of this research is to alert care teams when patients may be at risk of treatment days and to help patients get treatment faster. It was planned to enroll a total of 240 subjects with newly diagnosed cancer. Sixty colorectal and 180 breast cancer patients will be included."
