In particular, Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET, a new and more sensitive form of imaging that can help identify metastatic cancer earlier and more reliably.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective is to measure health related quality of life among patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing prostate specific membrane positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging. This will be assessed in four domains: cancer related anxiety, decisional conflict, health related quality of life (physical functioning) and health preferences.\n\nThe secondary objective is to conduct longitudinal in-depth qualitative interviews to better explore patient experiences and perspectives on PET imaging.\n\nStudy Design Investigators will conduct a longitudinal explanatory sequential mixed methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, serial quantitative psychological (anxiety, uncertainty) and HRQoL survey data from patients undergoing PET imaging in routine clinical care will be collected. In the second phase, a subset of patients from phase 1 who have completed initial surveys will be recruited and conduct longitudinal in-depth qualitative interviews to better explore patient experiences and perspectives on PET imaging.\n\nPatient clinical and sociodemographic data will be collected through automated extraction from the medical record (EPIC) into the REDcap database through collaboration with JDAT. For fields that are not populated via automated methods we will manually enter information via abstraction of the patient's medical record (EPIC)."
