The study design consists of a Screening Period (up to 35 days), and a 6-week Treatment Period (during which participants will receive either NMRA-335140 or placebo). At the completion of the 6-week Treatment Period, participants who complete the study, provide informed consent, and meet the eligibility criteria may enter an open-label extension study (NMRA-335140-501)."

It has been shown to be valid and reliable in normal and clinical samples, with adequate construct validity, satisfactory test-retest reliability, and high internal consistency. The scale will be completed by the participant and reviewed by site personnel qualified to oversee completeness. Each of the 14 items has a set of 4 responses, 2 of which endorse agreement (Definitely Agree, Agree) and 2 of which endorse disagreement (Disagree, Strongly Disagree). A total score can be derived by summing the response items; where those answered with \"strongly agree\" will be coded as a 1, while a \"strongly disagree\" response will be coded as 4. Therefore, scores on the SHAPS can range from 14 to 56, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of anhedonia.",
