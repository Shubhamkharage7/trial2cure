The primary objective is to evaluate differences in self-reported pain, fear, or embarrassment during and after the procedure between the VR Group, Aromatherapy Group, VR+Aromatherapy Group, and the Control group.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-center, randomized controlled trial comparing the use of a virtual reality (VR) device vs. an aromatherapy patch vs. VR+aromatherapy vs. standard of care as a non-anesthetic pain management tool during a transperineal prostate biopsy (TPBx).\n\n208 patients who express interest in participating in the trial will be consented via Redcap. Patients will be centrally, dynamically randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the treatment groups or control group. There will be no subgroup stratification. The randomization will be predetermined by participant ID number. There will be a sealed envelope prepared and labeled with the participant ID that will contain the information for which treatment group a participant is assigned to. Once a participant is consented and assigned an ID, the envelope will be reopened to reveal which intervention the patient will be assigned to.\n\nAll participants will take a survey immediately following the procedure and that will conclude their participation in the study."
