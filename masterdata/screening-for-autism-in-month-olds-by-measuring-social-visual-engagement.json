            "briefSummary": "The goal of this project is to measure the clinical utility of an objective and quantitative eye-tracking assay collected on a standalone, mobile investigational device to accurately screen 9-month-old infants for autism spectrum disorder and other actionable delays.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to see if measuring how infants look at social information can be used as a screening tool to identify developmental delays or vulnerabilities in infants as young as 9 months of age. What the 9-month-old infant looks at will be measured with eye-tracking technology, which uses a video camera to safely measure the child's eye movements while the child watches video scenes of other children at play. Parents/caregivers will be asked if they would like to participate during their child's 9-month well-baby visit at their pediatrician's office. If they agree to participate, the child will have their first study visit at this time. Children will undergo an eye-tracking session to measure social looking. Parents/caregivers will also complete forms and questionnaires about their child's health and development. The forms will be emailed, to be completed when the child is approximately 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months old.\n\nIf a child shows signs of developmental delay (DD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the child will be asked to participate in a comprehensive developmental and diagnostic assessment in-person with expert clinicians when the child is between 18-26 months old, to determine the child's strengths and any vulnerabilities, and to recommend any support or treatment if needed.\n\nIf the child does not show signs of developmental delay and/or autism, the investigators may still invite the child for an in-person assessment with expert clinicians when the child is between 18-26 months old. Approximately 10% of children who do not show any signs of developmental delay and/or autism will be randomly selected for an in-person assessment. At the end of the assessment, parents/caregivers will be provided feedback on their child's strengths and any vulnerabilities and, if necessary, a report will be written to help them access services for their child."
