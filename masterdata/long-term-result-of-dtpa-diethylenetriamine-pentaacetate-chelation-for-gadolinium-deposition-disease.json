Those who provide informed consent will have their questions about the study answered and their interest and eligibility assessed via telephone interview. Those who wish to participate will be sent an Informed Consent for study participation. Those who return the consent will be sent four study questionnaires for completion and return. The returned forms will be reviewed by Dr. Koran or his co-investigator, and a follow-up phone call will be offered via Secure Stanford email. The phone call will involve answering any new questions the participant has, and clarifying the participant's responses to the data collection forms if clarification is needed. Participants who wish to receive a summary of the study's results once it is completed and accepted for publication, will be emailed a summary via Secure Stanford email."
