Preclinical data demonstrate reinvigoration of exhausted T cells into an effector-like phenotype with improved anti-tumor activity in response to this combination. This study will evaluate T cell function as well as clinical outcomes associated with this combination therapy.",

To assess phenotypic, transcriptional, and epigenetic profiles of PD-1+ CD8 T cells response in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with the combination of IL-2 and pembrolizumab.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the combination of IL-2 and pembrolizumab by assessing the objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).\n\nII. To evaluate the safety of the combination of IL-2 and pembrolizumab.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV once every 3 weeks in combination with IL-2 given at 5 million IU subcutaneously twice daily for 3 weeks (5 days on, 2 days off each week, first dose in clinic and subsequent doses at home). IL-2 will be given only for the three weeks, after which pembrolizumab will be continued as monotherapy at either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of the study treatment, patients are followed for up for 6 weeks."
