The availability of technology to reconstruct conventional resolution (CR) simulation images from the raw CT acquisition data acquired on the UHR-CT scanner offers a unique platform to study this question without subjecting individuals to two different scans.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to generate preliminary data in support of the hypothesis that noninvasive UHR-CT is superior to conventional resolution CT for identifying patients with obstructive CHD."
