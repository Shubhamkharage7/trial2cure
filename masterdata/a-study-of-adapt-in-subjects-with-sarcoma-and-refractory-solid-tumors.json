Different groups of patients will participate in each part.\n\nPHASE 1 PART 1: Dose Escalation Safety Run-In (CLOSED - Enrollment Completed) During PART 1, all participants will be treated with AdAPT-001 as a single injection, one time. Participants will be assigned to different dose levels to find the highest dose of AdAPT-001 that is safe and tolerable.\n\nPHASE 1 PART 2: Dose Expansion Single-Agent (CLOSED - Enrollment Completed) All participants in PART 2 will receive injections of AdAPT-001 on Days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycles.\n\nPHASE 1 PART 3: Expansion (CLOSED - Enrollment Completed) Subjects will be assigned to the following two arms. If a checkpoint inhibitor is indicated for the subject, the subject may be enrolled on Arm 2 per investigator discretion, otherwise subjects may be enrolled on Arm 1.\n\nArm 1: Intratumoral administration of AdAPT-001 (1.0 x 10\u00b9\u00b2 viral particles) on Day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 12 injections.\n\nArm 2: Intratumoral administration of AdAPT-001 (1.0 x 10\u00b9\u00b2 viral particles) on Day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 12 injections plus a checkpoint inhibitor per investigator discretion\n\nPHASE 2: (OPEN to Enrollment)\n\nSubjects with advanced solid tumors will participate in a basket two-arm parallel group evaluation (Phase 2) where eligible participants will be assigned to the following two arms based on confirmed histology by the treating investigator.\n\nArm 1: Confirmed Histological Diagnosis of Sarcoma Intratumoral Administration of AdAPT-001 (1.0 x 10\u00b9\u00b2 viral particles) on Day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 12 injections with or without a checkpoint inhibitor.\n\nArm 2: Confirmed Histological Diagnosis of Advanced Solid Tumor indicated to receive at least one checkpoint inhibitor."
