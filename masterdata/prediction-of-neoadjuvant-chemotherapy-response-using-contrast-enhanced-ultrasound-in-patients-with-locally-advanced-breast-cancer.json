            "briefSummary": "This phase II/III trial studies if contrast-enhanced ultrasounds using a contrast dye, perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity), can predict the response to chemotherapy by estimating the pressure in the cancer in patients with breast cancer that has spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes (locally advanced). The efficacy of cancer therapy is affected by the pressure in the cancer. Definity is a contrast dye used to create better images during ultrasounds. The purpose of this trial is to determine if a special kind of ultrasound, called contrast-enhanced ultrasound, an experimental imaging test, can detect pressures in cancer to determine the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To apply and evaluate a novel biomarker from 3-dimensional subharmonic aided pressure estimation (3D SHAPE) to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response in patients with breast cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess whether the accuracy of 3D SHAPE for predicting locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) NAC response varies with breast cancer subtype.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and receive perflutren lipid microspheres intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes before NAC, after 10% of NAC, and after 30% of NAC. Patients also undergo unenhanced baseline ultrasound imaging before NAC, after 10% of NAC, after 30% of NAC, and after 100% of NAC.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at the completion of NAC."
