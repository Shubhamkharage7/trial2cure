Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.",

To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral azacitidine (CC-486) in patients with symptomatic T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL). (Phase I) II. To determine the overall response rate (complete response \\[CR\\] and partial response \\[PR\\]) of CC-486 in patients with T-LGLL. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Duration of response to CC-486. II. Progression-free survival. III. Rate of conversion from PR at 4 months to CR at 8 and 12 months. IV. Rate of molecular remission (T-cell receptor \\[TCR\\] clearance, STAT3 mutation clearance) at 4, 8, 12 months.\n\nV. Effect of treatment on IL-15 promoter demethylation. VI. Effect of CC-486 on IL-15 promoter demethylation. VII. Safety of CC-486 in T-LGLL patients.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients receive azacitidine orally (PO) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR or CR continue treatment for up to 8 additional cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
