            "detailedDescription": "The general structure of this Adaptive Platform Trial (APT) consists of a 30-day Screening Period, a 12-week Platform Treatment Period, and a 4-week Safety Follow-up. The S-21-02 Platform Trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products for the treatment of PTSD (see NCT05422612 for Master Protocol information). Participants are randomized among the multiple cohorts in the study and the resulting randomization enables sharing/pooling of control subjects, where all interventions may be compared to a common control (placebo). This record only includes information relevant to the fluoxetine cohort.\n\nOnce a participant meets all eligibility criteria for the Master Protocol, eligibility for each currently enrolling intervention cohort is assessed. Eligible participants will be randomized with equal probability into a cohort. Participants randomized to the fluoxetine cohort are then randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine or placebo in a ratio defined by the number of cohorts for which they are eligible, for the duration of the 12-week treatment period.\n\nParties interested in having their intervention considered for testing within the DOD PTSD APT should complete a request for information form using this webpage https://citeline.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0oDoJXvIL7EFM1M."

In the first stage of randomization, eligible participants who complete screening will be randomly assigned to an open platform cohort for which they are eligible (both site PIs and participants are aware of the cohort assignment) and, within that cohort, the second stage of randomization is to intervention vs placebo (double-blind) using Interactive Response Technology (IRT).\n\nFor this APT, participants assignment to a cohort will not be blinded. The tablets/capsules used in the cohorts may not be visually similar between cohorts and blinding to cohort assignment is not necessary to avoid bias. However, within each cohort, participants, site personnel, contract research personnel and the sponsor will be blind to treatment assignment (intervention vs. placebo).",
