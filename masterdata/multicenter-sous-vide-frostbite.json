            "detailedDescription": "Frostbite can be a devastating and limb threatening injury. Treatment involves active rewarming in a warm water bath at a consistent temperature, but maintaining the correct temperature water is clinically challenging. Currently these water baths are created and monitored manually - leading to poor rewarming and inefficient use of resources. The \"sous vide\" device offers an alternative to the manual water bath method. The specific aim of our study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of use of the sous vide device in patients with extremity frostbite in a multicenter prospective cohort. Data demonstrating the ability of the sous vide device to warm and precisely maintain water bath target temperatures, in addition to expanded evidence of the safety of this modality, will support the broader use of sous vide devices in frostbite care."

The thermometers will be powered on continuously and the researcher will record temperatures simultaneously from each thermometer and the SVD every 2 minutes. At the end of the 30 minute treatment, the extremity assessed by the researcher for warmth and pliability. If the extremity still feels cold or frozen, an additional 30 minutes in the water bath will commence, with subsequent reassessment.
