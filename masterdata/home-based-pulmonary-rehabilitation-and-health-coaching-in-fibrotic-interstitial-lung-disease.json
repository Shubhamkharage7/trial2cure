Gentle upper body exercises, walking and a breathing practice are completed by following along on the computer tablet. Weekly check-in calls by telephone will be provided by a Health Coach to assess clinical status and monitor progress. The exercise portion of the program lasts 12 weeks. There are questionnaires and a research grade activity tracker measuring baseline and post-intervention findings at the end of 12-week period."
