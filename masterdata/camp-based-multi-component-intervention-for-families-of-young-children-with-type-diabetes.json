            "detailedDescription": "The invesigators propose to deliver a structured multidisciplinary family-centered intervention over a 3-day weekend. The intervention will be based at a regional camp. The proposed camp encounters aim to provide:\n\n* An opportunity for intensive education beyond that achievable in a single class, and without the unfavorable impacts of multiple weekday classes on family and work time.\n* Varied educational modalities including didactic sessions, practical demonstrations and role playing.\n* Close observation of each child throughout the day and night by experienced diabetes counselors and medical staff to identify and help correct maladaptive family behaviors.\n* A safe environment where parents can participate in group therapy sessions without child care worries.\n* An opportunity for age-appropriate child-centered educational and therapeutic activities.\n* An opportunity for families to form mutually-supportive friendships.\n* Fun weekends away where the parents have help caring for their diabetic children.\n\nThe investigators will conduct this pilot study, which will enroll 18 preschool children age 3-5.5 years, with the goal of obtaining preliminary results for 15 subjects.\n\nThe primary outcome, to be determined approximately one month before and 3 months after the camp session, is improvement in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).\n\nExploratory Hypotheses:\n\nCompared with pretreatment baseline, subjects attending a 3-day session at a family diabetes camp will improve:\n\n* HbA1c 3 months after the first camp session\n* Behavioral/QoL assessments, including the parents of young children version of the hypoglycemia fear survey (HFS-P-YC), the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS), and the general and diabetes modules of the PedsQL."

Such patients often cannot secrete glucagon, leading to a particularly severe inability to defend against hypoglycemia.\n* Other severe chronic disease (e.g., cancer, cystic fibrosis) which in the judgment of the investigator is likely to significantly affect glycemic control.\n* Patients cannot be taking systemic corticosteroids at enrollment because of adverse effects on glycemic control, but the investigators will not disqualify subjects who require such therapy during the study. Inhaled or topical corticosteroids are permissible.\n* Patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism must be clinically euthyroid and have free T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone within age-appropriate reference ranges at last medically indicated testing. Patients with out of range values may be retested after medication dose adjustment.\n* Developmental delay or behavioral disorder in the patient of sufficient severity, in the judgment of the investigator, to interfere with group activities.\n* Medical or psychiatric disorder in a parent of sufficient severity, in the judgment of the investigator, to interfere with group activities.\n* Celiac disease is not an exclusion criterion.",
