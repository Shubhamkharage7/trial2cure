Participants will be enrolled if they were treated during early or late HIV infection. In addition, individuals not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or with HIV-1 plasma RNA levels \\>5,000 copies/mL will be enrolled.",

As a result, there is interest in imaging residual immune activation in the setting of both treated and untreated HIV-1 infection, a disease in which chronic immune activation and inflammation may lead to significant morbidity, despite the use of otherwise suppressive ART.\n\nThe primary endpoint is to determine the anatomical distribution of \\[18F\\]F-AraG in HIV-infected individuals taking or not taking antiretroviral therapy.\n\nSecondary objectives are to determine if \\[18F\\]F-AraG PET-MRI is able to detect differences in T cell activation between patients with early versus late treated HIV infection and to determine if \\[18F\\]F-AraG uptake correlates with direct blood and tissue measures of HIV reservoir size and activity in the above cohorts/studies."
