            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates a clinical trial navigation intervention to help increase participation and diversity in cancer clinical trials. Cancer clinical trials are an important part of the development of treatments, and improved patient care and outcomes. Despite this, only a small number of cancer patients participate in clinical trials. There are many different items that contribute to low clinical trial participation, including health-related social needs (HRSN) and financial burden. Guiding participation toward understanding, inclusion, diversity, and equity for cancer clinical trials (GUIDE), is a program that uses a trained clinical trial navigator, or \"Guide\", to work with identified potential cancer clinical trial patients to help them recognize and remove HRSN and financial barriers preventing clinical trial participation. A clinical trial navigation intervention, like GUIDE, may help increase participation and diversity in cancer clinical trials.",

Patients receive ongoing access to the Guide for up to 6 months. Patients also receive standard of care (SOC) supportive care services.\n\nARM II: Patients receive SOC supportive care services."
