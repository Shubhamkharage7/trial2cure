Urological disorder not well controlled. 7. Peptic ulcer disease requiring active treatment. 8. Cannot safely discontinue uric acid-lowering medication 14 days prior to study start to 9 days after the last dose of study medication was administered.\n\n  9. Surgery within the past 90 days prior to dosing as determined by the Principal Investigator to be clinically relevant.\n\n  10. Use of agents that could confound serum uric acid analysis (eg, long-term use of salicylates \\>100 mg or use of losartan).\n\n  11. Patients with an acute gout flare during the screening period that had not resolved 1 week prior to the first dose of study.\n\n  12. Hypersensitivity or intolerance to allopurinol, dotinurad or colchicine. 13. Positive for HLA-B\\*58:01 allele 14.

Patient's semi-recumbent blood pressure is less than 90/40 mmHg or greater than 155/90 mmHg during Screening and Day -1.\n\n  20. Stable dose of medications for long-term conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, asthma, etc. are allowed (provided that the patient has been on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to Screening and is not expected to require dose adjustment during the study through 7 days post study).\n\n  21. Patient reports receiving a strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 or a P-gp inhibitor within 1 month prior to study drug dosing, due to potential interactions with colchicine.\n\n  22.
