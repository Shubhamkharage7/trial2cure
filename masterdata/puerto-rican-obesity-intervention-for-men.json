            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to address the high rates of overweight/obesity in Puerto Rican (PR) men. The main question it aims to answer is whether virtual culturally relevant classes supporting physical activity and healthy eating for Puerto Rican men at different levels of acculturation to the US culture, will help these men achieve clinically meaningful weight loss.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to assess whether a virtual intervention tailored for Puerto Rican men that includes information about healthy eating, physical activity, sedentary behavior is feasible and acceptable compared to a general health (GH) intervention. It is also to determine whether this intervention leads to healthier eating, increased physical activity, less sedentary behavior (low activity), and clinically meaningful weight loss.\n\nHypothesis 1: Test the feasibility (recruitment, retention, adherence, fidelity) and acceptability (treatment components, intervention leaders, telehealth modality, technology and equipment, intervention satisfaction, satisfaction with randomized study, and measures) of a randomized 4-month synchronous telehealth lifestyle intervention led by a community health promoter and behavioral health specialist, who will receive either: TeleSalud HE-PA/SB\" or TeleSalud GH in 48 PR men.\n\nHypothesis 2: Demonstrate proof -of-concept by achieving a clinically significant weight reduction of \u2265 5% of baseline weight in the TeleSalud HE-PA/SB intervention after 4 months and at the end of the 4-month maintenance compared to the TeleSalud General Health intervention.\n\nResearchers will compare this to a group that will receive information about general health topics - not healthy eating or physical activity.\n\n* Participants in both groups will meet via virtually for 4 months (twice per week for 3 months and once per week for 1 month).\n* Participants will then meet one per month for a maintenance session for the next 4 months."

We will engage in Latino-centered moderate impact (increasing to vigorous) aerobics with Latino or salsa movements and music for 45-50 minutes. Aspects of kickboxing aerobics will be integrated. Goal: Exercise a minimum of 150-250 min./ week of moderate intensity. Weekly, Day 2: PA-SB identical PA-SB to Day 1.
