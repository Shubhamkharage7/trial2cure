Patient outcomes will be tracked by (1) personal assessments (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months): drug use, overdose, healthcare utilization, and (2) clinical and administrative records (over approximately 24 months): drug treatment status and retention, physical and mental health diagnoses, arrest, incarceration, controlled substance use, and mortality. Multilevel models will be applied to test the intervention effects, controlling for possible temporal trends.",
            "detailedDescription": "In response to RFA-DA-18-005 (Expanding Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorders in the Context of the SAMHSA Opioid STR Grants, R21/R33), this project will develop and test a patient decision support tool called Patient Decision Aid for Medication-Assisted Treatment (PtDA-MAT) for use in the CA H\\&SS. The PtDA-MAT is designed to (1) improve patient knowledge and involvement and to subsequently improve treatment adherence and outcomes and (2) to support clinicians in informing and communicating with their patients with OUD along a continuum of care. The 3 year project will assess the effectiveness of the PtDA-MAT in a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in CA H\\&SS (stratified by rural vs. non-rural areas) for adults with OUD. Patient outcomes will be tracked by (1) personal assessments (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months): drug use, overdose, healthcare utilization, and (2) clinical and administrative records (over an average of 24 months): drug treatment status and retention, physical and mental health diagnoses, arrest, incarceration, controlled substance use, and mortality. Multilevel models will be applied to test the intervention effects, controlling for possible temporal trends."
