            "briefSummary": "The study objective is to assess the impact of an automated electronic health record (EHR)-based intervention that leverages e-prescriptions to support pharmacist adherence to recommended dispensing practices, with the goal of reducing parent dosing errors.\n\nSpecifically, the study aims are to: 1) Examine the efficacy of the EHR-based intervention in improving pharmacy dispensing practices, including a) adherence to mL-only dosing and b) provision of optimal dosing tools; 2) Examine the efficacy of the EHR-based intervention in reducing parent dosing errors. The study will also explore whether implementation of the EHR-based intervention will reduce disparities in dosing errors by parent health literacy and LEP, and explore the efficacy of the EHR-based intervention in reducing ADEs.\n\nA pre-/post-implementation study will be performed with English- and Spanish-speaking parents of children prescribed oral liquid medications in the pediatric emergency room, outpatient general pediatric clinic, and pediatric subspecialty clinics of 2 New York City hospital systems (NYU Langone Health - Brooklyn and NYC Health+Hospitals - Bellevue Hospital). Prior to implementation, e-Rx's will be generated by the EHR in the usual fashion; after implementation, e-Rx's will be generated by the EHR with instructions to the dispensing pharmacy to: 1) keep the dosing instructions in mL-only, and 2) dispense a specific dosing tool based on the amount prescribed.\n\nThe proposed project is consistent with a growing national focus on promoting the adoption of evidence-based strategies to improve disease management that address the needs of those with low health literacy and LEP from groups like the Joint Commission and the AHRQ."
