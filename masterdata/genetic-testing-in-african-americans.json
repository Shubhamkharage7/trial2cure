            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot/feasibility study to conduct genetic testing using tumor/blood samples of African American and Caucasian patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer following surgery at AU Health Medical Center. The aim of the pilot/feasibility study is to sequence a panel of cancer genes on paired tumor/blood (germline) samples of patients with ovarian and endometrial tumors at a two-week time point following surgery at AU Medical Center. While paired testing of tumor and blood (germline) provides direct clinical value to patients, investigators propose to study whether investigators can define and overcome such minority barriers among the Georgia Cancer Center (GCC)/AU Health Medical Center (AUMC) patient population.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to identify genetic mutations using a sequence a panel to detect cancer genes on paired tumor/blood (germline) samples particularly (AA) patients with ovarian, endometrial, fallopian or primary peritoneal carcinoma as AA individuals with cancer are less prone to accept a recommendation to undergo genetic testing. Approximately 30 subjects will participate in this study at Georgia Cancer Center/AU Health Medical Center.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo test the feasibility of this approach designed to provide a preliminary statistical analysis among the number of patients to overcome minority barriers among the GCC/AUMC patient population.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. Measure attitudes toward early testing.\n2. Compare rates of participation based on messaging of benefits between Caucasians and AA\n\nSubjects must meet all inclusion criteria of the study. There are no exclusion criteria.\n\nPatients will be identified by an AU Health gynecologic oncologist (SG, BR, RH). A research coordinator will be deployed to the clinic at the 2-week post-biopsy visit.\n\nAll subjects who consent to participate a clinical research coordinator will ask for their permission to provide a matched tumor and blood sample for genetic testing. If consented the subjects will be given a questionnaire regarding their knowledge of genetic testing for germline mutations. Tumor and blood samples will be collected for testing and sent to the Georgia Esoteric and Molecular Laboratory. It is estimated that it will take approximately one year to fully accrue and complete assessments on all participants entered on this study."
