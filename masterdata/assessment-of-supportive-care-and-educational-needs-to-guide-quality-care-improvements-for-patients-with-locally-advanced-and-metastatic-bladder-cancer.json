Adult individuals diagnosed with Stage 4 incurable locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer will be included in this study and asked to participate in a focus group, complete a screening tool, or complete a survey. All data collected will be linked to a study ID number and HIPAA identifiers will not be linked to study data. Identifying information (ie: name, mrn, email, phone number) will be utilized for study recruitment and identifying eligible patients. Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation."
