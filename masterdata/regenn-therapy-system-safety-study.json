The main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n* The device-related serious adverse event rate.\n* Patient post-operative pain as assessed using a validated pain measurement scoring system.\n* The number and type of adverse events.\n* The rate of delayed seroma formation.\n\nParticipants will\n\n* Be screened for their suitability to participate in the investigational study using questions about their health, medical history, and current medications.\n* Undergo a physical exam, an assessment of patient vital signs and routine blood analyses.\n* Complete an Informed Consent Form if selected to participate in the investigational study.\n* Be randomly assigned to the different study arms.\n* Not change the operation of their respective device or to disturb components of their device.\n* Notify their surgeon or designated healthcare provider should they have any questions or encounter any issues with their device.\n* Attend two post-operative visits at approximately one month and three months."
