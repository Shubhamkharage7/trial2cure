Participants will be randomized to one of four groups based on assignment to iQuit Mindfully text messages (yes/no) and in-person MBAT (yes/no):\n\n* Usual Care (self-help materials + nicotine patch and nicotine lozenge treatment)\n* MBAT (8 weekly virtual MBAT sessions + self-help materials + nicotine patch and nicotine lozenge treatment)\n* iQuit Mindfully (iQuit Mindfully text messages + self-help materials + nicotine patch and nicotine lozenge treatment)\n* MBAT + iQuit Mindfully (8 weekly virtual MBAT sessions + iQuit Mindfully text messages + self-help materials + nicotine patch and nicotine lozenge treatment)\n\nAll study participants will receive self-help smoking cessation materials, including the \"Clearing the Air\" booklet developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and a referral to the Tobacco Cessation Quitline (1-800-QUIT-NOW). All study participants will also receive nicotine patches and lozenges. Assessments will occur at baseline and weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8. Follow-up assessments will occur at weeks 12 and 24."
