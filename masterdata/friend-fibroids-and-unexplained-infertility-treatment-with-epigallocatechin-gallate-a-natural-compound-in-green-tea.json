            "briefSummary": "The objective of this study is to determine the effect of low caffeine green tea extract containing 45% epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on fibroids and subsequent pregnancy and live births in women seeking fertility treatment.\n\nThe population will consist of 50 women desirous of conceiving, ages \u226518 to \u226440 years (at time of consent), and known to have class 2-6 fibroids, according to the FIGO staging system.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized double-blinded clinical trial to determine the effect of low caffeine green tea extract on fibroids and subsequent pregnancy in women seeking fertility treatment. The investigators hypothesize that EGCG in low caffeine green tea extract will reduce the fibroid size, improve the quality of endometrium, and increase the likelihood of pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate live birth outcomes for women with unexplained infertility who have uterine fibroids. Participants will be randomized to either oral low caffeine green tea extract (1650mg/day) vs. placebo along ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate and timed intrauterine insemination for up to 4 cycles.\n\nEndpoints\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\n- Our primary endpoint is cumulative live birth rate.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n* The conception rate.\n* The miscarriage rate.\n* The change of fibroid volume, symptom severity score, and health-related quality-of-life score, from baseline to completion of treatment, and endometrial receptivity biomarkers.\n* Time to pregnancy\n\nThis will be a randomized, multi-center, prospective, and double-blind clinical trial of low caffeine green tea extract versus placebo. Fifty (50) participants will be randomized via computer-generated randomization schedule to receive either:\n\n1. low caffeine green tea extract (1650mg in 6 capsules) taken orally on a daily basis along with Clomiphene citrate-intrauterine insemination (CC-IUI) cycle, up to 4 cycles if no pregnancy is achieved. Participant will stop green tea if she becomes pregnant.\n\n   or\n2. matched (smell, taste, color, texture) placebo capsules taken orally on a daily basis along with CC-IUI cycle, up to 4 cycles if no pregnancy is achieved. Participant will stop placebo if she becomes pregnant.\n\nThe randomization scheme will be on a 3:1 basis in favor of green tea extract, thus 37 participants will be assigned to the first arm (green tea extract) and 13 participants to the second arm (placebo).\n\nClomiphene citrate will be taken for 5 days on Day 3 +/- 2 days of the participant's cycle."

Participants with only intracavity uterine fibroid (FIGO Type 0 or Type 1) when not in combination with other types of fibroids (FIGO type 2-6).\n2. Currently pregnant.\n3. Clinical intrauterine miscarriages prior to initiating participation: participants must wait 3 months. No exclusion for biochemical pregnancies.\n4. Subjects using Green Tea/EGCG within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment. Matcha (Japanese green tea), maca powder, green tea beverages and all other forms of green tea require a 2-week wash-out.\n5. Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding.\n6. Suspicious ovarian mass.\n7. Participants on depo-progestins, or hormonal implants (including Implanon). A two-month washout period will be required prior to screening for participants on these agents. Longer washouts may be necessary for certain depot contraceptive forms or implants, especially when the implants are still in place.\n8. Known 21-hydroxylase deficiency or other enzyme defects causing congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n9. Uncontrolled diabetes with HbA1c \\> 6.5%\n10. Known significant anemia (Hemoglobin \\<8 g/dL).\n11. History of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or cerebrovascular event.\n12. Known heart disease (New York Heart Association Class II or higher).\n13. Known Liver disease (defined as AST or ALT\\>2 times normal, or total bilirubin \\>2.5 mg/dL).\n14.

Stage 3 and 4 endometriosis and endometriomas \\> 3cm (as per PI discretion) .\n24. Known polycystic ovarian syndrome as evidenced by anovulation or oligoovulation hirsutism and/or elevated testosterone levels, and ovarian morphology on ultrasound examination.\n25.
