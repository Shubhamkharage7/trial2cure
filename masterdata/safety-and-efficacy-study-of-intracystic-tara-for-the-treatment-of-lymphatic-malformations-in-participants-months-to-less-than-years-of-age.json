The Phase 2a safety lead-in, age de-escalation study is designed to establish the safety of TARA-002 in older participants 6 years to less than 18 years before proceeding to younger participants 2 years to less than 6 years, then 6 months to less than 2 years. The Phase 2b is an expansion study in which enrollment of participants will be initiated after safety has been established in each cohort during the Phase 2a safety lead-in study. Each participant will receive up to 4 injections of TARA-002 spaced approximately 6 weeks apart."
