            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial compares the use of tobacco flavored electronic cigarettes (ECs) to non-tobacco flavored ECs on smoking behavior in current cigarette smokers to use of nicotine replacement therapy (patches and lozenges). ECs may reduce cigarette craving and withdrawal symptoms, increase motivation and confidence to stop cigarette smoking, and decrease cigarette smoking and dependence. By comparing participants' preferred flavor ECs (PEC) to tobacco flavor ECs (TEC) to NRT, researchers hope to determine the effect of EC flavors on appeal and use, and learn how ECs affect smoking behaviors and health.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine PEC versus (vs.) TEC vs. nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) on tobacco use patterns including product switching, abstinence from cigarettes, and number of cigarettes smoked.\n\nII. Examine PEC vs. TEC vs. NRT on cigarette craving, withdrawal symptoms, and perceived nicotine dependence.\n\nIII. Examine PEC vs. TEC on product appeal and uptake, including initial trial, days used during period of product provision, and purchase and continued use after 12 weeks.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants receive PEC for 14 weeks, including a 2-week pre-switch period to become familiar with usage.\n\nARM II: Participants receive TEC for 14 weeks, including a 2-week pre-switch period to become familiar with usage.\n\nARM III: Participants receive NRT (nicotine patches and lozenges) for 14 weeks, including a 2-week pre-switch period to become familiar with usage.\n\nParticipants in all arms participate in discussions throughout the trial.\n\nSURVEILLANCE PHASE: Participants in all arms are followed for 12-weeks after completion of study procedures."
