            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests the effects of ruxolitinib in combination with a de-intensified HLH-94 drug regimen has on patients with newly diagnosed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a disorder caused by dysregulated immune responses (that is, immune responses that are too strong and cause inflammatory damage to normal tissues). The therapy used for HLH decreases the activity of the immune system. Ruxolitinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the signals that cause inflammatory cells to multiply. De-intensified HLH-94 is a treatment regimen that includes 4 weeks of dexamethasone with the dose being decreased each week, and up to 4 weeks of etoposide. This combination is commonly used to treat HLH. Dexamethasone is a steroid medication that works by fighting inflammation. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and may kill cancer cells and is used to kill the types of white blood cells in HLH that are attacking the body. Giving ruxolitinib in combination with a de-intensified HLH-94 drug regimen may reduce toxic exposure to therapy while maintaining efficacy in patients with HLH.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of ruxolitinib with de-intensified HLH-94 (dHLH-94; 4 weeks of dexamethasone and etoposide) for newly diagnosed adults with HLH.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe the toxicities of ruxolitinib in combination with de-intensified HLH-94 for the treatment of adult HLH.\n\nII. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of using ruxolitinib in combination with dHLH-94 for the treatment of adult HLH, stratified by malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (mHLH) and non-malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (nmHLH).\n\nIII. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) when using ruxolitinib in combination with de-intensified HLH-94 for the treatment of adult HLH, stratified by mHLH and nmHLH.\n\nIV. To evaluate the time to cancer diagnosis for HLH, among those ultimately diagnosed with mHLH.\n\nV. To evaluate the time to cancer-directed therapy from the diagnosis of mHLH. VI. To describe the practice patterns of adjunctive therapies (i.e., rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG), anakinra) for HLH.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To identify T cell subsets that are differentially increased in adult HLH (comparing mHLH and nmHLH).\n\nII. To evaluate the association of CD8+ T cell subsets expressing CD4dim/CD38+/HLA-DR+ (\"activated T cells\") with clinical deterioration.\n\nIII. To evaluate the relationship between the peripheral blood cytokine microenvironment (e.g., Interleukin 1b (IL-1b), Interleukin 2 (IL-2), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 10 (IL-10), Interleukin 18 (IL-18), Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha) and laboratory parameters (ferritin, blood counts, liver function, fibrinogen), ruxolitinib pharmacokinetic levels and clearance, and response to ruxolitinib.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nDuring induction therapy, participants receive ruxolitinib plus de-intensified HLH-94 induction with dexamethasone and etoposide and then based on response, another 2 weeks of treatment will be given in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After induction therapy, participants receive continuation therapy with ruxolitinib for a total of up to 6 months after first administration of study drug in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then at 3, 6, and 12 months"

Respiratory support including intubation/ventilation is allowed.\n\n  \\* Vasopressors are allowed if not required other than low dose vasoconstrictors to compensate the effects of sedation.\n* Newly diagnosed acute and clinically active tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C.\n\n  * Patients with active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not excluded from this study but must be on antiretrovirals.\n  * Patients with hepatitis B or C viremia can be on study if the hepatitis is not considered clinically active and/or if it is chronic. These patients should be discussed with the principal investigator.\n* Individuals with a prior malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen.\n* Individuals with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-associated HLH.\n* No prior HLH-directed therapy except corticosteroids for \\< 2 consecutive weeks and anakinra.\n\n  * Adjunctive approaches such as rituximab for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia or IVIG for viral infection are permitted.\n  * Emapalumab, alemtuzumab, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), tocilizumab, siltuximab, or prior ruxolitinib are NOT permitted. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are not permitted in the initial induction period.\n* Hypersensitivity to ruxolitinib or any of its excipients",
