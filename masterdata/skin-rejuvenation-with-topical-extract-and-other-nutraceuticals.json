            "briefSummary": "Hemp extract has been shown in several pre-clinical and clinical studies to have anti-aging effects on the skin through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, in addition resveratrol, thyme and caffeine have been shown to have anti-aging effects related to fibrillar collagen production and extracellular matrix production in the dermis.\n\nA combination of these four ingredients will be used in a vehicle of fermented medium chain triglyceride oil and skin shave biopsies will be taken before and after 90 days use of the topical to look for objective evidence of anti-aging effects in the dermis and epidermis.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a case series of 25 adults over age 50 identified through social media outreach in the Tampa Bay area. Each subject will be given a topical serum and advised to apply it once daily to the specific two by two inch area of skin under study (forearm or back of the neck). The serum will be comprised of hemp-extract, resveratrol, caffeine, thyme oil and fermented medium chain triglyceride as a vehicle. The skin anti-aging serum is expected to contain hemp-extract 5%, caffeine 2%, Thyme essential oil 2% and resveratrol 0.5%. The subjects will use the test formulation for 90 days. The subjects will jhave shaved skin biopsies taken on either the forearm or back of the neck. The biopsies will be done on day zero and on day 90.\n\nNone of the subjects are currently using anti-aging therapies. No other anti-aging therapy will be used during the 90 days of the research.\n\nThe subjects will be advised to apply a thin layer of the serum once each night at bedtime. To the area of skin under study (forearm or back of the neck). The one-ounce bottle of serum is expected to last for the entire 90 days of the study. The subjects will be reminded each day via text messaging to use the product and each subject will be required to text back that the daily treatment has been applied.\n\nThe 'before and after' shaved biopsies will be independently evaluated by Dr. Michael Morgan, board certified Dermatopathologist at KorPath, Inc. He will perform hematoxylin and eosin (H\\&E) staining, for histological analysis for morphology of the dermis and epidermis and histochemical staining for collagen and matrix analysis.\n\nThe subjects will be independently clinically evaluated by Dr. Kathy Anderson, board certified Dermatologist. She will determine \"before and after\" skin wrinkling scores using standard recognized metrics.\n\nEach subject will have a diary app added to their smart phones to document daily use and potential adverse effects.\n\nThe results will be statistically evaluated with a standard for comparison. Study results with a p-value less than 0.05 will be determined to be statistically significant and the result will be evaluated for efficiency compared to generally recognized therapies\n\n. The study will be prepared in standard fashion and submitted to recognized peer-review medical journals."
