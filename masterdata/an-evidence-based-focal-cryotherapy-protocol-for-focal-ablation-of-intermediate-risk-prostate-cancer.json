Please note that every effort will be made to correlate microultrasound findings with MRI, in order to determine if positive results are from the same MRIvisible focus. This determination will be made by the surgeon performing the biopsy.\n  * Note that GGG 1 disease at sites other than ablation zone are allowed provided these are 6mm or less in size. PSA \u226415 ng/mL, or PSAD \\<0.15 if PSA \\>15 ng/mL\n* Physician can fully visualize the prostate on transrectal ultrasound on entry biopsy\n* Lesion anatomically amenable to cryotherapy treatment based on treating physician's discretion\n* Willing and able to read, understand and sign the study specific informed consent document\n* Willing and agreeable to comply with study protocol requirements, including focal cryotherapy ablation and all follow up visit requirements\n* Patients must consent to investigative laboratory protocol (such as, but not limited to, 2021- 0560)\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Gleason grade group 4 or 5 disease\n* Medical history or concurrent disease, which in the opinion of the investigator, poses the patient at significant peri-operative risk of complication due to anesthesia or the procedure\n* Active urinary tract infection\n* Any previous treatment for prostate cancer, including radiation therapy, hormonal treatment, biologic therapy for prostate cancer, or chemotherapy\n* Prior TURP or other prostate outlet procedure such as HoLEP, greenlight, microwave ablation, aquablation, UroLift, or simple prostatectomy.\n* Previous rectal surgery (other than hemorrhoidectomy) or history of rectal disease\n* Inability to obtain prostate MRI (ex. due to claustrophobia, pacemaker, or prohibitive implants)\n* Unwilling to consent to laboratory investigative protocol (such as, but not limited to, 2021- 0560)",
