Prospective enrollment will be continued until the sample size is achieved up to one year from start date (October 2020).\n\nSecondary to slower than anticipated enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic and initial exclusion of AOM, following protocol amendment, patient enrollment will be continued until the sample size is achieved up to 18 months from amendment approval (anticipate April 2022 - October 2023). A historical matched case cohort (standard of care) at the two hospitals based on ICD10 codes associated with DFI \\[E11.(621, 622), E10.(621, 622); L97.(509, 521, 522, 523, 524, 529)\\], including subjects with AOM \\[M86.(08-09, 10, 16-19, 8X0, 8X7-8X9, 9) will be utilized for comparison.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a year-long study with planned enrollment of 57 patients (in addition to 114 historical control patients) evaluating the use of omadacycline for treatment of diabetic foot infections (DFI). Omadacycline (Nuzyra\u00ae) is a FDA approved antibiotic for skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired pneumonia. This study is considered to be investigational because data is being collected on the use of Omadacycline for the treatment of DFI with or without AOM."
