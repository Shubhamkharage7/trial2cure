            "detailedDescription": "The study will aim for a sample size of approximately 150 participants (equally distributed between 3 international sites) between the ages of 3 months and 5 years referred to the respective Dermatology Departments for management of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. They will be sequentially recruited and randomized to the wool-to-standard clothing arm or standard clothing-to-wool arm.\n\nThe study will run for 12 weeks for each participant with two consecutive 6-week periods for each intervention, either of wool followed by standard clothing or standard followed by wool clothing. Participants will be assessed by a blinded trained researcher, at their initial appointment, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks post commencement of the first intervention.\n\nThe primary outcome is the severity of atopic dermatitis at 6 weeks post commencement of each intervention i.e.at week 6 and week 12. Severity of atopic eczema will be measured using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).\n\nSecondary outcomes include the severity and change in the severity of eczema using the EASI at 3 weeks, the validated Investigators Global Assessment for atopic dermatitis (vIGA-AD\u2122) score and quality of life assessment using the children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (cDLQI) at 3 and 6 weeks of each 6 week intervention period, as well as weekly Patient Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (PO-SCORAD) scores."
