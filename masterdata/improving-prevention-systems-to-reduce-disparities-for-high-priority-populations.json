The goal of the study is to develop and test the impact of this new intervention on improving rates of HIV testing, linkage to HIV prevention/care, and PrEP uptake among highest risk contacts recently exposed to HIV. We will conduct a 6-month pilot project, followed by a cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which 12 clusters of NYC neighborhoods are exposed to the intervention sequentially, with three clusters moving from control to intervention every 6 months (n = 1150). Primary outcomes are HIV testing, timely PrEP/ARV uptake, and linkage to PrEP/HIV care. Secondary outcomes are STD testing and receipt of STD treatment (if indicated)."
