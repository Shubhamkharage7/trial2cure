            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test the neurophysiological mechanisms of an intervention to reduce symptoms of dissociation in traumatized people. The intervention will be tested in dissociative traumatized people at two sites: Emory University and University of Pittsburgh. The researchers are interested in whether neural networks associated with attentional control and interoceptive awareness can be enhanced in this population. The researchers propose to evaluate whether different body-focused and non-body focused interventions can change these mechanisms.",
            "detailedDescription": "People exposed to chronic trauma face devastating effects to the brain and body. Chronically traumatized people become highly distressed when attending to emotional stimuli, which can lead to feelings of detachment from their bodies and environment. It is difficult to engage highly dissociative traumatized patients in trauma-focused treatment; however, these patients benefit from acquiring basic emotion regulation skills, including present-centeredness and body awareness. Various practices that involve present-centeredness and body awareness (including mindfulness-based interventions) have been shown to demonstrate short-term and long-term improvement in cognition, emotion regulation and clinical symptoms in dissociative people with trauma exposure.\n\nIn order to address this issue, the researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that engage present-centered awareness and/or body focus."
