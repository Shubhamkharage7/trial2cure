            "briefSummary": "This is a multicenter, open label, nonrandomized, sequential dose escalation/cohort expansion, multiple dose study designed to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and PK as well as preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 in subjects with advanced solid tumors and breast cancer. The study will be done in two phases, described below.\n\nPhase 1a (Dose Escalation Phase):\n\nThe Phase 1a portion is designed to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of orally administered BTX-A51. BTX-A51 will be administered once daily on a weekly schedule of 5 days on/2 days off. Dose escalation will proceed according to a modified 3+3 design. Each cycle will consist of 28 days (4 weeks), and the DLT observation period will be the first cycle (i.e., 28 days after initiation of dosing). A DLT may be observed in no more than 0 out of 3 or 1 out of 6 subjects who have completed the DLT observation period before the next cohort initiates accrual. Barring DLT, sequential dose escalation of BTX-A51 is planned with up to a total of 6 dose levels; on the basis of these an MTD will be identified. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level with a subject incidence of DLTs of 0 or 1 out of 6 during the first 28 days of study drug dosing. A minimum of 6 subjects needs to be treated at a dose level before this dose level can be deemed as the MTD.\n\nPhase 1b (Cohort Expansion Phase):\n\nDose expansion may begin when the RP2D has been determined. Up to 40 additional subjects will be enrolled to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 in subjects with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-), GATA3 mutant (mt) and wild-type (wt) metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Dosing in this phase of the study consists of the first cycle of therapy (i.e., 28 days)."
