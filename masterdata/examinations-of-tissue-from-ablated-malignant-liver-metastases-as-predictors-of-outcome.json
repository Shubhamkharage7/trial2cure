The investigators want to know if a test can help predict whether the ablation worked.\n\nThe treated tumor is normally evaluated with CT. The CT shows signs of treated tumor(s) in the area treated by ablation. However, cancer cells may begin to grow in or near the treated area. The CT scan cannot tell us if the cells are new cancer cells or if they are healthy liver cells that just look different because of the ablation. The test the investigators will study should be able to tell us the difference."
