            "detailedDescription": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC 1) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC 2) leading to overactivation of the mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway resulting in multiorgan disease. Specifically, patients are at risk for autism, epilepsy, intellectual disability, renal cysts, tuberous sclerosis associated neuropsychiatric disorder (TAND), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and benign tumors throughout the body including subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), renal and liver angiomyolipomas (AMLs), and cardiac rhabdomyomas (rhabdomyomas).\n\nSporadic LAM occurs mostly in women and many patients with LAM have TSC gene mutations.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to gather information to help clinicians develop evidence-based guidance for the care of TSC and LAM patients during pregnancy and to provide screening recommendations for fetal TSC.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete monthly online surveys screening for changes in the pregnancy, maternal health/medication changes, and other care. For infants enrolled after birth, clinical data will be collected and reviewed for up to 5 years of age."
