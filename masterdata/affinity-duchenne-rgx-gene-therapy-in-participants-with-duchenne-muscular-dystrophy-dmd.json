            "briefSummary": "RGX-202 is a gene therapy designed to deliver a transgene for a novel microdystrophin that includes functional elements of naturally-occurring dystrophin including the C-Terminal (CT) domain.\n\nThis is a multicenter, open-label dose evaluation clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous (IV) dose of RGX-202 in participants with Duchenne.",
            "detailedDescription": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne) is a rare genetic disorder, caused by mutations in the gene responsible for making dystrophin, a protein of central importance for muscle cell structure and function. The absence of functional dystrophin protein in individuals with Duchenne results in cell damage during muscle contraction leading to cell death, inflammation, and fibrosis in muscle tissues, and ultimately progressive muscle weakness. RGX-202 is designed to use the AAV8 vector to deliver a transgene to muscle cells that encodes a novel microdystrophin that includes the functional elements of naturally occurring dystrophin including the C-Terminal (CT) domain. This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose evaluation clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (microdystrophin protein levels), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary clinical efficacy of RGX-202 in 2 dose groups over 52 weeks when administered by one-time intravenous infusion (IV) in ambulatory male pediatric participants with Duchenne.\n\nThe first 2 participants (ages 4-11 years old) in the first dose group (Cohort 1) will be dosed with 1x10\\^14 genome copies (GC)/kg body weight in a staggered fashion, at least 4 weeks apart, following increasing body weight: \u226425kg and \u226435kg. After an independent safety data review, 2 participants (ages 4-11 years old) in the second dose group (Cohort 2) will be dosed with 2x10\\^14 GC/kg body weight in a staggered fashion, at least 4 weeks apart, following increasing body weight: \u226425kg and \u226435kg. After an independent safety data review, an expansion phase of Cohort 2 may allow for up to five additional participants (ages 4-11 years old) to be enrolled. A separate group (Cohort 1b) was added and expected to enroll in the first dose group, a single patient, 4-11 years old, with at-risk mutations (premature stop codon mutation in exons 12-17). An additional group was added for the second dose group (Cohort 2c) and expected to enroll up to five, 1-3-years-old participants, must be \u2265 10 kg at the time of screening. A total of up to 15 participants may be enrolled in the study with 3 participants receiving dose level 1 and up to 12 participants receiving dose level 2.\n\nA comprehensive, short-term, prophylactic immunosuppression regimen will be administered during treatment to mitigate a potential immune response."
