Subjects will be assessed for eligibility through screening tests conducted within 28 days prior to enrollment. Following completion of screening tests and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be enrolled to complete pre-dosing requirements and questionnaires during screening window as per protocol.\n\nThere are two phases. In Phase 1, all patients will be given ARD-501 at 0.2mg/kg, dependent on their body weight (BW), for 7 days followed by a 7-day washout period. Subsequently, in Phase 2, patients will be blinded and randomized at a 1:1 ratio in two groups. Each group will be exposed to ARD-501 at 0.5mg/kg BW and placebo in alternate order. Each dosing week is followed by a 7-day washout.\n\nAll available safety and tolerability data will be evaluated throughout study conduct."
