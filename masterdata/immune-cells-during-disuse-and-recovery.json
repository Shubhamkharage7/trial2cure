The enrollment goal is 45 participants. The study will occur over the course of 1-2 months where participants will undergo testing before and after a 2-week limb immobilization period.",

After the visit, participants will be provided with a step activity monitor to track their level of activity. A dietary assessment will also be determined.\n\nVisit 2- At a later time, the participant will return to the research center for a biopsy, blood draw, body composition scan, MRI and muscle strength testing.\n\n2-week leg immobilization period- After visit 2 , the participant will return home and undergo a 14-day leg immobilization period using the equipment and instructions provided at visit 2.\n\nVisit 3- During the limb immobilization period, participant will return to the research center for a single blood draw.\n\nVisit 4- At the end of the 2-week limb immobilization period, the participant will return to the research center to undergo another biopsy, blood draw, body composition scan, MRI and muscle strength testing.\n\nVisit 5- 2 days after the 2-week limb immobilization period, the participant will return for a biopsy and blood draw.\n\nVisit 6- 7 days after the 2-week limb immobilization period, the participant will be asked to return for a final biopsy, blood draw, body composition scan, MRI and muscle strength testing."
