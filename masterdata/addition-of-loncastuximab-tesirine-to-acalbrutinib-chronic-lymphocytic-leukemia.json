The total number of participants enrolled will depend on the frequency of DLTs and when the MTD is determined. The maximum number of patients at a given dose level is 12.\n\nThe dose of acalabrutinib will be fixed and loncastuximab tesirine will be titrated as in dose level table 1 below.\n\nTable 1. Dose levels Dose Level Schedule\n\n1. 45 \u00b5g/kg Loncastuximab Tesirine + Acalabrutinib 100 mg BID\n2. 60 \u00b5g/kg Loncastuximab Tesirine + Acalabrutinib 100 mg BID\n3. 75 \u00b5g/kg Loncastuximab Tesirine + Acalabrutinib 100 mg BID\n4. 90 \u00b5g /kg Loncastuximab Tesirine (for first 2 cycles followed by 75\u00b5g/kg for subsequent cycles) + Acalabrutinib 100 mg BID\n\nThe DLT evaluation period is two cycles (42 days).\n\nLoncastuximab Tesirine will be given as an IV infusion, each cycle is a 21 day cycle, with Loncastuximab Tesirine given day 1 of each cycle."
