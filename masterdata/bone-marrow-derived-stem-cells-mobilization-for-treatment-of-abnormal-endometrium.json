PLERIXAFOR is administered via the subcutaneous route, as a single dose of 20mg.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine if the administration of PLERIXAFOR for autologous, peripheral stem cell mobilization and administration will restore endometrial function in women with AS, AE, and RIF, and allow for pregnancy implantation."
