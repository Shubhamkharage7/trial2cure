            "briefSummary": "Canavan Disease is a congenital white matter disorder caused by mutations to the gene encoding for aspartoacylase (ASPA). Expression of ASPA is restricted to oligodendrocytes, the sole white matter producing lineage in the brain. ASPA supports myelination in the capacity of its sole known function, namely, the catabolism of N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Inherited mutations that result in loss of ASPA catabolic activity result in a typically severe phenotype of Canavan Disease, characterized by chronically elevated brain NAA, gross motor abnormalities, hypomyelination, progressive spongiform degeneration of the brain, epilepsy, blindness, and a short life expectancy. Disease severity is correlated with residual levels of enzyme activity. Reconstitution of ASPA function in oligodendrocytes of the brains of Canavan patients is expected to rescue NAA metabolism in its natural cellular compartment and support myelination/remyelination by resident white matter producing cells. This protocol directly targets oligodendrocytes in the brain, which are intimately involved with disease initiation and progression. Targeting oligodendrocytes offers the safest and most direct therapy for affected individuals.\n\nThe latest generation AAV viral vector (rAAV-Olig001-ASPA) will be administered to patients using neurosurgical procedure which involves direct administration of gene therapy to affected regions of the brain. Outcome measures for the open label clinical trial include longitudinal clinical assessments and brain imaging.\n\nCurrently, there is no effective treatment for Canavan Disease. The purpose of this study is to validate a new technology targeted to the cells most affected by Canavan Disease in the safest way possible.\n\nThe study investigators are committed to supporting the Rare Disease \\& Canavan Disease Communities. For more information, please contact Jordana Holovach, Head of Communications and Community at PatientAdvocacy@myrtellegtx.com.",
            "detailedDescription": "rAAV-Olig001-ASPA is the first gene therapy designed to target the oligodendrocytes, which are critical for myelination and brain development.\n\nThis study is a Phase 1/2 First-In-Human protocol designed to obtain safety, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy data following neurosurgical administration of a single dose of rAAV-Olig001-ASPA delivered intracerebroventricularly in up to 24 children with Canavan Disease.\n\nPatients with a diagnosis of typical Canavan Disease who meet all eligibility criteria may be enrolled in this open-label, sequential cohort study of a single dose of rAAV-Olig001-ASPA."
