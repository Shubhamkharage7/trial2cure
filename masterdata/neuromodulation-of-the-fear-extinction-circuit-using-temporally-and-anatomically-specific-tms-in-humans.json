            "briefSummary": "This study aims to explore the mechanisms of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) impacts fear circuits. The overarching objectives are to understand how varying TMS parameters affect targeted brain regions in order to optimize its impact on enhancing fear extinction memory consolidation in a population with known fear extinction deficiencies: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 250 subjects will take part in this research study across NYU Langone Health. The study will include preliminary screenings, baseline visits, and experimental visits across four days",
            "detailedDescription": "The experiments proposed are aimed to understand how timing and location of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in humans will impact their ability to reduce conditioned fear responses and impact the activation of their brain regions involved in fear regulation. The researchers will use a novel TMS approach to vary timing and location of its delivery so that the researchers can characterize and establish best time and location to obtain optimal impact on fear inhibition, and then test these parameters in PTSD patients and see if such can rescue extinction deficits in PTSD. The anticipated impact is to enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of associated with TMS use and explore potential novel approaches for advancing PTSD treatment."
