            "briefSummary": "This is a single center, single surgeon, prospective, randomized trial examining the addition of Cryo Nerve Block during robot assisted thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection surgery",
            "detailedDescription": "Thoracic surgical procedures are consistently reported to be among the most painful surgical incisions currently used. Trauma to the skin, muscle, intercostal nerves, bones and pleura all contribute and lead to activation of various pain pathways including somatic, visceral, neurogenic and phrenic. In the short term, this pain leads to ineffective cough and pulmonary hygiene resulting in respiratory complications and prolonged hospital stays while in the longer term it leads to prolonged recovery, delayed return to work and in some instances, chronic post thoracotomy pain syndromes. Minimally invasive approaches such as standard thoracoscopy or robotic assisted thoracoscopy have certainly decreased some of this trauma as evidenced by decreased length of stays and decreased complication rates however even with these minimally invasive techniques, recovery to 80% of baseline is 25 days and 9.4% of patients are still using narcotics after 90-180 days.\n\nSeveral options are available in the management of pain following thoracic surgery with a multimodal pain medicine approach being most common. Opioids, unfortunately, are a relatively large part of this approach and are often relied upon despite their relatively unfavorable adverse event profile and risk for addiction. Many of the other pain adjuncts often used with thoracotomies such as epidural catheters or intraoperatively placed pain catheters are not really reasonable when using minimally invasive approaches as the hospital length of stay is 1-2 days. Intercostal cryoanalgesia has been shown to be a safe and effective strategy for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing thoracotomy. Recent studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of cryoanalgesia for post-thoracotomy pain in reduction of opioid requirement, reduction in post-operative pain scores, and superior pulmonary function (higher FEV1 and FVC values)5 and that it can produce temporary neurolysis for up to two months without long-term histological nerve damage. To date it has not been studied when using minimally invasive techniques whether it be standard thoracoscopy or robotic assisted thoracoscopy but it would stand to reason that it would be equally or maybe more effective in this patient population and truly maximize the benefits of a minimally invasive approach.\n\nWe therefore propose to assess whether intra-operative intercostal cryoanalgesia using the cryoICE\u00ae probe provides superior post-operative analgesia as compared to our current standard pain management strategy in patients undergoing robotic assisted thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection and allows for decreased opioid use and more rapid recovery."

In general, answers like no or that signal normal function are awarded 0 points and those that signal a pain related symptom or sign are awarded a number of points varying from 1 to 5, depending on the severity of the particular sign. The final score ranges from 0 to 24. The interpretation is that patients with scores below 12 are less likely to carry a neuropathic cause for their pain whilst in the case of patients scoring 12 or more, there is a higher chance for the underlying mechanism to be neuropathic.",
