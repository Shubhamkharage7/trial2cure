This study will also include civilian contractors who worked as part of these military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. The biorepository would store blood samples obtained from these patients during a clinic visit. The research database would store prospectively and retrospectively collected clinical and exposure data that would enable us to comprehensively characterize each case.",

The clinical data collected are part of the routine diagnosis and care of these patients. No additional procedures are required for the purpose of this research database. Collection of symptom and exposure data using a questionnaire designed for this study.\n\nAll NJH patients who served in southwest Asia will be approached for inclusion in the study. This will also attempt to contact patients evaluated previously at NJH for deployment-related lung disease to obtain informed consent to include data from their medical record and the research questionnaire in the database."

Blood and BAL fluid will be frozen and stored in -80 degree C freezers in the Occupational Medicine Laboratory until processed. If a patient will have a surgical or transbronchial biopsy as part of his or her clinical evaluation, any excess lung tissue that has been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded will also be collected and stored in the Occupational Medicine facilities."
