            "briefSummary": "This research study aims to identify MRI-based brain biomarkers that predict an individual's response to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). In particular, this study will focus on changes in cognition associated with DBS. A total of 55 participants with Parkinson's Disease planning to undergo DBS will be recruited from MUSCs Clinical DBS Program. Participants will undergo four visits, including a 1-hour screening visit, a 1.5-hour pre-DBS MRI scanning visit, and a 3.5-hour post-DBS cognitive assessment visit. In addition control participants without Parkinson's Disease will be recruited to undergo MRI scanning and cognitive assessments.",
            "detailedDescription": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a well-established surgical intervention to treat Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients with disabling motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Although this therapy is effective for motor complications, a subset of patients will go on to experience cognitive decline, which can overshadow improvements in the quality of life provided by STN-DBS. This accelerated decline in cognition occurs in patients despite rigorous evaluation of their neuropsychological status prior to surgery. While the factors contributing to cognitive decline following DBS remain unclear, there is evidence this may be the result of 1) limited cognitive reserve prior to DBS surgery, 2) stimulation that interferes with cognitive networks, and/or 3) a microlesion effect due to placement of the lead. Understanding how these factors contribute to DBS-induced cognitive decline has the potential to improve patient selection for surgery and optimize the selection of stimulation targets that minimize undesirable cognitive side effects."
