Part 1A (dose escalation) will determine the recommended dose of INCB123667 for expansion (RDE) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Part 1B (cohort dose expansion phase) will further explore antitumor activity of INCB123667 as a monotherapy in 6 tumor-specific cohorts at the RDE(s) defined in Part 1A."
