            "briefSummary": "The aim of the study is to investigate whether values clarification writing prompts administered via a prototype mobile application can help enhance motivation and facilitate decluttering in individuals with hoarding problems. This randomized control trial will help to (1) assess whether values clarification can improve outcomes in hoarding treatment by increasing motivation, (2) clarify which specific values clarification procedures are most beneficial, and (3) evaluate the impact of values clarification on overall symptoms and well-being. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group (receiving the values clarification intervention), psychological placebo group (self-reflection intervention), or the no intervention waitlist group.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized control trial study aims to investigate the efficacy of a values clarification prototype mobile application intervention in enhancing motivation and facilitating decluttering in individuals with clinical levels of hoarding symptoms. Participants will be recruited using a variety of recruitment methods (e.g., Google Ads, posts on relevant online groups such as Facebook groups, posting flyers, and provider referrals). Interested participants will first complete a pre-screen asking about their age, country of residence, and whether they own an appropriate mobile device (i.e. iOS or Android). Eligible participants, who must be at least 18 years old and residing in the United States, will be provided with a consent form to sign and then directed to further screening to determine whether they meet the clinical cutoff for hoarding symptoms. Individuals who decline to participate or are screened as ineligible will be screened out and provided with a brief list of other resources they may access for clutter/hoarding problems. Individuals who consent and are screened as eligible will be redirected to complete a baseline survey and then randomly assigned to one of three groups with equal probability: (1) Experimental group with the values clarification mobile application, (2) psychological placebo group with the self-reflection mobile application, and (3) no-treatment waitlist group. Four weeks after baseline, participants will be asked to complete a post-treatment survey and eight weeks after baseline, participants will be asked to complete a final, follow-up survey. The no-treatment waitlist participants will be given the opportunity to download and use either prototype mobile app, and participants assigned to use one of the apps will be given the opportunity to use the alternative app."
