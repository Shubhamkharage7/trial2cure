They will be asked to complete about 40 treatment sessions which include multiple stimulation sessions over the scalp and neck, followed by about 60 minutes of respiratory training. Assessment sessions will be completed prior at baseline, after 20 sessions and after 40 sessions of study treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to test a strategy to potentiate functional recovery of respiratory function in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Respiratory function is often impaired in individuals with high cervical spinal cord injury (SCI, C1-C5) leading to reduced quality of life and mortality. Currently, research has shown Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) targeting cortico-motoneuronal connections effectively promote recovery in upper and lower limbs, including functions such as grasping and locomotion. The overall goal of our proposal is to develop a non-invasive protocol using\n\nSTDP that can be used to strengthen synaptic plasticity and voluntary motor output in the diaphragm muscle in humans with high cervical SCI. To assess the effect of STDP on respiratory function in humans with high cervical SCI, we propose a pilot study of efficacy trial with the specific aim below:\n\nThe overall objective of this project is to investigate the efficacy of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) on respiratory function in humans with high cervical SCI.\n\nSpecific Aim: Examine the effect of STDP in respiratory function in humans with chronic high cervical SCI."
