            "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial studies the side effects and feasibility of total body irradiation using intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) when given in combination with cyclophosphamide prior to stem cell transplant to treat severe systemic sclerosis. IMRT delivers total body radiation therapy more precisely and may reduce radiation exposure to sensitive normal organs. Giving chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps make room in the bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. Giving IMRT and cyclophosphamide prior to stem cell transplant may work better in treating severe systemic sclerosis and reduce radiation doses to lung and kidneys compared to cyclophosphamide alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility of using IMRT to deliver total body irradiation (TBI) to 800 cGy while keeping mean lung and kidney doses to 200 cGy.\n\nII. To assess the safety/feasibility of total body irradiation using IMRT (IMRT TBI) in systemic sclerosis patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate dose homogeneity and dose sparing to lung and kidneys. II. To evaluate transplant-related mortality at 30 days and 100 days post IMRT TBI.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo TBI using IMRT twice daily (BID) on days -5 and -4 in the absence of disease progression or disease progression. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2 and undergo HSCT on day 0 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 30 and 100."
