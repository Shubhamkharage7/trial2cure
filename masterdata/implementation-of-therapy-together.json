            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to learn about the implementation of Therapy Together, a pediatric constraint-induced movement therapy program in young children with unilateral cerebral palsy. The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the Therapy Together program effective in improving hand function and occupational performance compared to usual care?\n* Is it feasible to implement the Therapy Together program within the standard care, early intervention framework?\n\nParticipants will participate in an 8-week pediatric constraint-induced movement therapy program. Researchers will compare the group completing the Therapy Together Program to a group that is receiving usual care to see if there is a difference in the change in hand function, occupational performance, and development.",
            "detailedDescription": "A pilot randomized waitlist control trial with early intervention therapists, infants/toddlers (ages 3 mo - 2 yrs 11 mo) with unilateral cerebral palsy (or at risk for developing cerebral palsy) and caregivers comparing Therapy Together to usual care followed by semi-structured interviews with caregivers and therapists will be utilized to examine the implementation and effectiveness of Therapy Together within early intervention.\n\nTherapy Together Program:\n\nThe Therapy Together program includes caregiver education and coaching on implementing therapeutic activities that are play-based, age-appropriate, and tailored to meet goals to improve arm/hand function. The child and caregiver complete 8 sessions with their early intervention therapist. The early intervention therapist is trained to educate the caregiver on the Therapy Together program, demonstrate how to engage the child in therapeutic activities, and observe the caregiver implement the program during each weekly session. The first 7 intervention visits focus on constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and the final intervention visit focuses on bimanual therapy (use of two hands)."
