            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing best medical therapy (BMT) alone to BMT with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (BMT+TEVAR) for uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design:\n\nThis is a prospective, two-arm, parallel-group, single-center, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial.\n\nPopulation:\n\nThe target population comprises all adult patients aged 18 years and older who present with uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection. The study sample will include 436 subjects of both genders and any race or ethnicity.\n\nProcedures:\n\nEligible and consented patients will be enrolled into the study if all eligibility criteria are met and will be randomly allocated to one of the two study arms: BMT vs BMT+TEVAR\n\nStudy Duration:\n\nThe study is expected to accrue patients over the course of 5 years and total follow up per patient for 5 years. Overall duration of the study is anticipated to be about 10 years for completion of all study endpoints.\n\nEndpoints:\n\n* Primary Outcome: To determine all-cause mortality among both study arms.\n* Secondary Outcomes: To assess any major morbidity events (rupture, aortic intervention or reintervention, progression to complicated dissection, aneurysm formation, malperfusion resulting in organ failure, and aorta-specific mortality), as will quality of life measures, temporal discounting assessment and outcomes comparison in an observational cohort of patients who decline to be randomized due to a strong treatment preference.\n\nRisks and Benefits:\n\nSince this study involves only usual care and FDA-approved treatments, the investigators do not expect any additional physical risks to patients beyond those associated with usual care. One discernible risk involved in study participants is an unintentional disclosure of sensitive patient health information.\n\nThe participants of this study do not stand to benefit directly from taking part. However, the investigators hope that the results obtained from this study would provide useful information that would help delineate a standard and economical management protocol for acute Type B aortic dissection in future."

The ADQoL is an instrument that measures the quality of life in 5 major domains - physical limitations, social limitations, general health perceptions, emotional limitations, and aortic-disease specific limitations. Lower scores on individual subscales and overall are deemed to be poor quality of life and higher scores indicate good quality of life. the SF-12 is also designed to assess general health related quality of life and is also scored and assessed similarly, i.e, higher scores indicate good general health related quality of life and measures health perception, physical, emotional, and social limitations.",
