            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the research study is to test new methods that could improve diagnosis and assessment of brain tumors. One of these methods is a new MR (magnetic resonance) imaging technique called magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), which allows for rapidly scanning the patient and provides quantitative information on tumor tissue. The investigators will compare the data gathered from MR Fingerprinting with other imaging tests, clinical information, treatment details and biopsy results to evaluate the accuracy of this new technique.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the utility of quantitative MRI imaging including 3D-MRF in differentiating among different brain tumors and differentiating recurrent brain tumor (TR) from treatment effects\n\nSecondary objectives include evaluating the correlation between quantitative MRI imaging with histopathological characteristics and genetic markers in pre-therapy setting and with treatment response and clinical outcomes in post treatment setting.\n\nGROUP 1: All patients with newly diagnosed intra-axial brain neoplasms undergo volumetric MRI study with contrast for surgical planning or clinical diagnosis. Diffusion, diffusion tensor imaging and perfusion imaging are often performed as a part of standard clinical imaging. In addition to these acquisitions, the research 3D-MRF acquisition through the entire tumor will be acquired. The imaging parameters will be correlated individually and in combination with biopsy/ resection outcomes.\n\nGROUP 2: All patients with brain tumors who present at post therapy follow up with imaging progression undergo serial imaging as a part of clinical care. The research 3D-MRF acquisitions will be added to these clinical scans. All the quantitative parameters will be evaluated individually and in combination to differentiate post treatment changes from tumor recurrence."
