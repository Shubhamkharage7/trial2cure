This project provides the infrastructure for acquisition of biological specimens, imaging, and correlative clinical data to facilitate biology studies and characterization of TFE RCC. This registry will collect clinical, demographic, and pathological data, specimens (as available) and imaging from patients with TFE RCC, prospectively. Cases are identified through:\n\n1. Existing clinical and/or cancer registry databases\n2. Referrals from clinicians, surgeons, or pathologists\n3. Families initiating contact with Registry staff directly",
            "detailedDescription": "The following data/materials will be collected for this registry study:\n\nClinical Data: Demographic data, date of diagnosis, pathology, radiological imaging at diagnosis and relapse, signs and symptoms at diagnosis, molecular and biological data, staging details including sites of disease, detailed treatment data (e.g. types and dates of surgeries/interventional therapy (if any), medical/systemic therapy, radiotherapy), response to treatment, dates of progression, types of progression (local or metastatic), and follow-up data. The demographic and clinical data collected are abstracted and entered into an electronic data system secured by password protection (see section 4.3.3). Collection of existing molecular and/or genomic data or analysis that has been performed will also be included.\n\nResearch Specimens:\n\nTissue (fresh/frozen/FFPE) will be requested for all enrolled patients and sent for central review to study pathologist. Then tissue will be stored at CCHMC and future research testing may be conducted on this tissue.\n\nOptional research specimens:\n\nPending consent specification of family/patient, and resources, specimens may be sent directly to collaborating laboratories to proceed with tumor modeling and drug testing, or other translational research with PI or designee via an IRB approved project.\n\n* Tumor Modeling (Fresh, frozen,): Prospectively collect or retain left-over tumor tissue samples and normal tissue (background kidney) as available, for research purposes.\n* Blood: prospectively collected at time of enrollment and at time of relapse\n* Urine: prospectively collected at time of enrollment and at time of relapse\n* Saliva: prospectively collected at time of or at one time point after at time of enrollment and at time of relapse\n\nRegistry clinical data will be correlated with biological/bioinformatic and genomic data. Data stored in the Registry may be used to provide statistical data for scientific presentations and for preparation of peer-reviewed manuscripts. For such purposes all data will be de-identified. Beyond tumor model development and new agent drug testing (if selected in the consent process), data and specimens will be released for IRB approved research proposals upon approval from the TFE RCC Steering Committee."
