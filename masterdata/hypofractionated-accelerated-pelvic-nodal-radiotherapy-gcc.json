            "detailedDescription": "Outcomes for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) have been historically poor and are now known to require multimodality treatment. A standard non-surgical treatment option for patients with localized, intermediate and high-risk PC is radiation therapy (RT) in combination with short- or long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).\n\nThe benefit of pelvic nodal RT in this setting is unclear, previous studies have been equivocal. There is a growing body of evidence to demonstrate that use of hypofractionated (HypoFx) RT may be a safe method for increasing the dose of RT, while also decreasing normal tissue toxicity."
