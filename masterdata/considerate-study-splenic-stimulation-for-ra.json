            "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effects of stimulating the splenic neurovascular bundle (NVB) with the Galvani System, which consists of a lead, implantable pulse generator, external components and accessories. The study will consist of 4 study periods, including a Randomized Control Trial period (Period 1), an Open Label period (Period 2), a Treat-to-target period (Period 3), and a Long-term Follow-up period (Period 4). Participants eligible for implant will have active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and have an inadequate response or intolerance to at least two biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) or JAK inhibitors (JAKis). A sufficient number of participants will be enrolled so that approximately 28 participants will undergo device implantation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who receive the implantable system will be randomly assigned to receive either active stimulation or sham-stimulation for 12 weeks (Period 1).\n\nFollowing Period 1, all participants will enter an open label phase (Period 2) during which participants who responded to stimulation will continue on stimulation; whereas participants who received sham stimulation, or were stimulation non-responders, will receive a market-approved RA drug for 12 weeks.\n\nAt the end of Period 2, participants who respond to their Period 2 therapy but still exhibit signs and symptoms of RA will enter the Treat-to-target period (Period 3); others will proceed to Period 4 (Long-term Follow-up). During the Treat-to-Target period, participants will be treated with dual therapy (stimulation in combination with the market-approved RA drug) for up to 24 weeks.\n\nPeriod 4 provides long term safety follow up for all study participants for a period of 5 years. Participants may receive stimulation in combination with other approved and standard of care therapies, subject to a favorable benefit-risk assessment in the judgement of the treating rheumatologist."
