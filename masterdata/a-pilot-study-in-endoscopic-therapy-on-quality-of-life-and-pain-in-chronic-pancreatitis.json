While pancreatic endotherapy is commonly performed, the effect of chronic pancreatitis on patient-centered outcomes remains poorly studied. Furthermore, the effect of endotherapy on pancreatic endocrine and exocrine are largely unknown. This study therefore aims to prospective observe patients with chronic pancreatitis after endotherapy is performed to better understand how it affects patient-centered outcomes such as pain and quality of life and pancreatic function. In doing so, the study also hopes to be able to predict which patients with chronic pancreatitis will benefit from pancreatic endotherapy."
