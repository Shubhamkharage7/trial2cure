            "briefSummary": "This trial studies the side effects of single fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy after surgery in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Standard radiation for lung cancer involves delivering small doses of daily radiation for several weeks. However, this technique has resulted in inferior outcomes compared to surgery and is associated with damage to surrounding normal lung. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy in fewer treatment sessions (single fraction) may kill tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess feasibility and toxicity of single-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the post-operative setting.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess quality of life following post-operative single-fraction SBRT. II. Assess rate of in-field failures.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess progression free survival and overall survival following post-operative SBRT for stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Changes in the inflammatory markers.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nBeginning at least 2 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo 1 fraction (or 5 fractions every other day if R2 resection of central tumor) of SBRT.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 5 and 12 weeks and then periodically for up to 5 years."
