            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests the feasibility of self-administered relaxing acupressure on fatigue in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. Acupressure, a type of complementary or alternative medicine, is the application of pressure or localized massage to specific sites on the body to control symptoms. Relaxing acupressure has been shown to improve cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in adults, however, less is known about the impact of relaxing acupressure on CRF in AYA cancer survivors.\"",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of implementing a randomized controlled trial of a six-week, self-administered relaxing acupressure intervention in AYA cancer survivors with clinically relevant CRF.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Explore participants' perspectives of acceptability and satisfaction with the six-week acupressure interventions using semi-structured interviews.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the preliminary efficacy of a six-week, virtual, self-administered relaxing acupressure intervention on clinically significant changes in CRF in post-treatment AYA cancer survivors.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive access to an acupressure mobile application and an AcuWand on study and self-administer relaxing acupressure to 9 acupoints over 27 minutes once daily (QD) for 6 weeks.\n\nARM II: Patients receive access to an acupressure mobile application and an AcuWand and self-administer sham acupressure to non-acupressure point locations over 27 minutes QD for 6 weeks."
