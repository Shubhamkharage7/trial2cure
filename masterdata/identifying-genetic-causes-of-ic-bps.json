Twin studies and family accounts have suggested that the condition may be genetic or passed down (inherited) from one generation to another.\n\nIn this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information from families in North America in an attempt to identify genetic factors that may cause IC/BPS/CPPS. We are enrolling families and individuals with IC/BPS/CPPS and their family members (both family members with and without IC like symptoms).",
            "detailedDescription": "We are trying to identify a genetic cause of interstitial cystitis (IC)/bladder pain syndrome (BPS)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). We will enroll individuals and families with IC/BPS/CPPS to fully describe the symptoms of IC/PBS/CPPS in adults and children. We will attempt to determine if the symptoms of IC/PBS/CPPS match or indicate changes in specific genes or a pathway of connected genes. We will use several genetic technologies including but not limited to; linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing and candidate gene studies to try to identify the cause of IC/BPS/CPPS. We hope this will lead us to better more effective treatments for affected individuals. We are looking for families with IC/BPS/CPPS symptoms to give a DNA sample (from blood/saliva), urine samples, bladder tissue from clinical biopsy and answer several questionnaires.
