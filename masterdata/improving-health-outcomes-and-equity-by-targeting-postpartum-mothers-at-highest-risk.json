The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* How can the investigators help postpartum Black people who have poor outcomes by decreasing the number of ED visits/readmissions for postpartum people within the first 30 days postpartum?\n* How can the investigators increase the ability of participants to \"obtain needed services\" and ability for patients to see their provider when they need to, in the 30-day post discharge period as one of the main pathways of unnecessary ED visits?\n\nParticipants will be put into the study group or control group. The study group will receive a pamphlet postpartum with helpful information as well as a patient navigator who the participants will be able to reach out to their first 30 days postpartum."
