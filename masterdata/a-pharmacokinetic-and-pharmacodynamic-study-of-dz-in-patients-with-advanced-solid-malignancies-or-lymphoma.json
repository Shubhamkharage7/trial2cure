Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of DZ-002 will also be assessed.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single center, first-in-human, Phase 1, safety, PK and pharmacodynamic study of DZ-002 in patients with solid tumors who have failed standard therapies. The study will be conducted in 2 phases, a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The dose-escalation phase will first determine the MTD and/or RP2D of DZ-002 in patients with advanced cancers. Subsequently, the MTD and/or RP2D will be investigated in 2 expansion treatment groups of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients who are determined to be eligible, based on Screening assessments, will be enrolled in the study and will receive their first dose of study therapy on Cycle 1 Day 1. All patients will receive DZ-102 administered as a weekly intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. The dose of DZ-002 will be dependent on the cohort in which the patient is enrolled."
