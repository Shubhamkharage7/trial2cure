            "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Parts 1, 2, and 5: Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are refractory to a novel antiandrogen therapy (abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide) and have failed at least 1 (but not more than 2) taxane regimens including for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) (or who are deemed medically unsuitable to be treated with a taxane regimen or have actively refused treatment with a taxane regimen). Note: A taxane regimen is defined as a minimum exposure of 2 cycles of a taxane. Any NHT that has been administered and has been stopped for reasons other than progression will not be counted as an additional line of treatment.\n\n  1. Dose exploration phase: Novel antiandrogen therapy must have been given for treatment of metastatic disease.\n  2. Dose expansion phase: participants must not have had more than 2 NHTs and 2 taxane regimens in any setting, and an additional up to 2 other systemic anti-cancer treatments are allowed (eg, anti-PD1, PARP inhibitors, radioligand therapies, sipuleucel-T, experimental agents) Note: Combinations are considered one systemic anti-cancer treatment.\n* Part 3: Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed mCRPC who are refractory to a NHT (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide) given in any disease setting and who are deemed medically unsuitable to be treated with a taxane regimen or have actively refused treatment with a taxane regimen.\n* Parts 4A and 4B:\n\n  1. Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed mCRPC who have received no or 1/2 prior NHT (given in any disease setting depending on the part), and no or 1 taxane (given for hormone sensitive prostate cancer).\n  2. Dose-expansion phase: at least 1 prior NHT must have been given; 0-1 prior PARP inhibitors are acceptable.\n  3. 4A: Participants planning to receive abiraterone acetate for the first time (participants who received prior abiraterone acetate are not eligible). Participants may have had exposure to up to 2 NHTs with a similar mechanism of action (apalutamide, enzalutamide or darolutamide) in the non-mCRPC and mCRPC setting.\n  4. 4B: Participants planning to receive enzalutamide for the first time (participants who received prior enzalutamide/apalutamide or daralutamide are not eligible).\n* All parts:\n* Participants must have undergone bilateral orchiectomy or be on continuous androgen-deprivation therapy with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.\n* Total serum testosterone \\<= 50 ng/dL or 1.7 nmol/L.\n* Evidence of progressive disease, defined as 1 or more Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria:\n\n  1. PSA level \\>= 1 ng/mL that has increased on at least 2 successive occasions at least 1 week apart.\n  2. nodal or visceral progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 with PCGW3 modifications.\n  3. appearance of 2 or more new lesions in bone scan.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1.\n* Adequate organ function, defined as follows:\n\n  1. Hematological function:\n\n     1. absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1 x 10\\^9/L (without growth factor support within 7 days from screening assessment).\n     2. platelet count \\>= 75 x 10\\^9/L (without platelet transfusion within 7 days from screening assessment).\n     3. hemoglobin \\>= 9 g/dL (90 g/L) (without blood transfusion within 7 days from screening assessment).\n  2. Renal function:\n\n     1. estimated glomerular filtration rate based on Modification of Diet in Renal Disease calculation \\>= 30 ml/min/1.73 m\\^2.\n  3. Hepatic function:\n\n     1. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\< 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (or \\< 5 x ULN for participants with liver involvement).\n     2. total bilirubin (TBL) \\< 1.5 x ULN (or \\< 2 x ULN for participants with liver metastases).\n  4. Cardiac function:\n\n     1. left ventricular ejection fraction \\> 50% (2-D transthoracic echocardiogram \\[ECHO\\] is the preferred method of evaluation; multi-gated acquisition scan is acceptable if ECHO is not available).\n     2. Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) QTcF \\<= 470 msec (average of triplicate values).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pathological finding consistent with pure small cell, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate or any other histology different from adenocarcinoma.\n* Radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose (or local or focal radiotherapy within 2 weeks of first dose).\n* Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Participants with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible if there is radiographic evidence of improvement upon the completion of CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening radiographic study.\n* Participants with symptoms and/or clinical signs and/or radiographic signs that indicate an acute and/or uncontrolled active systemic infection within 7 days prior to the first dose of investigational product administration.\n* Confirmed history or current autoimmune disease or other diseases resulting in permanent immunosuppression or requiring permanent immunosuppressive therapy.\n* History of arterial or venous thrombosis (eg, stroke, transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis); for arterial thrombosis within 12 months of AMG 509 initiation; for venous thrombosis, 6 months and stable on anti-coagulation.\n* Myocardial infarction and/or symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association \\> class II) within 12 months of first dose of AMG 509 with the exception of ischemia or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction controlled with stent placement and confirmed by a cardiologist more than 6 months prior to first dose of AMG 509.\n* Any anti-cancer therapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks of start of first dose, not including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)/GnRH analogue (agonist/antagonist). Participants on a stable bisphosphonate or denosumab regimen for \\>= 30 days prior to enrollment are eligible.\n* Prior PSMA radionuclide therapy within 2 months prior to AMG 509 unless participant received \\< 2 cycles (Note: a participant cannot have received PSMA radionuclide therapy \\< 35 days prior to enrollment if 1 cycle was given). Parts 3 and 4: prior PSMA radionuclide therapy is prohibited.",

Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
