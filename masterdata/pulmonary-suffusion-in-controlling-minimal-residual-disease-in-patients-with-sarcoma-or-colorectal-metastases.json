            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of pulmonary suffusion in controlling minimal residual disease in patients with sarcoma or colorectal carcinoma that has spread to the lungs. Pulmonary suffusion is a minimally invasive delivery of chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin to lung tissues. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Pulmonary suffusion may also be useful in avoiding later use of drugs by vein that demonstrate no effect on tumors when delivered locally.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety of chemotherapy isolated to the pulmonary circulation by determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of each chemotherapy agent. (Phase I) II. To determine the rate of local recurrences in patients receiving pulmonary suffusion, compared to historical controls in patients with completely resected pulmonary metastases (unilateral and bilateral disease). (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the local and systemic toxicities associated with pulmonary suffusion. (Phase I) II. To determine whether suffusion improves metastatic control by suppressing progression of microscopic metastases to new lesions assessable by imaging (Phase I) III. To determine disease-free survival (DFS) in patients receiving pulmonary suffusion compared to historical controls, in patients with completely resected pulmonary metastases (unilateral and bilateral disease). (Phase II)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the pulmonary suffusion-associated changes in local tumor microenvironment (TME) and potential of suffusion as an immune modulation enhancement. (Phase II) II. To determine overall survival (OS) in patients receiving pulmonary suffusion compared to historical controls, in patients with completely resected pulmonary metastases (unilateral and bilateral disease). (Phase II) III. To compare histology of tumor samples with previously resected specimens with attention to biomarkers of systemic immune recognition in patients eligible for repeat suffusion. (Phase II) IV. To obtain tumor and systemic immune biomarkers including cytokine activations for correlation with clinical responses. (Phase II) V. To correlate local control with biomarker for tissue effect from chemotherapy (including tissue levels of platinum, alkaline phosphatase \\[ALP\\]). (Phase II) VI. To correlate local disease control with tumor biomarker for metastasis (circulating \\[circ\\] ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\], micro \\[mi\\]RNA). (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo pulmonary suffusion consisting of cisplatin via infusion. Patients then undergo metastasectomy. Patients found to have unresectable sarcoma may receive chemotherapy within 4-8 weeks of metastasectomy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months for one year and then every 6 months for up to 5 years."
