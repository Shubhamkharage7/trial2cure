Hypothesis: Cancer survivors treated with anthracycline chemotherapy will have a lower MPRI than similarly aged healthy comparators without a history of cancer treatment.The secondary objective of this cross-sectional pilot study is to determine if MPRI is associated with myocardial fibrosis measured non-invasively with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Hypothesis: MPRI will be inversely associated with fibrosis burden\n\nStudy participants will be consented with pre-study data collection recorded. No randomization will occur as this is a cross-sectional study. Participants in both the cancer survivor and control groups will complete one study visit. No follow-up will be completed."

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the use of gadolinium in cardiac MRI imaging may not be safe in pregnant women.
