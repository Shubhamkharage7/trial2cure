To accomplish this objective, a human dietary intervention trial (RCT) with peanuts is proposed. The proposed study is a 12-week parallel-group, free-living, observer-blind, randomized controlled dietary intervention trial. This study will examine the effects of peanuts on markers of immune function, cardiometabolic markers and risk factors and upper respiratory tract infections, in 80 adult male and female volunteers."
