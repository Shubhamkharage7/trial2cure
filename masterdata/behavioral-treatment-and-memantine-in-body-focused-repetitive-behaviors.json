            "briefSummary": "The goal of the proposed study is to compare the efficacy of behavioral treatment (BT) to memantine, a psychopharmacological agent, for BFRBs. 28 subjects with trichotillomania (TTM) or skin picking disorder (SPD) will receive 8 weeks of memantine treatment, followed by 8 weeks of comprehensive behavioral therapy (ComB) treatment. The hypothesis to be tested is that behavioral therapy will be associated with superior clinical outcomes as compared to memantine. A second hypothesis is that both memantine and behavioral therapy will demonstrate improvement from baseline to the respective posttreatment assessment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hair pulling disorder (i.e., trichotillomania, TTM) and skin picking disorder (SPD) are often categorized under the umbrella term of BFRB disorders. These repetitive, intentionally performed behaviors often cause noticeable cosmetic issues and may result in clinically significant distress or functional impairment.\n\nBehavioral therapy (BT) is generally regarded as the first-line treatment for BFRBs. One type of BT is comprehensive behavioral treatment (ComB), a treatment that emphasizes habit reversal training and various techniques that target specific BFRB triggers (e.g., sensory cues, such as pressure on the scalp; environmental cues, such as bright lights and mirrors), including emotion dysregulation. The ComB protocol was methodically developed based on expert consensus and demonstrated promising results in one single case design study and a randomized controlled trial comparing it to a minimal attention control condition.\n\nResearch has also found benefit of pharmacological agents in the treatment of BFRBs. Most recently, a randomized controlled trial of memantine vs. placebo found statistically significant improvements in disorder severity and life functioning in the memantine group as compared to the placebo group.\n\nAlthough there are emerging behavioral and psychopharmacological interventions for BFRBs, the research is limited. Additionally, there are no studies comparing the efficacy of first-line behavioral treatments to promising medication interventions for this class of disorders. Given the serious personal consequences associated with trichotillomania and skin picking disorder, there is substantial need for additional research to clarify the best available treatments for BFRBs. Doing so would facilitate future research and the development of refined treatment guidelines. Therefore, the current trial aims to compare the efficacy of behavioral therapy and memantine in adults with trichotillomania and skin picking disorder."
