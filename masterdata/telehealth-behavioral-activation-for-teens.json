            "briefSummary": "Behavioral activation is one such empirically supported intervention. Derived from cognitive-behavioral therapy, a well-established treatment for depression, behavioral activation uses psychoeducation and skill-building to increase an individual's engagement in valued and enjoyable activities (e.g., socializing with family and friends, exercising, participating in a hobby) in order to improve depressive symptoms. Research has shown that behavioral activation is an effective intervention for depressed youth. Additionally, it has been shown as a promising intervention that can be conducted in a brief, virtual format and can be effectively implemented by both trained clinicians and trained, non-licensed interventionists. This project will provide Behavioral Activation for youth (12-17) experiencing depression or suicidal ideation who are currently enrolled in the Youth Depression Suicide Network study in Texas.",
            "detailedDescription": "Rates of youth depression and suicide are rising worldwide and present a critical public health problem. Between 2007 and 2018, rates of fatal suicide among U.S. youth and young adults increased by 57.4%, becoming the second leading cause of all deaths for Americans between the ages of 10 and 34 in 2020. Similarly, between 2009 and 2019, rates of past year major depressive episodes among adolescents in the United States increased from 8.1% to 15.8% (roughly 1 in 6). Despite these high rates of suicide and depression, Texas is rated 51st in access to mental healthcare in the United States. As untreated youth depression tends to persist and has been related to poorer functioning in adulthood, there is a need to increase access to empirically supported treatment for depressed adolescents.\n\nBehavioral activation is one such empirically supported intervention. Derived from cognitive-behavioral therapy, a well-established treatment for depression, behavioral activation uses psychoeducation and skill-building to increase an individual's engagement in valued and enjoyable activities (e.g., socializing with family and friends, exercising, participating in a hobby) in order to improve depressive symptoms.
