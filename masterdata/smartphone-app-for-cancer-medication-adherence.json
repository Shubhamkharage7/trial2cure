            "detailedDescription": "Many patients with cancer experience frustration with the large number and complex scheduling of their medications. This study will help find out how much \"pill burden\" exists in patients with cancer, and how a smartphone app can help patients take medications as providers prescribe. Results of this study may help figure out the best way to help patients manage medications in the future."

After the participant has input their medication information into the app, the researcher will assist the participant in adding an optional \"Medifriend\" who will be alerted if the participant misses a dose as an option. The participant will also be provided with written instructions about the Medisafe app to take home for reference. At each office visit (4, 8, and 12 weeks) participants will complete a medication checklist and reconciliation form with the research staff.
