However, breast cancer survivors have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to chemotherapy than adults without cancer. Cardiovascular rehabilitation can be an effective strategy to decrease the incidence of CVD and its risk factors in this population. The proposed study may help to examine the effect and durability of a novel high-intensity interval training compared to moderate-intensity continuous training on cardiovascular rehabilitation in breast cancer survivors."
