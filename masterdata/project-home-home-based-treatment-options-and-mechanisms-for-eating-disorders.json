Adolescents with AN-spectrum disorders (n=50) and their caregivers will be randomly assigned to either family-based treatment or integrated family therapy delivered in the home. Caregivers and adolescents will provide data on weight, eating, and putative treatment mechanisms, including caregiver self-efficacy, adolescent distress, and generalizability of treatment skills. Treatment feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness will be measured among providers and participating families. The proposed study has clear potential to advance scientific and clinical understanding of the real-world effectiveness of psychological treatments for AN, including whether adapting them for the home setting may improve accessibility and effects on treatment outcome"

In the current study, FBT is adapted for delivery in the home setting in the following ways: intensified dose of treatment (2-6 hours of therapy per week over 10 - 32 weeks); use of clinician as an additional support to the family; multiple family meals in the home and community; sociocultural tailoring; and inclusion of supplemental individual work with the adolescent to improve emotion regulation/distress tolerance.",
