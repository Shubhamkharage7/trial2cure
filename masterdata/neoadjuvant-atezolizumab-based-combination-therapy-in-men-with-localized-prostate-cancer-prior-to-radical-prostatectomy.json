            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works alone or in combination with etrumadenant or tocilizumab in treating men with localized prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. IL-6 is expressed by prostate cancer and within the tumor microenvironment and shown to enhance prostate cancer and disease progression. Treatment with an anti-IL-6 antibody such as tocilizumab may inhibit cancer progression. Giving atezolizumab in combination with etrumadenant or tocilizumab may work better in treating prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICS).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized prostate cancer (PC).\n\nII. To determine the clinical efficacy of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized PC.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating immune cells following atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized PC.\n\nII. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and phenotype of the tumor microenvironment.\n\nIII. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the circulating and intratumoral T cell repertoire.\n\nIV. To explore the role of novel imaging modalities to understand the immunologic and clinical impact to immunotherapeutic approaches in localized PC.\n\nV. To characterize changes in the gut microbiome associated with each therapeutic combination.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nCOHORT A: Patients receive one cycle of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of a 14 day cycle prior to radical prostatectomy (RP).\n\nCOHORT B: Patients will receive 1 cycle of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and etrumadenant (AB928) prior to RP; atezolizumab will be administered in an identical fashion as Cohort A. Etrumadenant will be administered at a dose of 150 mg once daily, until 48 hours prior to RP.\n\nCOHORT C: Patients will receive 1 cycle of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and tocilizumab prior to RP; atezolizumab will be administered in an identical fashion as Cohort A. Etrumadenant will be administered at a dose of 6mg/kg.\n\nTwo more groups consisting of treatment with atezolizumab in combination with other drugs may be added in the future.\n\nRP will occur 21 days (+/- 7 days) following treatments on Cycle 1 Day 1. No further study therapy will be administered following RP\n\nFollowing RP, subjects will be followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (from date of RP), or until disease progression, whichever occurs sooner"

Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association class III or greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident within 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment, unstable arrhythmia, or unstable angina.\n11. Active chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring use of home oxygen (O2) or systemic steroid therapy \\> 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily.\n12. Asthma requiring systemic corticosteroids \\> 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily. Inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma are permitted.\n13. Major surgical procedure (including joint surgery) other than for diagnosis within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study.\n\n    a. Placement of central venous access catheter (e.g., port or similar) is not considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted.\n14. Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia.\n15. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications.\n16. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.\n17. Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during the course of the study or within 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab. Note: Because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigen, patients should be brought up to date on all recommended vaccinations, except for live vaccines, prior to initiation of therapy with tocilizumab to maximize vaccine response.\n18. Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n19. Prior treatment with adenosine-axis inhibitors, cluster of differentiation 137 (CD137) agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), ant-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies.\n20. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents \\[including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 (IL-2)\\] within 4 weeks or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.\n21. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during the course of the study, with the following exceptions:\n\n    1. Patients who receive acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study\n    2. Patients who receive mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma (=\\< 10 mg prednisone or equivalent), or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency (=\\< 10 mg prednisone or equivalent) are eligible for the study.\n22. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n23. Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab formulation.\n24. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs of their excipients.\n25. Previous treatment with any cell-depleting therapies, including investigational agents or approved therapies, some examples include: CAMPATH, anti-cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), anti-cluster of differentiation 5 (CD5), anti-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), anti-Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19) and anti-Cluster of Differentiation 20 (CD20) within 5 years prior to first dose of study treatment.\n26. Treatment with intravenous gamma globulin, plasmapheresis or Prosorba column within 6 months of baseline.\n27. Previous treatment with tocilizumab (an exception to this criterion may be granted for single dose exposure upon application to the Sponsor-Investigator on a case-by-case basis).\n28.

Any history of recent serious bacterial, viral, fungal, or other opportunistic infections.\n32. Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of or currently active) unless related to primary disease under investigation.\n33. Any medical or psychological condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator would interfere with safe completion of the trial.\n34. Pregnant women or nursing (breast feeding) mothers.\n35. Neuropathies or other conditions that might interfere with pain evaluation unless related to primary disease under investigation.\n36. Patients with lack of peripheral venous access\n\n    Additional Exclusion Criteria for Cohort B (atezolizumab + etrumadenant):\n37. Treatment with known P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates with a narrow therapeutic window, administered orally (e.g., digoxin) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.\n38. Treatment with known strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort) and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg,clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin,and voriconazole) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.\n39.
