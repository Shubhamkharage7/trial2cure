Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs, as defined below:\n\n  * Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n  * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\\>/= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n  * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\> 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n* For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n  * With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period and for 90 days after the final dose of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this this same period.\n  * With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and 90 days after the final dose of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy to avoid potential exposure to the embryo.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the view of the investigator, contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment or within 6 months after the final dose of study treatment.\n* Symptomatic brain metastasis requiring corticosteroids. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible.\n* No concurrent therapy with approved or investigational anticancer therapeutics",
