            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if RRx-001, which is added on to the cisplatin and radiation treatment, reduces the incidence of severe oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancers. All patients in this study will receive 7 weeks of standard of care radiation therapy given with the chemotherapy agent, cisplatin. Patients will receive RRx-001 or placebo before start of standard of care treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The standard treatment for head and neck cancer currently includes a chemotherapy drug called cisplatin that is given by intravenous (IV) infusion and radiation, which is delivered from a machine that precisely targets the tumor. One common and unfortunate side effect of treatment with cisplatin and radiation is oral mucositis, which refers to irritation of the lining of the mouth. Oral mucositis is a serious problem 1) because the open mouth sores from oral mucositis may lead to severe pain, nutritional problems and dehydration from an inability to eat and drink, an increased risk of infection from bacteria and fungus and delay or discontinuation of treatment and 2) because there is only one approved therapy to treat or prevent it."

Active infectious disease excluding oral candidiasis.\n11. Presence of oral mucositis (WHO Score \u2265 Grade 1) or other oral mucosal ulceration at baseline.\n12. Untreated active oral or dental infection\n13. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus or active hepatitis B or C.\n14. Any significant medical diseases or conditions, as assessed by the investigators and sponsor that would substantially increase the medical risks of participating in this study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, NYHA II-IV congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study, severe chronic pulmonary disease or active uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled or clinically relevant pulmonary edema)\n15.
