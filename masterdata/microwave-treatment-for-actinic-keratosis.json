The trial will be conducted at 2 sites, one in Germany and one in the United States. Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized to ensure 51 subjects complete the study.",

Randomization of AK lesions will be stratified by side. Subjects will be randomized to treatment on half the number of AK lesions mapped located on their scalp or hands. The mapped AK lesions not randomized for treatment will receive no treatment (control).\n\nThe microwave energy applied by the Swift device will be applied to the randomized AK lesion sites for up to 2 treatments, spaced out by a 4-week interval. Follow-up is 2-months after the first treatment is administered where the AK lesions are assessed for resolution. Further follow-up visits occur at 4-months, 6-months and 12-months after the first treatment was administered where the AK lesions will be assessed for resolution or reoccurence."
