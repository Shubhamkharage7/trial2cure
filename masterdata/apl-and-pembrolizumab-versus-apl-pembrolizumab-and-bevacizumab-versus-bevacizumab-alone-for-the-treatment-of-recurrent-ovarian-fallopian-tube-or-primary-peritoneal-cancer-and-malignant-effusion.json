            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of APL-2 when given in combination with either pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab and bevacizumab compared with bevacizumab alone in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent) and a buildup of fluid and cancer cells (malignant effusion). APL-2 may limit tumor progression, decrease malignant effusion production, and improve the immune system's response against cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving APL-2 together with either pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab and bevacizumab may work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and malignant effusion compared to bevacizumab alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the safety of pegcetacoplan (APL-2) alone and in combination with pembrolizumab, and APL-2 in combination with both bevacizumab and pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer with symptomatic malignant effusion (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] version 5.0).\n\nII. Effect of therapy on of malignant effusion measured by total volume of effusion drained every 3 weeks (patient diary and/or drained volume).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and overall survival (OS) per immune related response criteria (irRECIST).\n\nII. Changes in quality of life measures during the clinical trial (European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer \\[EORTC\\] Quality of Life Questionnaire \\[QLQ\\]-Core 30 \\[C30\\], EORTC QLQ-Ovarian version 28 \\[OV28\\] and Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form \\[MFSI-SF\\]).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the immunologic and phenotypic changes in malignant effusions and blood samples in all cohorts, which can include the following:\n\nIa. To understand the signaling mechanisms in ascites primed neutrophils and their effects on tumor cell growth.\n\nIb. To understand the changes in complement activation pathways. Ic. Functional assays of neutrophil, macrophage and T cells. Id. Flow cytometry for immune cell composition. Ie. Luminex assay for circulation inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, angiogenesis markers.\n\nII. In patients with solid tumor lesions accessible by image-guided core biopsies the effects of therapy will be determined on the immune composition of tumor microenvironment. Studies on tumor may include immune cell infiltration, ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing (Seq) and T cell receptor (TCR)-Seq for immune cell activation and exhaustion markers, complement deposits, genomic and transcriptomic profile.\n\nIII. Microbiome analysis from stool, tumor tissue and malignant effusions. IV. Determine the concentration (pharmacokinetics \\[PK\\]/pharmacodynamics \\[PD\\]) of APL-2 in serum and malignant effusion.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP 2A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT 2A-1: Patients receive pegcetacoplan intravenously (IV) over 20-40 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1 and then subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly (BIW) of each cycle. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 21-day cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nCOHORT 2A-2: Patients receive pegcetacoplan IV over 20-40 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1 and then SC BIW of each cycle. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV and bevacizumab IV on day 1of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 21-day cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nGROUP 2B: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT 2B-1: Patients receive pegcetacoplan IV over 20-40 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1 and then SC BIW of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles, followed by every 42 days for up to 35 total cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nCOHORT 2B-2: Patients receive pegcetacoplan IV over 20-40 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1 and then SC BIW of each cycle. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV and bevacizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 21-day cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nCOHORT 2B-3: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks thereafter."
