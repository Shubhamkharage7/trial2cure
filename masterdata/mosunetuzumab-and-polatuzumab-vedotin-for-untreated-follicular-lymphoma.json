Mosunetuzumab is an antibody that has been engineered to attach to two target cells in the immune system: T cells that normally perform tasks like killing virus-infected cells, and cancerous B cells. Mosunetuzumab has been designed to direct these T cells to kill the cancerous B cells instead. Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate that attaches to certain cancerous B cells and then delivers a drug specifically to those cells."
