When using the intervention, a provider works with the patient (1) to conduct a narrative assessment of the events preceding suicidal thoughts or behavior, and (2) to develop a personalized plan for identifying and managing distress that could escalate to a suicide attempt. The CRP, which is typically handwritten by the patient on an index card, includes personal warning signs of distress, emotion regulation strategies, reasons for living, and contact information for friends/family as well as professional (psychological/medical) and emergency resources.",
