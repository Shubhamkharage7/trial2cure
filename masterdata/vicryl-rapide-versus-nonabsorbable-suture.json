            "briefSummary": "This will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial assessing noninferiority of Vicryl Rapide compared to nonabsorbable suture. The study will be conducted in the Community Regional Medical Center emergency department (ED). The aim of this study, then, is to prospectively determine if 3-month cosmesis for traumatic laceration repair of trunk/extremity lacerations in adult patients with Vicryl Rapide is noninferior to nonabsorbable suture.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study flyers will be posted in all doc boxes to ensure all ED personnel is aware of ongoing studies. Initial ED history and physical examination (standard procedure). Provider identifies patient who is felt to require suture closure. Provider will contact study staff that approved to consent patient to consent the patient for the study. After identification of a patient who meets inclusion criteria, the patient will be screened for exclusion criteria by the investigators using a preprinted form on the outside of the study envelope. If the patient has an exclusion criterion, this will be noted on this preprinted form and the form will be saved for further data analysis without any patient identifiers, and the patient will not be enrolled in the study. If the patient does not have exclusion criteria, the enrollment envelope will be opened and he/she will undergo the written consent process. After written consent is complete, the randomization envelope is opened. There will be a question asking if buried sutures will be needed as the group of patients needing buried sutures will have their own randomized packets to ensure a similar amount of buried suture patients are in both the Vicryl Rapide and nonabsorbable suture closure group. The study staff will then gather the following information regarding wound characteristics: Measure the length and width of the laceration, laceration location, presence of contamination, and if it is simple linear. The laceration will then be prepped for closure using whatever cleaning or anesthesia is felt to be appropriate by the practitioner. Suture closure will then occur with either Vicryl Rapide or nonabsorbable suture according to randomization direction in the envelope. After laceration closure, the practitioner will also write down on this paper the suture size and, for the nonabsorbable group, the type of suture used. The practitioner performing suture closure will also write down whether he/she is the nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), emergency medicine (EM) faculty or EM resident. Patients will be given preprinted discharge instructions appropriate to whether Vicryl Rapide or nonabsorbable suture was used that gives information such as precautions for infection, information about how to do the 3-month follow-up, research coordinator contact information, and date to return for suture removal in the nonabsorbable group.\n\nAt 30 days post enrollment, the patient will receive a call from trained Institutional review board (IRB) approved study personnel. The pre-printed scripted form will ask questions to determine if the patient had any complications including infection, dehiscence, and, in the absorbable suture group, whether a return visit was needed to have the sutures removed.\n\nAt 30 days post enrollment, study personnel will also do a chart review collecting the following elements: Patient's age, ethnicity, gender, comorbid conditions including diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, liver disease, and immunodeficiency, ED vital signs, and whether patient was admitted or treated as outpatient for the index visit. The chart will also be reviewed examining for any revisit to the ED during those 30 days with any of the complications listed in the previous paragraph.\n\nAt three-months post enrollment, the research coordinator will work with the patient to arrange an appointment to take pictures of the wound. The patient will have their follow-up visit done at the Clinical Research Center at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Fresno building. The photographs will be taken by study personnel with instructions on how to take these. At this time, the patient would be provided with a gift card and log book would be signed by the patient. The photographs are then prepared for submission to the plastic surgeon who will be evaluating them. Photographs will not have any patient identifiers other than a study number, and would be labeled with the anatomic area. The plastic surgeon, who is a blinded study staff to the study hypothesis, then assesses the cosmesis of the wound on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS)."
