            "detailedDescription": "Project purpose: The investigators will study the use of non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in newly diagnosed adolescent patients with POTS to see if symptom management improves over 2 months. Surveys will include COMPASS-31. Child Functional Disability Inventory, and PHQ-9. Patient logs will evaluate headache frequency, exercise duration and VNS use.\n\nResearch objectives: The investigators hypothesize that:\n\nPrimary Aim 1. Use of noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation will decrease autonomic symptom intensity compared to control group.\n\nPrimary Aim 2. Use of noninvasive vagal nerve stimulator will improve child function.\n\nPrimary Aim 3. Heart rate elevation measured by head up tilt table test will decrease in the treatment group compared to the control group.\n\nSecondary goals include:\n\nSecondary Aim 1: To determine if utilization of noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation influences headache frequency Secondary Aim 2: Determine if utilization of noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation will influence weekly duration of aerobic exercise.\n\nSecondary Aim 3: Determine if utilization of noninvasive vagal nerve stimulator results in significant side effects, particularly depression, in adolescent patients."
