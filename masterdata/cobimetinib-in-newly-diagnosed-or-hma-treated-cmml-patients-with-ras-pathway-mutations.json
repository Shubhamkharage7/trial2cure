Cohort 1 will enroll nine newly diagnosed patients in the first stage and if four or more responses are observed five additional patients will be enrolled in the second stage. Cohort 2 will enroll six HMA refractory patients in the first stage and if one or more responses are observed then nine additional patients will be enrolled in the second stage.\n\nAll eligible patients will be treated daily with cobimetinib in 28-day cycles.
