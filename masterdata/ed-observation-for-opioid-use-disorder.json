Rather, clinical care with well-documented effectiveness will be delivered at the discretion of clinical staff guided by clinical protocols for the management of OUD with MOUD (Medications for Opioid Use Disorder) introduced at each site prior to study enrollment. Enrolled patients will be randomized to ED vs. EDOU and to participate in assessments conducted at the index visit and at 30 days and 90 days. Patient level data will also be matched with Medicaid claims data for more robust analyses and to support the development of clinical quality measures."
