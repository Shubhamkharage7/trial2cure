With minimum of 1 year follow-up post-conversion, we anticipate the entire study would be completed within 2 \u00bd years.\n\nStudy design: This is a Phase II/III, Single-center, Prospective, Open-label, Single Arm Study of 30 Simultaneous Kidney Pancreas recipients who received a transplant at least 3 months, but no more than 5 years prior, with a history of tremors following transplantation.\n\nStudy duration: There will be a minimum of 1 year follow-up post-conversion, and it is expected that the entire study would be completed within 2 \u00bd years.\n\nStudy aims:\n\n* Determine if EnvarsusXR\u00ae reduces tremor severity compared to IR tacrolimus\n* Determine if EnvarsusXR\u00ae improves renal function or glycemic control compared to IR tacrolimus\n* Compare the efficacy of EnvarsusXR\u00ae by comparing the outcomes (patient, pancreas graft and kidney graft survival) of patients treated with Envarsus XR to those of contemporary and historical controls at our center treated with IR tacrolimus, with the goal of showing non-inferiority.\n* Compare insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity by defined measures post conversion between T1D and T2D recipients.\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\n1. Improvement in patient and physician-assessed degree of tremors based on FTM (Fahn-Tolosa-Martin Tremor Rating Scale) and QUEST (Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire) scoring tools\n2. Scores on Quality of Life in Essential Tremor and Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Scale (MTSOSD) Questionnaires\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n1. Renal function - eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and serum creatinine\n2. Glycemic control - AUC by MMTT, fasting BG, fasting C-peptide, calculated C-peptide/glucose ratio, calculated 20/(fasting Cpeptide x fasting BG) as a measure of insulin resistance, calculated HOMA-IR (fasting insulin x fasting BG)/22.5 as a measure of insulin sensitivity/resistance, calculated BETA-2 score to sensitive estimate beta cell function, and HbA1c.\n3. Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate doses as well as TAC and MPA levels"
