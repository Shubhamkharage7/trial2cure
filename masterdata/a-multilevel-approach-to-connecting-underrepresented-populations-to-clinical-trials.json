            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to pilot test and evaluate an existing tailored ALEX Research Portal to navigate Black and Hispanic adult cancer patients and their family members through referral to cancer clinical trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach. Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment techniques.The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the portal to easily navigate to key information and make self-and other-referrals. The ability to streamline information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research Portal for broad use. The outcome will be an evidence-based intervention that can be widely disseminated to quickly increase the referral of diverse patients to CCTs. This project will be conducted in three phases: (Phase I) establish a baseline of referrals and accrual of diverse participants to CCTs across multiple Florida Center Centers, (Phase 2) adapt and pilot the ALEX Research Portal using a randomized controlled clinical trial, and (Phase 3) scale the intervention by dissemination via the OneFlorida network. The proposed study will result in an empirically-tested vCHE Research Portal for increasing trust in CCTs among diverse populations that can easily be adapted and disseminated across the state to overcome challenges associated with recruiting diverse participants to CCTs."
