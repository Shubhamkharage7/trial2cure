            "briefSummary": "Incyclix Bio (Incyclix) is developing INX-315 as an oral, small molecule inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) for the treatment of human cancers. This first-in-human study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary antitumor activity of INX-315 in patients with recurrent advanced/metastatic cancer, including hormone receptor positive (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (HER2-) breast cancer who progressed on a prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) regimen, and CCNE1-amplified solid tumors who progressed on standard of care treatment. This study will evaluate approximately 6 dose levels of daily INX-315 in Part A, at least two dose levels will be evaluated in Part B to identify the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in patients with ovarian cancer, and Part C will evaluate combination treatment of INX-315 plus a CDK4/6i and selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients who have progressed on prior CDK4/6i regimen.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study INX-315-01 is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2, open-label, dose escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, PK, and preliminary antitumor activity of INX-315 in patients with advanced/metastatic cancers. The study will be conducted in 3 parts: Part A (dose escalation) and Part B (ovarian cancer dose expansion) and Part C (breast cancer dose escalation lead-in and expansion).\n\nPart A is the dose-escalation portion of the study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of INX-315 monotherapy. Dosing decisions will be guided using a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design. Up to 51 patients with recurrent advanced/metastatic cancer, including patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer who progressed on a prior CDK4/6i regimen, and solid tumors, including ovarian cancer with known amplification of CCNE1 are planned to be enrolled in Part A.\n\nDose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle, i.e., the first 28 days of treatment (the DLT period). Patients who are evaluable for DLT assessment are those patients who are enrolled, received \u226580% of the planned study drug doses and all study visits during the DLT assessment period, and complete the 28-day DLT period.\n\nPart B will expand at least two dose levels determined by the SMC. Part B will enroll patients with platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant advanced/metastatic ovarian cancer patients with CCNE1 amplifications. Part B will open for enrollment once the SMC has selected the dose levels to be evaluated from the Part A portion of the study. Part A patients cannot re-join or continue the study in Part B. Approximately 30 patients will be equally randomized to receive one of the dose levels of INX-315.\n\nPart C will be an expansion cohort, patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer will be enrolled in this cohort."
