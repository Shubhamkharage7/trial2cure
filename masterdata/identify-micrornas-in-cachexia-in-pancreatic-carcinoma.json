The prospective arm, will enroll a total of 100 eligible volunteers at the OU-SCC. The demographic and medical data from the retrospective and prospective arms will be combined (1495 patients) to ascertain any racial disparities in pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia. Perspective volunteers at the OU-SCC will undergo routine tests to determine if their cancer is operable. Pancreatic tumors will be removed from the eligible patients, as part of their normal standard of care and will be examined for genes that may be related to unexplained muscle loss and compared to tumor tissue from other patients with pancreatic cancer. An optional hand strength exam, and standing on a scale that measures weight, muscle, and body fat will be available to OU-SCC patients."
