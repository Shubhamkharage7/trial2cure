            "briefSummary": "Foods that release glucose rapidly, leading to spikes in blood sugar and insulin (known as high glycemic index foods), generate lower satiety responses than foods with low glycemic index. High glycemic index foods are also linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes. The partial replacement of carbohydrates in rich staple foods with soy flour has the potential to reduce glycemic response and improve satiety.\n\nIn many regions of Latin America, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, bread is the staple source of calories, but it is a relatively poor source of balanced nutrition. Bread enriched with soy flour could provide higher dietary protein while moderating blood glucose (and insulin) spikes, which can help reduce insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. The results of this study could provide government and private human nutritionists with the evidence they need to formulate soy flour into bread, corn tortillas, and arepas for schools and homes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to compare different percentages of soy flour inclusion rates in recipes of bread, flour tortilla, and arepa (South American corn pancake) for its effect on satiation and glycemic and insulin responses.\n\nThe hypothesis to be tested is that soy flour inclusion will improve the protein content, satiety profile and glycemic response of the products without significant increases in insulin responses (compared to the same products prepared with regular wheat flour)."
