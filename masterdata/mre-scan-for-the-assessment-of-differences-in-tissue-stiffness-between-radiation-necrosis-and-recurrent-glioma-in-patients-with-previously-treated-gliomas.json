Diagnostic procedures, such as MRE, may estimate the differences in tissue stiffness between radiation necrosis and recurrent glioma post treatment and ultimately lead to a more accurate diagnosis and/or surgery, and/or a better assessment of the disease's response to treatment.",

To estimate the mean lesion stiffness in patients with glioma recurrence using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate the mean lesion stiffness between radiation necrosis and glioma recurrence.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo MRE over 10 minutes and then undergo standard of care magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast at baseline. Within 4 weeks after the initial MRI and MRE scans, patients may undergo standard of care biopsy to check the status of the disease. Within 48 hours after biopsy, patients undergo standard of care MRI to check the status of the disease. Patients who do not undergo biopsy undergo standard of care MRI 4-8 weeks after MRE scan to check the status of the disease."
