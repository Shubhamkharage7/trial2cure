            "briefSummary": "The primary goal of this study is to examine rhythm sensitivity as a predictor of response to naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBIs) in autistic toddlers. Toddlers receive either Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT), an evidence-based NDBI that supports children's imitation and social communication skills, or a music-enhanced version of RIT. Throughout their participation in the intervention, toddlers will complete study procedures of viewing naturalistic videos of infant-directed singing and other social scenes while eye gaze data is collected.",
            "detailedDescription": "Social communication makes use of predictable, rhythmic behaviors and children are sensitive to the rhythm of social interaction from infancy. The goal of the current study is to investigate if social rhythm sensitivity, measured via children' entrained eye-looking when viewing videos of infant-directed singing, predicts autistic toddlers' response to naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI). Following eligibility testing and baseline assessments, children are randomized to receive either 30 sessions of Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT), an NDBI that uses evidence-based strategies to support children's imitation and social communication development, or a music-enhanced version of RIT that embeds music and rhythm within the RIT platform (meRIT). Children's imitation skills are assessed before and after the intervention programs. Children's rhythm sensitivity is assessed via repeated eye-tracking sessions throughout baseline, intervention, and two-weeks after the intervention ends."
