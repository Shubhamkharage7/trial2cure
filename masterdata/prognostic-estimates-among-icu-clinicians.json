            "briefSummary": "One challenge with decision making for mechanically ventilated is that their prognosis is often uncertain. The ProVent-14 score incorporates clinical variables measured on the 14th day of mechanical ventilation to predict risk of death in one year. The ProVent-14 is easy to calculate has been externally validated. However, it is unclear how often clinicians use the ProVent-14 score to predict long-term outcomes for patients requiring 14 days of mechanical ventilation or if it helps clinicians make more accurate predictions. The purpose of this study is to determine whether ICU clinicians who receive a patient's ProVent-14 score make more accurate predictions for mortality at one year than ICU clinicians who do not."
