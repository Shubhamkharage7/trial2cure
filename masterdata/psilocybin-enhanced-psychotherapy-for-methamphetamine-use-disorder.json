The treatment protocol will consist of 4 preparatory therapy visits, 2 psilocybin sessions (25-30mg), and 8 total integration therapy visits. Primary aims assess acceptability, feasibility, and safety with a primary endpoint at the conclusion of the study intervention. An additional aim assesses preliminary efficacy for methamphetamine use disorder and overall functioning at follow-up assessments 60 and 180 days after discharge from the residential treatment program."
