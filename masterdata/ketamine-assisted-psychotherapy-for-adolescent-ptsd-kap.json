The study will enroll adolescents with a current diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to complete three intravenous ketamine administrations immediately prior to a psychotherapy session over the span of six weeks. All participants will complete an initial set of preparatory sessions, and each dosing session will be followed by three integration sessions. Finally, participants will complete 7 nights of at-home sleep recordings. The investigators hypothesize that this protocol will be well-tolerated by adolescents and that patients will experience decreases in PTSD symptom severity at follow-up.",
