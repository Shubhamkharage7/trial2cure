Patients will undergo a stem cell transplant from a half-matched family donor. One week later, patients will receive an additional infusion of immune cells and a drug called interleukin-2.\n\nTo mitigate the potential complications associated with graft-versus-host-disease, the donated stem cell product undergoes a process that removes a specific type of immune cell. After transplant, recipients are administered additional immune cells known as memory-like natural killer (ML NK) cells. These cells are derived by converting conventional natural killer cells obtained from the donor.\n\nThe infusion of a modified stem cell product, along with administration of ML NK cells may help prevent the development of GvHD while simultaneously improving the efficacy of the treatment."
