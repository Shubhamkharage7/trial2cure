            "briefSummary": "This study is driven by the hypothesis that navigation for users of retinal prosthetics can be greatly improved by incorporating Spatial Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and object recognition technology conveying environmental information via a retinal prosthesis and auditory feedback. The investigators will study how effectively the SLAM technology enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The technology will be tested both with normally sighted individuals donning a virtual reality headset and with retinal prosthesis users (Argus II).",
            "detailedDescription": "About 1.3 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind, a majority because of diseases with onset later in life, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Second Sight Medical Products (SSMP) has developed the world's first FDA approved retinal implant, Argus II, intended to restore some functional vision for people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this era of smart devices, generic navigation technology, such as GPS mapping apps for smartphones, can provide directions to help guide a blind user from point A to point B. However, these navigational aids do little to enable blind users to form an egocentric understanding of the surroundings, are not suited to navigation indoors, and do nothing to assist in avoiding obstacles to mobility. The Argus II, on the other hand, provides blind users with a limited visual representation of their surroundings that improves users' ability to orient themselves and traverse obstacles, yet lacks features for high-level navigation and semantic interpretation of the surroundings. The proposed study aims to address these limitations of the Argus II through a synergy of state-of-the-art simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object recognition technologies.\n\nThis study is driven by the hypothesis that navigation for users of retinal prosthetics can be greatly improved by incorporating SLAM and object recognition technology conveying environmental information via a retinal prosthesis and auditory feedback. SLAM enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The system then provides object location and navigational cues via appropriate sensory modalities enabling the user to mentally form an egocentric map of the environment. Investigators will develop and test a visual prosthesis system which 1) constructs a map of unfamiliar environments and localizes the user using SLAM technology 2) automatically identifies navigationally-relevant objects and landmarks using object recognition and 3) provides sensory feedback for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object/landmark identification."

The navigation system will be designed and developed as part of the proposed research and will interface with the Argus II retinal prosthesis system, which is an FDA approved visual prosthesis. Existing blind users of the Argus II device will be recruited for this study, and the navigation system will interface with these subjects' existing Argus II systems. Sighted subjects will also be recruited for this study, in which case the navigation system will interface with a head-mounted display (such as the Oculus Rift) worn by the sighted subjects that simulates the visual sensory information experienced by blind users of the Argus II retinal implant.",
