            "briefSummary": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the blood's plasma cells. The cancer is typically found in the bones and bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of the bones) and can cause bone pain, fractures, infections, weaker bones, and kidney failure. Treatments are available, but MM can come back (relapsed) or may not get better (refractory) with treatment. This is a study to determine change in disease symptoms of ABBV-383 compared to standard available therapies in adult participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM.\n\nABBV-383 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of R/R MM. This study is broken into 2 Arms; Arm A and Arm B. . In Arm A, participants will receive ABBV-383 as a monotherapy. In Arm B, participants will receive the standard available therapy (SAT) identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable. Around 380 adult participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled at approximately 140 sites across the world.\n\nIn Arm A participants will receive ABBV-383 as an infusion into the vein in 28 day cycles, during the 3.5 year study duration. In Arm B, participants will receive the SAT identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable, during the 3.5 year study duration.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and questionnaires."
