Conclusions from Phase 2 will be based on safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity.\n\nParticipants with PSMA positive scans will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of three different dosing arms:\n\nArm 1: Will consist of nine doses of FPI-2265, administered every four weeks at 50 kBq/kg.\n\nArm 2: Will consist of six doses of FPI-2265, administered every six weeks at 75 kBq/kg.\n\nArm 3: Will consist of four doses of FPI-2265, administered every eight weeks at 100 kBq/kg.\n\nParticipants will be monitored and assessed for efficacy response, disease progression and adverse events."
