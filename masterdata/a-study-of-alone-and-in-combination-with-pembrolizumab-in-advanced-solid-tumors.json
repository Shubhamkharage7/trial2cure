What cancers can be treated effectively with DM919 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab??\n\nParticipants will be asked to attend clinic and be given a intravenous infusion of DM919 or DM-919 in combination with pembrolizumab. They will have blood tests and other assessments to measure whether DM-919 will have the effect on tumors."

Had an allogeneic solid organ or stem cell transplant.\n21. Received systemic corticosteroid use at doses \\>10 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment or other systemic immunosuppressive agents within 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment.\n22.
