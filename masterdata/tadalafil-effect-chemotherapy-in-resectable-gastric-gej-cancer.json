            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the ability of Tadalafil alone and in combination with neoadjuvant FLOT (5-Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, and Docetaxel) chemotherapy to suppress myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in patients with resectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Resectable means the tumor may be removed through surgical intervention. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy received before the primary course of treatment i.e.surgical intervention.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is Tadalafil treatment with FLOT feasible and safe?\n* How does tadalafil treatment with FLOT affect the tumor microenvironment (TME)?\n* Will 8 weeks of neoadjuvant exposure to tadalafil with chemotherapy reduce MDSCs in the TME?\n\nParticipants will receive Tadalafil for 14 days followed by combination of Tadalafil + FLOT for approximately 8 weeks as a part of standard of care neoadjuvant treatment in the window between cancer diagnosis and surgical intervention to remove their tumor. Tumor tissue, blood, and urine will be collected at the start of the study, after 2 weeks of treatment with Tadalafil alone, and around the time of surgical intervention. Saliva will also be collected at the start of the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Despite the availability of multimodality approaches for localized gastric cancer, the survival rates remain dismal for resectable disease. There is a large unmet need to identify new therapeutic options, to be used in combination with chemotherapy and to improve survival outcomes. Emerging data have shown the implication of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the alteration of tumor microenvironment. The MDSCs are involved in tumor progression by promoting immune suppression, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, tumor metastasis and limiting the effects of cancer immunotherapy. In vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) such as Sildenafil or Tadalafil inhibit MDSCs, augment the endogenous antitumor immunity and improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. There have been similar reports of enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy with PDE5i in murine models of melanoma, multiple myeloma, lung, breast, head and neck, colorectal and brain cancer. PDE5 inhibitors suppress nitric oxide synthetase (Nos)-expressing myeloid derived stem cells (MDSCs). There have been no prior clinical studies using a PDE5,6 inhibitor to enhance chemotherapeutic cell death in the upper gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, the investigators propose this trial to study the effect of the long-acting PDE5,6i Tadalafil in combination with chemotherapy (FLOT) in resectable Gastric/GEJ cancers.\n\nThis is a single arm, phase II, window trial to assess the ability of Tadalafil to suppress MDSCs as monotherapy and in combination with neoadjuvant FLOT chemotherapy in patients with resectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.\n\nThe study will enroll 10 patients. Patients will receive Tadalafil for 14 days followed by combination of Tadalafil + FLOT for approximately 8 weeks as a part of standard of care neoadjuvant treatment. Tumor specimens, blood, and urine will be collected at baseline, after 2 weeks of monotherapy treatment with Tadalafil, and around the time of surgical intervention to analyze the tumor microenvironment (TME) and to determine whether PDE5, 6 inhibition reduces the immune suppressive microenvironment. Saliva will also be collected at baseline.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that daily dosing of Tadalafil with chemotherapy will significantly reduce myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME."

Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\n    1. Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after Principal Investigator confirmation has been obtained.\n    2. Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n13. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment of within 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within screening. Test will need to be repeated if last completed \\>3 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n14. Inability to swallow tablets.\n15. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulations.\n16. Previous episode of Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)\n17. Any other active malignancy at time of first dose of study treatment or diagnosis of another malignancy within 3 years prior to first dose of study treatment that requires active treatment, except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.",
