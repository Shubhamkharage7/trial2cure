AU409 may stop cancer from growing and spreading. This trial may help researchers determine if AU409 is safe and effective in treating patients with liver cancers and solid tumors with liver metastatic disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RNA transcription modulator AU-409 (AU409) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).\n\nII. To characterize the safety and tolerability of AU409 by assessing toxicities per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0 criteria.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To obtain a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of AU409 via objective radiologic response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.\n\nII. To determine pharmacokinetics of AU409 in patients with advanced-stage solid tumors.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the concentration of AU409 in tumor tissue from liver biopsy samples obtained from a subset of patients treated with AU409 at dose level 4 (300 mg) and above.\n\nII. To evaluate expression of genes with TATA box promotion regions on pre- and post- treatment liver biopsy samples.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients receive AU409 orally (PO) on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and collection of blood samples throughout the trial."

Patients with chronic Hepatitis C are allowed\n* Patients who have active infection requiring treatment (except hepatitis B and C as noted above) including known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* Patients who have concurrent conditions resulting in immune compromise, including chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents\n* Patients who have any other condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interferes with the interpretation of the results\n* Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants\n* Patients who are on medications that are considered to be strong inducers or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes should have such medications discontinued or replaced. Such medications should be avoided for one week prior to first dose of treatment and during the trial participation. If these medications are absolutely necessary for the patient and cannot be replaced, enrollment may still be considered on a case by case basis if it is in the patient's best interest and after discussion with the principal investigator (PI)",
