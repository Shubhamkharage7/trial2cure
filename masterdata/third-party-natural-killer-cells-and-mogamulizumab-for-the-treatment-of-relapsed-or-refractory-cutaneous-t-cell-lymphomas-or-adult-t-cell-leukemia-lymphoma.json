            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of third-party natural killer cells in combination with mogamulizumab in treating patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with third-party natural killer cells, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Mogamulizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving third-party natural killer cells in combination with mogamulizumab may kill more cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine safety, tolerability, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IL-21 expanded, off the shelf, third-party natural killer (NK) cells and mogamulizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in same patient population treated with IL-21 expanded, off the shelf, third-party NK cells and mogamulizumab.\n\nII. To determine impact of treatment on quality of life (QOL) by skindex-16 score.\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To study CCR4 expression in lymphoma cells. II. To study serum cytokine levels. III. To study trafficking of third-party NK cells to skin and tissues. IV. To study the persistence of IL-21 expanded, off the shelf, third-party NK cells by chimerism studies.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of natural killer cells.\n\nPatients receive mogamulizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day -7 and fludarabine IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3. Patients receive NK cell infusion every 2 weeks for six infusions total starting on day 0. Patients then receive mogamulizumab IV over 60 minutes on days 0, 7, 14, and 28, then every 2 weeks thereafter in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28-35 days and then every 3 months for 2 years."

Patients are allowed to continue any medications with known activity in T cell lymphomas at the pre-enrollment doses for conditions other than T cell lymphomas (ie, steroids for sarcoidosis), as long as there is evidence of T cell lymphoma progression while patients were on these agents\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =\\< 1 at study entry\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1000/mm\\^3\n* Platelet count \\>= 50,000/mm\\^3\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\]) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 3 x ULN\n\n  * AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) =\\< 5 x ULN in patients with documented hepatic involvement by lymphoma\n* Calculated creatinine clearance \\>= 50 ml/min (by the Crockroft-Gault equation)\n* Disease free of prior malignancies for \\>= 2 years with exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast. Patients with early stage of prostate cancer under clinical surveillance without therapy are eligible. Patients with B-cell lymphomas treated with curative intent, and in remission for at least 2 years, may be in included (after discussion with principal investigator \\[PI\\])\n* Negative serum pregnancy test at the time of enrollment for females of childbearing potential\n* Life expectancy \\>= 90 days\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Investigational therapies in the 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on trial\n* Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement with lymphoma\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 \\< 350\n* Patients who had solid organ transplants\n* Evidence of active hepatitis B infection, based on positive surface antigen or hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or active hepatitis C infection based on positive PCR. Patients who are hepatitis B core antibody positive must take prophylaxis with lamivudine or equivalent and be willing to undergo monthly hepatitis B DNA PCR testing\n* Present or history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n* Active grade II-IV acute or extensive chronic graft versus (vs.) host disease (GVHD)\n* Patients may take steroids at any dose for disease control up to 24 hours prior to study enrollment. Steroids must have been discontinued at least 1 week or 3 half-lives whichever is the longest prior to treatment in this study, per inclusion criteria above. Topical steroids are allowed for CTCL patients\n* Any illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety\n* A cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association class \\>= 2\n* History of severe allergic reactions to humanized monoclonal antibodies\n* History of other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results.
