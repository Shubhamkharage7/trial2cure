They feature multisensory input that is inspired by nature, as has previously been found to confer physiological benefits. These environments include silk imitation plants, projected scenes of soothing natural landscapes, low lighting that is tailored in color to match the landscapes that are being projected, high definition audio recordings of nature sounds paired with relaxing music, and infusion of essential oils and calming scents.\n\nThe aim is to investigate the physiological and mental health outcomes that the short and long term exposure to these rooms have on healthcare workers. The data will be collected through online surveys. No identifiable information will be assessed or collected. The plan is to have 60 participants."
