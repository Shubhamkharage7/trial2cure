            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the brain activity associated with cognitive tasks (thinking, reasoning, remembering) in order to understand how the brain works during certain tasks and to improve treatment for diseases like dementia and attention deficit disorders. Cognitive (thinking) impairment may include poor memory function, poor attention span, or psychiatric disorders (ex: ADD, depression). The investigators are interested in the brain activity related to these issues, and want to investigate changes in brain activity while we record activity from specific areas of the brain. These recordings are in addition to clinical (routine or standard of care) recordings being performed to monitor for seizures and do not impact the clinical care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Routine intracranial monitoring (ICM) surgery involves placement of several (10-20) electrodes into the brain through a small opening to a target structure. Participants have been deemed a surgical candidate for this procedure, and detailed discussion of the procedure will occur as part of the surgical consent. The Investigators may place sensors (stickers) to monitor participant's arm/hand movements and brain activity. Sensors may be placed on participant's scalp and/or arms and legs. The Investigators may place a device on participant's wrist or finger to measure position (accelerometer). The Investigators may perform voice recordings, eye movement tracking, and motion capture recordings to obtain measures of how stimulation affects speech and other movements. These are performed without any attachment of devices.\n\nCognitive tasks: Multiple cognitive tasks may be used and will be decided upon based on the clinical symptoms, exam, or comorbidities. These may include Go/No-go, Simon/Stroop task, Stop-signal task, language tasks, Tower of London, gambling task, maze navigation, choice-reaction time, delay tasks, and attention tasks.\n\nCortico-cortical evoked potentials and Patterned Stimulation: Stimulus pulses at precise time intervals and or various patterns will be delivered across adjacent electrode contacts at a series of electrode sites while simultaneously recording neural activity at other electrodes. This does not require any activity from participant.\n\nTasks will be administered via computer monitor positioned in front of the you. This will be connected to a recording computer. Participant will respond via keyboard, mouse, or response button."

The most frequent paradigm consists of delivering small amounts of electrical stimulation through the implanted grid/strip/depth electrodes. This will be either continuous stimulation or patterned stimulation such as intermittent theta-burst . Stimulation will range between 1-8 mAmp. The duration of these pulses will last between 2-5 seconds.\n\nSubjects may be asked to rest quietly or to perform behavioral tasks during stimulation. Since there is a risk of evoking seizure activity with active testing, presence of an epileptologist is required. Active testing will only occur once the PI/staff has communicated with the epileptologist regarding safety, feasibility, and timing of active testing. Active testing will typically take 60-90 minutes and is only performed once patients are back on their anti-seizure medications.",
