The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* how effective is the usage of the i3.1 probiotic to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and normalize the GI and systemic/brain interface?\n* how well is it working on IBS severity? The study sample is 100 male and female participants aged 45 to 70 years with ME/CFS (per the Canadian Consensus Criteria); one-half of the participants will have co-morbid IBS (per Rome IV criteria). Participants will receive an i3.1 or a placebo and be assessed at baseline, at eight weeks, and at 12 weeks (four weeks post-treatment completion).",

In this study, we will evaluate using the i3.1 probiotic compared to placebo. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with four study arms that will include 25 participants per arm: Individuals with ME/CFS with and without IBS, who will take either the active medication i3.1 or placebo."
