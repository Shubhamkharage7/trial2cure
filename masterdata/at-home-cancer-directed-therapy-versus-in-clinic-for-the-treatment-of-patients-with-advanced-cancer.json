            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies the effect of cancer directed therapy given at-home versus in the clinic for patients with cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Currently most drug-related cancer care is conducted in infusion centers or specialty hospitals, where patients spend many hours a day isolated from family, friends, and familiar surroundings. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. The logistics and costs of navigating cancer treatments have become a principal contributor to patients' reduced quality of life. It is therefore important to reduce the burden of cancer in the lives of patients and their caregivers, and a vital aspect of this involves moving beyond traditional hospital and clinic-based care and evaluate innovative care delivery models with virtual capabilities. Providing cancer treatment at-home, versus in the clinic, may help reduce psychological and financial distress and increase treatment compliance, especially for marginalized patients and communities.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare mean patient-reported rating of Cancer Connected Access and Remote Expertise (CARE) using a modified question from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Cancer Care Survey after 8 weeks between patients randomized to receive care at home and care in the clinic.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate patient preference for location of cancer treatment administration, at the infusion center or in the home.\n\nII. To evaluate level of comfort with receiving infusions at home based on the following measures after 24 weeks of treatment (or at end of study):\n\nIIa. The proportion of patients who indicate a preference for home infusion or no preference versus outpatient infusion unit administration of cancer treatment as assessed via the Patient Preference Questionnaire; IIb. The proportion of patients who indicate comfort (quite a bit or very much) with receiving infusions at home as assessed by the Patient Preference Questionnaire.\n\nIII. To describe other patient experience questions within the Patient Preference Questionnaire after 24 weeks of treatment (or at end of study).\n\nIV. To describe whether patients felt that infusions at home was worthwhile, would do it again, and recommend it to others after 24 weeks of treatment (or at end of study) using the Was It Worth It questionnaire.\n\nV. To test whether home-based virtual delivery of cancer directed therapy is superior to standard administration (in clinic) in patient-reported function and global health/quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Function 17-Item (EORTC QLQ-F17) after 8 weeks of home versus outpatient infusion unit administration of cancer treatment.\n\nVI. To test whether home-based virtual delivery of cancer directed therapy is superior to standard administration (in clinic) in patient-reported symptoms as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) after 8 weeks of home versus outpatient infusion unit administration of cancer treatment.\n\nVII. To assess the safety of cancer directed therapy when administered at home by a home health provider with remote patient monitoring and Command Center support, based on the incidence, nature, and severity of the following:\n\nVIIa. Grade 3+ adverse event (AE) clinically graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0).\n\nVIII. To test whether home-based virtual delivery of cancer directed therapy is superior to standard in clinic administration in the proportion of patients with an emergency room visit or hospitalization at the end of 6 months of study treatment.\n\nIX. Overall survival.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the cost of care in first 6 months (data collected out to 1 year). II. To evaluate administration of treatment based on clinical practice data.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive the first 2 cycles of their standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy regimen in the clinic in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients continue receiving their SOC chemotherapy regimen at home for approximately 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. This includes drug administrations, injections/infusions and routine clinical laboratory tests in the home from the Home Health Nurse Provider (HHNP), overseen by Mayo Clinic's home health program Cancer CARE Beyond Walls (CCBW) Command Center. Patients are also provided biometric devices for health monitoring vital signs, as well as a computer tablet for video visits with the Mayo Clinic care team.\n\nARM B: Patients continue receiving their SOC chemotherapy regimen in the clinic for approximately 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then begin receiving their SOC chemotherapy regimen at home as in Arm I for an approximate additional 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed for 1 year."
