The trial will recruit from 3 NYC-H+H ambulatory clinics as well as NYU Langone Family Health Centers, and will use a lottery incentive program to promote adherence to antihypertensive medication that will be delivered via smartphone for 6 months. The trial will randomize 435 patients with hypertension determined to have poor adherence (\\<80% adherence with antihypertensive medication), in a 2:1 (intervention:control) ratio. Baseline enrollment will occur over 36 months with an expected 12 months follow-up per participant."
