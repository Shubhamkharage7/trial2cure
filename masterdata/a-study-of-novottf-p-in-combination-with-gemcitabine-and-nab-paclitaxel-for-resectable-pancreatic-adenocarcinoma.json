            "briefSummary": "This is a single arm phase II study. All patients will receive 3 cycles of the treatment of nab-paclitaxel (Days 1, 8 and 15), gemcitabine (Days 1, 8 and 15), and TTFields (worn every day for at least 18 hours). Following the initial 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment, patients will undergo restaging by CT or MRI. Patients with stable disease or better will undergo surgery for resection within 8 weeks following completion of initial chemotherapy although enrolling sites are encouraged to perform resection within 4 weeks of Cycle 3 D15 of therapy. If resection yields R0 or R1, patients will begin an additional 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment within 8 weeks of surgery. Based on available literature, it is expected that a percentage of patients will not undergo resection either due to disease progression or due to toxicities/ complications of the neoadjuvant segment of therapy. These patients will be included in the evaluable patients for both co-primary endpoints as well as the secondary endpoints including ORR, adverse events, and OS."
