Participants (N=125) will be children age \u22656 years and adults with definite PCD. Participants will be enrolled for approximately 13 months, during which they will attend at least two study visits and perform home monitoring. Participants will be encouraged to attend study visits in-person but will have the option for virtual telehealth visits to ensure compliance with local guidelines and participant safety. Endpoints will be assessed during both well state (i.e., patients typical state of health) and sick state (i.e., during each self-reported period of acute respiratory illness). Informed consent will be obtained, after which the participant will be receive a home spirometer and instructed in its use This design allows for a training period in order to become proficient with home spirometry, with the first study visit occurring 1 month \u00b1 2 weeks after enrollment and the second 12 (\u00b11) months after visit 1 (coordinated with routine clinic visits as possible). Participants will also participate in a set of two optional ARI visits during one ARI, scheduled between 3-5 business days of study team notification by the participant of the new ARI and 2-4 weeks later."
