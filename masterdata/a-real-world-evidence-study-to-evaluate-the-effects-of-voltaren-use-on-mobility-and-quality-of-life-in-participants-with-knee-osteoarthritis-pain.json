            "detailedDescription": "This prospective open-label, single-arm, multi-country (United States \\[US\\] and European Union \\[EU\\]) real-world evidence study will be conducted in a hybrid form and will focus on assessing the impact of Voltaren Gel on functional mobility and QoL in individuals with mild/nonserious OA of the knee. Participants will be required to be physically present at the study site for screening, end of baseline and end of study visits. The remaining treatment will be conducted in a remote manner (for example, at home) to observe the real-world usage of Voltaren Gel. This study will utilize a research-grade validated wearable device: Actigraph, to accurately measure objective changes in functional mobility. Sufficient participants will be screened to enroll approximately 195 participants to ensure that around 147 of these participants will successfully complete the entire study."
