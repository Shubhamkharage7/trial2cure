            "briefSummary": "Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing is an effective intervention to reduce hospitalized patient's risk of acquiring a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). While daily CHG bathing for hospitalized patients is widely supported in the literature, patient adherence with this practice is suboptimal. Written and verbal information is provided to patients by nursing staff regarding the importance of CHG bathing and the correct usage of the CHG cloths; however, these methods can be hindered by literacy and language barriers. Medical videos have become popular avenues to provide necessary education to patients, and have been shown to improve patient-reported outcomes. Whereas the benefits of educational videos has been described in previous studies on advanced care planning and postoperative quality of life, they have not been described for CHG bathing. In this study, we aim to provide education (including the rationale/importance of CHG bathing, and the appropriate process for bathing) through the use of a short video provided to hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of medical videos to educate patients on CHG bathing while hospitalized in the inpatient setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "For this study, approximately 16 inpatient units will be included; 8 will be randomized to the intervention (access to patient-facing CHG video) with the remaining units continuing with usual care (providing education via verbal/written information). All patients who require a CHG bath would be eligible to participate.\n\nIntervention Group: In addition to the current educational document available for CHG bathing, patients admitted to the intervention units will be provided access to a CHG bathing video through multiple avenues (QR codes placed in the room/unit, video provided on unit iPads). Nurses will be instructed to provide QR codes to patients to scan and watch the video. Patients can scan the QR code using their own smart device or through unit-based iPads. After viewing the video, patients will be directed to scan a separate QR code to complete a voluntary questionnaire.\n\nControl Group: Patients in the control group would have access to the current education available (patient education document) - usual care"
