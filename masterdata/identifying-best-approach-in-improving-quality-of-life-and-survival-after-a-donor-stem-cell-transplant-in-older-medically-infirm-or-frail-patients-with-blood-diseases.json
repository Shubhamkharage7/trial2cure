            "briefSummary": "This phase II/III trial studies the best approach in improving quality of life and survival after a donor stem cell transplant in older, weak, or frail patients with blood diseases. Patients who have undergone a transplant often experience increases in disease and death. One approach, supportive and palliative care (SPC), focuses on relieving symptoms of stress from serious illness and care through physical, cultural, psychological, social, spiritual, and ethical aspects. While a second approach, clinical management of comorbidities (CMC) focuses on managing multiple diseases, other than cancer, such as heart or lung diseases through physical exercise, strength training, stress reduction, medication management, dietary recommendations, and education. Giving SPC, CMC, or a combination of both may work better in improving quality of life and survival after a donor stem cell transplant compared to standard of care in patients with blood diseases.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo SPC on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo a CMC program on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.\n\nARM III: Patients undergo interventions as outlined in Arm I and Arm II.\n\nARM IV: Patients receive standard of care.\n\nIn all arms, patients undergo HCT on day 0 and complete questionnaires and surveys at enrollment and 30, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT. In all arms patients complete a 4-meter walk test, 6-minute walk test, up and go test, measured strength test and cognitive assessment at enrollment, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT. Patients may also complete surveys on medical and non-medical (transportation, lodging) costs related to transplant after HCT."

Patients with suspected active disease (relatively old disease staging or relatively old intervention) or significant comorbidity (e.g. suspicious untreated pulmonary nodules) based on prior evaluations, that could delay the transplant would be considered for enrollment within a tighter window (10-14 days before allogeneic HCT) to allow for completed pre-HCT work-up evaluations that would confirm readiness to proceed with transplant\n* Able to exercise at low to moderate intensity, specifically taking into consideration the rare circumstances where subjects are not able to exercise due to either birth deformity or prior traumatic injury that affects their gait\n* Adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, as judged by data from the patient's electronic medical record as to whether a patient could walk up one flight of stairs, no need for supplemental oxygen, and/or physician judgment\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Orthopedic, neurologic or other problems which prevent safe ambulation and protocol adherence. Information on prior falls and other recent orthopedic or neurologic problems will be used to make judgment about protocol eligibility\n* Participation in another intervention clinical trial with HRQOL as a primary endpoint\n* Planned donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 90 days post-transplant\n* Planned anti-cytotoxic therapies, other than tyrosine kinase inhibitors or single-agent monoclonal antibody, or FLT-3 inhibitors within 90 days of post-transplant unless pre-approved by the protocol principal investigator (PI)",
