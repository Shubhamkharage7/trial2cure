No other curriculum targeting tolerance and/or extremism has been optimized using the state-of-the-art MOST methodology. The overall goal of the project is that the optimized versions of Peaceful Coexistence and Anti-Extremism curricula will be used across the Kingdom of Bahrain and translated for use in other countries to combat the spread of extremism and intolerance. Additionally, the D.A.R.E. keepin' it REAL (kiR) and D.A.R.E. myPlaybook high school programs will be evaluated as part of the Peaceful Coexistence and Anti-Extremism evaluation."
