The participants are patients with stroke with motor weakness in one hand. Two measurement visits are required. During those visits, different hand function assessments will be carried out to analyze the motor function of the subjects hand. The measurements will be done during their inpatient rehabilitation stay, one at time of admission and the second at discharge, each taking 20 minutes. In the time between the measurement visits, the hand therapy takes place fivemtimes a week.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators hypothesize that the physical MT with Mira\u03c0 with physical movement of the affected hand will be generating a better patient outcome than conventional MT. Until now MT is performed in front of a mirror with the help of an occupational therapist, which can prove to be difficult. The affected hand of the patient is not moved during training. For the reasons mentioned, the mirror therapy device MIRA\u03c0 was developed. With MIRA\u03c0, no mirror is needed and the affected hand is also physically moved by the device. Therefore, this clinical trial will focus on evaluating the device to see if it works better than conventional MT and therefore creates greater benefits to the patients."
