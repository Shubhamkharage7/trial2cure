            "briefSummary": "This 3-year Hybrid Type 1 study will randomize 208 people with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders (COD) referred from the Worcester Hub. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of MISSION, a multi-component team approach, versus linkage with a Peer Specialist on improving outcomes among individuals with CODs. We expect that individuals receiving MISSION versus linkage only will show greater improvement in treatment engagement, substance use, and mental health outcomes. This study will also concurrently conduct a process evaluation to inform sustainability and future implementation of such interventions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Addiction is a growing public health problem in the United States (U.S.), with nearly 21 million Americans meeting criteria for substance use disorder (SUD), 1.6 million meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid-related overdoses have increased by 50% over the past 5 years. Among people with SUD, 49% have comorbid mental health disorders (COD). Individuals with COD are vulnerable to substance use relapses, mental illness exacerbations, overdoses, homelessness, and criminal justice involvement. However, despite the high rates of morbidity, mortality, and broad social determinant of health needs among people with COD, only 8% of individuals in the U.S. received treatment for both mental illness and SUD. Among those with a COD receiving treatment, 6-month engagement rates are as low as 16% for psychosocial treatments, and 90% of individuals leaving treatment will relapse within 12 weeks. Massachusetts is also hard hit, with a 16% higher SUD prevalence compared to the U.S., and Worcester, the second largest city in Massachusetts, is disproportionately affected by SUD, having one of the highest overdose rates in the state and is ranked 2nd on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's social vulnerability index. These findings highlight the need to improve treatment access and engagement to support recovery in Worcester, Massachusetts. Both linkage and multicomponent wraparound models have gained popularity as a solution to increase treatment access and engagement. Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a hybrid multicomponent linkage and treatment approach, providing assertive outreach linkage support combined with psychosocial treatment, delivered by a cross disciplinary team. MISSION is aligned with the Social Ecological Model (SEM) to address multilevel client needs via 3 evidence-based practices. They include 1) Critical Time Intervention (CTI), a time-limited form of assertive community treatment; 2) Dual Recovery Therapy (DRT), which is integrated group therapy for COD; and 3) Peer Support (PS), offering support for people in recovery by people in recovery. In response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (RFA-CE-22-010), the proposed 3-year Hybrid Type I study, \"Supporting Treatment Access and Recovery through Linkage and Support (STAR-LS),\" will recruit and randomize 208 patients with COD in Worcester, MA in the Hub, a program run by the Worcester Health and Human Services to one of the following conditions: 1) MISSION; or 2) Peer Support (linkage only). There are three specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of MISSION or compared to Peer Support to improve engagement, substance use and mental health symptoms. Aim 2: To examine mechanisms of action of the interventions. Aim 3: To conduct a sequential mixed methods process evaluation to inform sustainability and future implementation. This proposal is aligned with CDC's Strategic Priority Areas and Health People 2030 Core Objectives as it intends to improve behavioral health outcomes strengthen and sustain the recovery ecosystem for people with COD."
