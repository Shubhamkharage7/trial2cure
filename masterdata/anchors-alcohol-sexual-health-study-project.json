Participants will then take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention and complete a daily 5-minute, telephone-based interactive voice response (IVR) assessment of alcohol/substance use, sexual behavior and PrEP taking for 30 days. Medication will all be active PrEP. There is no placebo control in this study. Follow-up will occur after 30-days and 6-months later."
