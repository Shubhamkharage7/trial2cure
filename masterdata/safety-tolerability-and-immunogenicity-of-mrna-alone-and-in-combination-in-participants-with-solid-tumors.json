Parts A and B will include a dose escalation phase of the study to identify doses of mRNA-4157 for the expansion phase of the study. Doses of mRNA-4157 will be administered to participants in a dose escalation regimen. Participants in Parts A2, B, C, D, E1, E2 and E3 dose expansion phase will receive mRNA-4157 at a recommended dose for expansion."

Any investigational agents, anti-cancer monoclonal antibody, anti-cancer therapeutic vaccine, immunostimulant (for example, IL-2), or study drugs from a previous clinical study within 4 weeks of the first dose of mRNA-4157 or pembrolizumab (note only a 2 week wash out is required from prior pembrolizumab treatment)\n  2. Any chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of mRNA-4157 or pembrolizumab\n  3. Live-virus vaccination within 30 days of the first dose of mRNA-4157 or pembrolizumab. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.\n  4. Any systemic steroid therapy or other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days of the first dose of mRNA-4157 or pembrolizumab\n  5. Transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells \\[RBCs\\]) or administration of colony stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony stimulating factor \\[G-CSF\\], granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor \\[GM-CSF\\], or recombinant erythropoietin) within 1 week of the NGS blood sample during screening, and 4 weeks of the first dose of mRNA-4157 or pembrolizumab\n* A history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator\n* Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Previously identified hypersensitivity to components of the formulations used in this study\n* Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer.\n\nNote: Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply, per protocol.",
