The study will be guided by a standard \"3+3\"dose escalation by observing the drug-related toxicities and dose-limiting toxicities following weekly IV infusion of DFP-14927 for each 28-day cycle (4 doses per cycle). In addition, the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose for DFP-14927 will be determined.\n\nFurthermore, the study will determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of DFP-14927 during the first cycle of treatment using the weekly dosing schedule."
