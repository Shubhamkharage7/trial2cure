Tissue and serum samples collected from a limited numbers of \"healthy controls\" (donor grafts that were not utilized for heart transplantation) will serve as a comparator in research database projects.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is a registry project; there are no investigational treatments, drug or procedures associated with participation in registry activities. This project is an organized functional data and tissue data gathering and storing (database) endeavor with specific focus on the functional, structural, and molecular aspects of heart failure. Data collection will not immediately influence the course of treatment for any patient.",

Tissue samples will be obtained at the time of LVAD implantation by keeping the part of the left ventricular apex that the surgeon is removing in order to place the inflow cannula of the LVAD. No extra tissue sample, other than the tissue that has to be removed as a part of a standard LVAD, will be collected."
