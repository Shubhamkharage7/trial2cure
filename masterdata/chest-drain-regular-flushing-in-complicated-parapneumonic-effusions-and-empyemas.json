            "briefSummary": "Infections of the pleural space are common, and patients require antibiotics and chest drain placement to evacuate the chest from the infected fluid. Chest drains can get blocked by the drainage fluid and material. For this reason, it is thought that flushing the chest drain with saline solution, can help maintain the patency of the tube. This proposed study will evaluate the impact of regular chest drain flushing on the length of time to chest tube removal and total hospitalization as well as improvement in chest imaging and the need for additional interventions on the infected space.",
            "detailedDescription": "There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the role of regular chest tube flushing in the setting of pleural space infection for optimal drainage and treatment outcomes. Most studies of \\<16 Fr catheters have used both flushing and suction to decrease the likelihood of catheter blockage and improve drainage efficiency, however, this practice has never been studied prospectively or in RCTs. Regular flushing (e.g., 20-30 ml saline every 6 h via a three-way tap) is recommended for small chest drains by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) 2010 Guidelines. This practice is followed variably by some and not used by others. Importantly, the role of this practice in successful drainage of infected fluid, and patient-centric outcomes has not been investigated. Inconsistent flushing practices confound the interpretation of therapeutic modalities (such as intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator and deoxyribonuclease therapy) success or lack thereof and limit the execution of RCTs and prospective studies of the pleural space in the setting of infection."
