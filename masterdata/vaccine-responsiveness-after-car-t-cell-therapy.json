            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial will use the inactivated rabies virus vaccine to assess immune function in patients who previously underwent B cell targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell immunotherapy (CARTx). A cohort of healthy volunteers will also be enrolled as a comparator group. CARTx is a new treatment for patients with B-cell malignancies (cancer of the B-cells), and the long-term effects of CARTx on immune function are not yet well understood. Learning more about vaccine responsiveness in patients who previously underwent CARTx may help doctors better understand immune function. The findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.",
            "detailedDescription": "STUDY DESIGN:\n\nThis study will be a prospective, open-label clinical trial of primary and secondary vaccination with the inactivated rabies vaccine in patients treated with CARTx for B cell malignancies and healthy individuals. The target enrollment for this trial is 43 CARTx recipients and 10 healthy controls. The study is open to anyone regardless of gender or ethnicity.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nBOLUS COHORT: Patients receive the inactivated rabies vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and 6-10 weeks later. Patients also undergo a blood collection prior to each vaccine, and at approximately 1, 2, and 4 weeks after each vaccination. A final blood collection occurs 6 months after the first immunization. This will include up to 31 participants.\n\nFRACTIONAL DOSE COHORT: Patients receive the inactivated rabies vaccine fractionated primary dose IM on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 17 and the second dose 6-10 weeks later. Patients also undergo a blood collection prior to each vaccine, and at approximately 1, 2, and 4 weeks after each vaccination. A final blood collection occurs 6 months after the first immunization. This will include up to 12 participants."
