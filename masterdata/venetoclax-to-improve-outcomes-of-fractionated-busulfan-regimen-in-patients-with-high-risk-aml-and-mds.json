Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax, busulfan, cladribine, and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Adding venetoclax to the current standard of care stem cell transplant regimen of busulfan, fludarabine, and cladribine may help to control high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.",

Safety of this regimen as per NCI toxicity criteria\n2. Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment\n3. Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD\n4. Relapse incidence\n5. Non-relapse mortality\n6. Overall survival\n7. Graft versus host disease-relapse free survival (GRFS)\n\nPhase 3 Portion\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n1) To compare progression free survival between two arms Arm 1 Standard of Care: fludarabine + IV busulfan (FluBu) versus Arm 2 Experimental: Venetoclax + Fractionated busulfan, cladribine, and fludarabine\n\nSecondary Objectives To compare following between two arms\n\n1.
