This investigation attempts to isolate the influence of adiposity on these responses. We will enroll overweight, obese, and normal weight cancer survivors with a primary diagnosis of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer who have completed all cancer-related treatment. Participants will engage in a 15-week aerobic exercise intervention with pre- and post-intervention assessments."
