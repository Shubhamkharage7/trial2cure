            "briefSummary": "This Phase I/Il studies the side effects of endobronchial ultrasound guided interstitial photodynamic therapy work in treating patients with lung cancer that has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. Photodynamic therapy consists of injecting a light sensitive drug called a photosensitizer, such as porfimer sodium, into the vein, waiting for it to accumulate in the tumor, and then activating it with a red laser light. Giving photodynamic therapy with Porfimer sodium may reduce the tumor size in patients with lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES PHASE 1:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle (EBUS-TBN) guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (EBUS-TBN I-PDT) and/or I-PDT and/or photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with malignant airway obstructions using porfimer sodium as a photosensitizer.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE Phase II\n\n* I. To assess the tumor response to treatment.\n* II To observe changes in well being\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n* I. To evaluate local progression-free survival (PFS).\n* II.To compare the treatment planning in DOSIE\u2122 with the plan generated in COMSOL\u2122 - COHORT A ONLY\n* III. To measure changes in tumor pO2, optical properties, and irradiance and fluence in relationship to response\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Examine porfimer sodium retention in the target tumor tissue. II. Examine the relationship between immune biomarkers and response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive Porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes 2-4 hours prior to the delivery of I-PDT. Patients then undergo EBUS-TBN guided I-PDT over 30-45 minutes.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks."
