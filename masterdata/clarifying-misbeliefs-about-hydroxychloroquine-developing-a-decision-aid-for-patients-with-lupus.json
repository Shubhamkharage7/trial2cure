The main question it aims to answer is whether the decision-making tool will increase medication adherence.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete questionnaires that assess their understanding of the decision-making tool.",

During the same visit that a participant routinely does for lupus with their healthcare team, a healthcare team member will discuss the tool that elaborates the benefits vs. risks of lupus medications such as hydroxychloroquine. Participants will complete questionnaires that assesses their understanding of the medication (hydroxychloroquine) before and after they complete the discussion regarding the medication using the tool with the healthcare team member.\n\nStudy team members will study the data collected to answer research questions. They will analyze the data and plan better steps improve care quality in lupus."
