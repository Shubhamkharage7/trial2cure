Preliminary efficacy assessment of DSP107 as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab in third line treatment of colorectal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will be the first time that DSP107 is administered to human subjects. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of DSP107 monotherapy and combination therapy in a two-part design.\n\nPart 1 will involve DSP107 monotherapy dose escalation in subjects with advanced solid tumors that are not amenable to surgical resection or other approved therapeutic options that have demonstrated clinical benefit. Additional dose finding cohorts will be enrolled to establish a safe dose of DSP107 when given in combination with atezolizumab.\n\nPart 2 will comprise two expansion cohorts:\n\nA) Expansion cohort A consisting of one treatment arm in which subjects will be treated with DSP107 in combination with atezolizumab. This expansion cohort will enroll subjects with non small cell lung cancer who have progressed following no more than 2 lines of prior systemic treatment including treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents.\n\nB) Expansion cohort B consisting of two treatment arms in which subjects will be treated either with DSP107 monotherapy or DSP107 in combination with atezolizumab. This expansion cohort will enroll subjects with colorectal cancer who have progressed following two previous lines of therapy."

These dose-finding combination arms will start at least one dose level below a DSP107 monotherapy dose that has already been deemed safe.\n\nPart 2 will comprise 2 expansion cohorts:\n\nExpansion cohort A will involve enrollment of patients in a single arm receiving DSP107 in combination with atezolizumab.\n\nExpansion cohort B will involve enrollment of patients randomized to receive either DSP107 monotherapy or DSP107 in combination with atezolizumab.",
