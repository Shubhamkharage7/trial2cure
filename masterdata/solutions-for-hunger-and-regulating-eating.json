            "detailedDescription": "The investigators have developed a new model for the treatment of obesity, called Regulation of Cues (ROC), which is based on Behavioral Susceptibility Theory. The ROC program targets two theorized mechanisms for overeating; decreased sensitivity to appetitive cues and increased sensitivity to external food cues. Considering that BWL has merit for some people, but fails to facilitate maintenance, this study will compare BWL, ROC with some aspects of BWL (ROC+) and an active comparator (AC). All treatment groups will be 1.5 hours (including weigh-ins) and will be provided in groups of 15-20 participants weekly for 4 months and twice a month for 2 months (total treatment duration = 6 months, 20 meetings). The investigators will recruit adults with overweight or obesity who are high in Food Responsiveness (FR) and will assess them at baseline, post-treatment (month 6), mid-follow-up (month 12) and follow-up (month 18)."

For example, a single line item asks frequency of intake and portion size of soda or soft drinks. Embedded underneath are questions regarding whether the soft drinks consumed are regular vs. diet or caffeinated vs. decaffeinated.
