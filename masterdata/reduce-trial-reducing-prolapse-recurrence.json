            "briefSummary": "This study will examine whether surgeons should add a prophylactic posterior colpoperineorrhaphy to a mesh-augmented apical prolapse repair.",
            "detailedDescription": "The decision to perform a posterior colpoperineorrhaphy at the time of sacrocolpopexy is controversial. Based on cohort data, some surgeons advocate that sacrocolpopexy alone is effective at treating posterior vaginal wall prolapse and the addition of posterior colpoperineorrhaphy only increases the likelihood of pain with defecation and dyspareunia. Experts theorize that placement of posterior vaginal mesh down to the perineal body provides adequate posterior support and reduces genital hiatus size. Others argue that placement of mesh too low on the posterior vagina may be associated with increased mesh exposure and pain secondary to mesh stiffness. No randomized trials exist comparing prolapse outcomes using new, ultra-light polypropylene mesh with and without posterior colpoperineorrhaphy. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference in prolapse outcomes after sacrocolpopexy using Restorelle mesh with and without posterior colpoperineorrhaphy. However, patients with a posterior colpoperineorrhaphy will be more likely to report pain with defecation and dyspareunia. This will be the first multicenter randomized trial comparing outcomes of sacrocolpopexy with and without posterior colpoperineorrhaphy."
