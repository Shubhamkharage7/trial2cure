            "briefSummary": "This phase 2 trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining immunotherapy with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (Pembrolizumab), an anti-VEGF receptor (Ramucirumab), and a taxane chemotherapy (Docetaxel) in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did not respond to FDA-approved treatments with platinum-based chemotherapy given concurrently or sequentially with anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.\n\nPembrolizumab helps the body's immune system to attack cancer cells and hinder their ability to grow and spread. Ramucirumab blocks new blood vessel growth to reduce tumor growth. Docetaxel works mainly by stopping cancer cells from dividing. Ramucirumab combined with docetaxel is an FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC patients after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy. It has shown to improve efficacy compared to docetaxel alone in this setting. Pembrolizumab is an FDA-approved treatment for NSCLC and can be given alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nInvestigators hypothesize that the combination of docetaxel, ramucirumab, and pembrolizumab will be safe and more effective than the current standard of care treatments (docetaxel alone or in combination with ramucirumab) in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC after progression on treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy, given concurrently or sequentially.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination treatment using the 6-month progression free survival rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of docetaxel and ramucirumab in combination with pembrolizumab in patients who progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor given sequentially or in combination.\n\nII. To determine immune related adverse events of the combination docetaxel, ramucirumab, and pembrolizumab.\n\nIII. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination docetaxel, ramucirumab, and pembrolizumab.\n\nIV. To assess the overall survival (OS) of the combination docetaxel, ramucirumab, and pembrolizumab.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To correlate treatment response with PD-L1 22C3 expression, STK11 and KRAS mutation status.\n\nII. To correlate treatment response with the doublet tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 22C3 expression.\n\nIII. To perform an immunophenotypic analysis of circulating immune cells by mass cytometry before and after treatment and end of treatment (EOT).\n\nIV. To analyze the tumor infiltrating immune cells by mass cytometry coupled to blood mass cytometry, in paired biopsies before and at end of after treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nAfter premedication, patients will receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes, ramucirumab IV over 60 minutes, then pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The combination will be administered until confirmed disease progression defined as progression on 2 consecutive scans at least 4 weeks apart, occurrence of severe side effects, withdrawal of consent by the patient or if in the opinion of the treating physician continuing on the study treatment is not in the best interest of the patient.\n\nThe first six patients will be evaluated for safety data. If less than 2 patients experience dose limiting toxicity, enrollment on study will continue with the efficacy assessment of the combination.\n\nParticipants who experience confirmed disease progression or start a new anticancer therapy, will move into the Survival Follow-Up Phase and should be contacted by telephone every 12 weeks (+/- 3 weeks) for 2 years, then every 6 months for next 3 years, then annually until the subject's death or until the subject is lost to follow-up up to 10 years to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the trial, whichever occurs first."

Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment\n\n  * Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis (patients with treated brain metastasis without symptoms and not requiring steroid are allowed to participate)\n* Has severe hypersensitivity (grade \u2265 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, arterial thromboembolism, cerebrovascular thromboembolism) within 6 months prior to start of study therapy; angina requiring therapy; symptomatic peripheral vascular disease; New York Heart Association class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure; or uncontrolled grade \u2265 3 hypertension (diastolic blood pressure \u2265 100 mmHg or systolic blood pressure \u2265 160 mmHg) despite antihypertensive therapy\n* Patients with any major hemorrhage or thromboembolic events within 3 months prior to start on this study\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis or established interstitial lung disease\n* Patients who had prior history of immune-related adverse event (irAE) that required treatment with steroids and permanent immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) discontinuation per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Note: no HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA is detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment",
