Participants with documented previously completed appropriate LTBI treatment and without evidence of re-exposure will not be required to be tested.\n* Any other significant condition that according to the investigator's judgment would prevent compliance with study protocol and full study participation.\n* Participants must not be participating in another investigational study or have participated in an investigational study within the past 30 days prior to randomization (Day 1).\n* History of or current inflammatory skin disease other than SLE that in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the inflammatory skin assessments and confound the disease activity assessments.\n* History of any non-SLE disease that had required treatment with oral or parenteral corticosteroids for more than a total of 2 weeks within the last 24 weeks prior to randomization",
