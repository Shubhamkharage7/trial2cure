The Dose Escalation part (Part A) of the study will enroll participants with R/R AML and R/R HR-MDS and will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-91633 (BMS-986397), administered orally, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or preliminary recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2D) and schedule. Throughout the study, final decisions on dose escalation/de-escalation will be made by the safety review committee (SRC). Approximately 60 participants may be enrolled in Part A of the study.\n\nThe expansion part (Part B) will confirm tolerability of the selected doses and schedules and evaluate whether efficacy is in a range that warrants further clinical development. Approximately 60 response-evaluable subjects per indication (R/R AML or R/R HR-MDS) may be enrolled.\n\nParts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up."
