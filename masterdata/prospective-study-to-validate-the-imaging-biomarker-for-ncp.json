            "detailedDescription": "Dry Eye Disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities.\n\nNeuropathic corneal pain (NCP), an ocular and severe type of neuropathic pain describes patients with symptoms of ocular discomfort out of proportion with clinical signs. The lack of clinical signs observed by standard ophthalmic examination has resulted in underdiagnosis of NCP or misdiagnosis as dry eye disease. Thus, having a biomarker for NCP is critical to identify and treat these patients. No biomarker or clinical signs exists to identify NCP patients.\n\nInvestigating corneal neurosensory abnormalities could help to diagnose NCP and potentially differentiate these patients from those with DED. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) allows for real-time optical biopsies at a quasi-histological level, allowing for assessment of corneal nerves. IVCM non-invasive diagnostic imaging across NCP, DED, and healthy individuals will be analyzed to validate corneal microneuromas as a biomarker for NCP."
