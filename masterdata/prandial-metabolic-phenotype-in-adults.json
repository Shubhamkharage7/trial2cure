            "briefSummary": "Previous studies suggest that changes in metabolism due to the effects of aging might serve as a potential for therapeutic agents. The investigating lab developed a pulse method combining multiple stable isotopes to study multiple metabolic pathways in the same individual simultaneously. By measuring whole-body metabolism in a large group of older adults, the investigators may be able to unravel age-related deterioration in protein turnover (synthesis and breakdown) that contributes to impaired functional capacity. Metabolic profiles could explain differences in pathways in the aging process with special interest in metabolism of amino acids as they have been associated with aging-related disorders.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study involves 1 screening visits of approximately 3 hours and 6 study days of approximately 8 hours.\n\nSubjects will be asked to arrive in the fasted state on all study days. Fasting prior to screening is not required. On the screening day, body weight, height, and body composition by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be measured. In addition, The Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and skeletal muscle function tests will be assessed at the end of each screening visit.\n\nEach study visit will begin with vital signs. Before administration of the feeding or the tracer solution, baseline blood will be collected for measurement of the natural enrichment of metabolites. After the baseline sample is collected, feeding will begin and will be followed by tracers of several compounds that may be administered by IV pulse.\n\nNext, the subjects will be fed one of six liquid nutritional supplement every 20 minutes for 6 hours. The liquid nutrition supplement will target the amino acid formulation in the following meals (1) total amino acid, (2) Essential Amino Acids (EAA), (3) EAA + -hydroxy -methylbutyric acid (HMB), (4) EAA + leucine (LEU), (5) EAA high, and (6) Placebo."
