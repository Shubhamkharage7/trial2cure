The Patient Registry was established in 2008 as a means to monitor important trends in the BPD population and to improve understanding, treatment, and survival.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Preterm Lung Patient Registry is an observational study designed to identify epidemiologic and genetic factors associated with chronic lung disease in former preterm infants or those with lung disease in the neonatal period. The Patient Registry is used by both clinicians and researchers to better understand BPD and to improve care of individuals with BPD. It is used to assess phenotype and genotype information from former preterm infants with lung disease. Data in the Patient Registry will be analyzed and an regular report of BPD health trends will be created. Using this information, BPD clinicians can address quality improvement initiatives, and examine changing health care issues, including nutritional status, infection control, pulmonary treatment, metabolic and associated genetic variants. The Patient Registry will also play an important role in directing clinical care and in the design of clinical research studies. Researchers use the registry to help in investigating various aspects of neonatal lung diseases like BPD, including medications, diagnostic procedures, and eligibility for clinical trials."
