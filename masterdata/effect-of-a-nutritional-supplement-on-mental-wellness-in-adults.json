            "briefSummary": "Trillions of microbes reside in human gut and constitute \"gut microbiota\". Composition of these microbes and substances produced by them play an important role in human health and wellness.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine if a unique orally consumed triglyceride supplement will impart mood benefits. Investigators hypothesize that a part of the fatty acids will be released in upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can be absorbed and reach different organs via systemic circulation (blood), including to the brain, and provide health benefits. Rest of the portion would reach the colon and may modulate gut microbiota and provide health benefits via the gut-brain axis (a bi-directional communication between emotional and cognitive centers and the gastrointestinal system). These health benefits could include alleviation of stress, occasional anxiousness and low mood.\n\nParticipants with self-reported low mood will be randomized to two groups - one group will receive triglyceride supplement in softgel form and another group will receive a placebo (softgel with no active substance). Investigators will evaluate the effect of consumption of triglyceride supplement compared to Placebo on occasional low mood, occasional anxiousness, stress, sleep and general health by measuring changes from baseline.",
