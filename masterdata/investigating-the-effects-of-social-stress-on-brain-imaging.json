The study will enroll 50 healthy subjects who will be randomized to either experience the TSST or watch a nature film prior to undergoing task-based neuroimaging measures of emotional processing and self-referential processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nThis study will be conducted primarily at Massachusetts Institute of Technology with research and clinical support from Massachusetts General Hospital."
