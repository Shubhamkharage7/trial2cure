Our goal is to increase the knowledge surrounding lifestyle modifications, specifically the fasting mimicking diet, on chemotherapy-related side effects, which may be more acceptable to patients than a previously studied water-only fasting diet. To expand this knowledge, The investigators will focus on patients undergoing chemotherapy for gynecologic malignancies. These patients will be assigned to no dietary restriction (control group) or a 5-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD by L-Nutra) for three days prior to, the day of, and one day following chemotherapy treatments (treatment group). The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of a fasting mimicking diet in addition to its metabolic effects on the body, patient reported side effects, patient quality of life, deviations or delays in treatment plans, and hospital admissions. Our hypothesis is that a fasting mimicking diet will significantly decrease chemotherapy-related side effects while providing good quality of life."
