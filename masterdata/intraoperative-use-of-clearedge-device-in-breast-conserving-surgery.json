The study will assess whether there is an improvement in the detection of DCIS or invasive cancer involved margins by measuring whether removal at the time of primary surgical treatment can reduce the need for repeat surgeries as compared to the SoC, which does not use the device.",
            "detailedDescription": "ClearEdge is a CE marked device already been used in several hospitals in the UK. It was used in a prospective single arm and 2 phases clinical study. It was demonstrated that surgeons successfully used the device to identify DCIS or invasive cancer involved margins and that it can reduce the need for repeat surgeries by meeting the margins depth criteria to require repeat operations. European Journal of Oncology Surgery. 2016; 42 (12): 1834-1840. In addition, the device was clinically evaluated by several hospitals."
