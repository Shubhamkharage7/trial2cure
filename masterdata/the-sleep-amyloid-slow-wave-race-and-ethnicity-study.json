            "briefSummary": "African-Americans (AAs) have an increased prevalence of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular risk factors for AD such as diabetes and hypertension when compared to whites. However, in a recent community based study of non-demented elderly, black race was associated with higher amyloid burden after adjusting for vascular risk factors, suggesting the presence of additional physiological differences on AD-risk by race in the early stages of the disease. The purpose of this study is to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS) quantity (SWS duration) and quality (slow wave activity, SWA) is one of these physiological factors. To test these hypotheses, the investigators will perform community outreach in churches and community-based organizations in Brooklyn and other NYC boroughs with which we have created substantial ties in recent years. In consultation with community stakeholders, the investigators will recruit 150 cognitively normal AA elderly (age 60-75) and 60 age, sex, BMI, income and education matched non-Hispanic whites from the same geographical areas. Investigators will first perform a medical and cognitive evaluation (Visit 1). Participants will then undergo 2 nights of home sleep monitoring using an unattended device to exclude OSA, followed by 7 days of actigraphy with a sleep log to record sleep duration. Both devices will be returned by mail. Subjects with reported total sleep time (TST) between 5 and 10 hours and absence of moderate to severe OSA will be invited to perform a 2-night nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) (Nights 1-2) and a PiB-PET MR scan (Visit 2)."
