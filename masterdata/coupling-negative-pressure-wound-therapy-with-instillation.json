            "briefSummary": "The objective of this study is to compare standard negative pressure wound therapy with negative pressure wound therapy coupled with instillation for optimal skin graft take. Either the V.A.C ULTA NPWT or V.A.C. VeraFlo Therapy systems with normal saline will be applied intra-operatively to split-thickness skin grafts of upper and lower extremity wounds and kept in place for a duration of four days. Following completion of four days, the skin graft with be assessed for percentage of take/adherence and will be covered with simple gauze dressings as needed.",
            "detailedDescription": "Past studies have investigated the use of NPWT for post-operative skin graft treatment and shown superior outcomes regarding graft take and need for repeat grafting when compared with standard gauze dressing. However, to date, no study has compared standard NPWT to NPWT coupled with instillation for post-operative treatment of extremity skin grafts. This study is designed as a randomized, controlled pilot study to compare treatment standard NPWT with NPWT coupled with instillation on skin graft take.\n\nPatients will be selected based on inclusion criteria and randomized to either the treatment (NPWT coupled with instillation) or the control group (standard NPWT). Depending on the group to which they are randomized to, patients will have standard NPWT or NPWT coupled with instillation applied intra-operatively after application of split thickness skin graft for treatment of extremity wound.\n\nPatients randomized to control group will receive V.A.C Ulta NPWT at 125mmHg continuous pressure for duration of four days.\n\nPatients randomized to treatment group will receive V.A.C VeraFlo therapy. Protocol will consist of the following:\n\n* Instillation solution: normal saline\n* Dwell/soak time: 30 seconds\n* Cycle Time: 4 hours\n* Pressure: 125mmHg\n\nThe devices will be kept in place for four days, at which point, the wound vacs will be removed and the percentage of skin graft take will be evaluated with use of photometric analysis. The skin grafts will be subsequently dressed with gauze as appropriate. Patients will be followed up in clinic to assess outcome of skin graft take."
