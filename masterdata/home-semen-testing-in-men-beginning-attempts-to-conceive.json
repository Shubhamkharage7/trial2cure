            "briefSummary": "The overall objective of the proposed study is to enhance early detection of male factor infertility and reduce cost and morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis through development of a universal screening model based on home semen testing. The advent of inexpensive and accurate home semen testing has enabled a potential paradigm shift in the approach to male fertility evaluation. The investigator's central hypothesis is that universal home semen testing prior to attempts to conceive is easy for participants and can lead to reduced fertility-related anxiety and early detection of male factor infertility, thereby expediting evaluation and treatment for the couple while minimizing unnecessary cost and morbidity.\n\nThis study is specifically designed to assess the feasibility and utility of home semen testing for couples who are beginning attempts to conceive. First, the investigator will assess participants' ability to complete the home semen testing, ease of use, and obstacles encountered in doing so. Second, the investigator will examine the impact of home semen testing in fertility-related quality of life among couples beginning attempts to conceive, as well as ability of home semen testing to increase the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility in these couples."
