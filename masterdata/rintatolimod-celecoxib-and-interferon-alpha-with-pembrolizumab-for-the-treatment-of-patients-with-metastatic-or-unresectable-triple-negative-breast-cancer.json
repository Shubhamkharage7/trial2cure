            "briefSummary": "This phase I/IIa trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of chemokine modulation therapy (CKM) (rintatolimod, celecoxib, and interferon alpha 2b) in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). CKM drugs such as rintatolimod and interferon alpha 2b work to modify the immune response and tumor-related processes, including tumor cell growth, blood vessel growth, and metastasis. Celecoxib is an anti-inflammatory drug that can cause cell death and may reduce the growth of blood vessels tumors need to grow and spread. Immunotherapy such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving CKM therapy prior to pembrolizumab may direct the immune cells to the cancer cells and maximize the effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable triple negative breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile of modified CKM (celecoxib, rintatolimod and interferon alpha-2b) regimen (replacement of INTRON \\[registered trademark\\] A, using alternative source of interferon alpha-2b \\[IFNalpha2b\\]) combined with pembrolizumab therapy in metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of the CKM in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) as compared to historic outcomes of pembrolizumab and other anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapies alone, as determined by secondary measures of efficacy including:\n\nIa. Progression-free survival (PFS); Ib. Overall survival (OS); Ic. Overall response rate (ORR) to the combination therapy using Immune Modulated Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST); Id. Disease control rate (DCR) using iRECIST.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Examine the immune analysis profile of CKM and pembrolizumab combination:\n\nIa. Examine the relationship of infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and other immune and genetic markers, and their associated PD-1, CD45RA or CD45RO levels; Ib. Correlate PD-L1 expression within both neoplastic and nonneoplastic stromal elements of the tumor microenvironment to PFS, OS, ORR and adverse events (AEs); Ic. Correlate immune panel results with ORR, PFS, OS and AEs.\n\nII. Comparison of response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis:\n\nIIa. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 response assessment; IIb. iRECIST response assessment.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of interferon alpha-2b followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patients receive rintatolimod intravenously (IV), celecoxib orally (PO), interferon alpha-2b IV on days 0, 1, and 2 of week 1 and days 7, 8, and 9 of week 2 on study. Patients receive pembrolizumab IV on day 9 and then every 3 weeks after that for up to 4 doses on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening and follow-up and undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nCOHORT II: Patients receive rintatolimod IV, celecoxib PO, and interferon alpha-2b IV on days 0, 1, and 2 of week 1 and days 7, 8, and 9 of week 2 on study. Patients receive pembrolizumab IV on day 2 of week 1 and then every 3 weeks beginning in week 4 on study. Patients also undergo CT scan or MRI at screening and follow-up, undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study, and may undergo tumor biopsy at screening and follow-up."
