            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe lymphatic system is a network of vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph through the body. Problems in the lymphatic system can cause pain, fluid buildup, and issues with immunity. There is much researchers do not understand about lymphatic anomalies. In this natural history study, they will collect data from a lot of people over a long time.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo better understand why lymphatic anomalies develop. The goal is to improve future treatments.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 0 days and older with a suspected or confirmed lymphatic anomaly. Their unaffected parents or siblings aged 7 years or older are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants may remain in the study indefinitely. Affected participants may be evaluated every 10 months to 2 years. Some participants will be seen over telemedicine. Others will be seen at the NIH Clinical Center for 2-5 days.\n\nAll participants will have a physical exam. They may provide specimens including blood, saliva, hair follicles, stool, skin, and other tissues. Samples may be used for genetic testing.\n\nParticipants may undergo other tests depending on their medical conditions. The NIH Clinical Center visit may include:\n\nHeart tests include placing stickers on the chest to measure electrical activity and using sound waves to capture pictures of the heart.\n\nA lung test measures the muscle strength in the chest. Participants will blow into a tube.\n\nPhotographs may be taken of participants faces and other features.\n\nImaging scans will take pictures of the inside of the body. One scan will measure bone density.\n\nOne type of scan tracks how lymph fluid moves through the body. Participants will be under anesthesia, and they will be injected with a dye.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nA natural history study for lymphatic anomalies to systematically evaluate the disease phenotypes and long-term outcomes to provide improved prognostication to families, establish screening/monitoring guidelines, determine best practices for genetic diagnosis, explore family opinions, and explore fertility for those on long term medication management. This study will allow us to identify novel end points for future clinical trials.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary objectives:\n\n* To establish a longitudinal cohort of participants with lymphatic anomalies\n* To longitudinally determine the age at presentation and incidence of clinical features\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* To establish a longitudinal biospecimen repository\n* To determine the best practices for genetic diagnosis based on phenotype\n* To determine the malignant potential of anomalies longitudinally\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoints:\n\n* The number of participants with lymphatic anomalies\n* For each clinical feature or symptoms, the range of ages at the development of that feature/symptom and fraction of participants with that feature\n* Quantification and identification of novel features associated with disease\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* The number of specimens collected\n* Diagnostic yields by phenotype and genetic test methodology\n* Number of malignancies related to the primary lesion that have developed"
