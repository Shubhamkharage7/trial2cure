Currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n10. The patient must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to Grade \u22641 or baseline.\n11. The patient has an active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past.\n12. Presence of an uncontrolled endocrine disorder.\n13.
