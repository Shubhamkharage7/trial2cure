            "briefSummary": "Patients admitted to the hospital often develop functional impairments due to being in bed most of the day. Each day of bedrest leads to significant muscle loss. As a result, many patients become dependent on others or require rehabilitation at a facility to improve mobility and function prior to returning home. Staff in the hospital is limited and often unable to mobilize patients every day while hospitalized. The investigators are testing a new experimental gamified physical therapy exercise software to see if it can be a fun, enjoyable way to help mobilize patients without the assistance of staff. The primary aim of this pilot/proof of concept study is to determine whether gamified physical therapy software can help inpatients exercise within the safety of their own beds and preserve pre-hospitalization function."
