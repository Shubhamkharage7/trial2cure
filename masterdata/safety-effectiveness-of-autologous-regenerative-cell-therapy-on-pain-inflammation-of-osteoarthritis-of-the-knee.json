They will be treated with autologous Stromed obtained by the Adipose Ultrasonic Cell Recovery Unit (AUCRU) and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) processed by RegenLab (RegenKit BCT-3) PRP product each as direct injections to the affected joints.\n\nCohort 1 will include PRP treatments at time of initial StroMed treatment plus at 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 month.\n\nCohort 2 will include PRP treatments at time of initial StroMed treatment plus at 1 month and 2 months.\n\nPatient outcomes will be tracked with a follow up MRI at various endpoints to 6 months, laboratory tests for inflammation markers, and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) questionnaires. SF-36 forms (a quality of life measure) and numerical rating scales (NRS) will also be used to assess safety and efficacy of treatment, as well as any reduction in patient medication and/or delay in pending knee replacement therapy."
