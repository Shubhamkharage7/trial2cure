The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* How well does daratumumab and nivolumab, when given with a vaccine, control or stop these types of cancer?\n* How well does participants bodies handle these study drugs?\n* Does this combination of study drugs help participants live longer? Participants will receive daratumumab, nivolumab with KRAS vaccine and have regular tests and procedures to follow how the participants are doing on these study drugs."
