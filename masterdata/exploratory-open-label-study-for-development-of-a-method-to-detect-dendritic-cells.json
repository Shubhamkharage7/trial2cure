In the first part of the study, ICG will be delivered by intravenous infusion to healthy subjects to verify that peripheral immune phagocytic cells, of which DCs are a subset, can be labeled with ICG. If ICG labeling of phagocytic cells is confirmed, then in the second part of the study the presence of ICG in brain of AD patients, putatively carried in by ICG-labeled cells, will be investigated by NIRS using the INVOS 7000 cerebral oximeter."
