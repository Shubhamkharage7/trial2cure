It is not surprising that this vulnerable caregiver population reports high levels of distress along with numerous caregiving-related concerns, which may compromise their ability to provide quality care. This project will examine the feasibility and initial evidence for efficacy of a caregiving skills intervention aiming to improve caregiver and patient psychological health; caregiving efficacy and role adjustment; and reduce patient cancer-related symptoms and healthcare utilization.",

First and foremost, it is unlikely that a person under the age 18 is diagnosed with an HGG.\n* Childhood brain tumors tend to be diagnosed in infancy and the caregiving and symptom management needs are vastly different than in the adult patient population. Additionally, the assessment tools are not validated for minors.\n* While pregnant caregivers (self-reported) are study eligible, we will also exclude pregnant patients (medical notes).
