The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the treatment outcomes between patients with Achilles tendinopathy who participate in a home-based program versus patients with Achilles tendinopathy who undergo formal physical therapy. Participants will be randomized to a 12-week home-based or formal physical therapy protocol and asked to complete brief outcomes surveys at their initial visit, and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after their initial visit."
