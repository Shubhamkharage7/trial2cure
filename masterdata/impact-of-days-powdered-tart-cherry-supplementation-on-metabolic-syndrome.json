            "briefSummary": "Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is a growing health concern, with up to 25% of the worlds population having the syndrome. MetSyn is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes development, and is independently associated with all-cause mortality, making it an important disease target. The primary treatment for MetSyn is exercise and weight loss, along with medically necessary treatment. Exercise, along with dietary changes such as increased fiber and polyphenol intake can positively impact many of the metabolic abnormalities seen with MetSyn. For example, polyphenols have been shown to decrease lipid concentration and improved glucose clearance as well as decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. Powdered tart cherry capsules, which contain the skin of the fruit, provides polysaccharides (fiber) that would likely act as a substrate for gut bacteria degradation, providing energy substrates and barrier integrity to the colonocytes and increasing the bioavailability of the polyphenols to other cells in the body. However there have been no long-term investigations into the use of powdered tart cherry supplements in MetSyn, therefore we aim to determine if 60 days tart cherry supplementation modify criteria for MetSyn in currently diagnosed individuals including body mass, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood glucose control."
