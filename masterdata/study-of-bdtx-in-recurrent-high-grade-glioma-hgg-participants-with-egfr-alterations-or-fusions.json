BDTX-1535 was designed to block a growth signal important to some cancers. BDTX-1535 is being tested in this study to see if it can be given safely to people who have tumors that can be dependent on that growth signal because of changes in a protein called EGFR. These gene changes are called amplifications, mutations, fusions or alterations and are found only in the tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eligible participants will enroll in the Phase 0 study and receive BDTX-1535 prior to a planned resection. During surgery, blood, tumor, and CSF samples will be collected to measure the amount of drug that is present in the samples. Participants with tumors demonstrating PK response will continue with once-daily BDTX-1535 treatment, continuously in 28-day cycles after surgery. Participants will continue to receive BDTX-1535 until the progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination by the sponsor."
