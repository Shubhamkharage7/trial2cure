People for whom previous treatment was not successful can take part in this study.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 765179 that people with solid tumors can tolerate when taken alone or together with a medicine called ezabenlimab.\n\nEach participant is put into one of two groups. Participants get BI 765179 alone or in combination with ezabenlimab as infusion into a vein every 3 weeks.\n\nBI 765179 and ezabenlimab are antibodies that may help the immune system fight cancer. In this study, BI 765179 is given to people for the first time.\n\nParticipants can stay in the study up to 3 years if they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it.\n\nThe doctors regularly check the participants' health and note any health problems that could have been caused by the study treatment."
