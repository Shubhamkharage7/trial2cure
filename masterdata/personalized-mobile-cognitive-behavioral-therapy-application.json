            "briefSummary": "This study aims to compare the effectiveness of a standard mobile iPhone cognitive behavioral therapy program to a personalized mobile iPhone cognitive behavioral therapy program that introduces new skills over a shorter period of time. Participants will use the Maya app for two days per week, at least 20 minutes per day, for six weeks. Assessments will include a weekly check in with a member of the research team, questionnaires, and optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings at the beginning and end of the 6-week intervention. The investigators think that that the less burdensome personalized program will be just as effective at improving symptoms of anxiety and depression as the general program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Growing evidence suggests a need for anxiety and mood interventions that can be disseminated easily to adolescents and young adults. The goal of this study is to optimize a mobile application that teaches well-established, research-supported psychotherapeutic techniques to adolescents and young adults who are experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or bipolar disorder. The study aims to compare the efficacy of a personalized mobile cognitive behavioral therapy program to a more general mobile cognitive behavioral therapy program.\n\nStudy participants will randomly receive one of two versions of Maya, a mobile cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) app for adolescents and young adults: either a standard version that includes a variety of skills typically used in CBT, or a personalized version with skills matched to the participant's symptom profile. In contrast to the general condition, which may introduce new material over all six weeks of the intervention, all new material in the personalized condition will be introduced within the first four weeks. The remaining two weeks in the personalized condition will consist of practicing previously learned skills. Participants will use the Maya app for two days per week, at least 20 minutes per day for six weeks and will complete assessments at baseline, week 4, week 6 (end of intervention), and a follow-up assessment at week 12. Participants may also choose to complete an optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) recording at the baseline and end of intervention (week 6)."
