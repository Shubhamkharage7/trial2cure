            "briefSummary": "Animal and observational research in humans suggest that specific types of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) may impair glycemic control. However, whether NNS consumption impacts glucose homeostasis in middle-aged/older adults with prediabetes is unknown, and potential mechanisms by which this could occur have yet to be identified. The overall objective of this R21 proposal is to establish proof-of-concept for alterations in glucose homeostasis following intake of saccharin, but not acesulfame potassium, in middle-aged/older adults with prediabetes compared to a eucaloric diet with no NNS.",
            "detailedDescription": "Observational research has linked intake of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), which are consumed daily by \\~50% of middle-aged/older U.S. adults, with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This risk may be exacerbated by advancing age, which is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and increased risk of T2D. Current T2D prevention recommendations related to NNS usage are unclear and confusing; use as an alternative to added sugar intake is suggested but long-term NNS use is discouraged despite minimal research to support this recommendation. Animal and observational human studies suggest detrimental effects of some NNS on glucose homeostasis. Longer-term human studies largely demonstrate null findings. Differences in study design and a lack of rigor in existing research contribute to inconclusive findings. In addition, NNS are often studied as a single entity yet types of NNS vary in their absorption and metabolism (e.g., two commonly consumed NNS, saccharin and acesulfame potassium). Whether NNS consumption impacts glucose homeostasis in middle-aged/older adults with prediabetes is unknown, and potential mechanisms by which this could occur have yet to be identified. The overall objective of this R21 proposal is to establish proof-of-concept for alterations in glucose homeostasis following intake of saccharin, but not acesulfame potassium, in middle-aged/older adults with prediabetes compared to a eucaloric diet with no NNS. We will investigate changes in inflammatory markers as potential mechanisms by which saccharin intake influences glucose homeostasis. Following a 2-week eucaloric lead-in diet, 51 middle-aged/older adults (40+ yrs) with prediabetes will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 controlled feeding conditions for 6 weeks (17 participants per group): saccharin, acesulfame potassium, or a control group (no NNS). Standardized diets will be matched for macronutrients (50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein) and other variables to avoid the potential confounds of weight change and dietary factors which may influence study outcomes (e.g., added sugars). All groups will receive identical diets, other than the additional NNS for the two NNS groups. 24-hr glycemic control using continuous glucose monitoring and insulin sensitivity and beta cell function via oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), serum endotoxin, and inflammatory cytokines, including C-reactive protein, will be measured before and following the 6-week dietary treatment period. This research may have clinical practice and policy implications by informing U.S. dietary guidelines and guidelines for T2D prevention, which devote minimal attention to NNS and provide unclear guidance on NNS use due largely to a lack of rigorously-designed controlled feeding trials."
