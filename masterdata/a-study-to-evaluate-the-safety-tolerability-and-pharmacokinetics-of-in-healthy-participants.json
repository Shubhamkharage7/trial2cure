Systolic blood pressure \\> 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure \\> 90 mm Hg at Screening, and determined by the Investigator to confer a safety risk to the subject. Blood pressure measurements may be repeated after at least 10 minutes of rest if initial values obtained at Screening or Check-in are exclusionary.\n5. Subjects with active pathogen infections or carrier including but not limited to testing positive at Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.\n6.

Received an experimental drug or used experimental medical device within 3 months or within 10 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study drug.\n13.
