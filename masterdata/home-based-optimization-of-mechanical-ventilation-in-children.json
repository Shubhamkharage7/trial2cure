            "briefSummary": "Some children who are born very early or have other congenital conditions may develop severe, long-term lung problems that make them need to use a breathing machine to live at home. There are no studies that identify the best ways to monitor a home breathing machine or adjust its settings. Increasingly, healthcare systems are using information collected at home to make more informed decisions about a patient's healthcare treatment, which is called \"remote patient monitoring\". This study will ask whether using remote patient monitoring can provide more complete information to a child's team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists to help a child's healthcare team and family make more informed decisions about a child's home ventilator care. The investigators are hypothesizing it can safely decrease the level of breathing support children need while also avoiding emergency and hospital care and supporting their growth, development, and participation in daily life.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, non-randomized, open-label trial using remote patient monitoring for chronic management of invasive home mechanical ventilation in children. The investigators hypothesize that integration of longitudinal physiologic data and patient reported outcome measures into routine clinical care over 4 months can optimize home mechanical ventilation use by 1) reducing the level home mechanical ventilation level of support, 2) improving patient and family quality of life, specifically participation in daily activities and patient's lung symptoms, and 3) improving family-reported shared decision-making and child's access to ventilator care. The investigators will also evaluate its usability within family life and provider workflows and assess early implementation outcomes."
