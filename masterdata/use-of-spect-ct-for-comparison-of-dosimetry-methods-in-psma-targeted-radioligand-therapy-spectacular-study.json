The purpose of this investigation is to assess the limits of agreement of commonly employed dosimetry methods used to determine or approximate absorbed doses for organs and tumors compared to a dosimetry method using a triexponential fit requiring 6 post-injection SPECT-CT scans for all treatment cycles."
