The investigators hypothesize that probiotic-induced alterations in the intestinal microbiota may favorably alter the post-onset disease state.",
            "detailedDescription": "For individuals newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, this clinical trial will assess whether probiotic supplementation has efficacy in reducing the endogenous systemic innate inflammatory state known to exist in newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes and whether this reduction correlates with preservation of endogenous insulin production as measured by stimulated C-peptide during mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT). The innate inflammatory state will be measured by plasma-induced transcriptional assay and quantified as a composite inflammatory index. Mixed meal tolerance testing is the gold standard measure of endogenous insulin production. During this test, serial blood c-peptide levels are collected over 2 hours in response to challenge with a nutritional drink containing a mix of protein, fat, and carbohydrate and the C-peptide area under the curve is calculated.\n\nUsing a randomized, placebo-controlled design, the investigators will measure changes in systemic inflammation (primary outcome) and beta cell function (secondary outcome) after six months of daily treatment with either Lp299v supplementation or placebo. These measures of plasma-induced transcriptional assay and MMTT will be related to markers of beta cell stress, the composition of the gut microbiota, analysis of the plasma metabolome, and levels of microbial antigen exposure."
