The researchers will use information collected during this study to create a questionnaire and an educational video related to the patient perioperative experience. The educational video will address patient concerns about the perioperative period and recovery after surgery (post-operative recovery).\n\nAll participants in this study will be undergoing a MIS hysterectomy according to their routine care in the Gynecology"
