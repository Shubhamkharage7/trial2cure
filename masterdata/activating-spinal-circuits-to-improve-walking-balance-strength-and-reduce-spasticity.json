            "briefSummary": "For many people with spinal cord injury (SCI), the goal of walking is a high priority. There are many approaches available to restore walking function after SCI; however, these approaches often involve extensive rehabilitation training and access to facilities, qualified staff, and advanced technology that make practicing walking at home difficult. For this reason, developing training approaches that could be easily performed in the home would be of great value. In addition, non-invasive spinal stimulation has the potential to increase the effectiveness of communication between the brain and spinal cord. Combining motor skill training (MST) with transcutaneous spinal stimulation (TSS) may further enhance the restoration of function in persons with SCI. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if moderate-intensity, MST can improve walking-related outcomes among persons with SCI and to determine if the addition of non-invasive TSS will result in greater improvements in function compared to training alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "Individuals with SCI will be asked to participate in this study over a four-week period. During the first 2 weeks (wash-in phase), individuals will participate in 6 aerobic and exercise training sessions as part of either an existing outpatient clinical program or by completing a personalized exercise plan. During the intervention phase (last 2 weeks), participants will be randomized to complete 6 training sessions of: 1) motor skill training combined with TSS (MST+TSS group) or 2) motor skill training combined with shamTSS (MST+shamTSS). All participants will complete 3 testing sessions: baseline testing 1 (prior the wash-in phase), testing 2 (after the completion of the wash-in phase and prior the intervention phase), and testing 3 (after the completion of the intervention phase) to assess their walking ability, balance, strength, and spasticity. During the intervention phase and to monitor within-session changes, participants will also complete a short version of walking function and balance assessments prior to and after each training session."

Participants will perform each exercise for one minute each, until 4 cycles of the circuit have been completed (approximately 45 minutes total). Motor training activities will be performed at an intensity of 40-59% of heart rate reserve (HRR). During MST, participants will wear a chest-worn heart rate monitor to ensure that the optimal HRR range is achieved.
