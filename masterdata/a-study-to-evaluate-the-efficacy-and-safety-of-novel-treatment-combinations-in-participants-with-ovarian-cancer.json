If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (for example \\[e.g.\\], an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.\n     * Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after study treatment as per protocol.\n* Participant must provide sufficient tumor tissue samples based on requirements defined in each cohort-specific supplement.\n\nInclusion criteria specific to Cohort A:\n\n* Participants must be resistant to the most recent platinum-based therapy, defined for the purpose of this protocol as progression within 6 months from completion of a minimum of 4 cycles of platinum-containing therapy. This should be calculated from the date of the last administered dose of platinum therapy to the date of the radiographic imaging showing disease progression. Participants with primary platinum-refractory disease as defined by those who progressed during or within 4 weeks of completion of first platinum-based chemotherapy are not eligible.\n* Participant must not have received any prior therapy for ovarian cancer with a PARP inhibitor\n* Participant has had 1 to 2 prior lines of anticancer therapy for ovarian cancer\n* Participant is able to take oral medications.\n\nInclusion criteria specific to Cohort C:\n\n* Participant has newly diagnosed Stage III or IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria.\n* Participant must provide sufficient tumor tissue at Prescreening and agree to undergo a central HRD tumor testing using a fully validated assay.

All participants must agree to provide tumor tissue collected from IDS.\n  3. Participant must provide 2 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (or slides if blocks are not available) with sufficient tumor content (as confirmed by the sponsor's designated central and/or testing laboratory) for central HRD testing at Prescreening and for exploratory biomarker testing at Prescreening or Screening. If sufficient tumor tissue is provided at Prescreening, participants do not need to provide additional tissue at Screening.\n* Participant must have completed 1 run-in cycle of carboplatin-paclitaxel and not experienced disease progression after this treatment. Completion is defined as receiving \\>=50% of the prescribed dose of therapy within 5 weeks.\n* Participant must not have known contraindication or uncontrolled hypersensitivity to carboplatin and paclitaxel and their excipients and no known pre-existing conditions that would preclude treatment with these agents.\n* Participant must not have known contraindication or uncontrolled hypersensitivity to niraparib and its excipients.\n* Participant must not have symptomatic ascites or pleural effusions as defined by the following criterion: presence of fluid in the abdominal or pleural cavities requiring removal within 1 week prior to signing the informed consent.\n* Participant must agree to complete patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and work productivity questionnaires throughout the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has not recovered (i.e., to Grade \\<=1 or to Baseline) from prior chemotherapy-induced adverse events (AEs).\n* Participant has a known diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy exceeding an equivalent of prednisone 10 mg daily or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Participant is currently participating in a treatment study or has participated in a study of an investigational agent within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n* Participant has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including cytotoxic chemotherapy, PARP inhibitor, immune checkpoint inhibitors, hormonal therapy given with the intention to treat cancer, or biological therapy within 3 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.
