            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the CHANGE-BP study is to examine the change in in-office measured Blood Pressure (BP) from baseline to end of study (6-months) between participants randomized to either 1) Continual Blood Pressure Monitoring (CBPM), which includes receiving Aktiia's novel cuffless BP Research System that has an accompanying Aktiia Patient Interface smartphone application, and care delivered through a centralized Aktiia Provider Interface that displays device data and is accessible by a health care professional or 2) Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM), which includes a standard oscillometric blood pressure cuff and the standard blood pressure management care from a participant's primary care physician.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, unblinded, open-label, randomized clinical trial that will study the use of the investigational Aktiia Bracelet and an accompanying Provider Interface in hypertension management. The Aktiia Bracelet is a non-invasive blood pressure monitor intended to track systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nParticipants will attend a baseline visit, which will include a survey and blood pressure and anthropometric measurements. Participants will then be randomized to either the CBPM group, which includes the Aktiia Bracelet and care through a centralized Aktiia Provider Interface, or the HBPM group, which includes a standard blood pressure cuff and standard hypertension care. Individuals in the CBPM group will wear the Aktiia Bracelet for 6 months. During this time, a study-affiliated clinical pharmacist will monitor the individual's blood pressure through the Provider Interface and will potentially titrate the participant's blood pressure medications accordingly. After 6-months, all participants will return for an end of study visit that will include a survey and blood pressure and anthropometric measurements. Participants in the CBPM group will complete an additional survey to give their opinion on the Aktiia product."
