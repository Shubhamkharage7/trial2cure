            "briefSummary": "The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of combining pembrolizumab with a single fraction radiation boost in patients with early/ operable breast cancer. The secondary objectives are to assess clinical response on pre- and post-treatment clinical, imaging, and histology exams, and to assess immune response on pre and post treatment blood and tissue samples by tracking change in Ki67 + CD8 T cells in peripheral blood and in extent of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. A clinically significant partial response is defined as \\>30% tumor shrinkage post-clinical trial intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study has four arms. Arms 1 and 2 differ by the order of radiation boost and pembrolizumab administration. A minimum of 6 patients will be enrolled in the safety run-in portion of the study. The Phase 2 portion of the study will include Arm 3 (pembrolizumab only arm). An estimated 27 participants will be enrolled or until futility of Arm 3 is reached. Continuation of enrollment in Arms 1 or 2 will be contingent to funding availability. Arm 4 represents our control arm in which patients will follow usual care but will be consented for blood/tissue collection using a separate protocol (Penn IRB 801539)."
