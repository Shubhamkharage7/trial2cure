            "briefSummary": "The investigators will design, construct, and pilot a prototype of a trauma-informed online intervention, which will be called \"SunnysideFlex,\" that functionally integrates a web-based intervention targeting skills to decrease symptoms of PTSD and better manage mood during and after pregnancy. SunnysideFlex will build upon the previously IRB-approved \"Sunnyside\" intervention which targeted skills to manage mood through an interactive website with didactic material and tools. Women in weeks 16-28 of their pregnancy who self-report symptoms of PTSD will be randomized to one of three study groups: (1) SunnysideFlex, (2) the original Sunnyside intervention (active control), or (3) treatment as usual (TAU). The SunnysideFlex intervention will consist of 6 weeks of trauma-informed online lessons during pregnancy and booster sessions at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks postpartum. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, 6 weeks postpartum, and 12 weeks postpartum. SunnysideFlex has the potential to provide a novel paradigm for improving maternal and child health outcomes in high-risk, trauma-exposed women."
