A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.\n\nParticipants will have cancer that cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).\n\nThis study will have three parts. Parts A and B of the study will find out how much SGN-EGFRd2 should be given to participants. Part C will use the dose found in parts A and B to find out how safe SGN-EGFRd2 is and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers."
