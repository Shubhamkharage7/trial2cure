            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well single-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) works when compared to standard radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess patient-reported pain response and quality of life (QoL) in patients randomized to either single-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or non-SBRT palliative radiation therapy for metastatic disease.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Compare overall survival for patients undergoing single fraction SBRT versus non-SBRT palliative radiation therapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess for changes in immune markers. II. Assess toxicity related to radiation treatment. III. Assess change in frailty index and cognitive function over time in patients undergoing treatment for metastatic cancer.\n\nIV. Evaluate the effect of circadian rhythm and radiation treatment time on outcomes.\n\nV. Assess the utility of the Pain Catastrophizing Index in patients undergoing radiation treatment for metastatic cancer.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo 1, 3-5, 5-6, or 10 fractions of palliative radiation therapy (RT) deemed appropriate by the treating physician.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo single fraction SBRT.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at 5 and 12 weeks."
