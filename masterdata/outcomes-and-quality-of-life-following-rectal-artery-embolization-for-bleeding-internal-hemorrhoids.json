Patients referred from the Colorectal Surgery Clinic who are scheduled to undergo rectal artery embolization (RAE) as part of standard clinical care will be enrolled. Baseline anoscopy and clinical evaluation will be performed per standard clinical care in the Colorectal Surgery Clinic and baseline patient reported outcomes and quality of life questionnaires administered. A research pelvis CTA will be performed on a clinical CT scanner per standard clinical imaging protocol for assessment of the rectal arteries prior to embolization. Following rectal artery embolization, subjects will undergo a day 1 post-procedure clinical evaluation in Interventional Radiology followed by repeat anoscopy and clinical evaluation per standard clinical care in the Colorectal Surgery Clinic as well as repeat patient reported outcomes and quality of life questionnaires at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post rectal artery embolization with a clinical research study coordinator in Vascular and Interventional Radiology, either in person or virtually (video or phone).\n\nThe aims of the study are:\n\nAim 1. To determine the 12-month efficacy of rectal artery embolization with particles + coils for treatment of symptomatic bleeding predominant hemorrhoidal disease\n\nAim 2. To determine the 12-month safety of rectal artery embolization with particles + coils for treatment of symptomatic bleeding predominant hemorrhoidal disease.\n\nAim 3. To determine the feasibility of pre-embolization CTA in identifying the hemorrhoidal arteries supplying the hemorrhoidal cushion"
