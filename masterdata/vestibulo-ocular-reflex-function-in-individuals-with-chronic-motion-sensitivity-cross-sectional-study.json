Hence, the purpose of this study is to;\n\n1. Determine whether the function of an inner ear reflex is different between young adults with/without chronic motion sensitivity\n2. Assess relationships between reflex function and balance in young adults with/without CMS\n3. Assess relationships between physical activity and balance in young adults with/without CMS.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic motion sensitivity (CMS), also known as motion sickness, refers to a sensation of unwellness caused by physical or discerned motion. CMS has a prevalence of 28% in the general population and it is more common in women (27.3%) compared to men.\n\nBased on established evidence that individuals with chronic motion sensitivity demonstrate impaired postural stability with vestibular system impairment adjudged to be an inciting stimulus for chronic motion sensitivity, and individuals who practiced more physical and sporting activities have less motion sickness susceptibility than individuals who did not, the investigators theorize that individuals with chronic motion sensitivity will have an impaired inner ear reflex, causing them to be more reliant on other sensory systems like their muscles and joints, and their vision, we also theorize that individuals who are physically active will be less susceptible to chronic motion sensitivity.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to;\n\n1. Determine whether the function of an inner ear reflex is different between young adults with/without chronic motion sensitivity\n2. Assess relationships between reflex function and balance in young adults with/without CMS\n3. Assess relationships between physical activity and balance in young adults with/without CMS.\n\nParticipants between the age of 20 and 40 with and without a self-reported history of chronic motion sensitivity (i.e, experiencing nauseousness and/or dizziness during while using various means of transportation such as, car, train, bus, boat, and airplane and/or, recreational fun-fair rides and/or when exposed to conflicting visual images). Participants will be excluded if they report a medical diagnosis of central nervous system disorder, impaired cervical spine range of motion, migraines, seizure disorder, vestibular dysfunction, or any musculoskeletal dysfunction that can limit their participation in the study."
