            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSome people have a mutation in the CDH1 gene that is known to lead to stomach cancer. They are advised to get regular endoscopies with biopsies even if their stomach appears normal. The endoscopy method currently used is called the 'Cambridge Method.' Researchers want to test a new method called the 'Bethesda Protocol.'\n\nObjective:\n\nTo compare the Cambridge Method and Bethesda Protocol and find out which is more efficient in catching early signs of cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 and older who have a mutation in the CDH1 gene.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a review of their medical history, medical records, and physical status.\n\nParticipants will be put into group 1 (Bethesda Protocol) or group 2 (Cambridge Method).\n\nParticipants will have a physical exam. They will have endoscopy. For this, they will be put under general anesthesia. They will wear compression cuffs around their legs to prevent blood clots. A lighted tube will be inserted into their mouth and go down to their stomach.\n\nFor group 1 participants, 88 pieces of tissue will be taken from 22 areas of their stomach.\n\nFor group 2 participants, 30 pieces of tissue will be taken from 6 areas of their stomach. Then group 2 will be injected with a contrast dye. A microscope will be inserted, and more samples will be taken.\n\nAbout 14 days later, participants will have a follow-up visit or phone call. They may give stool samples every 3 to 6 months for 12 months for research purposes.\n\nParticipants may have another endoscopy 6-18 months later.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nHereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is most often attributed to inactivating germline mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) tumor suppressor gene. Mutation carriers have a 24-70% lifetime risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\nInternational consensus guidelines recommend endoscopic screening and surveillance of CDH1 mutation carriers who decline risk-reducing total gastrectomy (TG). However, this approach lacks sufficient sensitivity for detection of occult, intramucosal foci of signet ring cancer cells (SRCC), which are pathognomonic of HDGC. Our team has established a systematic endoscopic screening protocol (Bethesda protocol) that demonstrates a higher rate of SRCC detection compared to historic controls using the currently recommended Cambridge method.\n\nObjective:\n\nDetermine if Bethesda protocol provides improved sensitivity for detection of early-stage gastric cancer in CDH1 germline mutation carriers compared to the Cambridge method.\n\nEligibility:\n\nSubjects with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDH1 germline mutation.\n\nAge \\>=18 years.\n\nPhysiologically able to undergo upper endoscopy\n\nDesign:\n\nPhase II randomized study to compare Bethesda protocol and Cambridge method for detection of intramucosal SRCC in asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriers undergoing endoscopic screening or surveillance."
