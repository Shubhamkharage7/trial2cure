In addition, the overlay has blue tooth capabilities that will allow clinicians to remotely monitor adherence with the device.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a multi-center, prospective, study designed to evaluate the use of an alternating mattress overlay in the treatment of stage 3 pressure ulcers. After screening, eligible subjects will receive a mattress overlay system for the 4 weeks of treatment. The mattress is fitted to the patient's bed/mattress in his/her home or skilled nursing facility (SNF). Patients responding to the offloading regimen (percent wound area reduction \\>20% at 4 weeks) may use the overlay for up to 12 additional weeks. The SOC in this study is debridement, proper moisture balance, reduction of bacterial burden and nutritional counseling."
