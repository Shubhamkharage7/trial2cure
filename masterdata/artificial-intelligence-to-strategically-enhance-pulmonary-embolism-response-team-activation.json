            "briefSummary": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a high mortality and morbidity disease state. The investigators have previously shown that use of a Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) can improve overall readmission, bleeding, and mortality outcomes. Unfortunately, PERT may still be underutilized from a national standpoint and may not be readily available in underserved areas.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) may help streamline and systematically ensure unbiased mechanism for activation of PERT for discussion of patients with siginficant clot burden and hemodynamic abnormalities. AI algorithms have been FDA approved for use of triage of the PE patient. The institutional PERT program will adapt the use of an AI algorithm for activation as routine care; the efficiency of activation will be compared to our retrospective historical comparison for efficiency and appropriateness of activation.\n\nThe active phase of the study is designed to further differentiate between patients who are considered to be intermediate-high risk category but yet do not clearly qualify for invasive therapy (catheter-directed therapy, systemic thrombolysis, or invasive hemodynamic support). These patients will undergo walking test to further understand noninvasive hemodynamic compromise and undergo 2:1 randomization to early-invasive strategy versus mtranditional medical therapy."
