            "detailedDescription": "Insomnia is a debilitating condition that impacts one third of adults, with a majority not having access to proper treatment. Digital Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (dCBT-I). is a method that is becoming more accessible and with strong success rate with treatment completion; however, non-completion rates are common, specifically in those with low socioeconomic status (SES).\n\nThis study will examine the addition of telehealth coaching to dCBT-I to increase adherence rates. Telehealth coaching will aim to provide support to mitigate the impact of lower health literacy, and will also enhance self-efficacy as a mechanism to promote treatment persistence.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) outpatient network as well as the Medicare/Medicaid data warehouse. Subjects will be screened to determine eligibility, and then will be randomized into one of two insomnia treatment groups (control dCBT-I and dCBT-I with telehealth coaching). Treatment involves 6 weekly dCBT-I sessions. In the dCBT-I with coaching component, those who are at risk for treatment non-completion will be offered two telehealth sessions of brief behavioral therapy for insomnia. Those in the control dCBT-I who are at risk for treatment non-completion will be provided digital sleep education.\n\nAt the end of the treatment period, some participants will complete a semi-structured interview to assess for facilitators and barriers to treatment engagement."
