            "detailedDescription": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of intranasal oxymetazoline to ongoing optimal doses of intranasal fluticasone propionate on the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) in subjects with persistent nasal congestion and mild obstructive sleep apnea secondary to perennial allergic or non-allergic rhinitis despite treatment with the recommended doses of NGCS. The NOX T3 portable sleep monitor will be used to measure the AHI.\n\n1. The Flow Sensor, as part of the NOX T3 portable monitor, will be used to assess flow limitation of the upper airway through calculation of the flattening index, a marker of upper airway resistance.\n2. The Congestion Quantifier 7 (CQ7) questionnaire will be used to assess for an improvement in nasal congestion based on symptoms from the prior week.\n3. The Nasal Congestion Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to identify the changes in the severity of nasal congestion on a day to day basis.\n4. The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) will be used to assess the impact of perennial rhinitis and nasal congestion on activities of daily living."
