            "briefSummary": "This trial investigates a new approach using a mobile three-dimensional (3D) scanning application for volumetric measurement of the head and neck region in patients with head and neck lymphedema. Lymphedema is the buildup of extra lymph fluid in tissues that causes swelling. Accurate volumetric measurements of swelling are crucial to the diagnosis of lymphedema and to monitoring response to therapy and disease progression over time. A mobile 3D surface scanning application may help doctors measure and analyze swelling in patients with head and neck lymphedema.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To develop a specialized and mobile 3D surface scanning application to assess and monitor head and neck lymphedema.\n\nII. To confirm optimal positioning when volumetrically assessing head and neck lymphedema using 3D technologies as consistent with standard plastic surgery departmental protocol.\n\nIII. To quantify and serially track changes in head and neck lymphedema in patients with pathologies and correlate these changes with overall patient well-being and disease progression.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo 3D scanning of lower head and neck region over 90-120 seconds before surgery and then every 3 months for up to 1 year after surgery."
