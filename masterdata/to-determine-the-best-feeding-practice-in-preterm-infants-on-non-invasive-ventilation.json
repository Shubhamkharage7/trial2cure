            "briefSummary": "To evaluate the duration to reach full feeds by comparing continuous gavage feeds versus bolus feeds in preterm infants who are on non-invasive respiratory support (RAM cannula - short binasal prongs).",
            "detailedDescription": "Methods:\n\nThe study will be a randomized control trial at our NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) (Level III). Preterm infants on non -invasive ventilation (nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)/ continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) will be randomly assigned into either continuous feeds or bolus feeds groups. Baby will be fed enterally through a nasogastric tube via continuous or bolus feeds using either maternal milk or formula, according to parental choice. Feeds will be advanced as per the feeding guidelines or per treating physician. Currently we use both bolus and continuous feeding practice in our NICU, as per physician's discretion.\n\nIntervention:\n\nInfants will be randomized into 2 groups; one will receive continuous nasogastric feeding and the other group will receive intermittent bolus feeds. Continuous feeds will be delivered via an indwelling nasogastric/orogastric tube with a continuous infusion pump. Intermittent bolus feedings will be given by gravity every 3 hours over 15- 30 minutes.\n\nParents' consent will be taken when the infant is qualified for the study. The consent will be taken by one of the coinvestigators. Each coinvestigator will be trained to consent for standardization. Non-English-speaking parents will be consented using the medical video interpreter (Voyce). Accent will not be obtained as neonates aren't mature to give accent.\n\nPatients will be randomized into each group by pulling a sealed envelope.\n\nMonitoring for complications:\n\nDuring the study, infants will be monitored for any complications due to either feeding protocol like feeding intolerance, reflux, abdominal distension, poor weight gain, any risk of aspiration pneumonia or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Such symptoms are usually monitored by our NICU team as per our guidelines. These feeding issues can be encountered in either group. If such problems are encountered, feeding protocol will be changed as per the physician's clinical decision. Parents will be informed of the changes. Intention to treat protocol will be used while calculating the statistical analysis.\n\nGuidelines for withholding the feeds (bolus or intermittent) or changing either group will be:\n\n1. Excessive gastric residual (\\> 50% of the volume fed)\n2. Increase in abdominal girth (\\>1.5-2.5 cm along with other signs and symptoms of intolerance to feeds)\n3. Poor/slow weight gain (rate of weight gain is significantly below that expected for age and sex, or if weight has dropped \u22652 major percentile lines)\n4. Occult blood positive in stools/visible blood in the stools\n5. Concerns for neonatal sepsis clinically as per attending's discretion\n6. Apnea pertaining for more than 20 secs alone or apnea for \\> 10 seconds along with bradycardia (\\<80) or desaturations (hypoxemia as per gestational age); and occurring more than 2 or 3 times a day and requiring intervention\n7. Abnormal Abdominal X rays concerning for suspected NEC or NEC as per Bell's criteria\n8. Infants who need to be on invasive ventilation\n9. Treating physician's clinical decision\n\nFeeding protocol:\n\nBW: 500 -1000 grams:\n\nInitiate: When baby is stable. Start with trophic feeds, that is, 5 -10 ml/kg/day.\n\nAdvance: If tolerating trophic feeds for 2-3 days, advance feeds by 10 ml/kg/day.\n\nInitial choice of milk: Breast Milk/Donor Breast Milk / Formula (Enfamil) - 20Kcal/Oz.\n\nFortify: When 60-80 ml/kg/day feeds are reached, fortify to 22Kcal/Oz and within next few days to 24 Kcal/Oz.\n\nBW 1000 - 1500 grams:\n\nInitiate: When baby is stable. Trophic feeds 5-10 ml/kg/day. Advance: 15-20 ml/kg/day Initial choice of milk, fortifying and full feeds as above.\n\nBW 1500 grams and above:\n\nInitiate: 30 ml/kg/day. Advance: 20 -35 ml/kg/day Initial choice of milk, fortifying and full feeds as above."
