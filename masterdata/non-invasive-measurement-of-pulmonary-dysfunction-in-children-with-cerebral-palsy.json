            "briefSummary": "This proposal addresses pulmonary dysfunction in severe cerebral palsy by using a novel non-invasive respiratory sensor. The two aims of the project are to 1) provide a screening tool to detect respiratory distress and 2) Find a correlation between the degree of pulmonary dysfunction and scoliosis in children with cerebral palsy.",
            "detailedDescription": "This project proposes the utilization of a novel non-invasive real-time breathing sensor - pneuRIP- to measure pulmonary function (PF) in children with high-level cerebral palsy. Currently the standard measures of PF such as spirometry and peak flow meters are too strenuous for children and those with severe CP, as a result they have low compliance rates. The pneuRIP does not require active user participation and can passively measure PF. It consists of two inductive bands worn around the chest and abdomen that measure and differentiate diaphragmatic and chest breathing through Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP). Readings are recorded and analyzed on a small chest-worn unit and wirelessly transmitted to an iPad. The pneuRIP yields indices of work of breathing (WOB) which includes the phase angle between the chest and abdomen; percentage breathing through the ribcage; respiratory rate; and labored breathing index. This sensor takes little time to set up and readings are provided instantaneously.\n\nThe WOB indices provide a screening tool for pulmonary diagnosis and treatment, decrease the risk for pneumonia and respiratory illness, and has the potential to act as a marker for scoliosis in children with high-level CP.\n\nThe impact on the field will be to have a simple and fast way to measure pulmonary function in children and adults with severe CP and correlate this to measures of function and scoliosis severity as the effects of scoliosis, which is common in CP, on pulmonary function is unclear. Measures of motor function are classified by the Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS), ranking from I to V, with worsening disability from near normal gait in Type I to complete wheelchair use in Type V. This project will address GMFCS levels IV and V which includes people using wheelchairs. The two specific aims are a) Measure WOB indices non-invasively using the pneuRIP sensor in children with CP who use a wheelchair (GMFCS level IV, V) and validate the use of WOB indices as a screening test for pulmonary dysfunction., 2) Determine the correlation between WOB indices and the degree of scoliosis using the pneuRIP sensor in 250 children with CP who use a wheelchair (GMFCS level IV, V)."
