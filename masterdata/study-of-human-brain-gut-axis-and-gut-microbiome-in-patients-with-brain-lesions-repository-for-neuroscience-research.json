To establish a Mayo Clinic Florida Brain Tumor-Gut Axis Human Biorepository by sequential collection of fecal, urine, blood, saliva, and/or tissue samples and clinical patient information.\n\nII. To use spatial transcriptome/proteomics/multi-omics coupled with microbiome data from various sources including brain tissue and stool samples to understand how microbiota could impact disease development, progression, and treatment response in patients with brain cancer.\n\nIII. To study the effect of microbiome and potential relationships and/or microbiome reconstruction to impact patient's clinical outcomes including chemo, radiation, immunotherapy and/or cellular therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nParticipants undergo blood, tissue, saliva, urine and stool sample collection and complete questionnaires on study."
