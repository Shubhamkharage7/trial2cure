            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called BT5528 alone and in combination with nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors historically known for expression of EphA2. The main goals of this study are to:\n\n* Find the recommended dose(s) of BT5528 that can be given safely to participants alone and in combination with nivolumab\n* Learn more about the side effects of BT5528\n* Learn about how effective BT5528 is for the treatment of ovarian cancer, urothelial/bladder cancer, lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck cancer (HNSCC), and gastric/upper gastrointestinal cancer.\n* Learn more about BT5528 therapy alone and in combination with nivolumab.",
            "detailedDescription": "BT5528 consists of a bicyclic peptide (Bicycle\u00ae) which binds to EphA2, and is covalently attached to a spacer and a protease cleavable peptide linker attached to MMAE.\n\nThe Phase I/II multi-center, open-label trial will evaluate BT5528 administered once-weekly as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab. The Phase I portion is a dose escalation primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of BT5528 and to determine recommended Phase II dose(s) (RP2D). Following selection of a recommended Phase II dose(s) (RP2D), a dose expansion portion will be initiated with the primary objective of evaluating the clinical activity of BT5528."
