The intervention will include all 12 stretching exercises used in the exercise intervention of previous studies that have successfully used it in comparison to yoga, plus 3 additional stretches (hip internal rotators, hip adductors and hip flexion).Participants will be asked to practice every day for 20 minutes home as well. Printed handouts will be provided to facilitate home practice. In addition, a video demonstrating all the exercises will be provided to assist participants in practicing safely.
