            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe immune system is the part of the body that fights infection. Some people have immune deficiencies that cause skin rashes, make them get sick often with infections, or make it difficult for their skin to heal. Researchers want to learn more to better treat conditions that affect immune response.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn about how the immune system and skin healing are related to each other.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 18-75 with primary immune deficiency, eczema, or psoriasis. Healthy volunteers are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical and medicine history and a physical exam. They may take a pregnancy test.\n\nParticipants will discuss the medicines or supplements they take as well as skin products they use, such as soaps and lotions.\n\nParticipants will have up to 4 skin biopsies taken from the forearm. A needle will inject an anesthetic into the skin where the biopsy will be done. A sharp tool that looks like a tiny cookie cutter will be used to remove a round plug of skin a bit smaller than the tip of a pencil.\n\nParticipants will give at least 1 blood sample.\n\nParticipants may have optional skin swab collection. A cotton swab will be used to swab the skin on the arm.\n\nParticipants may have optional skin tape collection. A sticky strip of tape will be placed on the arm and then removed.\n\nParticipants may give leftover samples taken as part of their regular medical care.\n\nParticipation will last for about 4 days. Participants will have 2 visits that each last about 1 hour. They may be asked to repeat the study in the future.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is an exploratory sample collection study enrolling adult healthy volunteers and patients with immune-mediated diseases to elucidate the metabolic signatures associated with immune-mediated diseases. We hypothesize that activation of, and responses to, specific immune pathways will require metabolic changes within cells, serum, and skin.\n\nFollowing screening and baseline procedures, including blood draw, participants will undergo skin biopsies. The skin biopsies will involve up to 4 biopsies: 2 initial punch biopsies 2 mm in diameter, optionally followed by 1 or 2 punch biopsies 3 (+/-1) days later using a 3-mm punch to encompass the initial biopsy site(s), capturing the tissue at 3 days of healing. In addition, skin swabs and tape strips may be collected to assess for microbial or host markers of epithelial repair. Peripheral blood will be collected with the initial biopsies to compare metabolic signatures in peripheral blood cells and serum with those in the skin. After day 1 (or 3, if the participant has that optional visit), participation in the study will be complete. Samples and data will be stored for future research use.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. Evaluate metabolic profiles in immune activation associated with known or suspected immune-mediated disorders.\n2. Determine whether there are abnormalities in specific tissue repair pathways, such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), that are associated with immune-mediated disorders.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nNot applicable.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n1. Fold differences in metabolic pathways associated with immune pathways.\n2. Fold differences in metabolic pathways related to wound healing.\n3. Change in relative abundance of microbial skin taxa and/or skin metabolites associated with wound healing or immune-mediated disorders.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nNot applicable."
