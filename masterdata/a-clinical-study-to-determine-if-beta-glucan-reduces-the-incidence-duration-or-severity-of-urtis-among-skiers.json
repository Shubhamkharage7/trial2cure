            "detailedDescription": "In this study, we hypothesize that consumption of 200 mg beta-glucan per day will lessen the frequency, duration and severity of URTI symptoms in a population of elite, internationally competitive skiers over a 45-day period. In order to complete this objective, we will utilize the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-24 (WURSS-24) to monitor and quantify the incidence, duration and severity of URTI symptoms. A secondary objective is to determine if beta-glucan supplementation reduces or mitigates early indictors of athlete-specific stress. This objective will be assessed using the Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ), a 10-question patient-reported outcome tool used to evaluate athlete-specific psychological stress.\n\nThis will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel arm design conducted over a 6-week period. 50-60 healthy subjects will be recruited and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of two interventions:\n\n1. Placebo: daily consumption of the placebo tablet\n2. Treatment: daily consumption of the supplement (treatment) tablet\n\nIn addition, subjects will complete the WURSS-24 survey daily, and the APSQ survey weekly."
