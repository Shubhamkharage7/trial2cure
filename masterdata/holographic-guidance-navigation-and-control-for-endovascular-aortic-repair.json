            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this clinical study is to evaluate the feasibility of using electromagnetic (EM) guidance and tracking to precisely place a Cook Zenith Flex AAA bifurcated stent graft during EVAR. EM guidance and tracking is enabled using a system consisting of the following: 1) experimental 3D guidance, navigation, and control (3D-GNC) software developed by Centerline Biomedical, Inc., integrated with the company's FDA-cleared Intra-Operative Positioning System (IOPS), 2) FDA-cleared compatible sensorized guidewires added to the Cook Zenith Flex delivery system and 3) 3D visualization on the IOPS mobile cart monitor and 3D holographic visualization overlaid on the patient during the procedure using a head mounted display (HMD), the Microsoft HoloLens 2. Planning and execution of each case will be major steps in demonstrating feasibility of the technology beyond non-clinical and preclinical testing."
