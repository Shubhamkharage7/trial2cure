            "briefSummary": "The investigators will conduct a Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to test an integrated telehealth intervention among 400 overweight and obese patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The investigators will include eligible participants receiving primary care at one of five Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and their community-based outpatient clinics. The investigators will randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio to the multi-component intervention or \"enhanced\" usual care, stratifying by age (\u226565 vs. \\< 65) and site. Participants randomized to the intervention will receive an integrated, telehealth-delivered intervention composed of a self-directed lifestyle program and supervised pulmonary rehabilitation. At the end of 3 months, the investigators will offer to enter a recommendation for weight management medications on behalf of eligible intervention participants. In the post-core period (months 4-12), participants will continue to have as-needed access to the lifestyle coach. For participants randomized to the \"enhanced\" usual care group, study staff will prompt the patient's primary care provider to refer them to existing weight loss management and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Follow-up will occur at virtual visits at 3 and 12 months. The primary effectiveness outcome at 1-year is quality of life measured by the SF-12 Physical Component Summary Score. Secondary effectiveness outcomes will include other measures of quality of life (including sleep related impairment), sleep disturbance, disease severity (COPD exacerbations and respiratory event index for OSA), depression, social support, weight loss and cardiovascular risk. In addition to assessing effectiveness, investigators will also conduct a concurrent implementation process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework."
