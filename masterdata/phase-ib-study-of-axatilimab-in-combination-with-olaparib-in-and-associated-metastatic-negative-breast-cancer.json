            "detailedDescription": "This is a non-randomized, open-label, proof-of-concept phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a drug known as Axatilimab in combination with the drug Olaparib in BRCA1/2 and PALB2 associated HER2-negative breast cancer.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved axatilimab as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe FDA has approved olaparib as a treatment option for BRCA1/2 and PALB2 associated HER2-negative breast cancer, and it is considered standard of care for those types of breast cancer. The FDA has approved olaparib for metastatic (breast cancer that has spread) BRCA1/2 associated HER2-negative breast cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment in-clinic visits, tumor biopsies, blood tests, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, and electrocardiograms.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last for as long as there is clinical benefit and participants will be followed for a maximum of three years after finishing study treatment.\n\nIt is expected that about 16-20 people will take part in this research study.\n\nIncyte Corporation is funding this research study and providing Axatilimab."

Postmenopausal is defined as:\n\n  * Amenorrhoeic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments\n  * Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range for women under 50.\n  * Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses \\>1 year ago\n  * Chemotherapy-induced menopause with \\>1 year interval since last menses\n  * Bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago\n* The effects of axatilimab and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of study participation and for 4 months after discontinuation of treatment.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo 3 research biopsies: at baseline, after 2 weeks of olaparib monotherapy, and after 2 cycles of combination therapy. If biopsy is not feasible or safe, OR if the only area accessible to biopsy is also the only site of measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria, permission must be obtained from the DFCI sponsor- investigator to forgo the mandatory research biopsies. Formal eligibility exception would not be required in these circumstances.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical progression on a PARP inhibitor, or within 12 months of receipt of a PARP inhibitor, including but not limited to olaparib.\n* Any previous treatment with CSF1R antibody.\n* Patients who have had prior systemic chemotherapy, immune therapy, or investigational therapy within three weeks of initiation of protocol therapy. Endocrine therapy must have been discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy. Patients may receive bisphosphonates or denosumab during the study.\n* Participants who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia, are excluded.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to axatilimab or olaparib.\n* Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong or moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible. This also includes strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.\n* Participants with a QTcF of \\>470msec on screening ECG\n* Patients with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or with features suggestive of MDS/AML\n* Participants unable to swallow orally administered medication and participants with gastrointestinal disorders that are likely to interfere with absorption of the study medications in the opinion of the treating investigator (e.g. malabsorption syndrome or major stomach or bowel resections).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* History of pneumonitis or ILD, or evidence of pneumonitis/ILD on baseline imaging\n* Known active or latent tuberculosis\n* Patients with major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy.",
