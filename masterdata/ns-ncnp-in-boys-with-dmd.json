The 22 items are subdivided into the high level shoulder dimension (6 items), middle level elbow dimension (9 items), and distal wrist and hand dimension (7 items). For weaker patients, a low score on the entry item (0 2) means high level items do not need to be performed. Scoring options vary across the scale between 0-1 and 0-2 according to performance. Each dimension can be scored separately with a maximum score of 12 for the high level shoulder dimension, 17 for the middle level elbow dimension, and 13 for the distal wrist and hand dimension.
