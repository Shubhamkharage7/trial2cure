            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test CPO301, a type of drug called an antibody drug conjugate in adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* To assess the safety and tolerability of CPO301 at increasing doses and determine the dose to be used in the second part of the study (Part A)\n* To assess the safety and tolerability of CPO301 at the dose determined to be safe and tolerable in Part A in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and potentially other tumor types (Part B)\n* To evaluate how quickly CPO301 is metabolized by the body (pharmacokinetics or PK)\n* To evaluate if antibodies to the study drug develop (immunogenicity)\n* To evaluate preliminary efficacy to the drug\n* To correlate preliminary efficacy with mutations in a biomarker called EGFR\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Provide written informed consent\n* Undergo screening tests to ensure they are eligible for study treatment\n* Attend all required study visits and receive CPO301 by intravenous injection every 3 weeks until the study doctor determines study treatment should be stopped, based on how well a participant is doing on treatment\n* Be followed for progression every 3 months for up to 2 years",
            "detailedDescription": "This Phase 1 study is a multicenter, dose-escalating, dose-expansion, single agent, 2-part study conducted in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who progressed on \u22651 prior conventional systemic therapy or who were ineligible or intolerant to standard treatment or had no or refused standard treatment.\n\nDose escalation (Part A) - Dose escalation will be guided by a modified 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose of CPO301 (also known as SYS6010). Determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be based on toxicity observed during the DLT observation period (first 21 days \\[1 cycle\\]). Dose escalation decisions are made based on the occurrence of DLT. MTD will be determined based on the data of all enrolled participants. To better identify the MTD, one or more dose groups may also be added beyond the planned maximum dose group (if determined to be safe), or between the maximum escalation dose group and the next lower dose group for DLT assessment. Intermediate dose groups and/or adjustment to the dosing frequency may be made\n\nDose expansion (Part B) - Additional patients will be enrolled at the recommended dose determined in the dose escalation stage. An additional tumor cohort may be added based on data observed in Part A."
