            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nScientists have long used simple measures (such as height and weight) to estimate how much a person s body uses food (calories) as energy, as commonly called the metabolic rate. But metabolism varies among people with similar body sizes. Scientists now believe the old formulas for estimating metabolic rates may not work well for all people. Researchers want to find more accurate ways to measure a person s metabolism.\n\nObjective:\n\nThis natural history study will examine the relationships between metabolism, body composition, and body surface area in a wide range of people.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy children and adults aged 2 years or older. Also, people aged 2 years or older with conditions that may alter metabolism. These may include diabetes, obesity, renal disease, or cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will spend 2 days and 1 night in the hospital. They will provide a medical history and answer questions about their activity levels, the foods they eat, and their lifestyle. They will also eat a special diet.\n\nParticipants will undergo many tests:\n\nThey will lie in a bed with a clear hood covering their head for 30 to 45 minutes to measure the gases in their breath.\n\nThey will lie on a padded table for about 15 minutes while their body is scanned.\n\nThey will stand on a platform while a 3D scanner measures their body.\n\nThey will have a test to measure how fast an electric signal moves through their body.\n\nThey will grip an instrument to measure the strength of their hands.\n\nThey will drink salty water and provide blood and urine samples.\n\nParticipants may be invited to return for these 2-day visits up to 8 times per year. Return visits must be at least 2 weeks apart.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will examine the relationships between comprehensively measured resting energy expenditure (REE), body composition, and body surface area (BSA) in a wide range of healthy and diseased individuals.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n* To compare estimated and measured BSA.\n* To determine if measured BSA is associated with REE independent of body composition measures\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n* Mean difference and limits of agreement at baseline between measured BSA and predicted BSA calculated from traditional biometrics such as height and weight.\n* Increase in R\\^2 when measured BSA is added to equations predicting REE."
