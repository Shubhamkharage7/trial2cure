This is the first in-human study of IMC-I109V in persons with CHB.",
            "detailedDescription": "IMC-I109V-101 is a first-in-human (FIH) study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IMC-I109V in single and multiple dose regimens and to provide a preliminary assessment of antiviral activity, when administered to virally suppressed hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-negative participants receiving long-term NA therapy. The aim of this study is to identify safe, tolerable, and clinically active dose (CAD) regimens of IMC-I109V for further clinical development. The IMC-I109V study is divided into 3 main parts: Part 1 - Single Ascending Dose (SAD); Part 2 - Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD), in HBeAg-negative CHB; Part 3 will evaluate safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, PK and anti-tumor efficacy of Multiple Ascending Doses of IMC-I109V in participants with HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV HCC) who are virally suppressed on NA therapy."
