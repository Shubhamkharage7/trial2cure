Researchers will use a pair of commercially-available, noninvasive pulse oximeters to estimate the oxygen saturation of blood in the internal jugular vein, and compare it to the directly measured oxygen saturation in sampled jugular blood. Researchers will then measure the arterial oxygen saturation in a finger, and compare it to the directly measured oxygen saturation in sampled radial arterial blood."
