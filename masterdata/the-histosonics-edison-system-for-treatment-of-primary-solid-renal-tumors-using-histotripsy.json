Subject is diagnosed with only one (1) non-metastatic solid renal mass \u22643cm confirmed via CT or MRI \u226430 days prior to the index procedure date.\n4. Subject has had a biopsy to determine the type of tumor, \u226514 days prior to the index procedure.\n5. Subject can tolerate general anesthesia.\n6. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) grade 0-2 at baseline screening.\n7. Subject meets all the following functional criteria at \u226414 days prior to the planned index procedure date:\n\n   * White Blood Count (WBC) \u22653,000/mm3 (\u22653 10\\*9/L)\n   * Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u22651,200/mm3 (\u22651.2 10\\*9/L)\n   * Hemoglobin (Hgb) \u22659 g/dL\n   * Platelet count \u2265100,000/mm3 (\u2265100 10\\*9/L)\n   * White Blood Count (WBC) \u22645 hpf via urinalysis\n   * Albumin \u2264300 mg/g via urinalysis\n8. Subject has an eGFR (Glomerular filtration rate) \u226545mL/min, \u226414 days prior to the planned index procedure date.\n9.

Subjects who have active cancers (not in remission for the last two years) other than non-melanomatous skin cancers.\n4. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject has co-morbid disease(s) or condition(s) that would cause undue risk and preclude safe use of the HistoSonics Edison System.\n5. Subject is on dialysis, being considered for dialysis or has acute renal failure.\n6. Subject has not recovered to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 or better from any adverse effects (except alopecia and neuropathy) related to previous therapy.\n7. Subject has an International normalized ratio (INR) \\>1.5 or uncorrectable coagulopathy, (e.g., known von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, or on anticoagulants), on the planned index procedure date.\n8. Subject is taking Aspirin (ASA) or NSAIDS \u226414 days prior to the planned index procedure date.\n9. Subject has a life expectancy less than one (\\< 1) year.\n10. In the investigator's opinion, histotripsy is not a treatment option for the subject.\n11. Subject has a concurrent condition that could jeopardize the safety of the subject or compliance with the protocol.\n12. Subject's targeted tumor has had prior locoregional therapy (e.g., ablation, embolization, radiation).\n13. Subject's targeted tumor is not treatable by the HistoSonics Edison System's working ranges (refer to User Guide).\n14. In the investigator's opinion, the anticipated risks of intervention outweigh the potential benefits of the intervention.\n15. Subject has bilateral kidney tumors or has a single functioning kidney.\n16. Subject has a genetic predisposition to kidney cancer such as:\n\n    * Von Hippel Lindau (VHL)\n    * Hereditary Papillary Renal Carcinoma (HPRC)\n    * Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 Syndrome (BHD)\n    * Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)\n    * Hereditary Leiomyomata's Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC)\n    * Reed's Syndrome\n    * Succinate Dehydrogenase B Deficiency (SDHB)\n    * BRCA 1 associated protein -1 (BAP1) Renal Cell Carcinoma\n    * MITF predisposed Renal Cell Carcinoma\n17. The targeted tumor is an angiomyolipoma.\n18. Subject has a known sensitivity to contrast media and cannot be adequately pre-medicated.\n19. The targeted tumor is not clearly visible with ultrasound, MRI or CT.\n20. Targeted tumor with adequate margin overlaps the renal pelvis, main renal vessel, ureter, or other vital structure.\n21. The treatment of the tumor will not allow an adequate margin (as determined by the investigator).",
