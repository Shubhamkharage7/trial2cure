The intra-oral space will be exposed and the nasal floor and palatal mucosa will be primarily closed to create a water-tight space for the graft. The integrity of the nasal floor mucosa will be tested using methylene blue dye. Following closure of the fistula, the alveolar bone graft will be performed. For the treatment group, 10cc of crushed DBM will be mixed with the micro-sized sponge of rh-BMP-2 (Infuse Bone Graft, Medronic, Minneapolis, MN). The sponge and DBM will then be packed into the defect to completely fill the bony space (FIGURE 3). The anterior mucosa will then be closed.",
