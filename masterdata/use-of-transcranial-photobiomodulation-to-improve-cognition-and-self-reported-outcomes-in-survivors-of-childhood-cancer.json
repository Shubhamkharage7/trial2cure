The participants are a survivor of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Because of your treatment the participant may have developed trouble with thinking and learning.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo evaluate the feasibility of using home-based tPBM paired with remote cognitive training to improve cognitive performance in survivors of ALL and HL.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo estimate the potential efficacy of alpha and gamma frequency tPBM on cognitive performance in survivors of ALL and HL.\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\nTo estimate the effects of home-based tPBM paired with remote cognitive training on patient reported symptoms of executive dysfunction, sleep, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain in survivors of ALL and HL.",
