            "briefSummary": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in the United States, and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have a 2-fold higher risk for cardiovascular disease later in life compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies. This research investigates a patient-centered intervention during the postpartum period to promote engagement in cardiovascular preventive care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Current evidence demonstrates that women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have 2-fold higher risk for the later development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to women with healthy pregnancies. CVD prevention is a high priority for women's health, as it is the leading cause of death among women in the United States. In order to improve women's cardiovascular health, interventions for cardiovascular prevention could be initiated shortly after a pregnancy complicated by a hypertensive disorder. However, patient-centered interventions to promote preventive care engagement among postpartum women are lacking. Our objective is to address current gaps in knowledge regarding needs, values, and barriers regarding cardiovascular prevention among postpartum women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and to remedy the lack of available evidence-based interventions for this at-risk population. To this end, we will conduct a pilot study to demonstrate feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a patient decision aid to improve patient knowledge and self-efficacy regarding CVD prevention during the postpartum period"
