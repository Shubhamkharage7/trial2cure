This study will be initiated in patients with lymphomas, and solid tumors and then subsequently in patients with advanced high grade myeloid malignancies and ALL. Therefore, the study is comprised of two arms to characterize the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of KT-253 in each arm. Arm A will consist of patients with lymphomas and advanced solid tumors and Arm B will consist of patients with high grade myeloid malignancies and ALL."
