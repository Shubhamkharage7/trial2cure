            "briefSummary": "The heightened vulnerability to COVID-19 of African American older adults in Detroit, Michigan and other marginalized communities is linked to systemic racism experienced over the life course. Structural inequities also magnify the pandemic's impact on older adults' physical and psychosocial functioning. Many older adults in Detroit, burdened by poor health even before the pandemic, face a downward spiral of increased distress, reduced physical and social activity, and physical deconditioning. RESET (Re-Engaging in Self-care, Enjoying Today) is a self-management and resilience-building intervention led by community health workers (CHWs) at the Detroit Health Department (DHD). The central hypothesis of this study is that RESET, with components that include group telephone calls, a podcast series, and activity trackers, will improve psychosocial and physical functioning at 2 and 8 months. Specific aims are: 1) With input from a Community Advisory Board, modify RESET for group delivery and refine content after testing in a mini-pilot (n=10). 2) Conduct a randomized, controlled trial to assess the impact of RESET (compared to a one-time /telephone wellness check) on PROMIS-29 Psychosocial Score (a weighted combination of distress, fatigue, pain, social participation and sleep) among 456 primarily African American older adults age 50 and over who are at elevated risk of poor functioning. 3) Collect qualitative (interview) data from participants and other stakeholders, and use this data to better understand trial results, as well as to assess community impact and inform a dissemination toolkit."
