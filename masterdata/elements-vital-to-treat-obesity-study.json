The investigators will be comparing the previously developed and optimized behavioral weight loss intervention (APP) to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), to evaluate program weight-loss success and cost-effectiveness.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study seeks to determine if the APP program is an effective, resource-sensitive strategy to manage weight for obesity, as compared to the DPP program. During the 24-week active intervention phase, participants will be randomized to one of two treatments: 1) APP, wherein participants receive calorie, fat, and physical activity goals via a Smartphone application for self-monitoring, online educational readings, and biweekly sessions with a Health Promotionist; or 2) DPP, wherein participants are guided to self-monitor their physical activity, food intake, and weight via a participant log, and are guided through 16 sessions by a Health Promotionist. Assessments to track progress will occur remotely at the 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month time points of the program."
