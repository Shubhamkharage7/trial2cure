            "briefSummary": "Only 50% of sedentary adults that start an exercise training program adhere to the program after 6 months. Exercise variety may improve adherence. The goal of this study is to examine different exercise interventions that include a variety of exercise on adherence.",
            "detailedDescription": "Regular exercise, in the form of walking 150 minutes per week, is widely regarded as having many health and fitness benefits. Despite these well-known benefits, adherence to exercise interventions is extremely low. When sedentary adults start an exercise training program only 50% adhere to the program and meet the national recommendations of 150 minutes per week. A possible explanation of the low adherence is that most adults only walk for exercise, and that providing a variety of exercise may increase adherence. Preliminary observational data show that a variety of exercise may increase weekly exercise expenditure compared to other interventions. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility, adherence, and acceptability of different exercise interventions including 1) walk intervention, 2) variety intervention, and 3) progressive intervention (see below for description)."
