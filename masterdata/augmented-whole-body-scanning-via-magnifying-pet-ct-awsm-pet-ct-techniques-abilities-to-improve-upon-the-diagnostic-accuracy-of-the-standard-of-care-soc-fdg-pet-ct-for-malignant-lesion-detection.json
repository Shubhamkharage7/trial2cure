            "briefSummary": "Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to outperform other imaging modalities such as CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of metastatic cancers. Therefore, it is currently used for cancer staging, re-staging, and for monitoring response to therapy for many types of cancers. Despite its wide use and success, the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT is suboptimal for lesions that are significantly smaller than 1 cm due primarily to limitations on image resolution and system sensitivity. The investigators have developed an Augmented Whole-body Scanning via Magnifying PET (AWSM-PET) technology that can improve the image resolution and system sensitivity of current and future PET/CT scanners. This study will evaluate preliminarily whether the AWSM-PET/CT technology can provide additional high-resolution PET/CT images displayed concurrently with the standard of care FDG-PET/CT images to improve overall accuracy in depicting malignant lesions in cancer patients."
