AVZO-021 is an oral medication that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK 2).",
            "detailedDescription": "AVZO-021 is a compound being developed for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors, specifically, HR+/HER2- breast cancer and cyclin E1 (CCNE1) altered malignancies. AVZO-021 is a selective and potent cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitor, which plays an important role in cell cycle regulation. This is a Phase 1/2 first-in-human, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study of AVZO-021. Phase 1 is a dose-escalation phase aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of AVZO-021 and determining the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) as monotherapy and combination therapy. Phase 2 is a dose-expansion phase that will be conducted to assess the antitumor activity of AVZO-021 as monotherapy and combination therapy."

No more than 2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced/metastatic disease (prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting allowed if \\>12 months prior to starting AVZO-021 treatment and is not considered a prior line).\n4. Measurable disease as determined by RECIST version 1.1.\n5. Adequate bone marrow and organ function.\n6. Ability to swallow capsules or tablets.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Received an investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 2 weeks, or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior to planned start of AVZO-021.\n2. Received any CDK2 inhibitor, protein kinase membrane associated tyrosine/threonine 1 (PKMYT1) inhibitor, or WEE1 inhibitor anticancer therapy.\n3. Undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to planned start of AVZO-021.\n4. Received radiotherapy for palliation within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment, unless specified otherwise in the protocol.\n5. Active CNS metastases or confirmed leptomeningeal disease are not eligible.\n6. Unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 Grade \\>1 at the time of starting study treatment.\n7. Clinically unstable cardiac function as described in the protocol.\n8. Any active or chronic infection/disease that compromises the immune system.\n9. Current treatment with strong or moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 inhibitors or inducers.\n10. Active second malignancy unless in remission with life expectancy \\> 2 years and with documented sponsor approval.\n11.
