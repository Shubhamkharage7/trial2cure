            "briefSummary": "This study is a double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial. The study will take place at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The study will include 33-39 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe-Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) as well as 33-39 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe papulopustular rosacea (PPR). Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive study drug or placebo.\n\nEnrolled subjects will apply topical PF-07038124 0.02% ointment once daily for 8 weeks. They will return for visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12 following study treatment initiation for repeat clinical assessments, medication reviews, tape-strip, blood and urine sample collections, and monitoring for adverse events.",
            "detailedDescription": "After providing consent, all subjects will be assessed for study eligibility, which includes a review of the subjects past and current medical conditions, familial medical history and detailed review of past and current medications. Subjects will also undergo a review of past topical treatments/therapies for SD or PPR, and clinical assessments (SD: clinical SD score, IGA, Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale \\[PP-NRS\\]; PPR: inflammatory lesion count, IGA, PP-NRS).\n\nSubjects who meet inclusion criteria for eligibility may continue with the Baseline Visit (Week 0) or can be scheduled to return for the Baseline Visit within 28 days of the Screening Visit.\n\nAt Baseline/Week 0, subjects will undergo clinical assessments (SD: clinical SD Severity Score, IGA, PP-NRS; PPR: inflammatory lesion count, IGA, PP-NRS), review of concomitant medications, standardized clinical photography, and a Dermatology Life Quality index (DLQI) questionnaire. Subsequent clinical assessments including standardized clinical photography, and questionnaire completion will be performed at follow up visits at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12. Skin tape-strip samples will be collected for mechanistic studies (described below) at baseline (lesional and non-lesional facial skin), Week 4 (lesional facial skin), Week 8 (lesional facial skin), and Week 12 (lesional facial skin). Additional blood samples will be collected and stored at baseline and at Week 8 (or early termination, whichever is first) for potential future mechanistic analyses."
