The last IVT administration must have occurred at least 21 days prior to the screening visit.\n* Demonstrated response to prior IVT anti-VEGF or anti-VEGF/Ang-2 treatment since diagnosis.\n* Availability of historical VA data prior to the first anti-VEGF or anti-VEGF/Ang-2 treatment for nAMD.\n* Sufficiently clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to allow for analysis and grading.\n* Decreased BCVA attributable primarily to nAMD with letter score of 78 to 34 letters (inclusive) or better on ETDRS-like charts.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Study Eye:\n\n* History of vitrectomy surgery, submacular surgery, other intraocular surgery, or any planned surgical intervention during the study period.\n* Cataract surgery without complications within three months preceding the screening visit or planned during the study period.\n* Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule. Previous violation of the posterior capsule is also an exclusion criterion, unless it occurred as a result of yttrium-aluminum garnet laser posterior capsulotomy in association with prior, posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation.\n* Prior macular treatment with verteporfin, external beam radiation therapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, or any type of laser photocoagulation.\n* Prior treatment with IVT corticosteroids or implant (e.g., triamcinolone, ozurdex, iluvien).\n* Subretinal hemorrhage \\>50% of the total lesion area and/or involving the fovea.\n* Subfoveal fibrosis or subfoveal atrophy.\n* Retinal pigment epithelial tear involving the macula.\n* History of vitreous hemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, glaucoma-filtering surgery, tube shunts, or microinvasive glaucoma surgery, and corneal transplant.\n* History of rhegmatogenous retinal tears or peripheral retinal breaks within three months prior to the screening visit.\n* Actual or history of myopia \\>-8 diopters.\n* Uncontrolled ocular hypertension or glaucoma (defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) \\>25 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or a cup to disc ration \\>0.8, despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) and any such condition the Investigator determines may require a glaucoma-filtering surgery during a participant's participation in the study.\n* Concurrent intraocular conditions (e.g., cataract, diabetic retinopathy, epiretinal membrane with traction, macular hole) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could either:\n* Require medical or surgical intervention during the study period to prevent or treat visual loss that might result from that condition; or\n* Likely contribute to loss of BCVA over the study period if allowed to progress untreated; or\n* Preclude any visual improvement due to substantial structural damage.\n* Concurrent conjunctival, Tenon's capsule, and/or scleral condition in the supero-temporal quadrant of the eye (e.g., scarring, thinning, mass) that may affect the implantation, subsequent tissue coverage, and refill-exchange procedure of the PD implant.\n* Prior treatment with any medication for geographic atrophy.\n* Prior treatment with any anti-VEGF-C or anti-VEGF-D inhibitors.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Fellow Eye\n\n* BCVA letter score using ETDRS charts of \\< 34 letters.\n* Treatment with anti-VEGF or anti-VEGF/Ang-2 agents within one month prior to Day 1 (for Part 1) or prior to the randomization visit (Part 3).\n\nExclusion Criteria for Either Eye\n\n* CNV due to causes other than nAMD, such as ocular histoplasmosis, trauma, pathological myopia, angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, uveitis or central serous chorioretinopathy.\n* Prior participation in a clinical trial involving anti-VEGF drugs within six months prior to the screening visit, other than ranibizumab, aflibercept, or faricimab.\n* Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above), infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis.\n* History of uveitis, including history of any intraocular inflammation following intravitreal anti-VEGFor anti-VEGF/Ang-2 injections.\n* Prior treatment with brolucizumab.\n* Prior gene therapy for nAMD",
