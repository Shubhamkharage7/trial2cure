The overall objectives of the current study are to characterize the role of SMAD6 inherited genetic variation on LCH susceptibility and identify germline genomic regions associated with LCH somatic mutations. Building from preliminary data, the central hypotheses are: (1) causal genetic variants in SMAD6 underlie susceptibility to LCH, and (2) differences in LCH-related somatic activating mutations by race/ethnicity are related to Amerindian (i.e., Native American) genetic ancestry. The Central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the specific aims.",

To identify novel germline variants associated with LCH.\n\nIII.To determine the role of genetic ancestry on LCH-related somatic mutations.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To integrate clinical and epidemiologic questionnaire data with genetic risk factor data from the Primary Aims to more comprehensively elucidate LCH susceptibility.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nCase identification and recruitment followed by questionnaires and specimen processing."
