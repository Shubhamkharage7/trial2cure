Informed consent will be obtained from patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria before the initiation of any study specific procedures. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either PCC or plasma transfusion. The efficacy of interventions will be evaluated after 30 minutes of protamine administration. After the heart transplantation, thrombocytopenia and/or hypofibrinogenemia may worsen bleeding associated with vitamin K dependent factor deficiencies. Transfusion of platelets and/or cryoprecipitate is permitted if abnormal laboratory values are observed during the rewarming phase of CPB; platelet count \\<100 x 103/\u00b5l, and fibrinogen \\<200 mg/dl, respectively. Laboratory tests (hematocrit, platelet count, PT, PTT, POC-PT, coagulation factor and inhibitor levels (e.g., factor II, antithrombin), thromboelastometry or thromboelastography, endogenous thrombin generation) will also be obtained at baseline, twice during surgery and at 12-24 hours after surgery."
