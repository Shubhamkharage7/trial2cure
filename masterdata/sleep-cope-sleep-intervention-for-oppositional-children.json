Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) holds promise for improving insomnia and related concerns. Telehealth delivery will reduce the burden of in-person sessions, particularly in areas where there is low mental healthcare access. Telehealth CBT-I is efficacious in adults and children but has not been tested in children with ODD. The proposed trial is the next logical step - development and iterative testing of SLEEP-COPE, a brief dyadic telehealth CBT-I for children with ODD and their parents."
