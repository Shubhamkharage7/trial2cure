            "briefSummary": "Multivitamin/multimineral supplements (MVI) provide important nutrition supplement to the diet of pregnant women to cover potential deficiencies and optimize nutrition status of both mom and baby, especially when the diet is suboptimal or nutrient demand is high while absorption is hindered by various factors such as genetic variance and gastrointestinal function. It is, however, largely unknown whether using an MVI during the lactating period helps improve nutrition status of mom and baby. In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will recruit 7- postpartum women who exclusively breastfeed at week 5 postpartum and randomly assign them to either receive the Ritual MVI which is commercially available or a blank placebo for 10 weeks. A blank placebo is appropriate because there is currently no recommendation or scientific consensus that lactating women who are healthy and eat a normal diet would have improved nutrition status or maternal-infant health outcomes from a nutrition supplement. The investigators will collect blood and breastmilk samples at baseline and end of the study to assess nutrient status. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of a Ritual MVI leads to better nutrition status and biomarkers in maternal-child dyads compared to control."
