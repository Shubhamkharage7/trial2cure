Acupressure involves the application of pressure stimulation at specific acupoints on the body. Acupressure may help relieve pain and is used for a wide variety of pain conditions. Participation in this study will consist of remote self-administered treatment every other day over 5 weeks, followed by 6 months of remote follow-up visits. During participation, subjects will: 1) receive detailed instruction on locating treatment acupoints and completing study procedures remotely, 2) be assigned a treatment kit, 3) answer questions about their personal and health-related information for assessing their health condition before, during, and after the treatment during follow-up sessions, and 4) collect inner eyelid images for examining the hemoglobin level on a weekly basis at steady phase and daily basis during acute vaso-occlusive crisis stage."
