            "detailedDescription": "Radiofrequency (RF)-based selective electrothermolysis is an increasingly utilized minimally invasive technology for several dermatologic conditions, such as epilation, acne vulgaris, and skin rejuvenation, with minimal side effects. This procedure targets and destroys selective cutaneous and subcutaneous structures; therefore, allowing greater control and specificity of treatment area and minimizing destruction to surrounding tissue. Here, the investigators propose to utilize this technology on human axillary skin to establish safety and biologic effects of selective electrothermolysis in this particular area of the skin.\n\nThe investigators will assess the tolerability, safety, and histometric changes in skin-radiofrequency interactions in the axillary skin of participants. The investigators will collect skin samples from prospective volunteers and assess for biologic effects in human axillary skin after selective electrothermolysis treatment.\n\nDuring the four months of study period, Participants in the study will receive clinical assessments, photography, questionnaires, up to 3 treatments of RF-based selective electrothermolysis to pre-selected areas of the axillary skin, up to 2 4-mm skin biopsies for up to 5 study visits."
