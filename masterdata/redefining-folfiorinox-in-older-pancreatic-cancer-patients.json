Treatment will be given in the outpatient infusion room or clinical research unit. Reported adverse events and potential risks of these agents are described below. No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.\n\nThe study will accrue 37 patients who will be evaluated by correlating their daily activity via use of FitBit that will be provided to the patients, blood markers and progression of the disease with the toxicity grades observed during the treatment. Patients will be treated with standard of care doses of all the chemotherapeutic drugs. The study will be analyzed for futility after treatment of 20 patients. Each cycle consists of 28 days during which patient treatment will alternate between FOLFOX and FOLFIRI on day 1 and day 14 respectively. Patients will be treated until disease progression or any of the conditions listed in Section 4.4 that applies. Patient's response to treatment will be evaluated by CT scans every 8 weeks and the tumor will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria."

In patients with mixed histology tumors, the predominant feature must be adenocarcinoma.\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status of 0-2.\n5. Previous surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy will be allowed, provided radiation therapy is completed at least 2 weeks prior to signing consent and adjuvant therapy was administered more than 6 months prior to signing consent.\n6. Patients must have bone marrow and organ function as defined below:\n\n   * Absolute Neutrophil Count \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL\n   * Platelets \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL\n   * Total Bilirubin \u22642 X ULN\n   * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)/\n\n     o Alkaline Phasphatase \u22643 X ULN\n\n     o Or \u22645x ULN if liver metastasis present\n   * Creatinine \u22642.0 mg/dL And\n   * eGFR (using Cockcroft Gault equation) \\> 40ml/min\n7. Patients must be fluent in English and must be able and willing to undergo Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment\n8. Chemotherapy is harmful to the human fetus.

Patients with a history of in situ cancers treated with definitive local therapy will also be eligible.\n\n9 Patients with grade 3 or higher baseline sensory neuropathy\n\n10 Patients with chronic diarrhea (\\>4 bowel movements/day) unresolved despite best supportive care for greater than 2 weeks.\n\n11 Patients with any of the following results on the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment:\n\n* \\>2 falls in the past month\n* BMI \\<18",
