            "briefSummary": "This is a monocentric, observational clinical trial investigating the effect of Esketamine on brain network activity and a belief updating task in people with depression. We investigate the immediate and the long-term effect (approx. 8 weeks) of Esketamine on EEG signals, pupillometry and belief updating and the relation of those effects on depressive symptomatology.",
            "detailedDescription": "The FDA approved the S-enantiomer of Ketamine in a nasal spray formulation (Esketamine, Spravato) in 2019 for treatment resistant depression in conjunction with an oral antidepressant. Albeit showing impressive short term clinical effects, the neurophysiological mechanism leading to clinical improvements are not understood. The investigators aim to add missing knowledge about the network dynamics of Esketamine in depression. Besides changes of neural signatures, Esketamine might impact cognitive processes like belief updating.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that people update their expectations of future life events after receiving novel information. The Belief Updating Task (BUT) measures this belief update in reaction to new information. Healthy individuals have been shown to update their beliefs \"optimistically\", making larger changes in their expectations in response to good news. Individuals with depression lack this optimistic belief update bias. Therefore, the investigators also aim to examine if Esketamine treatment reinstates the optimistic bias, how those changes are mediated by neurophysiological changes during the task and if a change in belief updated is related to a change of depressive symptoms.\n\nThe first session takes place at the start of the Esketamine treatment period, whereas the second experimental session is conducted closer to the end of the treatment period. In both experimental sessions, EEG/pupillometry and cognitive measurements are taken before and after Esketamine administration. Analyses will assess pre/post Esketamine effects within a session and between two sessions."
