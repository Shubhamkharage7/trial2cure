The trial will be single blinded in regard to wound healing assessment (another clinician, other than the investigator at each site will assess wound healing) and confirmation of wound healing will be overseen by an independent adjudication committee made up of wound care experts. The study will last twelve weeks, with a two week screening period prior to enrollment.\n\nThere are two standard of care arms in the study:\n\nArm 1: The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting \\[TCC\\] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM), appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement) and wound care covering with bioactive resorbable glass fiber, MIRRAGEN\u2122 Advanced Wound Matrix, followed by a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compressive wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).\n\nARM 2: The SOC therapy in the study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting \\[TCC\\] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM), appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement) and wound care covering with calcium alginate Fibracol dressing follwed by a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compressive wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent)."

At randomization subjects must have a target diabetic foot ulcer with a minimum surface area of 1.0 cm2 and a maximum surface area of 20.0 cm2 measured post debridement with a photographic planimetry app.\n4. The target ulcer must have been present for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks of standard of care prior to the initial screening visit.\n5. The target ulcer must be located on the foot with at least 50% of the ulcer below the malleolus.\n6. The target ulcer must be full thickness on the foot or ankle that does not probe to bone.\n7. Adequate circulation to the affected foot as documented by any of the following methods performed within 3 months of the first screening visit:\n\n   1. TCOM \u226530 mmHg\n   2. ABI between 0.7 and 1.3\n   3. PVR: Biphasic\n   4. TBI \u02c30.6\n   5. As an alternative arterial Doppler ultrasound can be performed evaluating for biphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the level of the ankle\n8. If the subject has two or more ulcers, they must be separated by at least 2 cm. The largest ulcer satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be designated as the target ulcer.\n9. Target ulcers located on the plantar aspect of the foot must be offloaded for at least 14 days prior to randomization.\n10. The subject must consent to using the prescribed off-loading method for the duration of the study.\n11. The subject must agree to attend the weekly study visits required by the protocol.\n12. The subject must be willing and able to participate in the informed consent process.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. A subject known to have a life expectancy of \\< 6 months is excluded.\n2. If the target ulcer is infected or if there is cellulitis in the surrounding skin, the subject is excluded.\n3. Presence of osteomyelitis or exposed bone, probes to bone or joint capsule on investigator's exam or radiographic evidence.\n4. A potential subject cannot have an infection in the target ulcer or in a remote location that requires systemic antibiotic therapy.\n5. A subject receiving immunosuppressants (including systemic corticosteroids at doses greater than 10 mg of Prednisone per day or equivalent) or cytotoxic chemotherapy is excluded.\n6. The topical application of steroids to the ulcer surface within one month of initial screening is not permitted.\n7. A subject with a previous partial amputation on the affected foot is excluded if the resulting deformity impedes proper offloading of the target ulcer.\n8. If a subject has a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than or equal to 12% taken at or within 3 months of the initial screening visit he/she is excluded.\n9. If a subject has a serum creatinine \u2265 3.0mg/dL within 6 months of randomization he/she is excluded.\n10. The subject is excluded if the surface area measurement of the target ulcer has reduced in size by more than 30% in the 2 weeks prior to the initial screening during the 2-week screening phase: the 2 weeks from the initial screening visit (SV1) to the TV1/randomization visit during which time the subject received SOC.\n11. A subject with an acute Charcot foot, or an inactive Charcot foot, that impedes proper offloading of the target ulcer is excluded.\n12. Women who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant within the next 6 months are excluded.\n13. A potential subject with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis is excluded.\n14. A subject who participated in a clinical trial involving treatment with an investigational product within the previous 30 days is excluded.\n15. A subject who, in the opinion of the Investigator, has a medical or psychological condition that may interfere with study assessments is excluded.\n16. A subject treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a Cellular and/or Tissue Product (CTP) in the 30 days prior to the initial screening visit is excluded.",
