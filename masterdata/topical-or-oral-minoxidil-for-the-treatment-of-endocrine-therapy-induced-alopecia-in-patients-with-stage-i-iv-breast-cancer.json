            "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial studies the possible benefits and/or side effects of topical or oral minoxidil in treating endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (alopecia) in patients with stage I-IV breast cancer. Endocrine therapy-induced alopecia (EIA) is a distressing side effect that leads to reduced quality of life and early cessation of therapy in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Patients on endocrine therapy commonly report hair loss or thinning. Minoxidil is a drug that may promote hair growth and reduce hair loss. Oral minoxidil may increase hair density in women with EIA, and work the same as topical minoxidil in treating EIA in patients with breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of low-dose oral minoxidil in patients with breast cancer and EIA.\n\nII. To obtain preliminary data to support whether low-dose oral minoxidil is a reasonable alternative to topical minoxidil in patients with EIA.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients apply minoxidil foam topically to affected areas of the scalp once daily (QD) for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive minoxidil orally (PO) QD for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
