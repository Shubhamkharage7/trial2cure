            "briefSummary": "In the United States, the growing Hispanic/Latino population is at high risk for type 2 diabetes and associated complications, yet underserved in healthcare and underrepresented in research. The purpose of this Sansum Diabetes Research Institute (SDRI) study is to create an HbA1c testing and support closed-loop system for U.S. Hispanic/Latino families. This loop will integrate Abbott's point-of-care (POC) technology with SDRI's Community Scientist Model to contact, test, intervene, and monitor Latinos with or at risk of type 2 diabetes for HbA1c levels. This study is built on prior work using specially trained Hispanic/Latino Community Scientists/Especialistas to support engagement with and encourage adherence to American Diabetes Association guidelines for HbA1c testing among Hispanic/Latino adults with type 2 diabetes. The study is an unblinded, nonrandomized, two arm self-controlled single center study. It is anticipated to run over 24 months and enroll 750 participants, in whom HbA1c will be measured over 6 months. This study will provide unique data on the burden of type 2 diabetes for Hispanic/Latino adults in Santa Barbara County, CA. In addition, the closed-loop approach will provide proof-of-concept evidence for scaling this approach to the larger Hispanic/Latino community to reduce the risk of poor outcomes due to type 2 diabetes and now COVID-19.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hypothesis: Adoption of the SDRI Community Scientist/Especialista model will improve adherence to ADA recommended guidelines for HbA1c testing for Hispanic/Latino adults with T2D.\n\nParticipants known to have or considered to have diabetes by the Principal Investigator (PI) will be offered enrollment in the study, and their HbA1c will be tested using the Afinion HbA1c point-of-care analyzer. The subjects will be stratified into two groups: HbA1c \\<7.5 and HbA1c \u22657.5%. All other potential participants (unknown diabetes diagnosis) will be tested for HbA1c as the site standard practice. All participants with HbA1c \\<7.5 will be followed up at 6 months; those with HbA1c \u22657.5% will be followed up at 3 months and again at 6 months post enrollment. Participants with HbA1c \u22657.5% will be invited to participate in SDRI's existing educational programs.\n\nTherapy will be provided as per standard of care by the participant's treating physician and is out of the scope of this proposal. Those with an HbA1c at or above 7.5% will be offered diabetes education and support through the tele-health platform and/or in person. Participants not known to have diabetes but with an HbA1c result \\>6.4% will be referred to a local provider for further evaluation and possible diagnosis of diabetes."
