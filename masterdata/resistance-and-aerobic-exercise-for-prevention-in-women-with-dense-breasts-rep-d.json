Participants will be placed into one of two study groups: Exercise Training Group vs. Waitlist Control Group. Randomization means that a participant is put into a group by chance.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and baseline and end of study assessments which include: breast biopsies, assessment of physical activity habits, aerobic and strength testing, blood draws and questionnaires.\n\nParticipants randomized to the exercise group will be expected to participate in exercise sessions throughout the study. They will also be asked to complete logs of their activity.\n\nParticipants will be in this research study for up to 16 weeks.\n\nIt is expected that 46 women will take part in this study.\n\nThe Breast Cancer Research Foundation is supporting this research study by providing funding."

Investigators are only enrolling English-speaking participants to this study at this time due to the fact that investigators currently only have English-speaking exercise trainers with the proper qualifications to conduct the exercise training\n* Written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Self-reported inability to walk 2 blocks (at any pace)\n* Prior history of breast cancer; prior DCIS is allowable as long as participant is not taking endocrine therapy and has at least 1 breast that has not been irradiated\n* On oral or implantable hormonal contraceptives, postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, a selective estrogen receptor modulator or an aromatase inhibitor; Mirena or other IUD is acceptable\n* Consistent strength training in the past 3 months\n* Use of weightloss drugs\n* Cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate exercise. Examples would include unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis requiring imminent joint replacement. Moderate arthritis that does not preclude physical activity is not a reason for ineligibility\n* Psychiatric disorders or conditions that would preclude participation in the study intervention (e.g. untreated major depression or psychosis, substance abuse, severe personality disorder)",
