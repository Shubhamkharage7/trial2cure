This pilot study will be conducted in two stages. In the treatment development stage, we will recruit n=10 older individuals age \u226565 with poor sleep health (\u2264 7 on the Ru-SATED self-report questionnaire) to assess acceptability and tailor the sleep health enhancement intervention for older adults. In the pilot study stage to assess preliminary efficacy of the tailored sleep health enhancement intervention, n=30 older adults with poor sleep health will be randomly assigned to a 4-week 1x/week, telehealth-delivered sleep health enhancement intervention or to a wait-list control condition. Participants will wear wrist-worn actigraphy, complete sleep, frailty, and quality of life questionnaires at baseline and reassessments."
