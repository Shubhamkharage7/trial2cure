            "detailedDescription": "Use of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS), which are noncombustible tobacco products (e.g., e-cigarettes), has increased dramatically among youth and is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes as well as use of alcohol and other illicit substances. National guidelines recommend counseling to address tobacco use at every adolescent clinical visit; however, many at-risk adolescents do not routinely attend primary care. Although evidence supports treatment of tobacco use during an adult hospitalization, no interventions have been developed or tested in the pediatric hospital setting. Based on promising theoretically-based evidence from the primary care and hospital settings, we will design, iteratively refine and assess implementation of a novel tobacco and ENDS use intervention for hospitalized adolescents and young adults (AYAs). We do so by conducting a randomized controlled pilot study (n=144) with 3-month follow up to evaluate preliminary efficacy as well as implementation outcomes (i.e., acceptability, feasibility, fidelity)."
