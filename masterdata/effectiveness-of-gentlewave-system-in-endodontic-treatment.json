            "detailedDescription": "New irrigation modalities such as the GentleWave\u00ae System, which integrates advanced multisonic ultrasound technology, have been developed to overcome limitations and improve root canal treatments success rates, by ensuring comprehensive cleaning while minimizing mechanical instrumentation. This system, featuring CleanFlow technology, optimizes the delivery of irrigants and promotes efficient root canal debridement. Postoperative pain is common, usually peaking within the first 24 hours after treatment and decreasing thereafter.\n\nIn the presence of necrosis, microorganisms can colonize anatomical complexities, such as isthmuses, ramifications and dentinal tubules causing symptoms such as pain, inflammation, and in some cases even odontogenic sinusitis. Conventional Syringe Irrigation (CSI), which delivers irrigants (NaOCl, EDTA) through a needle-syringe system, often fails to reach the entire working length and the intricate anatomy of the root canal. This inadequacy can result in residual bacteria and necrotic tissue, potentially compromising treatment efficacy and increasing the risk of treatment failure; furthermore, positive pressure exerted during CSI may cause the extrusion of irrigants beyond the apex, leading to complications."
