While stent therapy, when feasible, is the standard of care for coarctation, it may not completely improve the work (and afterload) of the heart due to its effects on the elasticity of the aorta. This study will provide the information needed to understand the effects of current management on the cardiac mechanics and work."

When Ea/Ees ratio is approximately equal to 1.0, LV and arterial system are optimally coupled to produce stroke work, a measure of the efficiency of LV work, corresponding to the product of systolic arterial pressure and stroke volume, and related to oxygen consumption. When Ea/Ees ratio is \\<1.0, the stroke work remains close to optimal values, but when EA/EES ratio is \\>1.0, the stroke work significantly falls, and the LV becomes progressively less efficient.
