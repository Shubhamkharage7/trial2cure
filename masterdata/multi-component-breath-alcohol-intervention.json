The multimodal intervention will be made up of brief telehealth counseling and psychoeducation and use of three mobile technologies to facilitate moderate drinking. In the first stage of the study, we will conduct formative research to obtain input from the study population, test initially the telehealth version of the brief counseling and psychoeducation and to develop a simple, \"low tech\" approach to coaching participants to use the three mobile technologies in typical drinking situations. Participation will last approximately one month."

Report having consumed at least one alcoholic drink during a minimum of 12 days out of the prior 30 so that subjects will have multiple opportunities to use the moderate drinking technologies during the intervention period.\n5. Meet, at minimum, DSM-5 criteria for a mild alcohol use disorder (i.e., meet at least 2 diagnostic criteria)\n6. Self-report interest in using a smartphone app to help reduce drinking with a score of at least 3 on a 0-10 scale indicating at least a degree of openness to using technology to moderate drinking.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nNo subject may:\n\n1. Have been in inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment within the past 12 months\n2. Have used a smartphone application to facilitate moderate drinking more than 1 time within the past 12 months\n3. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current substance use disorder with the exception of tobacco use disorder, mild or moderate alcohol use disorder or mild cannabis use disorder.\n4. History of alcohol withdrawal or medically-assisted detoxification as individuals with this history will likely be in need of more intensive treatment than is offered in this study.\n5. Be psychotic or otherwise severely psychiatrically disabled\n6.
