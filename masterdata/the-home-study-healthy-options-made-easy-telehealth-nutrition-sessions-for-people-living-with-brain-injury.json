            "briefSummary": "Brain injury is a leading cause of disability in the United States. When survivors of brain injury recover from the initial injury and return home to live in the community, they often face chronic health conditions that warrant nutrition therapy, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and overweight and obesity. Typically, these individuals do not receive nutrition counseling.\n\nThus, the purpose of this clinical trial is to compare changes in diet quality between community-dwelling individuals with a history of brain injury who receive three individualized nutrition therapy sessions versus handouts only.\n\nOur research question is:\n\nCan nutrition counseling improve dietary intake among this population?\n\nParticipants will complete a survey, participate in three days of dietary recalls via Zoom or telephone, and receive either three individualized nutrition counseling sessions with a Registered Dietitian or standard of care (handouts).\n\nResearchers will compare the diets of the recipients of the nutrition counseling to a control group who receives nutrition handouts to see if nutrition sessions with a Registered Dietitian improve dietary intake.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of providing nutrition therapy on diet among a cohort of community-dwelling individuals with a history of brain injury.\n\nIn this pre/post study, 134 participants with brain injury will be recruited and randomized to the control or intervention group. All participants will complete a standard set of nutrition-related questionnaires to assess weight status, co-morbid conditions, food security, stressors, stress-related eating, eating behaviors, and diet quality.\n\nThe control group will receive a packet of nutrition education materials. The intervention group will receive the packet and one-on-one nutrition counseling with a Registered Dietitian.\n\nFollow-up data collection will include repeating the dietary recalls and questionnaires. This will allow for an evaluation of the impact of nutrition therapy on diet quality among community-dwelling individuals with brain injury.\n\nAim: Evaluate the effectiveness of providing nutrition therapy on diet quality and stress-related eating among a cohort of community-dwelling individuals with brain injury\n\n\u2022 Ho: Individuals who receive three nutrition therapy sessions with a Registered Dietitian will have greater increases in Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores than those who receive only handouts (current practice)."

Because individuals with brain injury may not do their own grocery shopping and meal preparation, caregivers will be encouraged to attend sessions. Checklists will be used to ensure treatment fidelity across participants and nutrition sessions.
