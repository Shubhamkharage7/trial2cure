The hypothesis of this study is that mosunetuzumab can be safely combined with platinum-based salvage chemotherapy in this patient population, and that this approach may outperform chemoimmunotherapy approaches that instead incorporate rituximab retreatment. The enrolling physician's choice of the chemotherapy backbone will determine a patient's assigned study arm (Arm A = DHAX, Arm B = ICE). The two arms will accrue patients to phase Ib and expansion cohorts as well as be analyzed independently."

There are no restrictions on the timing of CSF studies via lumbar puncture and/or neuroimaging performed for routine staging of patients without CNS signs or symptoms, or if performed for reasons unrelated to lymphoma evaluation.\n* Current or recent history (within the last 6 months) of clinically relevant CNS disease or pathology, such as stroke, epilepsy, CNS vasculitis, or neurodegenerative disease.\n* Clinically significant toxicity (other than alopecia) from prior treatment that has not resolved to grade \u2264 1 per NCI CTCAE v 5.0 prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to prednisone (\\> 20 mg), azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents within 2

by PCR to be eligible for study participation.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status.\n* History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n* Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study:\n* Patients must not receive live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) while receiving study treatment or after the last dose until B cell recovery to the normal ranges.\n* Other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, with the exception of the following:\n\n  * Any of the following malignancies previously curatively treated: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, good-prognosis ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, basal or squamous cell skin cancer.\n  * Stage I melanoma, low grade, early stage localized prostate cancer, or any other previously treated malignancy that has been in remission without treatment for \\>2 years prior to enrollment.\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring treatment.\n* History of autoimmune disease, including, but not limited to, myocarditis,

for 12 months may be eligible to enroll if judged to be safe by the investigator.\n  * Patients with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid-replacement hormone are eligible.\n  * Patients with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on an insulin regimen are eligible for the study.\n  * Patients with a history of disease-related immune thrombocytopenic purpura, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia may be eligible.\n* Evidence of any significant, uncontrolled concomitant disease that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including, but not limited to, significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or unstable angina) or significant pulmonary disease (such as obstructive pulmonary disease or history of bronchospasm).\n* Major surgical procedure other than for diagnosis within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or anticipation of a major surgical procedure during the study.\n* Pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant during the study:\n\n  \\*Women of childbearing potential must have one negative serum pregnancy test result (minimum sensitivity, 25 mIU/mL) within seven days of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory
