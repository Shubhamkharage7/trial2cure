As a result, they typically have lower grade-point averages, more course failures and withdrawals, are more likely to be placed on academic probation and are less likely to graduate from college than students without ADHD. The purpose of this project is to refine and test a psychological intervention on campus to help students with ADHD develop these self-management skills so that they can be more successful in college and avoid these negative outcomes."
