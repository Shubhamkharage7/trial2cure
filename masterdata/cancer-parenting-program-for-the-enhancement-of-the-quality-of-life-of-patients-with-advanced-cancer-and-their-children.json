The programs are designed to enhance the quality of the parent-child relationship and add to the parent's confidence in managing the impact of their cancer on their child. Educational programs may reduce anxiety and depression and improve the well-being and quality of life of parents with advanced cancers and their children.\n\nRecruitment occurs nationally via referral to the Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium team.",
