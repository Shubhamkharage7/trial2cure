To estimate overall survival in patients with recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma being treated with LB-100 and dostarlimab, including specific survival probabilities at 6 and 12 months.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To describe clinically significant and immune related adverse events (ir-AEs) in the study population.\n2. To determine the objective response rate (ORR), time to initial response, progression free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR) using modified RECIST v1.1 criteria.\n\n   a. Although the clinical benefit of these drugs has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.\n3. Translational:\n\n   1. To describe PP2A activity and immune changes, using baseline and on-treatment tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\n   2. To describe expression of mismatch repair proteins using immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n   3. To correlate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels with response by modified RECIST v1.1 criteria."

Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade 2 from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria.\n\n   1. Subjects with Grade 2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the principal investigator.\n   2.

Any medical, social, or psychological condition that would interfere with evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of participant safety or study results.\n13. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen, or HBsAg, result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).\n\n    1.

Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 180 days after the last dose of treatment\n\n    a. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the investigational agents have unknown teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is also an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\n21. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients\n22. Unresolved partial or complete small or large bowel obstruction\n23.
