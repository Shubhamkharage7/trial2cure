The patients' own cancer cells collected after surgery are combined into a vaccine to produce an immune response that significantly increases the number of cancer neoantigen-specific effector T cell precursors in the patient's body. These cancer neoantigen-specific T cells are harvested from the blood, subsequently stimulated and expanded, and infused back into the patient.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized study is designed to compare the combination of TVI-Brain-1 immunotherapy and standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone as a treatment for newly diagnosed MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma patients. The general procedures include the collection and testing of cancer tissue samples after surgery and chemoradiation therapy (radiation and temozolomide). For the patients randomized into the investigational study treatment group, they will also receive two vaccinations created from their own cancer cells, undergo leukapheresis to collect immune T-cells from their blood, and transfer of those activated effector T-cells after chemoradiation therapy. All patients are followed with MRIs at follow-up visits."
