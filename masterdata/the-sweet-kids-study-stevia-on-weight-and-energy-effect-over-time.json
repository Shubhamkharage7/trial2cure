            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study will be an 8 to14-week three-arm randomized controlled blinded trial in children ages 8 to12 years from the Central, Arkansas region. Children with normal weight (BMI percentile \\<85th, n = 90) and excessive weight (BMI percentile \u226585th and \\<140% of the 95th, n =120) will consume either:\n\n1. Sucrose-sweetened beverage\n2. Stevia-sweetened beverage\n3. Calorie free flavored water beverage Participants with excessive weight will complete a 14-week intervention to assess both primary and secondary hypotheses. In parallel, normal weight participants will be enrolled with the objective of monitoring indicators of safety for steviol consumption through assessment of changes in metabolic function (glucoregulation and cardiometabolic) markers as well as assessment of shifts in gut microbial communities and steviol metabolism over 8 weeks"
