The investigators will ask questions about the health and eating behavior of the participants, and perform a brief physical examination. The investigators will collect saliva or blood to perform genetic testing from the participants and invite family members to enroll in the study.",

These subjects will be invited to participate in the study. After obtaining informed consent, the investigators will obtain history on the proband and the family, and perform a brief examination in addition to collecting genetic material.\n\nTargeted sequencing of genes associated with monogenic and syndromic forms of obesity will be performed using next-generation sequencing. In selected individuals with favorable family history, exome or whole genome sequencing will be performed. Functional analysis of newly identified variants will be performed where possible."
