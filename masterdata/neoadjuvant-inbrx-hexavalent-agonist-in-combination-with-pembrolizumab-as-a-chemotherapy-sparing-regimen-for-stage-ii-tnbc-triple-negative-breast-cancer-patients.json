            "detailedDescription": "A Simon 2-stage design is implemented to minimize exposure if the treatment regimen is futile. If feasibility is established with responses exceeding futility parameters, study will expand to stage 2. Additional arms may be introduced in a protocol amendment.\n\nBelow shows the sample size required using Simon's 2-stage design, 80% power and 5% one-sided significance level:\n\n* Null hypothesis: \\<5% pCR\n* Alternative hypothesis: \\>35% pCR\n* Stage I n (r\\*): 6 (0)\n* Stage I + II total n (r): 12 (2)\n* Criteria: Minimax\n* Minimum responses to proceed to stage II: 1\n\nNote: r\\* and r represents the threshold for declaring futility, i.e. greater than r\\* or r responses would be required to consider ongoing investigation.\n\nThe null hypothesis of 5% is based upon the assumption that virtually no subjects would experience pCR if the therapy was not effective. The alternative hypothesis of 35% is based upon the assumption that complete responses in the absence of chemotherapy in approximately one-third of subjects would be clinically meaningful, encouraging further development of the treatment paradigm.\n\nIf no responses are observed, a second feasibility run-in may be considered using a biomarker enrichment strategy (such as with the 27-gene IO score).\n\nThe arm will be terminated from further development if an unacceptable proportion of patients experience rapid clinical/radiographic progression (defined as progression of disease, or clinical evidence of progression), or other toxicities that interfere with curative-intent therapy, defined as \\>1/6 evaluable subjects in stage I or \\>2/12 in stage II, evaluated for each arm. This is a Pocock-type stopping boundary that yields the probability of cross the boundary at most 23% when the rate of dose-limiting toxicity is equal to 10%."

Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.\n\n    Acceptable methods of contraception presented below are in compliance with the Clinical Trial Facilitation and Coordination Group (CTFG) recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials, Version 1.1 (September, 2020). However, if a contraception method listed below is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception in that country/region. Local guidelines should be followed.\n    * Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: Oral. Intravaginal. Transdermal.\n    * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: Oral. Injectable.

(Only considered to be highly effective contraception if he is the sole sexual partner of the female patient of childbearing potential and if the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.)\n    * Sexual abstinence. (Only considered to be highly effective contraception if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and IRBs/IECs.\n11. Pre-menopausal women must have a negative urinary or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to start of treatment. If screening serum pregnancy test collected outside of 72 hours prior to start of treatment, this may be accepted for determination of eligibility, but must be re-checked prior to treatment C1D1. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n    * Women \\< 50 years of age are considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n    * Women \u2265 50 years of age are considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n12. TIL score \\> 1%.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Bilateral breast cancer.\n2.

Patients who have received these agents more than 3 years prior for other malignancies may be considered if they are not still at clinically significant risk of systemic recurrence in the opinion of the investigator.\n7. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n8. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n9. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in excess of prednisone 10mg daily or equivalent in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n10.

Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Has a known additional malignancy (other than their current breast cancer diagnosis) that is progressing or has required active systemic treatment within the past 3 years.\n\n    Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n17. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n18. Active infection requiring systemic therapy with the exception of UTI requiring oral antibiotic therapy and prophylactic anti-viral therapy (e.g. Acyclovir).\n19. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.\n20. Known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection.
