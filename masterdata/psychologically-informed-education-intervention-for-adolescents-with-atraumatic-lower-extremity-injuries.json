A set of psychosocial surveys assessing activity-related fear, stress, anxiety and depression will be completed by the participants. Participants will then complete self-report questionnaires assessing pain, quality of life and functional ability followed by an assessment of physical activity levels assessed with a wearable activity monitor;. Participants will then be randomized into one of two intervention groups (psychologically-informed video education group and a control group). After participants receive their assigned educational intervention, the self-report questionnaires will be re-administered. Participants with leg pain pain will then complete follow-up assessment of their psychological beliefs, pain, quality of life, physical activity levels, and self-reported functional ability through REDcap at 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year."

Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, the patient sample is composed of minors who are a protected patient population Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Aggregate data including sample means, standard deviations, frequencies and significance values will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and conference abstracts.
