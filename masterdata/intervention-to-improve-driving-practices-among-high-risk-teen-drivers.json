Teens will be aged 16-17 who committed a moving-related traffic violation and their parent/legal guardian who is most involved with their driving. Researchers will aim to determine the effects of the intervention on teens' risky driving events, unsafe driving behaviors, and traffic violation recidivism. Additionally, researchers will aim to determine the effects of the intervention on frequency and quality of parent-teen communications about safe driving practices."
