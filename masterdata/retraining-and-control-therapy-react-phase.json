            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess sense of control and catastrophic symptom expectations as targets for Retraining and Control Therapy (ReACT- an intervention focused on changing behaviors and thoughts) for treatment of pediatric psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES, episodes resembling epileptic seizures but with no correlated epileptiform activity). 11-18-year-olds diagnosed with PNES will engage in twelve sessions of either ReACT or supportive therapy. Sense of control over actions will be measured by the magic and turbulence task, a well-validated measure of sense of control. Participants will complete the cold pressor test (CPT) in which participants hold their hand in cool water for as long as possible up to 3 minutes. Catastrophic symptom expectations in response to the CPT will be measured by Pain Catastrophizing Scale for Children (PCS-C), pain tolerance (time with hand in water) and cortisol response. Target assessments occur 7 days before treatment, 7 days after 12th treatment session, and 2 months after the 12th treatment session. Long term follow-up assessments will occur 6 months and 12 months after the 12th treatment session. PNES frequency will be measured from 30 days before to 12 months after treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants with PNES and their parent come to our laboratory for a baseline visit and 4 follow-up visits. After the baseline visit, participants are randomized to 12 sessions of either Retraining and Control Therapy (ReACT) or supportive therapy. The first therapy session is in-person, and the following 11 sessions are completed via telehealth.\n\nDuring the baseline visit, participants and their parent complete several questionnaires assessing demographics, mood and suicidality, relationships with friends and family, as well as past and current PNES symptoms. They also complete the childhood trauma questionnaire. The treatment targets (sense of control and catastrophic symptom expectations) are measured by the magic and turbulence computer task and pain tolerance, PCS-C and cortisol response to the CPT, respectively. PNES diaries are completed to assess PNES frequency over the previous 30 days. The baseline lab visit lasts about 2.5 hours. Saliva is collected over 1 time point before and 3 time points after the CPT to measure cortisol response to the CPT. Participants also collect 2 saliva samples 24 hours later to serve as a baseline outside of the laboratory setting. Participants will also be given a Respironics Actiwatch Spectrum Pro to track sleep and PNES episode severity and frequency for the 1 week between the baseline visit and first therapy session.\n\nAfter the baseline visit, participants are scheduled to return in one week for their first of 12 intervention sessions of either ReACT or supportive therapy. This first session lasts a maximum of two hours, and the following 11 sessions are scheduled weekly and last one hour. The following 11 sessions are conducted as telehealth visits via HIPAA-compliant Zoom. Before beginning the first ReACT session, participants will complete the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention, List Sorting Working Memory, Pattern Comparison Processing Speed, Dimensional Change Card Sort, and Picture Sequence Memory subtests. Participants will be mailed another Respironics Actiwatch Spectrum Pro before the 11th therapy session to track sleep and PNES episode severity and frequency for the 2 weeks between the 11th therapy session and the lab visit one week after the 12th treatment session.\n\nFollow-up at 7 days after treatment and 2 months after treatment also is conducted to perform tasks and complete follow-up assessment of the targets (sense of control and catastrophic symptom expectations), PNES frequency, and questionnaires. Each of these sessions last 2 hours. Participants will complete the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention, List Sorting Working Memory, Pattern Comparison Processing Speed, Dimensional Change Card Sort, and Picture Sequence Memory subtests at the lab visit at each of these visits. Participants will be mailed and asked to collect 2 saliva samples 1 day before they come in for their follow-up lab visit occuring 7 days after treatment. Participcants will complete 2 Zoom visits at 6 months and 12 months after treatment to assess long-term PNES outcomes and questionnaire data. These appointments will last 1 hour. PNES frequency will be measured from 30 days before treatment to 12 months after treatment through PNES diaries completed by the parent and the participant.\n\nParticipants will be offered the treatment to which they were not randomized after the 2-month follow-up when the study is completed.\n\nAfter treatment, booster therapy sessions will be offered as needed.\n\nHealthy controls will be recruited. Healthy controls and their parent come for a baseline laboratory visit and a follow up visit 13 weeks after the baseline visit. The baseline and follow-up appointments for healthy controls will be identical to the visits for children with PNES."
