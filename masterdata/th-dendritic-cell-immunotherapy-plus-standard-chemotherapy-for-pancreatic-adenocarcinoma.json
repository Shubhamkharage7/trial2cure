Those who are Hepatitis B sAb positive as well as those who are Hepatitis C Ab positive but Hepatitis C RNA viral load negative will not be excluded.\n* Patients with any active autoimmune disease or immune deficiency or previous Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g. patient with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are eligible provided all of the following conditions are met: rash must cover \\< 10% of body surface area; disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical corticosteroids; no occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high-potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months.\n\nStep 2 Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Provision of signed and dated informed consent form for Step 2\n* Must have completed standard neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, as deemed by Investigator.\n* Must have completed standard care within 3 months of step 2 registration.\n* Must have adequate tissue obtained from surgery, as determined and confirmed by Dr. Decker.\n* Adequate kidney, liver, bone marrow function, and immune function, as follows, within 28 days prior to step 2 registration: Hemoglobin greater than/equal to 8 gm/dL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than/equal to 1,500 cells/mm3; Platelet count greater than/equal to 75,000/mm3; Total bilirubin less than/equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN); Aspartate transaminase AST (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase ALT (SGPT) less than/equal to 2.5 times the ULN; TSH range between 0.4-4.0 mIU/L; RF less than/equal to 15 IU/ml.\n* Negative Hepatitis B and C serology. Positive HBs Ab indicating immunity is not exclusionary. Those who are Hepatitis B sAb positive as well as those who are Hepatitis C Ab positive but Hepatitis C RNA viral load negative will not be excluded.\n* ECOG performance status less than/equal to 2\n* For women of child bearing potential (WOCBP): At the time or (or prior to) registration to Step 2, use of highly effective contraception must be discussed with participant. NOTE: Patient must agree to start contraception at least 30 days before first vaccination and continue for at least 12 weeks after his/her last vaccination.\n* WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy within 28 days of registration to step 2.\n* For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure effective contraception with partner during study participation and for an additional 12 weeks following discontinuations of last vaccination.\n* Patient must agree to not donate blood for up to 90 days after last vaccination.\n\nStep 2 Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of nonstandard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, as determined by the Investigator.\n* Female patients who are pregnant, breast feeding, or of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test within 28 days of registration to Step 2 (or decline contraception requirements as outlined above). Post-menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.\n* Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or provide informed consent.\n* Any severe or uncontrolled medical condition or other condition that could affect participation in this study (in the opinion of the investigator), including but not limited to: hyper/hypothyroidism, active systemic autoimmune disorders, untreated viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis.\n* Treatment with a systemic steroid or with any systemic immunosuppressive agent within 7 days of step 2 registration.",
