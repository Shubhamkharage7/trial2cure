MSK has developed a standard (\"optimized\") practice for cord blood transplant (CBT). This optimized practice includes how patients are evaluated for transplant, the conditioning treatment (standard chemotherapy and total body irradiation therapy) given to prepare the body for transplant, the amount of stem cells transplanted, and how patients are followed during and after transplant.The purpose of this study is to collect information about participant outcomes after CBT following MSK's optimized practice. The researchers will look at outcomes of the CBT treatment such as side effects, disease relapse, GVHD, and immune system recovery after CBT treatment."

High resolution 8-allele HLA typing and recipient HLA antibody profile will be performed. Unit selection will occur based on HLA-match, total nucleated cell (TNC) and CD34+ cell dose adjusted per patient body weight. The bank of origin will also be considered. Donor specific HLA antibodies, if present, will also be taken into consideration and may influence the selection of the graft.\n\n* Each CB unit must be at least 3/8 HLA-matched to the patient considering high-resolution 8-allele HLA typing. \\[Taken from the Cord Blood Summary\\]\n* Each CB unit will be required to have a cryopreserved TNC dose of at least 1.5 x 10\\^7 TNC/ recipient body weight (TNC/ kg). \\[Taken from the Cord Blood Summary\\]\n* Each CB unit will be required to have a cryopreserved CD34+ cell dose of at least 1.5 x 10\\^5 CD34+ cells/ recipient body weight (CD34+ cells/kg). \\[Taken from the Cord Blood Summary\\]\n* A minimum of one unit will be reserved as a backup graft. \\[Taken from the Cord Blood Summary\\]\n* Each CB unit will be required to be cryopreserved in standard cryovolume (24-27 ml/s per unit or per bag if unit in two bags) and be red blood cell depleted. \\[Taken from the Cord Blood Summary\\]\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of myelofibrosis or other malignancy with moderate-severe bone marrow fibrosis.\n* Patients persistent with CNS involvement in CSF or CNS imaging at time of screening\n* Prior checkpoint inhibitors/ blockade in the last 12 months.\n* Two prior stem cell transplants of any kind.\n* One prior autologous stem cell transplant within the preceding 12 months.\n* Prior allogeneic transplantation.\n* Prior involved field radiation therapy that would preclude safe delivery of 400cGy TBI in the opinion of Radiation Oncology.\n* Active and uncontrolled infection at time of transplantation.\n* HIV infection.\n* Seropositivity for HTLV-1.\n* Inadequate performance status/ organ function.\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding.\n* Patient or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the treatment protocol including appropriate supportive care, long-term follow-up, and research tests.",
