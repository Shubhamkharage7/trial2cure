Three to six participants may be treated at each dose.\n\nThe maximum number of participants to be enrolled in the study is 27.\n\nThe clinical study treatment will be administered, following a CSF flow study, on an outpatient basis by the clinical study physician.\n\nParticipants will be followed for up to 12 months after the clinical study drug is administered.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved 186RNL for this specific disease."
