The study will be conducted in two parts; Part 1 will enroll participants with superficial lesions and Part 2 will enroll participants with visceral lesions.",
            "detailedDescription": "This Phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) study will: 1) evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and preliminary clinical activity of ANK-101 administered as an intratumoral (IT) injection in participants with superficial or visceral lesions; and 2) determine the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of ANK-101.\n\nFor both parts, the study design consists of six sequential dose-escalation cohorts and an expansion cohort at the RDE. Part 1 will enroll participants with advanced solid tumors, with cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal disease (accessible by clinical palpation or ultrasound guidance). Part 2 will start once the DLT period of dose level 1 in Part 1 is completed and dose level 2 is opened. Part 2 will enroll participants with visceral disease (accessible by interventional radiology or endoscopic techniques). Participants in Part 2 may also have superficial lesions that can be injected if in the Investigator's opinion this is clinically indicated.\n\nTen participants will be dosed in a Part 1 dose expansion cohort at the RDE, and in Part 2, the dose expansion cohort at the RDE will include 10 participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."
