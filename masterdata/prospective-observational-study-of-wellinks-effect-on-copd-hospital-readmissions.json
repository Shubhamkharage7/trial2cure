            "detailedDescription": "Wellinks, an integrated virtual COPD management solution consists of a combination of health coaching, Bluetooth-connected devices, collection of patient-reported symptoms and medication use, and virtual pulmonary rehabilitation, all centralized by the use of a mobile-phone application (mobile app) downloaded onto a study participant's iOS (iPhone) or Android device. The clinical objectives of this study are to determine whether utilization of Wellinks can reduce the rate of hospital readmissions due to a COPD exacerbation for patients recently discharged from the hospital. The nonclinical objectives of this study are to describe the experience of study participants using Wellinks through the assessment of engagement with the components of Wellinks, as well as by participant-reported satisfaction and perceived value (e.g., willingness to pay). Qualitative feedback on the features and functionality of Wellinks will be solicited."
