            "detailedDescription": "This large, multi-center randomized controlled trial will compare two multi-component postpartum care models via hybrid type 1 design conducted in two phases. An initial phase (phase 1) will collect baseline data and ensure patient input into final study. In phase 2, women will be randomized. Comparators are evidenced- based approaches: (1) an intensive in-person education with virtual education via push notifications using an electronic health record web portal; (2) a telehealth model using serial encounters. The \"push\" approach using notifications directly contrasts with the \"pull\" approach using telehealth visits. Both models include home visit programs. The study population includes patients delivering in two urban, inner-city health systems: Parkland (Dallas, TX) and Grady Memorial (Atlanta, GA). The primary outcome is time from hospital discharge to diagnosis and treatment of a composite of complications in the first 6 weeks. Based upon pilot data, 2349 women will demonstrate a 40% reduction (9 to 5.4 days) with 80% power and two-sided alpha of 0.05. 3500 women will be enrolled (1000 in phase 1; 2500 in phase 2) with anticipated \\<5% attrition at 6 weeks. Inclusion will be women who deliver liveborn infants. Secondary outcomes include mental health disorders, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, patient knowledge, quality of life and satisfaction, provider satisfaction, and social determinants of health. Women will be followed for one year postpartum."
