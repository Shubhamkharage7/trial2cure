To test the efficacy of home medical visits by Family Medicine physicians specifically designed for patients with hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)\n2. To compare primary outcome of the patients randomly selected for home visits to similar patients receiving usual care in the clinical setting\n3. To understand the efficacy and impact of the home visit from the patient perspective\n\nStudy participant will receive usual care from a resident doctor in home. There will be (2) home visits conducted over the course of this study that will include a comprehensive assessment of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and social factors that may be impacting their health. Study participants will also be asked to complete several questionnaires related to their knowledge of chronic diseases, personal health management, and experience of the study home visits."
