Approximately 264 participants will be enrolled into one of three cohorts. Cohort 1 (including cohort 1b) will enroll approximately 126 RRMM subjects with \u2265 3 prior anti-myeloma treatment regimens. Cohort 2a will enroll approximately 39 MM subjects, with 1 prior anti-myeloma therapy including ASCT and with early relapse. Cohort 2b will enroll approximately 39 MM subjects with 1 prior anti-myeloma therapy not including ASCT and with early relapse. Cohort 2c will enroll approximately 30 MM subjects with inadequate response to ASCT during their initial anti-myeloma therapy. The cohorts will start in parallel and independently. Cohort 3 will enroll approximately 30 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) participants with suboptimal response to ASCT.",
