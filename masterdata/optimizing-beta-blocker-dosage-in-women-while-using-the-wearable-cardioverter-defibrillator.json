Heart rate (HR) will be continuously monitored by the WCD. Every two weeks a report showing daily HR trends will be emailed to the healthcare provider. The healthcare provider will also receive a HR control alert if the HR exceeds a predetermined threshold for 3 days in a row.\n\nBased on this information, clinicians should follow guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to add or titrate medication accordingly. The goal of these changes will be to achieve the average nighttime HR to recommended guidelines (\\<70 bpm) by the end of WCD use."
