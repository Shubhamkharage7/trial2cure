Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone as treatment options for this disease but the combination of these agents with isatuximab hasn't been approved."
