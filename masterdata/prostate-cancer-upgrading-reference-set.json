Upgrading is defined as: Gleason 3+4 or higher grade A secondary study endpoint is presence of prostate cancer beyond the prostate (pathologic T3 disease) at radical prostatectomy. (This finding may be considered as a rationale for treatment.) Evidence of pathologic stage T3 or higher disease will be assessed by the presence of: (1) seminal vesicle invasion or (2) positive surgical margins or (3) established extracapsular extension or (4) lymph node involvement by tumor. It should be noted that pathologic stage T3 disease, while generally portending a greater risk of disease recurrence, may not be an intrinsic feature of disease prognosis but can be an artifact of surgical technique. Nonetheless, a secondary risk assessment tool will include both a Gleason 7-10 endpoint plus any patients with pT3+ disease to a composite endpoint that could indicate disease best managed with treatment in lieu of active surveillance.Prostate cancer, confirmed on prostate biopsy, within two years of scheduled radical prostatectomy.\n\n2. Prostate cancer must be graded as Gleason 3+3 on the biopsy immediately prior to radical prostatectomy. (Secondary eligibility will be established on central review of pathology slides, and blocks if available, at Cornell Central Pathology Laboratory to confirm eligibility.) 3. Prostate cancer may have been detected on prior biopsy as well but must not be greater than Gleason 3+3. (Also requires Central Pathology Laboratory review.) 4. Slides must be available for Central Pathology Laboratory review on any biopsy showing prostate cancer. FFPE (formalin fixed paraffin embedded) blocks may also be requested if available.\n\n5. Patient must have selected radical prostatectomy as treatment for prostate cancer.\n\n6. Signed informed consent. 7. Blocks and/or slides from prostate biopsy and from radical prostatectomy must be available for analysis by Central Pathology laboratory.\n\n8.
