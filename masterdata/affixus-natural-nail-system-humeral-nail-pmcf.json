Relation of the events to implant, instrumentation and/or procedure should be specified.\n\nThe performance and clinical benefits will be evaluated by assessment of fracture/osteotomy healing and functional outcome of all enrolled study subjects.\n\nStudy Endpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\nThe primary endpoint is bone union after 12 months since surgery.\n\nSecondary endpoint:\n\nThe secondary endpoints will be evaluating functional outcomes (Range of Motion, \\& American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons questionnaire), quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), radiographic findings and adverse events including re-operation of all enrolled study subjects at the defined follow up time points."
