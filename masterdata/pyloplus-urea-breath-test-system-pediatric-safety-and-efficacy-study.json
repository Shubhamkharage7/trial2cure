Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. All children will be exposed to non-radioactive 13C-Urea with citric acid, and shall submit a stool sample.\n\nCenters will house a PyloPlus UBT Analyzer to document results. PyloPlus Analyzer results shall remain blinded to the investigator and treating physician. No patient management decisions should be made based on the investigational PyloPlus\u00ae UBT System.\n\nTreating physician will prescribe a H. Pylori Stool Antigen Test to Stool test at either LabCorp or Quest Diagnostic, for the patient, which will be used for diagnostic purposes by the ordering physician.\n\nTotal duration of study is anticipated to be approximately 6 months."
