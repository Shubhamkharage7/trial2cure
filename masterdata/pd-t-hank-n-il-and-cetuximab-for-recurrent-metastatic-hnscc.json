            "detailedDescription": "This research study is to test the safety and efficacy of the combination of PD-L1 t-haNK (modified immune cells), N-803 (a manufactured protein that stimulates the immune system), and cetuximab (a targeted antibody) in treating advanced head and neck cancer. PD-L1 t-haNK in combination with the immunotherapies, N-803 and cetuximab, may work together to increase the activity and durability of the NK cells in fighting cancer cells.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved PD-L1 t-haNK cells or N-803 as a treatment for advanced head and neck cancer, but the FDA has approved cetuximab as a treatment option for advanced head and neck cancer. This trial will test these agents in combination.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, Computed Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, blood tests, and electrocardiogram (ECGs).\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment every 2 weeks for at least 1 year and will be followed for up to 15 years, as the FDA requires for any participant who has received genetically modified cells.\n\nIt is expected that about 25 people will take part in this research study.\n\nImmunityBio is supplying PD-L1 t-haNK and N-803 for the study."
