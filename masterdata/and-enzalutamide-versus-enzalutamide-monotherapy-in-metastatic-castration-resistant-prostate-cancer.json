Abiraterone started in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) disease setting: \\< 12 months duration on abiraterone or failure to achieve PSA nadir of 0.2 ng/mL while taking abiraterone\n   2. Abiraterone started in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) disease setting: \\< 6 months duration on abiraterone or failure to achieve a PSA50 response\n7. Cohort B only - Patient must meet definition of responder to abiraterone by one of the following:\n\n   1. Abiraterone started in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) disease setting: \u2265 12 months duration on abiraterone and nadir PSA \\< 0.2 ng/mL\n   2. Abiraterone started in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) disease setting: \u2265 6 months duration on abiraterone and PSA50 response\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any history of brain metastases, prior seizure, conditions predisposing to seizure activity\n2.

Receipt of prior second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors (e.g. enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, proxalutamide). Receipt of first-generation AR antagonists (e.g. bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide) does not count towards this limit.\n4. Have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic castration-resistant setting (prior chemotherapy in the hormone-sensitive setting is allowed provided last dose was at least 6 months prior to first dose of study drug)\n5. Have received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks or five half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first administration of study drug\n6. Have received exogenous administration of testosterone therapy since discontinuation of abiraterone.\n7.
