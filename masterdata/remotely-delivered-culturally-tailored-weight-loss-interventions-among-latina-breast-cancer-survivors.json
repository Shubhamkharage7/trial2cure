            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates a remotely delivered, culturally tailored weight loss interventions in Latina breast cancer (BC) survivors. Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos, and among Latinas, BC is the leading cause of cancer death. An estimated 80% of Latinas in the United States have overweight/obesity, which is associated with poorer BC outcomes. However, few, if any, effective interventions exist to promote and maintain weight loss in Latina BC survivors. The development of an adaptive program that provides survivors the support they need, as opposed to what is typically available, is essential to reducing persistent inequities in cancer survivorship.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: This study includes a baseline run-in and randomized stage I and stage II studies.\n\nBASELINE: Participants receive written instructions and website link to an instructional video along with supportive materials including measuring tape, Aria wireless fidelity (WiFi)-enabled scale, and Actigraph accelerometer to be worn for 7 days at baseline. Patients also undergo blood sample collection at baseline.\n\nSTAGE I: Eligible participants from the baseline run-in are randomized to arm I or II.\n\nARM I: Participants participate in the online \u00a1Vida! program consisting of 26 health education online sessions, dietary modifications, and home-based exercise sessions on study. Participants receive supportive materials consisting of a Fitbit Aria scale, a Fitbit Luxe (or latest device), the Fitbit app, and access to the Cook for Your Life website on study. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.\n\nARM II: Participants participate in the online \u00a1Vida! program consisting of 26 health education online sessions, dietary modifications, and home-based exercise sessions on study. Participants receive supportive materials consisting of a Fitbit Aria scale, a Fitbit Luxe (or latest device), the Fitbit app, and access to the Cook for Your Life website on study. Participants also attend remote lifestyle health education sessions on study. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.\n\nSTAGE II: Participants who achieve \\>= 2% weight loss (responders) at week 4 will continue their assigned interventions in stage I. Participants who achieve \\< 2% weight loss (non-responders) at week 4 will be re-randomized to 1 of 4 arms. Participants who were assigned to arm I in stage I are randomized to arm III or IV. Participants who were assigned to arm II in stage I are randomized to arms V or VI.\n\nARM III: Participants receive interventions as in arm II.\n\nARM IV: Participants participate in the online \u00a1Vida! program consisting of 26 health education online sessions, dietary modifications, and home-based exercise sessions on study. Participants receive supportive materials consisting of a Fitbit Aria scale, a Fitbit Luxe (or latest device), the Fitbit app, and access to the Cook for Your Life website on study. Participants also attend remote lifestyle health education sessions and receive 14 30-minute individualized telephone health coaching sessions. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.\n\nARM V: Participants receive interventions as in arm IV.\n\nARM VI: Participants participate in the online \u00a1Vida! program consisting of 26 health education online sessions, dietary modifications, and home-based exercise sessions on study. Participants receive supportive materials consisting of a Fitbit Aria scale, a Fitbit Luxe (or latest device), the Fitbit app, and access to the Cook for Your Life website on study.
