            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests whether increased activity throughout the day can improve the chronic pain and associated symptoms that breast cancer survivors may experience after surgery. Staying active is a key factor of one's physical, mental, and social health and well-being. Moving more could also reduce pain and associated stress, anxiety, or depression. Using a fitness tracker may help patients to move around more, whether or not they choose to exercise. Information gathered from this study may help researchers learn how the use of a Fitbit tracker with health coaching may improve physical activity and reduce pain in young, Hispanic breast cancer survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility of a physical activity intervention in young, Hispanic women with chronic post-operative pain after breast surgery for invasive breast cancer, termed post breast surgery pain syndrome (PBSPS) for this study.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the preliminary efficacy of a physical activity intervention in decreasing pain in young, Hispanic women with PBSPS.\n\nII. To assess the preliminary efficacy of the physical activity intervention in increasing physical activity and improving health-related quality of life (hrQOL).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients wear a Fitbit and use the Fitbit application to monitor their physical activity daily in weeks 2-12 with the goal of increasing their number of steps per day and their number of active hours per day. Starting at week 2, patients also receive educational materials and attend 6 calls over 20-60 minutes each with their health coach in weeks 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11."
