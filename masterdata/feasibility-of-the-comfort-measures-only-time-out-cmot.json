            "briefSummary": "Nearly 25% of Americans die in intensive care units (ICUs). Most deaths in ICUs are expected and involve the removal of ventilator support, or palliative withdrawal of mechanical ventilation (WMV). Prior work by the Principal Investigator (PI) found that patient suffering can be common; with 30-59% of patients going through this process experiencing distress. Thus, experts and national organizations have called for evidence to inform guidelines for WMV. This research study will 1) develop and refine a Comfort Measures Only Time out (CMOT) intervention consisting of a structured time out with check-list protocol for the ICU team (nurse, physician, respiratory therapist) to improve the process of WMV. and 2) Pilot test the CMOT intervention in 4 ICUs (2 medical/2 surgical) among 40 WMV patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will field test an ICU team-based timeout and checklist intervention, the Comfort Measures Only Time Out (CMOT), in 6 cases with 2 ICU teams (3 cases/team) and then further refine based on ICU team and expert feedback to create a final version of the CMOT. Then pilot testing of the final CMOT intervention will occur in 4 ICUs (2 medical/2 surgical) among 40 WMV patients (20/ICU sub-type). There are two groups of human subjects for this study: 1) Patients (n=46)- eligibility criteria are: 1. age \u2265 18, 2. decision made for WMV by extubation (but not yet extubated). and 2) ICU clinicians (n= approximately 138) (ICU nurses, physicians/APPs, and respiratory therapists)- eligibility will include: 1. Age \\> 18, and 2. provision of direct care to the patient for at least 1-hour pre-extubation. Verbal consent will be obtained from ICU clinicians by the RA. During the preparation period, the research team will conduct seminars to inform the ICU team about the study recruitment and data collection procedures. Each morning during the 12-month recruitment period, a research assistant (RA) will ask the ICU team to identify potentially eligible patients.\n\nStudy Procedures:\n\nPilot-testing of the CMOT will be in 4 ICUs (2 medical/2 surgical) among 40 WMV patients (20 patients/ICU type). Feasibility will be assessed by: recruitment, protocol adherence, acceptability to providers (e.g. helpfulness, endorse future use), and outcome measurement: rates of distressful episodes/person time alive (primary outcome). Outcomes will be compared with OBSERVE-WMV historical controls to help inform the design of a larger trial.\n\nICU sites: The CMOT intervention will be delivered at the ICU team level in 2 medical ICUs (16 beds), and 2 surgical ICUs at BIDMC (22 beds). Each ICU will have a designated CMOT champion.\n\nICU provider training:\n\nThe RA will collaborate with the CMOT Champion to compile a list of 'targeted' providers for training including ICU nurses, physicians, residents/fellows, mid-level providers, and respiratory therapists expected to provide care in the ICU over the next 13 months. The list will be refreshed every 2 months to reach new staff. The goal will be to have all targeted providers complete either the in-person or online training seminar (see below) within one month from the initial start-up for \"prevalent\" providers, or from start time in the ICU for new providers. The RA will track provider participation based on seminar sign-in logs or online training completion (see below). Weekly reminders will be emailed to non-compliant providers. It is estimated there will be \\~50-60 targeted providers per ICU (20-25 nurses, 10-15 physicians, 10-15 fellows/resident physicians/mid-level providers, and 5 respiratory therapists). Provider involvement will be voluntary with verbal informed consent obtained during orientation."
