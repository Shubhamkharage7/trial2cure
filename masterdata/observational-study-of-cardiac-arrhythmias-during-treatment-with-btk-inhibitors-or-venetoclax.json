            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nBruton s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) are used to treat a form of leukemia. But taking BTKi can also increase a person s risk of developing an abnormal heart rhythm. This can cause sudden death. In this natural history study, researchers want to learn how BTKi affects the heart.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo identify and monitor the effects of BTKi on the heart.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 and older currently receiving or planning to receive BTKi or venetoclax.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants who have not yet started BTKi will have 2 required clinic visits: 1 before they start taking BTKi, and 1 about 6 months later. Participants who are already taking BTKi will have 1 required visit.\n\nParticipants will undergo multiple tests:\n\nA physical exam, including collection of blood and saliva.\n\nA test that measures heart activity via stickers placed on the chest.\n\nA test that uses sound waves to capture images of the heart.\n\nAn exercise stress test that monitors heart activity and blood pressure while the participant works on a treadmill or stationary bike. Sound wave images of the heart may also be taken while the participant exercises.\n\nStress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done in place of an exercise test. Participants will lie on a table that slides into a tube. They will be given drugs to stress the heart while images are taken.\n\nParticipants may wear a device to monitor their heart at home.\n\nParticipants may have repeat visits if they develop heart symptoms or if they need to stop taking BTKi. They will have follow-up phone calls each year for up to 3 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nPharmacologic therapy with BTK inhibitors (BTKi) is associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias which can lead to sudden death. There is currently no standard for cardiac screening or monitoring patients on BTKi. We hypothesize that thorough and routine comprehensive cardiac evaluations prior to starting therapy with BTKi and repeated during therapy with BTKi will result in earlier identification of cardiac arrhythmias with the goal of minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. In addition, venetoclax, a different standard therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, has not been associated with increased cardiac adverse events and could serve as a control group.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary objective: Identify, monitor, and analyze the arrhythmogenic effects of BTKi as well as sudden death\n\nSecondary objective: Assess the utility of different cardiac tests for identifying and monitoring cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving BTKi or venetoclax\n\nExploratory objective: To examine the relationship between the development of cardiac arrhythmias in patients on BTKi as it relates to other variables\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n-A composite endpoint of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death in patients starting a BTKi (Cohort A) and in patients already receiving BTKi (Cohort B).\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Detection of arrhythmias on devices (rest/stress EKG, ambulatory EKG monitor, KardiaMobile)\n* Arrhythmia (treatment emergent or worsening) in patients on BTKi\n* Sudden death in patients on BTKi\n* A composite endpoint of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death in patients starting venetoclax\n* Difference in cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death between different BTKi groups (e.g., ibrutinib vs. non-ibrutinib group)\n* Difference in cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death between BTKi and venetoclax groups\n\nExploratory endpoints:\n\n* Pharmacokinetic levels of BTKi\n* Duration of BTKi exposure\n* Cumulative BTKi dose\n* Genetic variants\n* Cardiac structural remodeling\n* Medical comorbidities\n* Concomitant medications\n* Substance use\n* Identify risk factors or biomarkers for arrhythmia"
