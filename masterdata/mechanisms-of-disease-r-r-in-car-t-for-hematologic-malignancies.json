Blood samples and accompanying health information (including PHI) may be collected from standard of care, non-significant risk, research-only procedures or obtained from our Division Research Repository and Database (Duke IRB Pro00006268) or DUHS Biospecimen Research and Biobanking protocol (Duke IRB Pro00035974). All hematologic malignancy patients treated with commercial CAR T products will be screened and enrolled for the study.\n\nThe investigators will perform multivariable regression to see if the number and function of MDSCs can be used as independent factors to predict disease relapse at 1 year after CAR T treatment, overall survival or progression-free survival. The studies will not require additional invasive procedure solely for the study.\n\nThe investigators will use blood samples that are performed as part of standard care. Therefore, no additional procedure is needed. The major potential risk associated with the study is the breach of confidentiality."
