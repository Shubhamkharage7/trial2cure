            "briefSummary": "Hypothesis: Use of a Free Water Protocol (FWP) will improve patient satisfaction scores (Dysphagia Handicap Index), will not increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, and will result in improved oral hygiene (as assessed by the Oral Assessment Guide). Aim: To demonstrate that improvement in patient satisfaction and quality of life scores outweighs the potential risks of aspiration of plain water in an acute care setting; to qualitatively assess the implementation of a Free Water Protocol from the viewpoints of the patient and family/caregivers; to quantify changes in oral hygiene practices for individuals on the Free Water Protocol.",
            "detailedDescription": "Individuals who have difficulty swallowing thin liquids are commonly restricted from ingesting plain water and prescribed a thickened liquid only diet to prevent choking hazards and aspiration pneumonia. These thickened liquids are intended to reduce aspiration of oral secretions carrying respiratory pathogens, the primary cause of aspiration pneumonia. This restriction from plain water (also known as thin water) can result in lowered patient satisfaction in addition to dissatisfaction with the texture and taste of thickened liquids. However, prior research from inpatient rehabilitation settings has demonstrated that plain water can be given to patients who otherwise require thickened liquids to prevent aspiration pneumonia. If patients prescribed a thickened liquid diet are allowed access to plain water, then hydration status may improve along with increased patient satisfaction.\n\nThis Free Water Protocol (FWP) differs from a thickened-liquids-only protocol in three ways: 1) allowing individuals access to plain, un-thickened water; 2) purposefully providing oral care prior to access of plain water; and 3) not allowing plain water until 30 minutes after meal completion and oral care has been completed with the intent to reduce the risk of pulmonary complications. Although many institutions have adapted and implemented an FWP, only 10 studies have measured pulmonary complications of an FWP. Among those, other outcomes are reported inconsistently with varying methodologies (e.g., fluid intake, hydration status, occurrences of urinary tract infection, satisfaction measures). More research is needed to demonstrate the benefits of allowing free water over the risk of potential pulmonary complications, especially in an acute care setting."
