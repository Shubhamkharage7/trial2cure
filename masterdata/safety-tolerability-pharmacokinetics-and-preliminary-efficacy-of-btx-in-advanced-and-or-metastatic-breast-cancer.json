The study includes a dose escalation part (Part A) where small groups of participants will receive increasing doses of BTX-9341 or BTX-9341 + fulvestrant followed by a dose expansion part (Part B) where participants will receive the dose of BTX-9341 selected in Part A + fulvestrant.",
            "detailedDescription": "This first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1 study of BTX-9341 is multicenter, nonrandomized, and open-label to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of BTX-9341 in participants with advanced and/or metastatic HR+/HER2 breast cancer. The study will include a dose escalation part (Part A) followed by a dose expansion part (Part B). During Part A, BTX-9341 will initially be dose escalated alone and then in combination with fulvestrant. A single combination therapy cohort of BTX-9341 + fulvestrant will be further explored in Part B. BTX-9341 will be administered orally in 28-day treatment cycles."
