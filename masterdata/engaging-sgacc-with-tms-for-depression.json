            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the responses of the brain region known as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in individuals with depression. Specifically, investigators aim to determine whether the sgACC is engaged when TMS is delivered to specific targets and if the engagement of sgACC changes throughout a full TMS treatment intervention. To achieve this goal, the investigators will employ a combination of TMS and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) procedures.\n\nStudy participation will include completing various questionnaires, clinical assessments, receiving a full transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment intervention (every weekday for 4-6 weeks), and undergoing MRI scans, both with and without concurrent TMS.",
            "detailedDescription": "Interested subjects will be asked to complete multiple questionnaires, a clinical interview, and a TMS demonstration to determine eligibility following the informed consent process.\n\nIf determined eligible, participants will proceed to undergo an MRI scan to generate their individualized TMS targets.The subsequent visit will involve the first MRI scanning session with concurrent TMS (TMS/fMRI), referred to as Baseline TMS/fMRI, along with the completion of multiple questionnaires.\n\nFollowing the Baseline TMS/fMRI session, participants will begin the TMS treatment phase. This phase comprises daily sessions (Monday to Friday) lasting 4-6 weeks, during which participants will receive rTMS treatments and complete various surveys.\n\nMidway through and upon completion of the TMS treatment intervention, two additional TMS/fMRI sessions will replicate the procedures conducted during the initial Baseline TMS/fMRI.\n\nRemote follow-up assessments at 1, 6, and 12 months post-treatment will evaluate any enduring improvements in clinical symptoms.\n\nParticipants will be compensated for completing study procedures."
