            "briefSummary": "This is an open-label phase 1 study with expansion. The study will start with a dose escalation of single-agent ABSK121-NX administered in repeated 28-day cycles in patients with advanced solid tumors to evaluate safety and tolerability. The expansion part will investigate oral ABSK121-NX at the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) to further evaluate safety and tolerability among selected tumor types. Preliminary antitumor activity will also be assessed.",
            "detailedDescription": "Escalation Part:\n\nDose escalation of oral ABSK121-NX will be guided by the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design based on safety data collected until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been identified. During the dose escalation part of the study, patients will receive a single dose of ABSK121 on Day -7 followed by a 7-day washout (Day -7 dosing day as 1st day of wash out) as a run-in period to access the safety and PK of ABSK121-NX. Then, patients will continuously receive ABSK121-NX once daily (QD) beginning at C1D1.\n\nThe dose escalation will start at 3 mg QD followed by dose escalation of a total of 8 potential dose levels. Once RDE is determined, an RDE-confirmation group of up to 24 more patients may be enrolled at the selected dose levels to further evaluate safety and efficacy (up to 12 per dose level/regimen), if approved by the sponsor. In addition, a preliminary food-effect (FE) may be evaluated in Cycle 1 D15 or later in at least 6 patients from the RDE- confirmation part.\n\nAfter the RDE is determined in the dose escalation part, the dose expansion phase will be conducted.\n\nExpansion Part:\n\nWhen health authorities outside US require that the safety data in the local population be provided prior to the expansion part, a minimum of 3 local subjects will be enrolled and treated at the selected RDE dose level first in that country/region to evaluate the tolerability of ABSK121-NX. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for escalation part will apply for these subjects. After similar safety and tolerability of ABSK121-NX in patients in the relevant locality have been confirmed by local Investigators and the Sponsor, additional patients will be allowed to enroll in the expansion part."

Current evidence or previous history of corneal pathology such as keratopathy, corneal abrasion or ulceration, or current evidence of conjunctivitis\n\n   16. Patients with refractory/uncontrolled ascites or pleural effusion\n\n   17. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test within 7 days prior to the start of study drug\n\n   18. Non-surgically sterilized male or female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control during the study and for approximately 6 months after the last dose of study drug. A condom is also required to be used by vasectomized men to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid\n\n   19. Vaccination with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment except for administration of inactivate vaccines (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines, inactivated influenza vaccines)\n\n   20. Any other clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active infection, or any other condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator, could compromise compliance with the protocol, interfere with the interpretation of study results, or predispose the patient to safety risks\n\n   21.
