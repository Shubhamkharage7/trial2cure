Music therapy helps relieve pain or stress and promote well-being. Listening to music during a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate procedure may reduce anxiety during the procedure.",

To determine whether music listening alleviates psychological distress such as anxiety in patients undergoing bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy that do not require general anesthesia.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if patients with lower to no anxiety during bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy will also experience less pain.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To design and implement an evidence-based music intervention protocol that could be used during bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients undergo standard of care bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration.\n\nGROUP II: Patients listen to music while undergoing standard of care bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration."
