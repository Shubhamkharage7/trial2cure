            "briefSummary": "Major depressive and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in the general population and are a leading cause of disability. Black adults have a high burden of depression and anxiety. This study aims to assess a self- administered video-based intervention to reduce mental illness stigma and medical mistrust among Black adults with moderate to severe depression or anxiety.",
            "detailedDescription": "Major depressive and anxiety disorders affect 57.3 million adults in the U.S. These disorders are also highly stigmatized. Stigma refers to negative attitudes or beliefs about mental illness, or negative behaviors directed toward persons with mental illness (PWMI) is a leading and fundamental cause of health inequities.\n\nThe efficacy and precision of anti- stigma interventions to improve mental health outcomes among underserved Black adults are grossly limited and represent a critical public health gap. Studies show stigma compounds disabilities related to the primary symptoms of mental illness and increases morbidity and premature mortality related to mental illness. Compared with white adults, Black adults with mental illness have more chronic disease, and more severe illness at presentation. Meta-analyses have consistently shown that both face-to-face and video-based contact with individuals with mental illness can reduce stigma. Recent studies that distinguished contact delivery showed effect size for video-based contact to be comparable to face-to-face contact. Contact interventions, which are premised on the idea that positive and voluntary contact with PWMI can effectively reduce mental illness stigma, are aimed at reducing stigma and improving health outcomes.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a self-administered, video-based mobile app intervention aimed at reducing mental illness stigma among Black adults. Black adults with moderate to severe depression or anxiety will be recruited to participate in the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: two video-based intervention arms and one waitlist control arm. The video-based intervention will include first-hand lived experience stories of mental health and one's recovery journey."
