            "detailedDescription": "Soldiers with mental illness typically face a two-fold problem. On the one hand, they have to cope with the symptoms of their mental illness; on the other hand, they often have to deal with stigma and discrimination. Both due to fear of public stigma and due to self-stigma or shame, soldiers with mental illness may decide to keep their condition a secret or even to withdraw from other people altogether in order to minimize the risk of being labeled. Secrecy can help on the short term to protect individuals from public stigma, but usually it has negative long-term consequences such as social isolation, distress and avoidance of help-seeking. Disclosure, on the other hand, carries the risk to be discriminated by others, but can reduce the burden of secrecy, lead to support by others and reduce public stigma.\n\nIn this study investigators aim to test the efficacy (see our outcomes above) of Honest, Open, Proud run by soldiers with lived experience of mental illness."
