Study procedures for the open pilot include screening for eligibility, intervention Zoom sessions, questionnaires, and exit interviews with study staff.\n\nPatients participating in the subsequent randomized controlled trial will be randomized into one of two study groups: CBT for fatigue intervention versus usual care.Study procedures include screening for eligibility, intervention Zoom sessions (intervention arm) or receipt of informational materials about fatigue (usual care arm), and completion of study questionnaires (after consent but before randomization and at approximately 3 and 5 months post-randomization).\n\nThis research study is expected to last about 3 years. It is expected about 66 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institute of Health is providing funding for this project."
