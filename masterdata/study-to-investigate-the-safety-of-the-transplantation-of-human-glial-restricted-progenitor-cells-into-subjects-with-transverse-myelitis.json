            "briefSummary": "This study is a non-randomized, open-label, partially blinded, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study designed to obtain preliminary data on the safety, tolerability, and early activity of Q-Cells\u00ae transplantation in subjects with Transverse Myelitis. For each of the dose levels, transplantation of Q-Cells\u00ae unilaterally into spinal cord demyelinated lesions will be evaluated. Subjects will be blinded to side of treatment.\n\nIdiopathic Transverse Myelitis is a monophasic disorder characterized predominantly by demyelination. Patients are left with disability from damage to ascending and descending white matter tracts. Q-Cells\u00ae are comprised of glial progenitor cells.It is postulated that the Q-Cells\u00ae glial progeny (healthy astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) will integrate into the spinal cord lesion site and remyelinate demyelinated axons as well as provide trophic support for damaged axons. Therefore, Q-Cells\u00ae have the potential to repair damage that has occurred and could be clinically useful for patients with disability caused by TM.\n\nThe study is planned to enroll up to 9 subjects. Each subject will be followed for 9 months after transplantation of Q-Cells\u00ae. Each subject will receive a single time point administration of Q-Cells\u00ae: with transplantation foci targeted to posterior columns in the spinal cord (all transplantation foci below C7) on one side.\n\nStudy participation consists of Screening, Pre-operative/Treatment, and Post-treatment study periods that will generally last from 9 to 12 months in total. The study data will be assessed for safety and activity until the last subject has completed the 9-month study visit. Following completion of the 9-month follow-up period, subjects who consent will continue to be followed for safety and activity in a separate long-term follow-up protocol."
