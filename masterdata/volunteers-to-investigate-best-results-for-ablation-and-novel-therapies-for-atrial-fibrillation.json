            "briefSummary": "VIBRANT-AF seeks to:\n\n* Identify clinically relevant predictors of effectiveness and complications of AF ablation procedures in a prospective, US-based, multi-center, real-world longitudinal study\n* Assess changes in modifiable lifestyle-related exposures influence the effectiveness of AF ablation\n* Determine incidence and predictors of complications of AF ablation procedures\n\nParticipants will connect with the Eureka Research Platform and answer a series of surveys and activities over a one-year period. They will be asked about lifestyle habits, recurrence of AFib, hospitalizations, and general feelings and emotions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Catheter ablation for Atrial Fibrillation is the most commonly performed cardiac electrophysiology procedure. Although now standard of care in professional society guidelines, recommendations favoring the procedure are predominately based on randomized trials or single-center experiences from high-volume institutions staffed by expert operators. Participants enrolled in those randomized trials are healthier than those undergoing the procedure in the \"real world,\" and the actual experiences of patients throughout the US are not represented by those referred to tertiary-referral centers that most frequently publish their retrospective observations. Although administrative databases provide a glimpse into what happens in the real-world, ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT codes cannot capture specific procedural approaches or patient perspectives. For this reason, this study aims to leverage the Eureka Research Platform, a digital health infrastructure to enable longitudinal follow-up and ascertainment of patient reported outcomes.\n\nThis is a longitudinal, observational cohort study. 15,000 subjects are planned to be enrolled, and will be followed for a period of one year. Subjects will be asked weekly survey questions on weekly habits, complications, medication usage, and hospitalizations. They will have the option to receive AliveCor Kardia devices for remote ECG monitoring, as well as connect their Apple HealthKit data. Surveys will be conducted via the Eureka mobile app.\n\nIn conjunction with the Eureka Research Platform, the study will leverage the AF Ablation National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) run by the American College of Cardiology (ACC). This rapidly growing registry includes comprehensive data regarding patient, procedure, and institution-level characteristics, now includes over 200 institutions around the US, and has already enrolled more than 47,000 patients. However, the registry is limited to data collected during the index procedure visit, without longitudinal follow-up or patient reported outcomes. The study will link the Eureka Research Platform data to NCDR registry data on the index procedure for a subset of participants, allowing for analysis of longitudinal follow-up together with index procedure data."
