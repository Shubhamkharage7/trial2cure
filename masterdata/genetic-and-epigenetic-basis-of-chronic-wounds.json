            "briefSummary": "This pilot study is designed for chronic wounds that fail to heal in a timely manner carry specific genetic signatures. These genetic signatures will be studied using debrided wound tissue that is removed by the wound care provider as part of standard of care. The reference genomic signature will be evaluated by obtaining blood samples and will be compared with wound debrided tissue genomic signature to understand wound specific genomic changes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic wounds affect a large fraction of the world population and poses major threat to the public health and economy of the United States affecting 6.5 million patients. It has been estimated that approximately 2% of the population residing in developed countries, will experience at least one chronic wound during their lifetime. Current treatment options for chronic wounds are insufficient due to lack of individual specific genetic information. To improve therapy, an increase in the investigator's understanding of the genetic predisposition of individuals which result in impaired wound healing response is warranted. Information about these individual specific genetic and epigenetic regulations can altogether yield subset of repair genes which can serve as master regulators of wound healing. The effect of specific genetic information is also modified a lot by environmental epigenetic factors. Epigenetic changes have been shown to control the wound healing outcomes.\n\nIn this prospective pilot study, patients with chronic wounds visiting UPMC hospitals will be enrolled. Patients enrolled in the study will be followed for 16 weeks (+ or - 2 weeks). Within this time, debrided wound tissue will be collected, when available, as part of their standard of care at the clinics. The study consists of four study visits (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 16 or earlier if target would is healed before that time). Study visit 1 consists of obtaining informed consent, medical history, current medications, and baseline demographics including, but not limited to: age, gender, zip code, ethnicity/race, marital status, education level, employment history, household income, number of household member. Digital imaging along with the collection of a saliva and blood sample will be performed during the visit. Participants will be asked to complete fourteen health questionnaires. Study visits two and three consists of digital imaging, along with a medication and adverse event review. Debridement tissue, if available, will be collected, if not collected earlier, during a follow up standard of care as part of wound care visit during the 16-week period. Study visit 4 (Healing Confirmation visit) consists of digital imaging, medication and adverse event review, along with Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements."
