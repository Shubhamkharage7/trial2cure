            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether an exercise intervention works to improve cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. Many breast cancer survivors report cancer-related cognitive impairment, which this has recently become a priority in clinical research due to its dramatic impact on daily functioning, quality of life, and long-term health. Aerobic exercise has the potential to improve cognitive function and brain health in older adults and is recommended as a safe, tolerable, and accessible complementary therapy for breast cancer survivors. This study aims to understand the effects of physical activity compared with health education on memory, attention, and brain health in women with breast cancer. Study findings may help researchers design more programs that can improve memory, attention, and brain health in other women with breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Examine the effectiveness of a 6-month, community-based aerobic exercise intervention on multiple indicators of cognitive function in post-menopausal breast cancer survivors.\n\nII. Gather information on the intervention's potential for scalability using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Explore potential moderators and mediators of the effects of aerobic exercise training on cognitive function.\n\nII. Investigate the feasibility of urinary metabolites as biomarkers of overall diet patterns.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients attend 3 weekly exercise sessions in weeks 1-2, 2 sessions each week in weeks 3-4, 1 session each week in weeks 5-8, biweekly sessions across weeks 9-16, and monthly sessions in weeks 17-24 for a total of 20 supervised sessions. Patients undergo a gait assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as wear an accelerometer throughout the study.\n\nARM II: Patients participate in up to 9 monthly classes/webinars. Patients also receive informational portable document format (pdfs), videos, and/or podcasts, and a one-year subscription to the Mayo Clinic Health Letter. Patients undergo a gait assessment and MRI, as well as wear an accelerometer throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up with at 12 months."

Sessions will be progressive in nature such that the volume of exercise increases across weeks. Treadmill walking is the primary mode of exercise. However, participants will be permitted to use other cardiovascular equipment (e.g., elliptical machines, stationary bicycles) as prescribed by their exercise trainer.
