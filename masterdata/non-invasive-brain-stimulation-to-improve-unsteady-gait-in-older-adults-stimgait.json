            "briefSummary": "Walking is a complex and continuous task that entails repetitive motions of the body. Relatively high gait variability sensitively predicts falls and cognitive decline in older adults. Previous work has identified an unique brain network relationship linked to gait variability and its relevant cognitive function (i.e., sustained attention). This project aims to develop a non-invasive brain stimulation montage designed to modulate the shared brain networks dynamics and to demonstrate its effects on resting state functional connectivity, gait and cognitive performance in older adults at risk for falls.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of a non-invasive brain stimulation intervention of tDCS to improve unsteady gait in older adults. The investigators will enroll 30 older adults with elevated gait variability. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms: a) 10 sessions of tDCS and b) 5 sessions of sham stimulation followed by 5 sessions of tDCS. Participants will engage in a set of pre-intervention assessments, the brain stimulation intervention - consisting of 10, once-daily, 20-min stimulation sessions over a 2-week period, and a set of post-intervention assessments. This project is expected to demonstrate that tDCS can be used to reduce gait variability in older adults."
