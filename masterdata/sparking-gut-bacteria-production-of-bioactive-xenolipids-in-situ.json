            "briefSummary": "Long-chain cyclopropane fatty acids (CpFAs) are microbially-derived lipids (fats), some of which can be found in select foods and appear to be produced naturally in the gut from dietary fatty acid precursors. Some of these lipids appear to have signaling properties in the body's tissues, i.e., to help regulate cardiometabolic health. Thus, increasing the bioavailability of CpFAs in humans may have utility to improve management of blood sugar and blood lipids, or to mitigate or prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study is a proof-of-principle experiment in 10 subjects, to feed dietary fats thought to enhance upper gut CpFA production. The latter will be monitored through post-meal blood and urine CpFA concentration measurements, as well as concentration in the stool."
