Confirmation of residual imaging abnormality is required within 6 weeks of randomization.\n* Placement of Savi scout optical reflectance marker in tumor bed area as a wireless guide for surgery and for neoRT treatment planning is preferred but not required if anatomic metallic markers are sufficient for radiation planning. Placement does not have to occur before randomization. Additionally, wire localization before surgery is permissible.\n* Planned lumpectomy.
