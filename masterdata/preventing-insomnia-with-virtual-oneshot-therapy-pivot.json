            "briefSummary": "This study is intended to assess the efficacy of preventative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (pCBT-I) on reducing the severity and stopping the progression of acute insomnia and depression. We also hope to gain a deeper understanding of the sociocultural, interpersonal, and individual factors that may have a role in development of insomnia and/or engagement with treatment plans.",
            "detailedDescription": "Insomnia is a debilitating condition that escalates the risk of a myriad of disorders and is a source of significant economic burden. Insomnia takes an immense toll on individuals' physical and mental wellbeing and treating it before it can develop into chronic insomnia can save individuals untold time and money on treatment.\n\nThis study is intended to assess the effects of one virtual pCBT-I session with a nurse coach on reducing the severity and stopping the progression of acute insomnia and depression. The benefits of pCBT-I have been demonstrated in prior studies but have yet to be tested on larger sample populations.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) outpatient network, as well as the Medicare/Medicaid data warehouse and other community partners. Subjects will be screened to determine eligibility, and then will be randomized into one of two insomnia treatment groups (control digital sleep education and pCBT-I via telehealth coaching).\n\nUpon completion, the proposed research will not only have validated a preventative treatment for both insomnia and depression, but we will have the tools to apply it in the most effective way possible."
