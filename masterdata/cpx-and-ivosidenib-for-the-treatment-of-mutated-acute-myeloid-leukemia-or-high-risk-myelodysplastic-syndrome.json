            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates how well CPX-351 and ivosidenib work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that has IDH1 mutation. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied. IDH1 is a type of genetic mutation (change). Chemotherapy drugs, such as CPX-351, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ivosidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The purpose of this trial is to learn if CPX-351 in combination with ivosidenib can help to control IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) including CR, CRh, CRi, MLFS, and PR of the combination of CPX-351 and ivosidenib in IDH1-mutated patients with AML or high-risk MDS\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess safety of CPX-351 in combination with ivosidenib. II. To determine time to event endpoints including duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) using multiparameter flow cytometry, cytogenetics and molecular evaluation.\n\nII. To evaluate molecular and cellular biomarkers that may be predictive of antitumor activity and/or resistance to treatment including evaluation of 2HG, IDH1 and other co-occurring mutations and VAF levels before, during and after treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, and ivosidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients who do not achieve complete remission may receive a second cycle of induction therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission proceed to consolidation.\n\nCONSOLIDATION: Patients receive CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3, and ivosidenib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE: Patients receive ivosidenib PO QD for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are experiencing clinical benefit and who have not experienced excessive toxicity after completion of 2 years of maintenance may be eligible to continue therapy after discussion with the principal investigator.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then monthly for 3 years."
