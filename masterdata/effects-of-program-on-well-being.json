Demographic information will be documented during the baseline research session.",

Baseline Research Session: self-report completion of demographic information, perception of safety (Neuroception of Psychological Safety, NPSS) and trauma experience (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist DSM-5, PCL-5), autonomic reactivity (Body Perception Questionnaire, BPQ), anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), and perception of events and goals related to purpose in life (Purpose in Life Scale).\n2. Participate in the 3-day Alliance180 Program (intervention), which includes the Transformative Equine Experience.\n3. Post-intervention Research Sessions: 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after completing the Alliance180 Program, self-report completion of perception of safety and trauma experience (NPSS, PCL-5), autonomic reactivity (BPQ), anxiety/depression (HADS) and purpose of events and goals related to purpose in life (Purpose in Life Scale)."
