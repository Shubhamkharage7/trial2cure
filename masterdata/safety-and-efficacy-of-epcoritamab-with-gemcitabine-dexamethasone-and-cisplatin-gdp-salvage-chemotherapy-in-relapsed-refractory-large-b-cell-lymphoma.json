            "briefSummary": "Subjects with relapsed large cell lymphoma will receive 3 cycles of combination therapy consisting of GDP and epcoritamab. Each cycle will last 21 days. GDP consists of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, and dexamethasone 40 mg orally on Days 1 through 4. Epcoritamab will be administered subcutaneously (SC) on Days 1, 8, and 15. Patients will receive granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) between Day 8 through Day 10 of each cycle of combination therapy.\n\nPatients will then undergo radiology imaging for disease assessment. Patients may proceed to SCT(autologous or allogeneic) or CAR T-cell therapy or epcoritamab monotherapy upon completion of Cycle 3 per investigator discretion. The rationale for subjects not proceeding to autoSCT or CAR T-cell therapy will be captured in the eCRFs.\n\nPatients who do not undergo SCT or CAR T-cell therapy may have the option to receive study treatment with epcoritamab monotherapy following completion of Cycle 3. Epcoritamab monotherapy will be offered to selected subjects who become ineligible to undergo SCT or CAR T-cell therapy (such as social situation, change in subject decision). The decision to offer epcoritamab monotherapy will be per investigator's discretion. However, subjects must have demonstrated a response to the combination therapy (partial remission or complete remission) per disease assessment scans prior to offering epcoritamab monotherapy. Epcoritamab monotherapy should begin 2 weeks following Cycle 3 Day 15. Monotherapy will consist of epcoritamab 48 mg administered subcutaneously on Days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle for Cycle 4 to Cycle 9 or until unacceptable toxicity, or disease progression per the Lugano Criteria."

Known active central nervous system or meningeal involvement by large cell lymphoma at time of screening. Patients diagnosed with CNS disease who achieved and maintained CNS CR at the time of relapse are eligible. Lumbar puncture must be done in this case prior to study entry to demonstrate CNS CR status. Tests to investigate CNS involvement are required otherwise only if clinically indicated (i.e. disease suspected on basis of symptoms or other findings).\n3. Contraindication to any drug contained in the combination therapy regimen (GDP).\n4. Known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to epcoritamab or its' excipients.\n5. Any AE related to the previous large cell lymphoma therapy which has not recovered to Grade \u2264 1 (CTCAE v.5.0) or baseline by C1D1, except alopecia.\n6. Use of any standard or experimental anti-large cell lymphoma therapy (including nonpalliative radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radio-immunotherapy, or any other anticancer therapy) \\< 14 days prior to C1D1 (prednisone up to 50 mg or equivalent for 5 days is permitted; palliative radiation is permitted only if on non-target lesions).\n7. Major surgery \\< 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n8. Neuropathy Grade \u2265 2 (CTCAE v.5.0).\n9. Patients with a history of other malignancies, except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, non-invasive superficial bladder cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, DCIS of the breast, localized low grade prostate cancer (up to Gleason score 6), or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for at least 3 years.\n10. Active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) requiring systemic treatment within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Prophylactic antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents are allowed.\n11. Confirmed history or current autoimmune disease or other diseases requiring permanent immunosuppressive therapy. Low-dose (10 mg/day) prednisolone (or equivalent) for rheumatoid arthritis or similar conditions is allowed.\n12. Active HIV infection. NOTE: Testing for HIV antibody is required at the time of screening. Those with positive HIV antibody will require HIV viral load by PCR testing. Patients with detectable viral load will not be eligible for the study. Those with positive antibody but undetectable viral load and CD4 \\>200 will be eligible.\n13. Testing for hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is required at screening. Hepatitis B testing will consist of Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B Core Antibody (HBcAb) and Hepatitis Surface Antibody (HBsAb). Hepatitis C testing will consist of Hepatitis C Antibody (HCAb). Subjects with a history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must have an undetectable HBV viral load on suppressive therapy, if indicated. Subjects with evidence of prior HBV but who are PCR-negative are permitted in the trial but should receive prophylactic antiviral therapy. Subjects with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, the HCV viral load must be undetectable to be eligible for this trial. Subjects who received treatment for HCV that was intended to eradicate the virus may participate if hepatitis C RNA levels are undetectable.\n14. Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study).\n15. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the Investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, or being compliant with the study procedures.",
