            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, dose-escalation Phase I/IIa trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of an investigational RNA-based vaccine (BNT165e) for prevention of P. falciparum malaria in healthy malaria-naive adults.\n\nThe multi-antigen malaria vaccine (designated BNT165e) is a combination of three distinct RNAs, BNT165c and BNT165d (composed of BNT165d1 and BNT165d2), encoding P. falciparum antigens encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. The BNT165c RNA encodes the full Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein. The BNT165d1 and BNT165d2 RNAs both encode conserved, immunogenic segments of liver stage-expressed proteins.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial will be observer-blind and assess the reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity of up to 9 dose combinations in a 3-dose regimen of the 3 components of BNT165e. Participants will be randomized 5:1 active:placebo.\n\nThe initial two doses will be administered \\~8 weeks apart and the third dose will be administered \\~18 weeks after the second dose.\n\nAn amendment will be submitted to the Health Authorities detailing Part B, which will explore the efficacy of BNT165e in a controlled human malaria infection model."
