Randomization means there is an equal chance of being assigned to the PediRISE Program Group or the Usual Care Group.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility, study visits, and completion of surveys and questionnaires.\n\nParticipation in this study will last for about 6-months.\n\nIt is expected that about 40 pediatric participants with parents/guardians will take part in this research study.\n\nThis study is being supported by grants from the American Cancer Society and the Children's Cancer Research Fund."
