Transfemale (MTF) youth (male sex, female gender identity) who begin clinical Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT) with estrogen may be at a higher risk for headache since estrogen has been linked to headache in cisgender females (female sex, female gender identity). This research hopes to learn more about headache in MTF youth.",
            "detailedDescription": "MTF youth who will begin estrogen clinically will be enrolled in the study and will be seen twice, once before starting estrogen and then one year after beginning estrogen. Cisgender males (male sex, male gender identity) will also be enrolled as a control group and will be seen once at the beginning of the study and then once a year later. The researchers will track how often youth have headaches during this time to see if it is different between groups. In a subset of the youth enrolled, an MRI will be completed to also look at brain structure and function."
