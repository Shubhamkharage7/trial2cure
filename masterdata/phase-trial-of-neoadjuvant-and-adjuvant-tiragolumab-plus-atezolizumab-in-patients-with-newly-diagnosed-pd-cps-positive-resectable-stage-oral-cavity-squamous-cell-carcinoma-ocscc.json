The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n\nExamples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n\nThe reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n\n- For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period, for 90 days (a sperm cycle) after the final dose of tiragolumab and for 6 months after the final dose of carboplatin or cisplatin. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n\nWith a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period, for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab and for 6 months after the final dose of carboplatin or cisplatin to avoid exposing the embryo.\n\nThe reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry:\n\n* Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of enrollment.\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium 1.5 mmol/L, calcium 12 mg/dL or corrected serum calcium ULN)\n* Active or history of autoimmune disease or immune deficiency, including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or multiple sclerosis (see Appendix 6 for a more comprehensive list of autoimmune diseases and immune deficiencies), with the following exceptions:\n\nPatients with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are on thyroid-replacement hormone are eligible for the study.\n\nPatients with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on an insulin regimen are eligible for the study.\n\nPatients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are eligible for the study provided all of following conditions are met:\n\n* Rash must cover 10% of body surface area\n* Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical corticosteroids\n* No occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high-potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months\n\n  * History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n  * Active tuberculosis\n  * Significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class II or greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident) within 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment, unstable arrhythmia, or unstable angina\n  * Major surgical procedure, other than for diagnosis, within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the study\n  * History of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS rate \\> 90%), such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non melanoma skin carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer.\n  * Severe infection, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia, or any active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact patient safety.\n  * Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., to prevent a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) are eligible for the study.\n  * Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n  * Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n  * Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during study, or within 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab or 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab Patients being treated with chemotherapy (i.e., carboplatin and cisplatin) should not receive live vaccines.\n  * Current treatment with anti-viral therapy for HBV\n  * Positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin M (IgM) test at screening An EBV PCR test should be performed as clinically indicated to screen for acute infection or suspected chronic active infection.
