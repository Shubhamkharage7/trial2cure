            "briefSummary": "To date, there are no studies of the therapeutic effects of varied work-focused programs in Veterans undergoing outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial to test the effects of work-focused programs on improving sobriety and other clinical outcomes in Veterans early in the course of recovery from SUD. Veterans will be randomized to either receive or not receive referral for work-focused therapeutic programs. Primary aim is to examine effects of work-focused programs on sobriety outcomes, namely sobriety and global functioning. Secondary aim is to examine effects of work-focused programs on psychiatric symptoms, self esteem/efficacy, and quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose a trial to test the effects of Incentive Therapy (IT) and Other Therapeutic and Supported Employment Services (Other TSES) on improving SUD outcomes in newly recovering Veterans in outpatient treatment. In line with eligibility criteria for different TSES programs, the investigators will employ a two branch study: One branch will be for Veterans who are not interested in pursuing competitive employment, and will be a two arm RCT with randomization (2:1) to referral for IT + treatment as usual (TAU; including usual SUD outpatient treatment) or TAU alone. The second branch will be for Veterans who express interest in competitive employment, and will be a two arm RCT with randomization (2:1) to referral for TSES competitive employment services + TAU or TAU alone. Total Intent to Treat sample will be 140 (n=70 per branch). Primary outcomes will be percent days abstinent during 3 month active phase and clinical global impression scale scores at 6 months. Secondary outcome will be psychiatric symptoms, self esteem/efficacy and quality of life."
