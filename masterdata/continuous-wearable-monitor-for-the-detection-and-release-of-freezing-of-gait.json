The purpose of the overall Phase II study is to: (1) Develop a production ready system, (2) Develop a companion mobile app for the proposed system and refine previously developed FOG detection algorithms, and (3) Validate the proper operation of the system and demonstrate its efficacy through lab and in-community testing. This study will focus on validating the system and demonstrating efficacy through in-community testing."
