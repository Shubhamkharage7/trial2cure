            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if the Revian Red All LED cap shows potential to be an effective treatment for Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) by recruiting hair follicles back to anagen growth or by improving inflammation. The primary outcome is to determine if hair loss regression is halted. Secondary outcomes include hair regrowth and alleviation of signs and symptoms of the disease.\n\nParticipants will be asked to use the Revian Red All LED cap once daily for a 10-minute treatment regimen which is the current androgenetic alopecia recommendation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects who are willing to participate in a novel treatment for Revian Red All LED cap will be enrolled in this study. The cap uses two wavelengths of light, 620 nm and 660 nm. A study cap will be provided for each subject. Subjects will use the cap once daily, 10-minute treatment regimen which is the current androgenetic alopecia recommendation. The subjects will use the cap for a total of 6 months. To use the cap, subjects will connect the Revian Red All LED cap to a Smart App on a mobile phone device using Bluetooth. Subjects can use the Smart App to set daily reminders to use the cap, track and log usage, and use the 10 minute timer. No additional information will be stored on the Smart App. Only subjects will have access to the Smart App located on their personal mobile phone device.\n\nStandardized photos and trichoscopic photos before starting treatment and every 2 months for x 6 total months will be taken to assess hairline stabilization and potential for regrowth. A baseline photo and completion photo will also be taken with a visio device. This will help determine pigmentation of the present hairs throughout the study.\n\nPrior to study enrollment, all participants will receive a detailed explanation of the purpose of the study and will undergo written informed consent. Clinical history of hair loss and history of prior treatment will be obtained by administering a standardized questionnaire to all subjects. Subjects will also fill out a questionnaire regarding symptoms of their hair loss at each visit. There will be 4 visits total (1 Pre-treatment visit and 3 Follow up visits)."
