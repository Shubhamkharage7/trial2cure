This may help doctors use testing information on tumors to identify clinical trials that may be most relevant to patients. Researchers may also use the information learned from this study to develop a database of the different kinds of mutations in cancer-related genes.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To perform standardized molecular analysis for patients at MD Anderson to assist in personalized cancer therapy.\n\nII. To determine the frequency of mutations and co-mutations and other alterations in cancer-related genes in different tumor types.\n\nIII. To establish a database of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, gene fusion/translocation information and other biomarker alterations and clinical characteristics that can be used to select patients that may be eligible for new targeted therapy trials.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine enrollment to pathway-targeted therapy trials by cancer genotype and ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression, and plan additional pathway-targeted therapy trials.\n\nII. To determine how somatic and germline mutations in cancer-related genes, other molecular alterations affect response to commonly used anti-tumor therapies and cancer outcomes.\n\nIII. To determine genomic alterations detectable in plasma and their evolution with treatment.\n\nIV. To perform multiplex and non-multiplex protein and protein/RNA screening using different platforms such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence, (IF) mass spectrometry (MS), and nanostring of slides or tissue microarrays.\n\nV. To determine feasibility of identifying actionable targets and rationale drug combinations based on gene expression profiling and systems biology.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients' previously collected tissue samples are analyzed. Patients may also undergo collection of blood, saliva or buccal samples for analysis. Patients' medical records are reviewed."

However, research testing will only be performed on patients who have sufficient archived diagnostic tissue or residual tissue banked in one of the authorized tissue banks at MD Anderson available to proceed with testing. The extent of testing may be modified based on amount of tissue available. If any new tissue acquisition including a biopsy and/or surgical resection etc. is being ordered for clinical care or another research study, or an operation is being performed testing can be ordered on that sample\n* Circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) Cohort: Circulating cell-free DNA next generation sequencing (NGS) testing will be performed with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified Guardant360 panel (or equivalent) for select patients. This particular cohort of research collaboration will be supported by Guardant Health, Inc. at no charge to MD Anderson. Patients who are being considered for enrollment into clinical trials in the next 2 lines of therapy may be enrolled.
