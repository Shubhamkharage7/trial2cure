The primary endpoint will be measurement of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other inflammation associated proteins (cytokines and heat shock proteins) in the plasma at one hour, 24h and one-week post WBH. A further endpoint is treatment response defined by a decrease of 50% or more in the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Clinician-Rated (IDS-CR) score at 7 days post-intervention, 2 weeks post-intervention, and 4 weeks post-intervention."
