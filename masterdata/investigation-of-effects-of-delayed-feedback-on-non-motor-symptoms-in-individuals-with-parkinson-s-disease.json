            "briefSummary": "Learning deficits are frequent in individuals with Parkinson's Disease. Clear feedback is integral because through feedback individuals know whether they should stick with an action that they have been doing (if the feedback is positive), or change their course of action (if the feedback is negative). Learning though immediate feedback has been shown to be depended on the brain chemical dopamine that is disrupted in individuals with Parkinson's Disease. During learning, feedback can also be presented after a delay. The investigators propose that learning through delayed feedback will lead to greater learning in individuals with Parkinson's Disease, since learning through delayed feedback does not rely on dopamine. During the proposed paradigm, participants with Parkinson's Disease complete a multiple-choice test. After making their selection on the multiple-choice test, they either see feedback immediately or are given feedback 25 minute later after reviewing their selection on the multiple-choice test. The investigators hypothesize that participants will learn better when they are provided with delayed feedback."
