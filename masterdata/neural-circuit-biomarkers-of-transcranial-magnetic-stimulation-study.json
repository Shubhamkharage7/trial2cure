            "briefSummary": "This study is currently recruiting Veterans only. The objective of this observational study is to test whether neuroimaging biomarkers of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be prospectively replicated in a large ecologically valid sample. We focus on cognitive network connectivity as a predictive biomarker of the clinical effect of TMS, and as a response biomarker of change with TMS. We address this objective through a pragmatic approach in which we recruit patients undergoing routine clinical care and program evaluation in a Veterans Administration multi-site clinical TMS program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is becoming a gold standard treatment for pharmacoresistant depression, we lack neural target biomarkers for identifying who is most likely to respond to TMS and why. To address this gap in knowledge this observational study evaluates neural targets defined by activation and functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-anchored cognitive control circuit, regions of the default mode network and attention circuit, and interactions with the subgenual anterior cingulate.\n\nThe study evaluates whether these targets and interactions between them change in a dose-dependent manner, whether changes in these neural targets correspond to changes in cognitive behavioral performance, and whether baseline and early change in neural target and cognitive behavioral performance predict subsequent symptom severity, suicidality, and quality of life outcomes.\n\nThis study is designed as a pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial partnering with the National Clinical TMS Program of the Veteran's Health Administration.\n\nAll veterans will receive a clinical course of TMS as part of their routine care. Those who agree to enrollment in the observational study will be assessed at 'baseline' prior to commencement of their TMS treatment, 'first week' after initiation of TMS (targeting five sessions) and 'post-treatment' at the completion of TMS (targeting 30 sessions).\n\nVeterans will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a cognitive behavioral performance battery, and established questionnaires.\n\nTo our knowledge, our study will be the first pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial to use fMRI imaging and cognitive-behavioral performance as biomarkers of TMS treatment response in pharmacoresistant MDD."
