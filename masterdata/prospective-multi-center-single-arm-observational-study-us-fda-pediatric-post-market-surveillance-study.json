            "briefSummary": "The post market surveillance study will employ a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, observational design to capture data on children who undergo CRRT using the Carpediem\u2122 system. Participating clinicians will manage subjects in accordance to their local standard of care practices and decisions on initiating, modifying or discontinuing CRRT are up to the local investigative team's prescription.\n\nA minimum of 10 centers in the United States, that have been trained on the use of the Carpediem\u2122 system, will be invited to participate in the study. After obtaining institutional review board approval and written informed consent from a parent or legally authorized representative (LAR), data from all subjects treated with the Carpediem\u2122 system will be included in the study. A minimum of 35 subjects will be enrolled and sites may be asked to screen and enroll patients for the study for up to 36 months.\n\nStatus of subjects discharged from hospital will be collected at 30- and-90 days following hospital discharge by phone interviews in accordance to local standard of care practices, review of in-hospital records or in-clinic visit, as available.",
            "detailedDescription": "The post market surveillance study is designed to capture data in the real-world clinical setting on the use of the Carpediem\u2122 system and will evaluate the safety and performance in children requiring CRRT in the US. Data on survival and the effectiveness of the Carpediem\u2122 system on renal function recovery will be evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of subjects being treated with Carpediem\u2122 will include, but is not limited to, acuity at hospital/ICU admission and prior to CRRT initiation, Carpediem\u2122 treatment parameters, laboratory data, and requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or inotropic support. Subject status and requirement for renal replacement therapy post hospital discharge will be evaluated at 30- and 90-days."
