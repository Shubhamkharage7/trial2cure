            "briefSummary": "Persons with COPD benefit from being physically active, but they are often limited by chronic musculoskeletal pain. This project will determine whether a non-pharmacologic, integrated, technology-mediated walking and Tai Chi mindfulness intervention can improve physical function in Veterans with COPD and chronic musculoskeletal pain. The proposed research addresses VA Rehabilitation R\\&D Service's high priority area of improving health-related quality of life by reducing disease burden and maximizing function in Veterans with chronic disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Current physical activity (PA) interventions for persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) focus primarily on reducing the debilitating symptom of dyspnea, or shortness of breath. However, over half of patients with COPD experience chronic musculoskeletal pain which limits achievement of PA goals and optimization of physical function. Low PA is associated with poor outcomes-increased risk of COPD acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, and death-independent of lung function. Funded by Rehabilitation R\\&D, the investigators have developed Every Step Counts (ESC), a web-based intervention to promote PA in Veterans with COPD. ESC couples a dynamic website with a pedometer that objectively monitors daily step counts. Based on the Behavioral Theory of Self-Regulation, the website provides individualized step-count goals, iterative feedback, education on disease self-management, motivation, and an online community of social support. In RCTs, the investigators have demonstrated ESC's safety, feasibility, and efficacy to increase PA over 3-6 months. However, not all participants increased daily step counts. In secondary analyses, the investigators identified pain as a significant barrier to PA. Participants with co-occurring pain and dyspnea walked 1,200-1,400 fewer steps per day, compared to those with no symptoms. In its current form, ESC does not focus on pain management. Tai Chi (TC) is an attractive nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic musculoskeletal pain. TC improves neuromuscular function, core strength, and lower limb proprioception. Importantly, the mindfulness embedded in TC uniquely addresses cognitive and psycho-emotional processes critical for pain management (i.e., \"extinction of fear conditioning, acceptance-based coping strategies, increased ability to self-regulate affective appraisal of nociceptive input,\" and reduced pain-related distress and catastrophizing). The investigators have shown that persons with COPD can safely engage with TC delivered via either in-person classes or video instruction. The investigators propose to integrate ESC and TC to target biopsychosocial mechanisms of pain to break the chronic pain cycle and improve physical function in persons with COPD. The investigators will adapt ESC with pain management content, an online TC video library, and synchronous TC classes led by an instructor via teleconference. The investigators will randomize participants 1:1 to ESC-TC or usual care for 6 months. Assessments of outcomes will occur at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months in all participants, and at 12 months in a subset who enroll early. Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of the ESC-TC intervention in 136 persons with COPD and chronic musculoskeletal pain to improve the primary outcome of physical function, measured by daily step count, compared to usual care at 6 months. Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the ESC-TC intervention on secondary outcomes of (a) pain intensity and interference, (b) dyspnea, (c) health-related quality of life, (d) mobility, (e) depression, (f) exercise self-efficacy, (g) kinesiophobia, (h) pain catastrophizing, and (i) sleep quality. Aim 3: Explore the long-term effects of ESC-TC on symptoms and risk of acute exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations at 12 months in approximately 96 participants. The innovative multimodal, web-based, non-pharmacologic intervention to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain has potential to expand access to exercise as a rehabilitation strategy."
