The main question to answer is which imaging device provides measurements that are most similar to the standard of care device.\n\nParticipants will be patients of a retina doctor at University Station Eye Clinic with geographic atrophy, and can expect to be in the study for 60-75 minutes.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a single site pilot comparative imaging study in which enrolled participants will undergo dilated fundus exam as per standard of care. Study images will be obtained using Optos ultrawide field fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and both blue and green ultrawide field FAF with Zeiss Clarus. Autofluorescence (AF) imaging will also be performed on the Spectralis as it is currently the gold standard. The goal will be to obtain all images in 60-75 minutes over one visit. Images will be assessed, and area of geographic atrophy measured independently by two experienced readers."
