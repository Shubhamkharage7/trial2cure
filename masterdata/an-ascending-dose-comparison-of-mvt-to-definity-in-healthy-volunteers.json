            "briefSummary": "Definity (perflutren lipid microspheres, Lantheus Medical Imaging) is an ultrasound contrast indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular chamber and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border. MVT-100 (the investigational pharmaceutical) is similar to Definity, with the exception of the removal of one lipid in the lipid blend and substitution of another lipid. This study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MVT-100 using a single ascending dose design in healthy volunteers. Patients are randomized to receive either MVT-100 or Definity and undergo echocardiograms after receiving either MVT-100 or Definity via bolus or IV infusion administration. The primary endpoints evaluated are safety and endocardial border delineation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Ultrasound is one of the most common imaging examinations and has advantages of absence of ionizing radiation, portability and relatively low cost. Ultrasound contrast agents are used to improve the accuracy of ultrasound and Definity (perflutren) is the world's leading ultrasound contrast agent but perflutren has to be refrigerated and has a side effect of back pain. The investigators have developed a new, improved perflutren, MVT-100, with potential for room temperature storage.\n\nUltrasound contrast agents are used to increase the backscatter (signal intensity of blood vessels and tissues to improve diagnostic accuracy) of ultrasound imaging. In the US ultrasound contrast agents are FDA approved for echocardiography to improve endomyocardial border definition.\n\nMVT-100 reflects the ultrasound to provide strong back-scattering. MVT-100 microbubbles resonate with ultrasound to provide strong harmonic signals. MVT-100 microbubbles will cavitate with higher levels of ultrasound and cavitation may be stable or inertial depending upon acoustic parameters and other factors.\n\nThe study is a multi centre ascending dose comparison of Definity and MVT-100 for use in echocardiography and will be performed in a sample of healthy volunteers who are randomized to receive either Definity or MVT-100.\n\nThis trial will assess safety and evaluate the following imaging metrics:\n\n* Determine the optimal dose of MVT-100 by comparing MVT-100 vs Definity in the change from baseline of quantitative left ventricular opacification\n* Evaluation of qualitative left ventricular opacification (LVO)\n* Evaluation of endocardial border delineation\n* Evaluation of endocardial border length\n* Evaluation of duration of useful contrast"
