Subjects will receive a combination of pembrolizumab, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to the prostate, and short-term androgen deprivation therapy (STADT or Short-term ADT). After receiving this \"trimodal therapy\", subjects will undergo a radical prostatectomy. The prostate tissue will be analyzed for differences in pathology and local immune cell infiltration, and subjects will be followed for 2 years to watch for prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence. The PSA results will be analyzed by comparing them to historical controls that have already been published, to learn if this therapy approach delays PSA rise."

Prior pelvic radiation or prostate cryotherapy or high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\n3. Any prior treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137, PD-L2).\n4.

Prior therapy for prostate cancer\n\n   a. Exceptions: Previous alpha-reductase inhibitor use allowed IF patient has not been taking for at least 30 days prior to study treatment initiation, OR if alpha reductase inhibitor was not used as a primary treatment of prostate cancer and the PSA on alpha-reductase inhibitor remains within eligibility when doubled. \\]\n6.

Presence of a condition requiring chronic steroid use (equivalent to \\>10 mg of prednisone daily) or other immunosuppressive drugs (i.e., for organ transplant). The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n   1. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\n   2. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication)\n9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent\n10. History of another primary malignancy except for:\n\n    c. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease \u22655 years before the first dose of IP and of low potential risk for recurrence d.

History of allogenic stem cell transplant\n12. History of active primary immunodeficiency\n13. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus\n14. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection.\n15. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n17.
