This study will also determine if hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves engraftment, graft versus host disease, neutrophil count, and incidence and severity of mucositis (inflammation of the mouth or gut) and infection. This study has two cohorts. The first cohort is subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). The second cohort is subjects with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), chronic monocytic leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), myelofibrosis, and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPN) overlap syndrome. The first cohort has completed the recruitment so only the second cohort will be recruited."
