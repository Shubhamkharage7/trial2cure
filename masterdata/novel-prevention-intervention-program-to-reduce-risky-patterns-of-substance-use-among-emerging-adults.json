            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to test whether completion of a new personalized feedback program is associated with reductions in risky substance use among emerging adults (18-25 years of age).",
            "detailedDescription": "There has been tremendous advances in gene identification. From large-scale, well-powered genome wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic scores (PGS) can now be calculated that sum risk alleles across the genome and weight them by their effect size, creating an index of genetic liability for any given individual. But genetic influences are only part of what contributes to substance use disorders; the environment also plays a critical role. Accordingly, understanding the development of substance use outcomes necessitates integrating both genetic and environmental information. The rationale for this line of research is that the integration of genetic and environmental information will provide the foundation for precision medicine, and that the provision of this personalized risk information will help prevent the development of problems and/or allow for earlier intervention before problems have become severe. Our research team is creating a new prevention/intervention program, consisting of an on-line platform for individuals to receive their personalized risk estimates for addiction risk, created by integrating information about their genetic, behavioral, and environmental risk factors followed by information about how to reduce risk.\n\nThe investigators are enrolling a sample of emerging adults (18-25 years of age) into a randomized controlled trial consisting of 4 conditions. All four conditions will involve completion of a behavioral/environmental risk survey and the provision of saliva to determine genetic risk. Three active conditions involve individuals receiving their personalized risk estimates, followed by (condition 1) psychoeducation about ways to reduce substance use and associated harm; (condition 2) the on-line CBT-based module to assist with controlling substance use; or (condition 3) a follow-up appointment with a genetic counselor (GC). The fourth condition will be a waitlist control, in which individuals will receive psychoeducation only at the time that the active conditions receive their personalized risk estimates.\n\nAt the first time point (T0), participants will be randomly selected into one of four conditions. Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the conditions. Across all conditions, the investigators will measure substance use and problems at enrollment (T0), at the time of receipt of risk estimates (\\~8 weeks later; or at the time other participants receive their results (\\~8 weeks later) in the case of control condition) (T1), 1 month (T2), and 3 months (T3) after completion of the program.\n\nAfter the final survey (T3), participants in the control condition will receive their personalized risk estimates. All participants, regardless of their initial group, will be invited to receive access to the content of conditions in which they did not take part (e.g., online modules, appointment with a genetic counselor).\n\nFindings from this study have great potential to enhance our ability to use precision medicine to prevent the development of substance use disorders and/or intervene earlier in the progression to disorder."
