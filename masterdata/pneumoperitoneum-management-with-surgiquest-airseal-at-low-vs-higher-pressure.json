Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 treatment device to control ratio into one of two (2) different study arms:\n\n1. AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9mmHg \u00b11mmHg; or\n2. AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 15mmHg \u00b11mmHg.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is designed and powered to demonstrate superiority of the AIS at low pressure vs. at higher pressure on a single key effectiveness measure: Incidence of shoulder pain. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9mmHg \u00b11mmHg or to AIS with an insufflation target pressure of 15mmHg \u00b11mmHg.\n\nSecondary outcome measures include severity of shoulder pain measured using a VAS scale and medication use, length of hospital stay, aspects of anesthesia management including end tidal CO2 and the frequency of adverse events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled population undergoing laparoscopic surgery."

Specifically, the AirSeal\u00ae System creates a pressure barrier within the proximal housing of the cannula which acts as an invisible seal to maintain pneumoperitoneum during the course of surgery. It utilizes a re-circulation and filtration control unit (AirSeal\u00ae iFS) designed specifically for the AirSeal\u00ae Access Port to create and maintain the pressure barrier.",
