The messages are tailored to patient engagement levels based on established engagement thresholds, which are based on the patient's use of the dDPP application. The system is designed to minimize work for providers by sending automated targeted messages to patients to potentially increase engagement, prevent onset of diabetes and improve clinical outcomes. The patients in the study are automatically nudged using a combination of text messaging and MyChart messaging.",

For Phase 3, we aim to conduct a randomized control trial with 400 patients with pre-diabetic, all of whom will be using the dDPP application. Half of enrolled patients will be randomized to the intervention group and receive automated targeted messaging."
