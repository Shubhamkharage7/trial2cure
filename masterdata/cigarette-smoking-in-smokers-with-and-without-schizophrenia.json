            "briefSummary": "Higher rates and severity of tobacco dependence in people with schizophrenia, as compared with the general population, contribute to the lower life expectancy seen in this population. Dependent tobacco smoking is controlled by how different aspects of cigarette smoking are perceived. There is evidence suggesting that people with schizophrenia differ in how they perceive cigarette smoking, which, if confirmed, would have implications for tailoring treatment interventions for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.",
            "detailedDescription": "The aim of the present study is to determine whether tobacco smoking in people with schizophrenia is governed by different aspects and effects of cigarette consumption. Smokers participating in this study either have no psychiatric diagnosis, or a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Over four study visits, participants will sample and compare different research cigarettes, complete questionnaires and concentration tasks, and smoke one type of research cigarette for eight hours while wearing a nicotine patch. By shaping our understanding of tobacco dependence in schizophrenia, the present project may redirect treatment development toward strategies tailored to the specific vulnerabilities of this population, which is among the most severely affected by its detrimental impact on health and life."
