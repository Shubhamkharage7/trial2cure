HBV-HCC: Hepatitis B subjects will be allowed if they meet the following criteria: On antiviral therapy for HBV or HBV viral load must be less than 100 IU/mL prior to first dose of study drug. Subjects on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 100 IU/ml should stay on the same therapy throughout study treatment. Subjects who are anti-HBc (+), negative for HBsAg, negative for anti-HBs, and have an HBV viral load under 100 IU/mL do not require HBV anti-viral prophylaxis.\n    * 2. HCV-HCC: Active or resolved HCV infection as evidenced by detectable HCV RNA or antibody. Patients who have failed HCV therapy as evidenced by detectable HCV RNA will be eligible. Subjects with chronic infection by HCV who are treated (successfully or treatment failure) or untreated are allowed on study. In addition, subjects with successful HCV treatment are allowed as long as there are \u22654 weeks between completion of HCV therapy and start of study drug. Successful HCV treatment definition: SVR12.\n13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n14.

Interstitial lung disease, including history of interstitial lung disease or non infectious pneumonitis (lymphangitic spread of cancer is not disqualifying),\n   * 5b.

A condition that may obscure the interpretation of toxicity determination or AEs,\n   * 5e. History of prior solid-organ transplantation.\n6. Hypersensitivity to IV contrast; not suitable for pre-medication.\n7. Pre-existing thyroid abnormality with thyroid function that cannot be maintained in the normal range with medication.\n8.

Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n   * 8b. Participants with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or local corticosteroid injections will not be excluded from this study. Participants on chronic systemic corticosteroids will be excluded from the study.\n9. Known history of active bacillus tuberculosis.\n10.

Has significant dementia or other mental condition that precludes the participant's ability to consent to the study.\n18.
