Because pregnancy induces multiple maternal hormonal and physiological changes that can increase cancer susceptibility to environmental chemical exposures, this study will focus on pregnancy as a period of particular vulnerability to toxic agents.",
            "detailedDescription": "The environmental exposures will focus on two major components: Consumer product related chemicals (including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phthalates and plasticizers, phenolic compounds, pesticides, and aromatic amines) measured via biomonitoring and prioritized based on widespread public exposure; and environmental pollutants in air and water, evaluated via geographic information system analyses of participants' residential histories.\n\nThe study team will collect questionnaire data and biospecimen samples starting at the second trimester of pregnancy up until the child reaches four years of age. A Cohort Ambassador Program will also be established to invite participants across our three sites to provide continuous feedback which will be integrated into the research priorities."
