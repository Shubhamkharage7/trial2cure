This can be accomplished in several ways, including loss of heterozygosity studies as well as comparative gene expression analysis. When possible, linkage analysis on families with multiple individuals affected with PTC may also help identify the putative gene(s).\n\nStudy participants will be asked to:\n\n1. Complete family history and medical history questionnaires\n2. Sign a medical record release so that thyroid cancer pathology reports can be obtained\n3. Supply a blood or saliva sample for genetic studies\n4. Provide study related information to family members who are needed for family studies"
