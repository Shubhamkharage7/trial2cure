Only patients who proceed to surgery will be evaluable for the primary endpoint. The primary efficacy outcome measurement will be pathologic response (including Major Pathologic Response (MPR), and Complete Pathologic Response (CPR)). Secondary outcome measures include safety, and exploratory biomarkers of immune response in pre- and post-operative blood and tissue. A two-stage design will stop the study if fewer than 3 of the first 9 evaluable patients do not achieve MPR. An early stopping rule for safety will stop the study if more than 12 patients are enrolled to find the first 9 evaluable patients."
