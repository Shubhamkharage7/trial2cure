            "briefSummary": "The main goal of this clinical trial is to test benefits of completing online pain coping skills training program in women who have been diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer, who have completed their primary cancer treatment, who are taking an AI medication, and who have arthralgia. Arthralgia is a type of joint, bone, and muscle pain that is a common side effect of AI medications. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Whether online pain coping skills training reduces the severity of pain and the interference it causes in women's daily lives.\n2. Whether online pain coping skills training improves emotional distress, quality of life, and adherence to AI medications.\n3. Whether benefits of online pain coping skills training are at least partially caused by women's increased confidence that they can manage their pain and a reduction in unhelpful thinking patterns about pain.\n4. Whether online pain coping skills training improves effects of AI medications on sleep problems and symptoms of menopause like hot flashes and night sweats.\n\nParticipants can complete all parts of the study at home. They will:\n\n1. Complete four sets of questionnaires throughout the study, which will take about 9 to 10 months.\n2. Attend 3 meetings in the first month of the study, all of which can be held via a video conference.\n3. Use an electronic pill bottle to track their use of their AI medication.\n4. Be randomized (like flipping a coin) to one of two study arms: They will either receive education about AIs and arthralgia or they will receive this education along with access to an online pain coping skills training program.\n\nResearch will compare the education group to the education plus online pain coping skills training group to see if online pain coping skills training has the benefits mentioned above."

This interactive, web-based program teaches cognitive and behavioral skills that research has shown can reduce pain and pain-related interference with daily activities. The program includes eight sessions that participants will complete at a rate of about 1 per week. Each session takes 35-45 minutes. Participants will be shown how to use the program and can contact the study team if they have any problems with it. Participants who do not have a device capable of accessing the program will be loaned a tablet computer for the study.",

(Note: Patients may elect to decrease their analgesic use during the study as per discussion with their provider. Unexpected dose adjustments including dose escalations due to unforeseen clinical need is allowed. Cannabis taken for pain relief would qualify as an analgesic)\n* Comfortable using a tablet computer, a computer, or a smartphone to access online training\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Evidence of metastatic disease\n* Other active cancer (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer)\n* Completed chemotherapy or radiation therapy less than four weeks prior to enrollment (these treatments can cause temporary exacerbation of musculoskeletal symptoms that typically resolve spontaneously)\n* Completed surgery less than 8 weeks prior to enrollment (because surgery can cause temporary post-surgical pain that typically resolves in this period of time); minor surgeries may be allowed more recently than 8 weeks at the discretion of the study team\n* Have diagnosed or suspected condition that would interfere with informed consent or completion of study activities (e.g., significant impairment in cognition or uncorrected hearing/vision)",
