            "detailedDescription": "\\[68Ga\\]CBP8, is a PET imaging probe which selectively binds collagen type I. Collagen deposition is a pivotal event in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 binds collagen with high affinity and has excellent pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles. \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 was shown in a mouse model to be effective for detecting lung fibrosis and response to treatment. In addition, \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 can detect increased collagen in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nThe goals of this study are:\n\n1. To determine whether collagen deposition as assessed by \\[68Ga\\]CBP8-PET MRI can detect increased collagen deposition in early interstitial lung disease and\n2. if the degree of \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 uptake predicts subsequent disease progression."
