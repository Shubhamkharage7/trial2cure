            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug alirocumab, which may lower cholesterol, can reduce the amount of inflammation caused by an infection that has caused either low blood pressure or difficulty breathing. Participants will be randomized to receive a single IV infusion of alirocumab or a placebo.",
            "detailedDescription": "Sepsis is an inflammatory syndrome with life threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection. The global burden is estimated to exceed 15 million cases annually. In the United States, the incidence is increasing and currently there are more 1,750,000 cases each year, with more than half requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Further, sepsis cases account for 30%- 50% of all hospital deaths, making it the third leading cause of death in the United States, and is the most expensive reason for hospitalization with annual expenditures exceeding $20 billion. Notably, even among those that do survive, many endure significant reductions in physical, emotional and cognitive quality of life. New therapeutic approaches to reduce the high morbidity and mortality of sepsis are needed.\n\nCurrent management strategies focus on early aggressive fluid resuscitation, blood pressure support with vasopressors, early appropriate antibiotics, and the identification and control of infected sites. Though outcomes have improved with the bundled deployment of these strategies, mortality remains high at 20 - 30%. Despite over a hundred phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of pharmacological agents with the potential to improve sepsis outcomes, only antibiotics have demonstrated reproducible benefits.\n\nDespite decades of research, no specific treatment of the dysregulated host response has proven effective. There is strong biologic plausibility to modulate the PCSK9 pathway in sepsis patients. Alirocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor that has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol in normal volunteers and in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nPatients admitted to a study site hospital with sepsis or septic shock associated with cardiovascular or respiratory failure will be considered for enrollment. Those meeting eligibility criteria and providing consent for study participation will be randomized to receive alirocumab or a placebo, administered once via IV over an approximately 30 \u00b1 10 minute infusion. Participants will be followed for 180 days."
