FAP-2286 is a peptidomimetic molecule that that binds to Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP). FAP is a transmembrane protein expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts, and has been shown to be present on a number of solid tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "Initially the investigator(s) will focus on imaging breast, pancreas, sarcoma, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, and head and neck cancer.\n\nSTUDY AIMS\n\n1. Determine the dosimetry for gallium-68 labelled (68Ga-) and 64Cu- FAP-2286.\n2. Evaluate the uptake and retention of radiotracer in a variety of solid tumors with FAP-2286.\n3. Evaluate the ability of FAP-2286 to detect metastatic disease.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES\n\n1. All cohorts: Safety of 68Ga- and 64Cu-FAP-2286.\n2. Cohort 1a: determine the organ dosimetry of 68Ga-FAP-2286.\n3. Cohort 1b: determine the organ dosimetry of 64Cu-FAP-2286.\n4. Cohort 2: To assess the feasibility of detecting tumor uptake using FAP-2286.\n5. Cohort 3: To determine the feasibility of detecting metastatic disease using FAP-2286.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES\n\n1. To detect the sensitivity of FAP-2286 PET compared to conventional imaging for the detection of metastatic disease, and when available sensitivity compared to Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET (FDG-PET).\n2. Correlation of FAP-2286 uptake with FAP expression determined by immunohistochemistry.\n3. Compare biodistribution of 68Ga-FAP-2286 and 64Cu-FAP-2286 in normal organs and blood pool based on renal function.\n4. Determine impact of administered dose of FAP-2286 on image quality.\n5. Compare the feasibility of detecting tumor uptake using 68Ga-FAP-2286 and 64Cu-FAP-2286\n\nA repeat radiolabeled FAP-2286 PET may be obtained after initiation of subsequent treatment in order to evaluate changes in PET uptake due to treatment effect. Patients will be followed for up to 3 days after the injection of radiolabeled ligand for evaluation of adverse events."
