Salvage therapy (treatment after standard treatment failed) needs to be improved. Rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin combination is a standard therapy for rrDLBCL and polatuzumab vedotin (PV) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b. PV has shown efficacy in the setting of rrDLBCL and can improve the response rates of standard salvage therapy.\n\nThis study will focus on subjects in the first relapse (one prior regimen) and will include both subjects who are transplant eligible and those who are transplant ineligible."
