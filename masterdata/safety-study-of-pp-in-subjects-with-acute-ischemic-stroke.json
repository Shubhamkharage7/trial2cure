Subjects will receive two doses of PP-007 infusion 24 \u00b1 6 hours apart in addition to the site-specific SOC protocol. PP-007 is PEGylated bovine carboxyhemoglobin and will be administered via IV infusion. The effects on collateral flow, infarct size and functional outcomes will be evaluated.",

Refractory BP (systolic \\>200 and/or diastolic \\>120 mmHg). 5. Confirmed diagnosis of septic embolus or bacterial endocarditis. 6. Aortic dissection. 7. Blood glucose \\<50 mg/dL (2.78 mmol) or \\>400 mg/dL (22.20 mmol). 8. Known bleeding disorder (e.g., coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia).\n\na. Platelet count \\<50,000/\u03bcL at Baseline b.

Evidence of intracranial mass (except for small non-clinically significant meningioma based on the Investigator's discretion).\n\n11. Intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm 12. Any condition or situation which may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study in the opinion of the Investigator.\n\n1. Parenchymal hematoma (PH-1 and PH-2)\n2. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage\n3. Hemicraniectomy\n4. Midline shift \u2265 8 mm\n5. Mass effect\n6. Significant cerebral edema Note: LVO and/or SVO will be allowed as long as the respective study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined above. The decision to administer the 2nd dose will be based on subject's safety and PI's discretion.",
