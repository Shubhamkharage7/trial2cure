Also assessed will be relevant safety and efficacy endpoints as compared to a two-to-one reference group.",

Participating subjects will be randomized and evaluated for implant passing, successful cuff closure, healing, adverse events, dyspareunia, and pain. Blinded follow-up will involve in-person visits at one week and six weeks. There will be additional unblinded follow-up in person at six months post-operatively and by telephone at 12 months post operatively."
