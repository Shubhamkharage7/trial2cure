The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of enrolling subjects and treatment adherence. The secondary objectives are to describe the safety and tolerability. Exploratory objectives are to assess the effect of ketamine/placebo on Depression, Anxiety, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Pain Intensity, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities as measured by PROMIS Anxiety Short Form 7a and the PROMIS-29 Profile v2.1 of Patient Reported Outcomes, as well as changes in circulatory inflammatory cytokines, blood glutamine levels, and other biomarkers of anxiety and/or depression."
