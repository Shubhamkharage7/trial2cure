            "briefSummary": "The proposed research aims to reduce obesity-related health disparities by promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors among African Americans (AAs), given the high disease burdens associated with low physical activity, insufficient sleep, and obesity. There will be two phases to the proposed research. Phase 1 (Aim 1) will encompass formative research and community engagement activities, and Phase 2 (Aim 2a and 2b) will be a randomized clinical trial.\n\nThe primary goal of Aim 1 is to conduct in-depth qualitative interviews in order to: (1) better understand sleep-related social contextual factors, knowledge, behaviors, and beliefs, and (2) discuss and receive feedback on an existing sleep intervention design and materials. The primary goal of Aim 2 is to explore the feasibility, satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of a sleep intervention to increase sleep and physical activity (PA) among sedentary and short sleeping (\u22646 hrs/night) African American adults with overweight/obesity, compared to a contact control group. (Aim 2a) An additional exploratory (Aim 2b) examines changes in cancer-relevant biomarkers between those who received the intervention vs the control condition (n = 20). Data will be collected from a sample of 20 participants (10 per condition) who volunteer to have their blood drawn pre- and post-intervention.\n\nThere are two phases of the study, and information gained during Phase 1 (Aim 1) will be used to inform Phase 2 (Aim 2). Thus, additional modifications to the protocol will be submitted prior to engagement in Phase 2."
