            "briefSummary": "The bedside use of ultrasound after central venous catheter (CVCs) insertion has lagged behind other applications in medicine, thus presenting an opportunity for innovative, evidence-based research that will influence clinician behavior. This research focuses on bedside ultrasound applications as an example, to evaluate clinical practice change. Chest radiographs are associated with delays in initiating time-critical interventions and present an unexamined opportunity for improving patient care by evaluating the use of ultrasound in lieu of chest radiographs after CVC insertion. Strategic interventions for implementation are needed to hasten the adoption of this clinical innovation (ultrasound guided CVC confirmation protocol) allowing them to de-implement chest xrays when no longer indicated.",
            "detailedDescription": "The placement of central venous catheters (CVCs) is a common procedure performed in critically ill patients, with millions placed annually. The routine use of chest radiographs for CVC confirmation is outdated. Chest radiographs are associated with delays in initiating time-critical interventions and present an unexamined opportunity for improving resource utilization and associated costs. Radiography has been used for over 50 years for this purpose in the absence of other options. Emerging evidence suggests that a post-procedure chest radiographs are unnecessary when ultrasound is used to confirm catheter position and exclude pneumothorax (PCEP). Yet few in the medical community are likely aware of these data and even among those who are aware, chest radiographs continues to be the routine modality used for CVC PCEP.\n\nThe average 17 years it takes to translate clinical research into practice is too long and presents an opportunity to expedite implementation of innovations in critical care medicine. For the proposed project, \"De-Implementation Of Routine Chest Radiographs After Adoption of Ultrasound Guided Insertion and Confirmation of Central Venous Catheter Protocol (DRAUP)\", the hypothesis is that identifying determinants of behavior for intervention development (Aim 1) will increase the likelihood of developing successful strategies that will yield faster clinical adoption. Understanding the behavioral adaptations that have to occur is key to developing strategies that increase the uptake of evidence into healthcare practice and improving health outcomes. These strategies (targeting adoption and substitution) will then be implemented in a local Emergency Department (Aim 2) to determine if these selected implementation strategies will increase provider adoption, fidelity, and organizational penetrance (Aim 3) of ultrasound-guided CVC PCEP. A good clinical outcome would be a decrease in provider dependence on chest radiographs after ultrasound-guided CVC PCEP."
