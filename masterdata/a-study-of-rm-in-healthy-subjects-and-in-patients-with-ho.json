Cohorts in Parts A and B are double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized 2:1 (4 subjects receive RM-718, 2 subjects receive placebo). Part C evaluates open-label dose escalation in patients 12 to 65 years of age with HO. Study participants will receive: 1 weekly dose of either RM-718 or placebo in Part A, 4 weekly doses of either RM-718 or placebo in Part B, and 4 weekly doses of open-label RM-718 in Part C. Study drug (RM-718 or placebo) doses are administered weekly via subcutaneous injection."
