            "briefSummary": "This project will develop a data-driven decision making model to assess a competitive athlete's readiness to return to sport after ACL injury and surgery safely.",
            "detailedDescription": "One hundred pre-collegiate or collegiate athlete participants will be recruited for this study. The duration of the treatment plan will be 24 months. Each of the participants will be qualified for the study due to falling within all inclusion criterion and no exclusion criterion. The screening of the inclusion criterion will occur at visit one of the study. At this time, the AREF Research Team will review and collect informed consent from each participant. Visit two will occur three (3) months after each participant's ACL reconstruction surgery. At this time, an evaluation by the treating physician will occur along with functional movement assessment and MRI. Visit three will occur six (6) months after each participant's ACL reconstruction surgery. At this time, an evaluation by the treating physician will occur along with functional movement assessment and MRI. Visit four will occur nine (9) months after each participant's ACL reconstruction surgery. At this time, an medical evaluation by the treating leading physician will occur along with functional movement assessment and MRI. Visit five will occur twelve (12) months after each participant's ACL reconstruction surgery. At this time, an evaluation by the treating physician will occur along with functional movement assessment and MRI. Visit six will occur eighteen (18) months after each participant's ACL reconstruction surgery. At this time, an evaluation by the treating physician will occur along with functional movement assessment and MRI. Visit seven will occur twenty-four (24) months after each participant's ACL reconstruction surgery. At this time, an evaluation by the treating physician will occur along with functional movement assessment and MRI. At each time point, the treating physician or the therapist performing the functional movement assessment can choose to limit the functional movement assessment if there are concerns that the patient may not be ready for the expected load of one or more elements of the functional movement assessment.\n\nAt each monthly time point after ACL reconstruction, patient reported outcomes will be collected by the research team to assist in assessing the overall health and confidence in return to sport for each athlete. The following patient reported outcomes will be collected in written or electronic format after informed consent has been obtained from each participant: Sports Participation, Reinjury, Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, IKDC, PROMIS, SANE."
