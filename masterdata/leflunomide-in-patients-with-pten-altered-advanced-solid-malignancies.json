Adverse events such as alopecia, hypothyroidism, and neuropathy are allowed. Other adverse events may be allowed by permission of the principal investigator.\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* A known history of acute or chronic Hepatitis B or C, due to the known potential hepatotoxicity of leflunomide.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to leflunomide or teriflunomide.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.",
