Participants will be older adult patients of the clinic who present with objectively measurable cognitive dysfunction, and who elect to voluntarily participate in the study.\n\nParticipants' cognitive function will be assessed using validated objective (NIH Toolbox) and subjective (NIH Neuro-Quality of Life questionnaires) instruments. The primary outcomes are change from baseline to six months post-baseline in these two instruments.\n\nAdditionally, physical activity and sleep data will be tracked using wearable telemetry, and neurophysiological parameters will be measured with electroencephalography. Detailed treatment descriptions and adverse events will be tracked."
