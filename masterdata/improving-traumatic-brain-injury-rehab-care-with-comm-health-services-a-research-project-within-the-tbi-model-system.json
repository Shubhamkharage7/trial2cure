            "briefSummary": "TBI rehabilitation care transitions refer to the processes of preparing patients, families, and community-based healthcare providers for the patient's passage from inpatient rehabilitation to the home and community or to another level of care. Persons with TBI have heterogenous neurological impairment (cognitive and behavioral foremost, along with motor, sensory, and balance), that limits their functional independence and participation, and increases their risk for secondary medical conditions, injuries, rehospitalizations and early mortality",
            "detailedDescription": "Once people with TBI and their care partners enter the post-acute care landscape, they must navigate fragmented health care systems, interact with providers who may be unfamiliar with TBI, and discover their own services and supports. Inpatient rehabilitation provides high levels of structure and professional support that are impossible to replicate when constructing a home environment to independently manage day-to-day care. Once home, the person with TBI's physical, cognitive, behavioral, and medical needs can easily overwhelm even the most committed care partners. Community health workers (CHWs) through a combination of care coordination, advocacy, and direct service delivery, have the potential to address TBI care partners' needs, particularly those from low income and/or traditionally underserved minority groups. CHWs are well-suited to fill resource gaps that TBI care partners have difficulty finding, including: (1) finding diagnostic, treatment, and social services; (2) assisting with referrals; (3) providing health education and motivational interviewing to support behavioral health change; (4) collecting and managing clinical data; (5) facilitating productive relationships between health services and communities, and (6) offering psychosocial support."
