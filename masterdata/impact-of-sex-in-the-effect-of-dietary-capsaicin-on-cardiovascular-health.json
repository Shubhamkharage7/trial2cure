            "briefSummary": "The investigators long-term goal is to better understand novel interventions to promote cardiovascular health in humans. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate whether there is sex-specificity in the effects of dietary capsaicin on mechanisms regulating nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, its effect on key markers of cardiovascular (CV) health, including BP, macro- and microvascular function, and arterial stiffness. This knowledge will provide critical insight into the effects of dietary capsaicin on CV health and will guide future trials.",
            "detailedDescription": "Specific Aim 1: Determine the sex-specific effects of dietary capsaicin on central and peripheral blood pressure and arterial stiffness. The investigators hypothesize that dietary capsaicin intervention (6 week) will improve BP and arterial stiffness, likely in a sex-dependent manner. The investigators will measure heart rate variability and excretion of capsaicin and metabolites to ascertain bioavailability, and understand the mechanistic role of the autonomic nervous system, in capsaicin's effect on BP.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Assess whether dietary capsaicin effects on vascular function is sex-specific. The investigators hypothesize that dietary capsaicin intervention (6 week) will improve NO bioavailability, through improved redox balance and lowered asymmetric dimethylarginine, thereby improving peripheral vascular function, likely in a sex-dependent manner.\n\nUtilizing a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, design the investigators will investigate whether there is sex-specificity in the effects of a 6-week dietary capsaicin intervention on nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, BP, vascular function, and arterial stiffness."
