In the ongoing Actuate 1801 study in a cohort of over 90 patients with advanced refractory malignancies, 9-ING-41 has exhibited no significant toxicity, including no myelosuppression, and significant anti-tumor activity. 9-ING-41 also has significant pre-clinical ability to reverse pathologic fibrosis in multiple models of pulmonary and pleural fibrosis. 9-ING-41 is very highly active against neuroblastoma in diverse pre-clinical models. This Phase 1 study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 9-ING-41, as a single agent or in combination with irinitecan, in paediatric patients with advanced malignancies and thus to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further paediatric patient studies."

Neurologic deficits in patients with CNS tumors must have been relatively stable for at least 7 days prior to study enrollment. Patients with CNS tumors who are receiving steroids must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 7 days prior to study entry.

Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Girls of childbearing potential must have a negative baseline blood or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of first study therapy. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use hormonal or barrier birth control with spermicidal gel, or total abstinence to avoid pregnancy for the duration of study participation and in the following 100 days after discontinuation of study treatment (see Section 4.1.1).\n11. All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent. The investigational nature and objectives of the trial, the procedures and treatments involved and their attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the patient or the patient's parents or guardian if the patient is a child, and a signed informed consent and assent will be obtained according to institutional guidelines\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from trial entry:\n\n1.
