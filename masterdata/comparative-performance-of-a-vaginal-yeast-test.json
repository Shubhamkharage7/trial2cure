To determine the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the lay user-performed SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test in comparison to the Reference Method (vaginal Candida yeast culture)\n2. To determine the concordance between the results determined by lay user-performed SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test -vs. trained user-performed SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\n1.

We estimate that it will require a total enrollment of up to 600 symptomatic women at all clinical sites combined, to achieve the target of at least n=216 Reference Method (vaginal Candida yeast culture) positives. In addition, a combined total of 320 asymptomatic women will be enrolled in the study from the four clinical sites combined, to achieve the target of at least n=170 Reference Method (vaginal Candida yeast culture) negatives.\n\nThree, large, regional, DoD military treatment facilities (MTFs)\n\n1.

The SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test is designed for use by women experiencing vaginal symptoms, including: increased vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, vaginal soreness and irritation, rash on the labia, and genital burning that may worsen during urination. The SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test is indicated for over-the-counter use."
