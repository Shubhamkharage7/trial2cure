In random order, healthy physically active adults will consume provided diets low in fiber and supplemented with SCFA-enriched high amylose maize starch (a poorly digested resistant starch considered a fermentable fiber) or low amylose maize starch (a rapidly digestible starch) for 1-week separated by a \u22652-week washout. At the end of each intervention period, participants will complete an endurance exercise bout followed by a time trial. Biological samples will be collected to assess muscle and whole body metabolism, gut microbiota, inflammation, and gastrointestinal function."
