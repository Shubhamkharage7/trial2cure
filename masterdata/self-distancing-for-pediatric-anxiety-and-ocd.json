            "briefSummary": "Self-Distancing is a cognitive technique that involves shifting perspective away from first person to promote an adaptive, self-reflective stance in emotionally charged situations. This trial aims to help learn how self-distancing may increase approach during exposure and thereby improve treatment response. To find out if self-distancing works by helping children approach fear inducing stimuli, the study will look at behaviors related to approach as well as symptom severity, before, after and during treatment.\n\nThe study hypothesizes that Self-Distancing will produce greater increases in approach behaviors and greater decreases in anxiety severity than in the Classic Exposure.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pediatric anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) affect 1 in 3 youth by adolescence and increase risk for depression, substance use, school dropout, and suicide. Therapy involving repeated exposure to feared stimuli is the gold-standard for affected youth, however, as many as 50% of those treated continue to struggle with illness. Theory suggests that to be effective, patients must fully engage with (i.e., approach) feared stimuli to learn that feared outcomes do not occur. Yet, approaching feared stimuli is difficult for anyone, and particularly aversive for clinically anxious youth who are highly motivated to avoid anxiety- inducing situations. Strategies to increase approach during exposure therapy could improve exposure therapy response in anxious and OCD- affected youth."
