            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of intraperitoneal oxaliplatin and fluorouracil in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the peritoneal cavity (peritoneal metastasis). Oxaliplatin is in a class of medications called platinum-containing antineoplastic agents. It damages the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill cancer cells. Both oxaliplatin and fluorouracil are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with colorectal cancer, however administration of these drugs directly into the area between the muscles and organs in the abdomen (intraperitoneal) for the treatment of peritoneal metastases is experimental. Giving oxaliplatin and fluorouracil directly into the peritoneal space may be a safe and effective way of treating patients with peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine safety, tolerability, and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal (IP) fluorouracil (5FU)+oxaliplatin.\n\nII. Determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of IP 5FU+oxaliplatin both in blood and peritoneal fluid.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine tumor-cell intrinsic effects, modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, and changes in the makeup of circulating immune cells in response to IP 5FU+oxaliplatin.\n\nII. Identify preliminary response from IP 5FU+oxaliplatin: assess the rate of conversion from unresectable to resectable (determined by peritoneal carcinomatosis index \\[PCI\\] decreasing to \\< 20) and response rates by imaging criteria.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 5FU and oxaliplatin followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients undergo placement of indwelling IP port for chemotherapy infusion. Patients receive oxaliplatin and 5FU over 1-2 hours via IP infusion on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo diagnostic laparoscopy, biopsy, computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and collection of blood samples at screening and on study and undergo collection of IP fluid samples on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days. Patients with confirmed disease progression or who start a new anti-cancer therapy are followed up every 12 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, or end of study."
