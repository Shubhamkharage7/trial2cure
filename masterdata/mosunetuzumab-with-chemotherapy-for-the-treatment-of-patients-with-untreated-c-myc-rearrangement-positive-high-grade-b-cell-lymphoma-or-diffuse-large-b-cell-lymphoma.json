            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib/II clinical trial tests the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of mosunetuzumab with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with untreated, c-Myc rearrangement positive, high grade B cell lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as mosunetuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and prednisone work in different ways to stop the growth of cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving mosunetuzumab with chemotherapy may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with untreated, c-Myc rearrangement positive, high grade B cell lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the mosunetuzumab (M) plus dose-adjusted (DA) etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone \\[EPOCH\\] combination in previously untreated c-Myc + high-grade B cell lymphoma. (Phase Ib) II. Evaluate the efficacy of M DA EPOCH as complete response (CR) in previously untreated c-Myc + high grade B cell lymphoma. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the efficacy of M DA EPOCH in Phase Ib and II as overall response, durability of response, and survival.\n\nII. Ongoing evaluation of the toxicity and tolerability of M DA EPOCH. (Phase Ib and II) III. Summarize DA EPOCH treatment details when received as part of M DA EPOCH. (Phase Ib and II)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess utilization and benefit of tocilizumab for toxicity management. (Phase Ib and II) II. Assess toxicity of M DA EPOCH based on immune related AEs (irAEs). (Phase Ib and II) III. Identify baseline factors of response and progression. (Phase Ib and II) IV. Assess the immune response to mosunetuzumab in the setting of the M DA EPOCH regimen. (Phase Ib and II)\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive mosunetuzumab intravenously (IV), over 2-4 hours, on day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Patients receive etoposide IV, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on days 1-4, cyclophosphamide IV, over 2 hours, on day 5 and prednisone orally (PO) twice per day (BID) on days 1-5 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 6 cycles. Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, tumor biopsy and may undergo echocardiography or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) at screening and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months for 3 years."
