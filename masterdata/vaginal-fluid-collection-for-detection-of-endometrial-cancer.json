            "detailedDescription": "For participants providing written informed consent to participate in the study, samples of vaginal fluid will be obtained by the Principal Investigator (PI) during a pelvic examination. All vaginal fluid samples will be collected \u22657 days after the endometrial biopsy and prior to initiating any therapeutic interventions including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or hormonal therapy PIs will be provided with multiple, individually packaged Copan eNat\u00ae sterile sample collection kits including a swab and a transport tube containing a stabilizer and preservative medium as well as a pre-addressed shipping container and single-use tubes of sterile saline solution After vaginal fluid sample collection, the swab will be inserted into the tube for storage and subsequent shipping to the Sponsor's designated laboratory. The samples can be stored at ambient temperature and should be shipped to the designated laboratory within 24 hours of collection. Site(s) will provide the Sponsor with de-identified endometrial biopsy histopathology report and post-surgery histopathology report (if any) confirming the histopathological diagnosis of EC, AEH or EIN. The final diagnosis will be based on the most severe clinical histopathology (at diagnostic endometrial sampling or surgery.)"
