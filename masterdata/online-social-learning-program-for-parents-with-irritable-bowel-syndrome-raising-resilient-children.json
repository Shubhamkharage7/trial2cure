            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test efficacy of the REACH program in parents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and their young children. The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n-How can parents with IBS help their young kids develop healthy habits?\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete online surveys and to use a website. Researchers will compare results from parents who use one of two websites chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. One website focuses on child health and safety behaviors. The other website focuses on strategies to promote child wellness behaviors.",
            "detailedDescription": "To date, preventive interventions have not been applied to reduce intergenerational transmission of pain conditions. There are several reasons that abdominal pain presents an ideal model for this important work. Abdominal pain is the second most common recurrent pain complaint of childhood. It is associated with disruption of normal activity, including school attendance and poor quality of life, and is emotionally distressing for both children and parents. Research demonstrates that illness behaviors are linked to development of abdominal pain disorders in children.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that a social learning intervention modified toward a preventive focus for parents with IBS who have young children, ages 4-7 years, will reduce risk factors (anxiety, catastrophizing, parenting stress) and increase protective factors (positive affect, social support), resulting in lower parental solicitous behaviors, fewer child abdominal pain symptoms, reduced child health care utilization, and better child physical, psychological, social, and school functioning. The objective of the current application is to test the efficacy of an early preventive intervention targeting parents with IBS whose young children are thus at higher risk for developing abdominal pain. To enhance potential for scalability and dissemination, and meet parental preferences, the intervention is delivered via the internet."
