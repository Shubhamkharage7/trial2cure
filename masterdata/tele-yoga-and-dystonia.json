Subjects with cervical dystonia will complete yoga classes delivered at-home with videoconferencing, receiving one-on-one yoga instruction including breathing, postures, and meditation/relaxation for two to three times a week. Data collection will occur remotely via videoconferencing at 0-weeks (baseline), 6-weeks (after the intervention), and 12-weeks (follow-up). Data collection will include demographics, mental health questionnaires, motor assessments, enjoyment, usability, and follow-up yoga status. Each yoga session will be video recorded to aide in recording adherence, adverse events, and challenges."
