            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-institutional study investigating postoperative or adjuvant human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-directed therapy with adjuvant ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in HER2-positive salivary gland carcinomas (SGC).\n\nThis research study is:\n\n* Studying the use of T-DM1 in combination with radiation and chemotherapy; and the use of maintenance T-DM1 alone for up to a year after surgery\n* Evaluating the effectiveness, safety, and toxicity of T-DM1\n\nT-DM1 is a specialized antibody targeting HER-2 (a protein that is expressed in some breast and salivary gland cancers). The drug is a HER-2 antibody that is bound to a chemotherapy agent (DM1) and delivered intravenously. T-DM1 then binds cancer cells that express HER-2 and is taken up into the cell to allow DM1 to kill cancer cells in a more targeted way. This allows the use of a targeted treatment along with chemoradiation to treat HER-2 expressing salivary cancers.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved T-DM1 for HER2-positive salivary gland cancer but it has been approved for other uses (for breast cancers that express HER2 protein).\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nThis research study involves radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy given after surgery for up to 1-year, and participants will be followed for 3 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 55 people will take part in this research study.\n\nGenentech is supporting this research study by providing the research study drug, T-DM1."
