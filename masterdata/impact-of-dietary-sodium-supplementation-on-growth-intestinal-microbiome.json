            "detailedDescription": "Premature infants are at an increased risk of postnatal growth failure and as well as developing short or long-term impaired neurodevelopment and cardio metabolic health.\n\nFor many years, it has been recognized that ideal growth is attainable with sufficient sodium intake and a positive sodium balance. The results of this study could have a significant impact on the care of preterm infants.\n\nInfants will be randomized into one of two groups. One group will receive sodium supplementation as guided by a urine sodium concentration algorithm, one group will be managed by current standards. Randomization will occur at 2 weeks of postnatal age\n\nStandard of care group Care for the participant will remain the same as if they were not in the study. Nutritional information, including sodium intake will be collected on three separate days weekly for 8 weeks. Stool samples will be collected for determining intestinal microbiome at 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 8 weeks and the day they are discharged from the hospital.\n\nThe study team will also collect detailed health information from participants hospital stay from the medical chart. Which will include gestational age, birth weight, sex, race ,ethnicity, mode of delivery and exposure to any steroids, antibiotics and clinical diagnoses.\n\nSodium supplementation group:\n\nParticipants will receive sodium supplementation per the urine sodium concentration algorithm. Urine sodium will be determined weekly, and if urine sodium concentration is below set value, dietary sodium supplementation is provided."
