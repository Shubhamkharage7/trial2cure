            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates a culturally tailored educational outreach intervention for increasing clinical trial knowledge, referral, and participation among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. Clinical trials are research studies that involve people. Through clinical trials, researchers are able to determine whether new treatments are safe and effective and work better than current treatments. Clinical trials can also help find new ways to prevent and detect cancer and improve the quality of life for people during and after treatment. Recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in clinical trials remains a challenge. Racial and ethnic minority groups bear a disproportionate burden of cancer compared with other groups yet these populations continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials. This clinical trial uses community health educators (CHEs) to facilitate individual and group education sessions to improve knowledge of what constitutes a clinical trial, the value of participating in clinical trials, and why it is important for racial/ethnic minorities to participate in clinical trials.",

To implement culturally tailored educational outreach activities with the goal of increasing clinical trial (CT) knowledge, referral and participation among racial/ethnic and rural populations.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants attend an educational session with CHEs and receive educational materials on study."
