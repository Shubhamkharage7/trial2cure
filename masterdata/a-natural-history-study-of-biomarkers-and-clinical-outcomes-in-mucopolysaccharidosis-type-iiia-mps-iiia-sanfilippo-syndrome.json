            "briefSummary": "This protocol is a decentralized, single cohort, natural history and biomarker study enrolling up to 20 participants with MPS IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome). At least 10 participants (\\~50%) must be less than four years old at the time of the Parent/LAR consent. The study will have a screening process and 7 study visits, e.g. home visits, that will consist of serum collection and completion of a remote assessment of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales 3rd Edition (Vineland-3)\n\nMPS IIIA remains a devastating disease with a high unmet medical need. There is currently a limited number of available data to adequately characterize the progression of the disease. Analysis of blood biospecimens and adaptive behavior in this study will help researchers better understand the clinical progression of MPS IIIA. A better understanding of disease progression may assist in developing novel therapies for rare genetic disorders."
