An outreach registry of primary care patients obtaining care at participating practices who meet study eligibility criteria will be created from the electronic medical record. 500 primary care patients will be randomly selected for the Outreach Contact with Decision Counseling (OCDC) Group from this outreach registry. Patients targeted for inclusion in the study will have a scheduled primary care appointment 18-23 days after initial outreach contact."
