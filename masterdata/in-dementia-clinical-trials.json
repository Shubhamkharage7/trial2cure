The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Can an intervention's outcome be better assessed by a latent variable (\"\u03b4\") integrating cognitive performance with functional status?\n* Can latent biomarkers of \u03b4 guide the selection of an intervention that will modulate dementia severity?\n* Can a latent variable, derived from information collected remotely from caregivers, preselect subjects most likely to respond to the intervention?\n* Is the effect of the intervention in fact medicated by changes in the targeted biomarker?\n\nIn this case, the biomarker will be a latent variable derived from several proteins measured in blood (i.e., so-called \"adipokines\"). The intervention will be donepezil, a medication approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, but only recently associated with adipokine changes.\n\nParticipants with cognitive impairment and their caregivers will be interviewed by telephone and those with cognitive impairment will be treated for six-months with donepezil. On the basis of the caregiver's report, the cognitively impaired subjects will be assigned to two groups based on a prediction of their response to donepezil. Researchers will compare those groups to see if dementia severity, as measured by \u03b4, improves in predicted responders, and whether the change in the d-score is mediated by changes in adipokines.",

To test donepezil's effect on dementia severity as measured by \u03b4.\n2. To test Adipokines as a mediator of donepezil's effect on \u03b4.\n\nEndpoints: Primary Endpoint: Dementia severity as measured by the latent phenotype \"\u03b4\" using the \"dTEL\" homolog.\n\nSecondary Endpoint: Change in Adipokines as a mediator of donepezil's effect on dTEL."

In Lieu of clinical diagnosis, the subject may proceed upon PI's review of cognitive testing done at pre-screening and baseline and their confirmation that the subject's scores are consistent with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's\n* Capacity to give informed consent. If a patient is found to clinically decline during the course of the study and no longer able to provide consent, continued participation will be evaluated by the PI on a case-by-case basis.\n* Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (15 item) score \u2264 6\n* No significant visual or hearing impairments\n* A standardized dECog score between 0.0 and -1.0 relative to ADNI's cohort\n* Assignment to \"Group 1\" by a LOI assessment of Adipokine adjusted v. unadjusted dECog scores.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A current self-reported diagnosis of \"Major Depression\" (treatment with \"antidepressants\" not exclusionary);\n* A history of psychosis, including visual hallucinations;\n* History or treatment for Parkinson's, or tremor, or Rapid Eye Movement (REM) behavior disorder;\n* History or treatment for atrial fibrillation;\n* History of bradycardia or syncopal events;\n* Chronic diarrhea, h/o colonic resection or irritable bowel syndrome;\n* Treatment for cancer in the last 5 years (excluding skin cancers);\n* Major surgery in the last year;\n* Treatment with anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers, neuroleptics, opiates, muscle relaxants, or systemic steroids.\n* Current treatment with any AChEI or past treatment within the last year.\n* Co-current treatment with any pharmacological intervention for dementia administered as either on or off label. Non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. Behavior Therapy) will be evaluated on a case by cases basis by the PI.\n* In the opinion of the PI, treatment with AChEI is not appropriate due to a possible negative risk/benefit ratio based on past medical history or endorsement of symptoms during the screening interview.\n* Co-participation in another study that the PI feels would pose a safety risk or adversely affect data integrity of this study.",
