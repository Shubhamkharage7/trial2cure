In brief, the primary endpoint is PSA50 response , defined by a 50% reduction in PSA from baseline . The secondary endpoints are assessing the PSA doubling time, radiographic and PSA PFS, safety and tolerability as defined by the incidence of grade 3 to 5 toxicities, and measuring overall survival."
