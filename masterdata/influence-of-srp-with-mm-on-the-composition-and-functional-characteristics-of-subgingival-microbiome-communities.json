            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of minocycline microspheres (MM) administered as an adjunct to scaling and rooting planning (SRP) on the subgingival community composition and metatranscriptome functional profile, in comparison to a group treated with SRP only and to periodontally-healthy subjects.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients attending the West Virginia University School of Dentistry Clinics will be invited to participate in this study. Thirty periodontitis patients (stage II, III or IV) with \u22654 teeth with a probing pocket depth (PPD) \\>4 mm; at least 1 tooth with a PPD \\>6 mm and clinical attachment loss (CAL) \u22652 mm, and radiographic evidence of bone loss will be recruited.\n\nClinical examination will include measurement of clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque score (PS) at 6 sites per tooth. Furcation involvement (FI) will also be recorded. Radiographic examination will include full-mouth radiographic series. Patients will receive a clinical examination at baseline (V1, before periodontal therapy), and their subgingival plaque biofilms will be sampled at a second visit (V2) two weeks after this initial exam to collect subgingival plaque not disrupted by the examination procedures.\n\nSubjects will be then randomized to one of two groups: SRP only and SRP + MM. Periodontal therapy will consist of one visit (V3) full-mouth SRP alone or in combination with MM placed at all sites regardless of PPD. Each site will receive 1mg of MM for a total of 6mg of MM per tooth. In this manner we will also evaluate whether MM modifies the microbiome of shallow sites, since subgingival microbiome dysbiosis affects shallow sites of subjects with periodontitis and therefore represents a risk for future disease progression.\n\nSubjects will be evaluated 2 months after receiving periodontal therapy (V4). At this visit subgingival plaque samples will be collected and clinical outcomes evaluated. Clinical examinations and plaque collection will be conducted by one calibrated examiner.\n\nFifteen periodontally-healthy subjects will also be recruited from the West Virginia University School of Dentistry Clinics. Subjects will receive a clinical examination and their subgingival communities sampled at the same visit (V1)."
