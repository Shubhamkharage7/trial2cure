            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to find out if a 9 week group therapy using video from home will help veterans with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* is the video therapy user-friendly for veterans?\n* does it improve veterans well-being and quality-of-life?\n\nVeterans will be asked to attend nine 1 hour small group video sessions and will complete questionnaires before and after the sessions.\n\nResearchers will compare the group of veterans that starts the video sessions right away with a group that waits before starting the video sessions.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will be achieved by conducting a two-arm, single-blind, pilot randomized controlled trial at two VA medical centers. Eighty participants at each site will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the MiND-MCI group or waitlist control group. Participants will be Veterans ages 60 and older with a diagnosis of MCI, at least one cardiovascular risk factor, self-reported cognitive complaint, and self-reported difficulty adjusting to MCI diagnosis or symptoms. MiND-MCI will be delivered in nine weekly 60-minute sessions via telehealth in groups of 5 to 7 Veterans. Feasibility and acceptability process data will be tracked throughout the study. Acceptability measures pertaining to participants' perceptions of MiND-MCI will be collected at post-treatment using quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. Outcome measures collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 12-week follow-up will assess global QoL, MCI-related QoL, MCI-related self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, loneliness, coping, and cognitive functioning."
