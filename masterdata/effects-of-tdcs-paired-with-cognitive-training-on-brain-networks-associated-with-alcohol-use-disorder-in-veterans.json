            "briefSummary": "Alcohol misuse is an epidemic among Veterans in the United States. Nearly 1/3 of Veterans have a lifetime history of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). In 2014, there were 15,306 unique patients treated in inpatient VA treatment programs alone, which represents a 10.7% increase from just two years prior. Unfortunately, about 2/3 of those entering treatment will relapse within one year.\n\nCognitive impairments found in chronic alcohol use interfere with adaptive behavior needed for successful recovery. These cognitive impairments and their underlying neural substrates may provide promising new targets for interventions that can reduce relapse rates. Evidence suggests that cognitive training can improve cognition in individuals with AUD, strengthen neural networks mediating cognition, and improve treatment outcome. However, cognitive training is effort intensive, has small effect sizes, and may have limited durability. The primary objective of this study is to investigate if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase the effectiveness of cognitive training to enhance cognition in alcohol use disorder and improve treatment outcome."
