            "briefSummary": "This study will be the first in vivo human multimodal neuroimaging study exploring the relationship between mGluR5 availability (PET), neural oscillations (EEG), and cognitive function in people with CUD. The goal is to test the overall hypothesis that mGluR5 availability is higher in people with CUD compared with HC. In Aim 1, the investigators will determine differences in mGluR5 availability between people with CUD and HC in the fronto-limbic brain circuit. Aim 2 examines the associations between mGluR5 availability, CUD severity, neural oscillations, and cognitive function in CUD subjects. Aim 3 will determine how prolonged abstinence from chronic cannabis use affects mGluR5 availability, neural oscillations, and cognitive function in CUD subjects.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cannabis use and availability continue to rise significantly in the US. It is critical to expand our knowledge of the negative and positive effects of cannabis to \"catch up\" to the current reality of widespread and growing use. Cannabis and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), its primary psychoactive chemical, have widespread effects on neural glutamate homeostasis, and specifically metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). mGluR5 regulates transmission of glutamate and plays a critical role in neural plasticity (i.e., long-term potentiation; LTP), memory, learning, mood, and addiction. Specifically, it is thought that mGluR5 activation by glutamate initiates production of endocannabinoids (i.e., 2-AG) that bind retrograde to presynaptic cannabinoid receptor 1. This pathway inhibits further glutamate release and modulates synaptic plasticity diffusely in the brain. However, cannabis use disrupts this normal mechanism of glutamate homeostasis. While the relationship between cannabis use and glutamate regulation has been explored in preclinical models, it has not been well-characterized in humans, and particularly in people with cannabis use disorder (CUD).\n\nThe goal is to test the overall hypothesis that mGluR5 availability is higher in people with CUD compared with HC. This study will advance our understanding of cannabis effects on the neural glutamate system in humans and may lead to the development of novel therapeutics and biomarkers to treat people with CUD. Aim 1 will determine differences in mGluR5 availability between people with CUD and HC in the fronto-limbic brain circuit. Aim 2 examines the associations between mGluR5 availability, CUD severity, neural oscillations, and cognitive function in CUD subjects. Aim 3 will determine how prolonged abstinence from chronic cannabis use affects mGluR5 availability, neural oscillations, and cognitive function in CUD subjects."
