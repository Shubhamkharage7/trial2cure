The primary research question we aim to answer through this study is: Among youth ages 15-19, does the Many Ways of Being program reduce unprotected sex (through consistent and correct use of condoms and contraceptives) compared to the a career readiness program, which does not include sexual health components?\n\nAs part of the study, participants will be asked to:\n\n* Attend approximately 14 hours and 40 minutes of programming completed over 4-8 weeks\n* Complete baseline, post-intervention, and 9-month follow-up surveys\n* For select participants who received the MWB program, participate in an optional focus group discussion\n\nThe local evaluation will focus on the impact of the entire MWB intervention, as compared to a similar-length control program focused on career readiness."
