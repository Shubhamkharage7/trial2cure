Determine if the app-based training increases self-compassion, non-reactivity and non-judging about inner experiences.\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* Use an app-based mindfulness training program\n* Complete online surveys at baseline, immediately post-intervention and 1 month after the post-intervention as follow up"
