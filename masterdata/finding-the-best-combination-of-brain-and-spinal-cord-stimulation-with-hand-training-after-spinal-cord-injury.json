            "briefSummary": "While physical exercise remains the foundation for any rehabilitation therapy, the team seeks to improve the benefits of exercise by combining it with the concept of \"Fire Together, Wire Together\" - when brain stimulation is synchronized with spinal cord stimulation, nerve circuits in the spinal cord strengthen - a phenomenon termed \"Spinal Cord Associative Plasticity\", or SCAP.\n\nThis project will build on the team's promising preliminary findings. When one pulse of brain stimulation is synchronized with one pulse of cervical spinal stimulation, hand muscle responses are larger than with brain stimulation alone or unsynchronized stimulation. However, the team does not know the best ways to apply SCAP repetitively, especially in conjunction with exercise, to increase and extend improvements in clinical function. Do ideal intervention parameters vary across individuals, or do they need to be customized?\n\nThe team will take a systematic approach with people who have chronic cervical SCI to determine each person's best combination of SCAP with task-oriented hand exercise. Participants will undergo roughly 50 intervention, verification, and follow-up sessions over 6 to 10 months each. The team will measure clinical and physiological responses of hand and arm muscles to each intervention.\n\nRegaining control over hand function represents the top priority for individuals with cervical SCI. Furthermore, this approach could be compatible with other future interventions, including medications and cell-based treatments.",
