            "detailedDescription": "The efficacy of the Unified Protocol for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (UP-CBT) combined with commercial FDA-approved Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) will be tested in comparison to CGM only in a randomized controlled clinical trial. The central hypothesis is that the addition of the UP-CBT intervention will yield clinically significant improvements in anxiety and depressive symptom severity and glycemic control relative to CGM alone. We will recruit 94 adults (age 18-64) with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes and an anxiety or depressive disorder from a national population for an entirely virtual 12-month study over five years, with targeted recruitment of racial/ethnic minorities. In addition to standard measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for glycemic control and validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) surveys, the study integrates momentary psychological and behavioral data via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with CGM data to assess day-to-day changes in affect, self-management, and glycemia over the course of the trial.\n\nQualitative information will be collected from people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) ages 35-64 to solicit suggestions and inform future study decisions. We will create 2-4 focus groups to ask their impressions about our current study and to explore key factors like establishing adult care and attending medical appointments, disease self-management, and adjusting to chronic disease. We will compare interview responses from participant groups who have high vs. low social needs and poor vs. good glycemic control."

To the extent that the relationship between emotional disorders and diabetes is bidirectional, a common assumption across research studies in this area, the comparison condition should benefit anxiety and depression outcomes through improved glycemic control and diabetes self-management.",
