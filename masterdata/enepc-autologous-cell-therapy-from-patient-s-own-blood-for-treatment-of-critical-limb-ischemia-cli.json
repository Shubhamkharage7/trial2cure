            "detailedDescription": "BGC101 is designed to treat peripheral vascular disease in patients suffering from Critical Leg Ischemia (CLI) also referred to as chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI).\n\nThis part of the study is designed as a placebo double-blind randomized controlled trial (CRT) assessing the safety and efficacy of BGC101 in 45 eligible subjects in 2 Arms: Arm A: BGC101 treatment and Arm B: Placebo treatment. The Arm A:Arm B ratio is 2:1 A single dose treatment of the personalized cells by intramuscular injections into the affected leg takes less than 10 minutes.\n\nCells from a standard blood draw (with no pre-treatment, bone marrow aspiration, mobilization or apheresis) are transformed, within a day, into the investigational medicinal product BGC101.\n\nBGC101, intended for autologous use, is a 'ready-to-use' cell suspension in prefilled syringes."
