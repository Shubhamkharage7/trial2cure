            "briefSummary": "The overall goal of this study is to develop, adapt and evaluate an intergenerational prevention intervention, named \"Wak\u021f\u00e1\u014bye\u017ea (Little Holy One),\" with Native American caregivers on a Northern Plains reservation and the caregivers' 2-to-5-year-old children. The intervention aims to: 1) reduce symptoms of historical trauma and everyday stress among parents/caregivers, 2) improve parenting, and 3) improve children's emotional and behavioral developmental outcomes to reduce future risk for suicide and substance use.",
            "detailedDescription": "The scientific premise of this work is rooted in understanding that high rates of historical and current trauma in Native communities compromise caregivers' mental health and parenting, which in turn affect early childhood behavior problems and adverse events that increase children's risk for suicide and substance use in adolescent and young adulthood.\n\nWak\u021f\u00e1\u014bye\u017ea will combine adapted elements of: 1) Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), an evidence-based intervention proven effective to reduce stress, depression and trauma-related symptoms, 2) Family Spirit, an evidence-based parent training program to promote positive early child development in Native American communities, and 3) cultural components informed by tribal-specific risk and protective factors for suicide and substance abuse identified in community-based studies that led to this proposal. The intervention will consist of 12 weekly individual lessons taught to parents and children (ages 2 to 5) at Head Start facilities by indigenous community health workers, a delivery strategy selected to enhance participant engagement, local acceptability and sustainability.\n\nThis study will use a randomized control trial (RCT) with an embedded single-case experimental design (SCED) to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on mental health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while empirically exploring the added benefit of specific cultural components on parent/caregiver outcomes. The study plan is situated within a well-established trust relationship with tribal communities, innovative formative research that led to this proposal, and an experienced, multi-disciplined study team led by an Indigenous Principle Investigator.\n\nA supplement has been added to this clinical trial, the goal of the supplement is to add to our understanding of opioids and other substance use and suicide risk in Native communities by analyzing individual social network data to understand the relational factors that may increase both risk of suicide and opioid use and the relational characteristics of networks that act as protective factors for suicide and opioid use."
