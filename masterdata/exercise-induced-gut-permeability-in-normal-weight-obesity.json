            "briefSummary": "Exercise acutely increases gut permeability and inflammation, even in healthy populations. However, whether this response differs in groups at-risk for CVD that present with low-grade inflammation (e.g., normal-weight obesity) has yet to be examined. The investigators aim to measure serum indicators of gut permeability in those with normal-weight obesity pre- and post-short, intense exercise and sustained, moderate exercise",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigator's overall goal is to examine how indicators of gut permeability change in response to exercise in individuals with normal-weight obesity (i.e., normal body mass index \\[BMI\\] and high body fat percent) relative to those with a normal BMI and low body fat percent and those with a BMI in the obesity range and high body fat percent.\n\nThe investigators will examine indicators of gut permeability (specified in primary outcomes) in response to a short, intense bout of exercise (i.e., VO2 max test on a cycle ergometer) and sustained, moderate bout of exercise (i.e., 45 minutes at 65% measured VO2 max on a cycle ergometer).\n\nAdditionally, the investigators will measure basic anthropometrics, blood lipids and glucose, and body composition with DXA."
