            "briefSummary": "This is an early phase, proof-of-concept clinical trial assessing the safety and feasibility of non-invasive spinal cord stimulation to prevent respiratory muscle atrophy in mechanically ventilated ARDS patients. The investigators will recruit 10 elective surgery patients (surgery cohort) and 10 ARDS patients (ARDS cohort) for this study. A non-invasive, alpha-prototype Restore Technology stimulator using hydrogel surface electrodes will be used to stimulate the spinal cord at the cervical or thoracic level.",
            "detailedDescription": "Stimulation will be conducted in closed-loop fashion at the start of inspiratory cycle. Signal from a chest belt will be used to synchronize stimulation with ventilator and prevent interference with ventilator (see Protection of Human Subjects). Prior to treatment stimulation, mapping will be conducted at 1 Hz with electrodes placed in locations identified to be optimal in the surgery cohort. Assessment of evoked EMG responses from respiratory muscles will be conducted. Once this electrode configuration is confirmed as effective (capable of evoking EMG activity), stimulation with this configuration will be applied for treatment."
