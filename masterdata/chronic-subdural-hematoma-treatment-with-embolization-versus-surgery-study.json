The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Compared to open conventional surgery, does MMAE reduce the need for rescue surgery or deaths?\n* What is the safety of MMAE and conventional open surgery in these patients?\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* Share their medical history and undergo physical examinations\n* Have blood drawn\n* Have CT scans of the head\n* Answer questionnaires\n* Undergo MMAE or conventional open surgery\n* Provide information about possible adverse events Researchers will compare participants in the MMAE group with those in the conventional open surgery group to see if there is a reduced need for rescue surgery or deaths and evaluate safety."

Unable to withhold all antiplatelet agents or OACs for the first 7 days after randomization.\n7. Indication that withdrawal of care will be implemented for the qualifying SDH.\n8. Prior surgical treatment for CSDH if the surgery is less than 30 days prior to randomization.\n9. On tranexamic acid.\n10.

Known large diameter arteriovenous shunt, i.e., where the blood does not pass through an arterial/capillary/venous transition but directly from an artery to a vein or presence of patent extra-to-intracranial anastomoses (where study embolization devices could pass directly into the internal carotid artery, vertebral artery, or intracranial vasculature) that cannot be addressed with coil embolization.\n17. Patient has a known active systemic infection or sepsis.\n18. Patient is pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating.\n19. Life expectancy of less than 6 months due to comorbid terminal conditions.\n20. Concurrent participation in another research protocol for investigation of an experimental therapy.\n21.
