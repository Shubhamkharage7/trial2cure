            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition. People with MDD have occasional bouts of depressive symptoms; these bouts are called major depressive episodes (MDEs). Researchers want to know if people having MDEs have lower levels of an enzyme called PDE4B in their brains.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find out (1) if PDE4B can be detected in a person s brain using a special scanning method and (2) if brain PDE4B levels are lower in people having an MDE.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18-70 years with MDD. Healthy volunteers are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have up to 5 clinic visits.\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. They will have a test of their heart function. Some participants may have a psychiatric assessment; they will answer questions about their state of mind and related topics.\n\nParticipants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. They will lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder.\n\nParticipants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A needle will be used to guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into a vein in one arm. An experimental substance called a radioactive tracer (\\[18F\\]PF-06445974) will be injected through the catheter. Participants will lie on a table that slides into a doughnut-shaped machine. The scan will last up to 4 hours with a 15-minute break.\n\nParticipants blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing will be monitored before, during, and after the PET scan. A second catheter will be inserted in the artery of the wrist so blood can be drawn during the scan.\n\nSome participants may return for a second PET scan.\n\nhttps://nimhcontent.nimh.nih.gov/start/surveys/?s=KE88DXXPLDFHHTF8",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will examine whether phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) can be accurately quantified in the human brain and whether it is reduced in the brain of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine whether PDE4B is reduced in the brains of individuals with MDD experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE).\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo determine the optimal length of scanning and the retest variability and reliability of \\[18F\\]PF-06445974, and whether PDE4B binding correlates with clinical rating scales.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: measurement of PDE4B density (distribution volume VT) in the brains of individuals with MDD compared to healthy volunteers\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n1. To determine the optimal length for PDE4B scans with \\[18F\\]PF-06445974 PET scans in healthy volunteers\n2. To measure whole-brain VT of PDE4B in a retest setting.\n3. To assess the relationship between clinical rating scales and PDE4B binding"
