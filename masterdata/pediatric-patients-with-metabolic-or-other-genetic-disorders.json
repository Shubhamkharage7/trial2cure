            "briefSummary": "Background: Some patients with unusual genetic conditions are referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). They may not be eligible to join current research studies. Testing such patients is a good way to improve the skills of research staff. The findings could lead to new processes and research.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo recruit a diverse group of pediatric subjects with genetic disorders. To give clinic staff hands-on experience working with these patients.\n\nEligibility:\n\nChildren any age with a known or suspected genetic disorder.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They may have lab and other tests.\n\nFamily members may give DNA samples.\n\nParticipants will have:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nHeight, weight, and other measurements taken.\n\nA clinical evaluation of their disorder.\n\nThey may have:\n\nBlood, urine, and saliva samples taken\n\nImaging tests. These may include x-rays, scans, ultrasound, or skeletal survey.\n\nA sleep study\n\nA visit with other specialists at NIH\n\nA genetic test from a commercial lab\n\nMedical photographs taken\n\nOther tests\n\nParticipants may have follow-up visits. They may get medical or surgical treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The aim of this protocol is to allow genetic-related evaluations for patients with a variety of known or suspected genetic disorders, supplement and offer an additional opportunity for training in clinical genetics, dysmorphology and metabolic genetics in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). If not eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, patients with genetic-related conditions may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance the clinical skills of physicians participating in NICHD clinical research and training programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the subjects may receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder at the NIH CC according to current clinical practice. The overall purpose of genetic evaluations under this protocol is to support our clinical training and research missions. Family members of subjects evaluated on this protocol (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index case) may also be enrolled."
