            "briefSummary": "This study is being done to determine the feasibility and tolerability of a novel regimen of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS). SSRS delivers high doses of radiation to tumors of the spine using precision techniques.\n\nIn standard medical care, conventional SSRS is delivered in only 1 or 2 treatments. When this treatment is delivered in only 1-2 treatments, a high dose is used which can increase the side effects of treatment. This study aims to test an alternative technique of delivering SSRS over 5 treatments. By delivering the radiation therapy over multiple treatments, the dose of radiation is less per treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Given the limitations with conventional external-beam radiotherapy, spine stereotactic radiosurgery was developed as an alternative treatment for localized spine metastasis. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative treatment option to conventional palliative radiotherapy, which has gained acceptance over the last decade. Clinical experience with spine stereotactic radiosurgery has showed high rates of pain control and improvement in neurological function in patients with epidural compression."
