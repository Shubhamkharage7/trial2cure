This study is not testing an experimental drug.",

Examine the extent to which reductions in blood pressure (2 weeks of diuretic and 2 weeks of placebo) improve pain management among patients with chronic pain and hypertension compared.\n2. Examine the extent to which arterial baroreflex function, which is critical to blood pressure regulation, is impaired in patients with chronic pain and hypertension and is correlated with chronic pain symptoms."
