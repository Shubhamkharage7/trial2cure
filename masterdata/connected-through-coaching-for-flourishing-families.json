            "briefSummary": "Despite the known association between the quality of participant relational engagement with service providers and clinical outcomes, limited studies have examined caregiver Relational Responsiveness (RR) as a mechanism to achieve maltreatment prevention program outcomes. Using a realist-informed mixed method approach, this study will examine RR's role in mediating the effects of a community-based maltreatment prevention program, the Family Success Network (FSN) on protective factors against maltreatment and the contexts within which RR's mediation effects are activated or inhibited.",
            "detailedDescription": "Maltreatment prevention programs can promote public health by building protective factors among at-risk families. To maximize their benefits, programs should be delivered as intended by maintaining fidelity. Participant responsiveness (PR) is an under-studied fidelity construct defined as the degree to which participants \"respond to or are engaged by\" intervention at the behavioral, attitudinal, and relational levels. However, previous studies mostly focus on behavioral and attitudinal responsiveness such as attendance, follow-through, and satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to examine the role of participant Relational Responsiveness (RR) as a mechanism to increase protective factors against child maltreatment among the caregivers participating in the Family Success Network (FSN). The FSN is a community-based maltreatment prevention program piloted to serve 3 under-served counties in Ohio with high maltreatment rates. In FSN, coaches and families collaboratively develop a tailored plan of services designed to increase family protective factors. Focusing on primary and secondary prevention, FSN serves families with no history of substantiated maltreatment. Leveraging the parent study (clinicatrials registration currently in progress), which is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) funded by the Children's Bureau, the proposed study will pursue the following aims; 1) To examine the structural validity of the Relational Responsiveness (RR) measure among FSN participants; 2) To determine the degree to which RR mediates FSN effects and whether RR's mediation effects are moderated by caregiver race and gender; 3) To identify contexts within which RR's mediation effects are activated or inhibited using a realist informed mixed-method approach. The parent study focuses on FSN outcome and process evaluations. Aims 1 and 2 of this study will utilize quantitative data collected through the parent RCT (protective factors and Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised). Aim 3 will use mixed data involving the quantitative data collected through the parent RCT and the qualitative data to be collected in this study."
