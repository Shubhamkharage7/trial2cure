This new study will be similar in structure to pilot study, except that all completed screening questionnaires will be sent to the study site rather than only those deemed eligible according a computer algorithm. The investigators expect that this change will better serve the needs of both clinics and patients, and it will also allow us to assess whether the algorithm is overly restrictive, i.e., whether it is excluding patients who are in fact eligible for MA. The primary goal of the study is to collect data on feasibility of the approach and safety. Secondarily, the investigators aim to assess the ability of a defined set of responses to the screening questionnaire to predict the clinician's decision about whether a clinical consultation is needed."
