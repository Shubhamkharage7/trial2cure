            "detailedDescription": "To better understand the effects of hemp-derived CBD with and without a small amount of THC, we propose a Phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT) to examine the clinical effects of Full Spectrum CBD (fsCBD, contains less than 0.3% THC) vs. Broad Spectrum CBD (bsCBD, does not contain THC), vs. a matching placebo in a population of individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n\nThis is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the efficacy of fsCBD and bsCBD, compared to a placebo control, on biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease progression, cognitive function, pain, sleep quality, anxiety, oxidative stress, and inflammation. If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 24 weeks.\n\nThe current study will test the hypothesis that a moderate dose of CBD will improve measures of Alzheimer's disease progression, cognitive function, pain, sleep quality, anxiety, oxidative stress, and inflammation as compared to placebo. The study will also test whether endocannabinoids mediate the effects of CBD on these outcomes."
