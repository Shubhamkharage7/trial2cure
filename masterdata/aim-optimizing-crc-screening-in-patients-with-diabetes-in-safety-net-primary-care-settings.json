This single-arm study uses a pre-post design to evaluate the targeted implementation strategies impact on: (1) preliminary effectiveness and (2) implementation (i.e., feasibility and acceptability) and a mixed-method comparative case study learning evaluation for safety-net primary care adoption and implementation. Implementation strategies that will be tested were developed through a stakeholder engaged, community-based participatory implementation planning approach. This study uses a tailored combination of implementation strategies that include but are not limited to: identification of patient and practice-level barriers, patient education matierals, patient reminders provider/clinical team education, clinical champions, and audit and feedback. The impact of this evaluation will be measure using mixed methods to assess Exploration, Preparation, Implementation factors related to how organizational and contextual variables affect adoption and implementation for targeting CRC screening among patients with diabetes in safety net clinics at 12 months post intervention. Aim 3 surveys 20 clinicians and staff from 6 clinics (n=120) and conducts key-informant interviews with 8 clinic and staff members at pre- and post-implementation (who have participated in the survey; n=96) and evaluates aggregate data for 30 patients across six clinics (n=180)."
