            "briefSummary": "People with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) have narrow or blocked arteries that supply blood to the heart. Reduced blood flow to the heart muscle from CAD can cause chest pain or aching, especially with exercise or activity. CAD can lead to weakening of the heart muscle or heart failure, and a higher risk of heart attack or death. Certain proteins in the blood, known as biomarkers, can be found in people with CAD. Higher levels of these biomarkers are associated with a greater risk of complications from CAD. The purpose of this study is to see if a customized treatment based on biomarkers will reduce the biomarker levels and lead to lower risk of complications from CAD.",

Reduced blood flow to the heart muscle from CAD can cause chest pain or aching, especially with exercise or activity. CAD can lead to weakening of the heart muscle or heart failure, and a higher risk of heart attack or death. Certain proteins in the blood, known as biomarkers, can be found in people with CAD. Higher levels of these biomarkers are associated with a greater risk of complications from CAD. The purpose of this study is to see if a customized treatment based on biomarkers will reduce the biomarker levels and lead to lower risk of complications from CAD.\n\nParticipants with high biomarker levels will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to either the treatment group or usual care. Both groups will have physical exams, blood tests, and answer questionnaires. Participants in the treatment group will have their medications adjusted based on their biomarker levels. They will also be asked to make lifestyle changes like diet, exercise, and quitting smoking. Participants in the usual care group will receive the standard of care prescribed by their doctor.\n\nThis study will take place in research rooms at Emory University Hospital and the Woodruff Memorial Research Building.\n\nParticipants will be paid for being in the study.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from Emory Healthcare outpatient cardiology clinics and cath labs. Participants will be identified through the medical record and by their doctors. Written consent will be obtained from Participants before they can join the study.\n\nStudy data and blood samples will be collected and banked for possible research in the future. These may also be shared with other researchers including researchers outside of Emory.\n\nThis study will advance scientific knowledge and benefit human health by giving us more treatment options for CAD."
