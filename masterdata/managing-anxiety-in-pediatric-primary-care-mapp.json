            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to enhance the capacity of pediatric primary care providers to assist their patients who struggle with anxiety.\n\nThe study aims to refine and assess the feasibility of the Anxiety Action Plan (AxAP), a brief intervention to reduce pediatric anxiety, delivered by primary care providers (PCPs) in community pediatric primary care clinics. The goal of the AxAP is to enhance the capacity of PCPs to identify and intervene with anxious youth, which will enhance access to care in general and especially in locations with few mental health specialists. PCPs participating in this study will attend a training, administer the intervention to enrolled youth assigned to the MAPP condition, participate in coaching sessions, and fill out study questionnaires. Families participating in this study will complete evaluations with the study team, receive the intervention from their PCP (if assigned to the MAPP condition), and fill out study questionnaires. Researchers will compare the MAPP intervention to Enhanced Usual Care (EUC; consisting of videos, handouts, and other resources for anxiety reduction) to see the differences, if any, in child outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Anxiety disorders in youth are: 1) the most prevalent psychiatric illnesses, 2) associated with severe disability, and 3) considered gateway disorders--as they predict a broad range of adult psychiatric and functional problems. Despite the high prevalence and impairment, less than half of anxious youth receive mental health services and access to evidenced-based interventions lags far behind that of less common psychiatric illnesses, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This application addresses this mental health service gap and responds to NIH's priorities in PAR-MH-21-131: Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34) aimed at testing interventions with previous efficacy in community settings using novel service delivery methods. Specifically, the investigators propose to refine and assess the feasibility of the Anxiety Action Plan (AxAP), a brief intervention to reduce pediatric anxiety, delivered by primary care providers (PCPs; defined here as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and/or pediatricians) in community pediatric primary care clinics. Primary care settings are ideal for addressing pediatric anxiety specifically because: 1) prevalence rates of excessive anxiety are high in primary care (approximately 10-20%), 2) over 90% of anxious youth report physical complaints (e.g., stomach aches) and are \"frequent flyers\" in primary care settings, 3) children with, compared to without, medical conditions treated by PCPs are more likely to have elevated anxiety, and 4) PCPs are often the first and only health professional children visit. This study builds on the PI's development and feasibility pilot work with PCPs conducted as part of the NIMH-funded Center for Mental Health in Pediatric Primary Care and with school nurses as part of a Department of Education grant. The AxAP, modeled after the Asthma Action Plan familiar to PCPs, is based on the core element of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety (i.e., behavioral exposure), was designed to fit within the short primary care visit (20-30 minutes), can be delivered virtually, is brief (1-4 sessions), and can be billed for as an office visit. Uniquely, and in stark contrast to co-location or integrated models, the goal of the AxAP is to enhance the capacity of PCPs to identify and intervene with anxious youth, which will enhance access to care in general and especially in locations with few mental health specialists. If results of this study are positive, findings would support a large effectiveness trial using an intervention that is ready for dissemination and that could significantly improve clinical care for anxious youth, enhance the capacity of PCPs to identify and reduce anxiety, and lower personal and economic costs associated with pediatric anxiety."
