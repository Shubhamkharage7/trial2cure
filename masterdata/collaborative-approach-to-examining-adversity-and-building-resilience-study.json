            "detailedDescription": "Early-life trauma and related adversities are prevalent and associated with negative health and achievement outcomes. These adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are especially common in economically disadvantaged and communities of color. While there has been tremendous growth in knowledge about ACEs and their impact on health across the life course, critical gaps persist: 1) Which biologic pathways are most affected by ACEs during early childhood and may help identify those children at greatest risk for future poor health? And, 2) How may child and family resilience be bolstered across the care continuum to mitigate the negative health effects of ACEs? These critical gaps severely limit our ability to effectively identify children at high-risk and to intervene to promote resilience before poor health occurs.\n\nThree previously piloted resilience-promoting, caregiver-child interventions will be examined: primary care-based, group-delivered Resilience Clinic (RC); home-based, dyadic Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC); and primary care-based, dyadic Resiliency Family Program (RFP). Using a randomized wait- list controlled trial design,12 families will be assigned to intervention or enhanced primary care (n=50/arm in each intervention, total n=300). Pre-post intervention health (behavioral, caregiver stress) and biology will be compared between intervention and controls, as well as modifying factors such as setting and delivery method."
