            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a significant difference in electrical impedance between normal, benign, premalignant, and malignant oral lesions using a custom device. The secondary study objective is to create a database of in vivo electrical impedance spectra and images of oral lesions. This will be achieved by collecting Electrical Impedance sensing data and images from two cohorts of patients: Cohort I will consist of 200 patients undergoing oral lesion biopsies and Cohort II will be comprised of 50 patients scheduled for oral cancer resection. A maximum of 5 additional subjects will be initially enrolled in each Cohort to optimize data acquisition.",
            "detailedDescription": "For this study, a novel small field-of-view EII probe will be used for recording impedances from oral lesions. The device is comprised of gold-plated electrodes with analog electronics located in the probe's tip, to minimize cable lengths and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. A pressure sensor is embedded within the probe to reduce variability in the amount of pressure used when the probe is applied to soft tissue. The bioimpedance-sensing probe is designed to the following specifications in order to accurately assess oral lesions:\n\n1. measurement precision \\~85 dB,\n2. accuracy \\>99%,\n3. bandwidth extending to 1 MHz, and\n4. multi-frequency sample rate of \\>10 impedance spectra per second.\n\nSimilar to other EII systems the team has developed and deployed in vivo, the system complies with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) requirements for safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment (IEC 60601-1).\n\nThere are no known probes cleared by the FDA for this application.\n\nThe study is not being conducted in order to evaluate the EII probe's safety or effectiveness in human subjects, nor to test the device for marketing or promotion."
