Using the ResearchKit platform as well as a stand alone app available for Android and HTML, it makes it easier to enroll large numbers of participants and carry out real-world health research to answer questions important to a broad population.",
            "detailedDescription": "* Eligibility determined, Individuals enrolled and consented to join study\n* Short Intake Survey (demographic and baseline health information collected)\n* Health History Survey (two days after participant enrolls in the study)\n* Survey questions about current health and medical history will be sent to participants weekly. If participants had a prenatal visit during the week, a few additional questions will be asked.\n* Twins / Multiples survey will begin appearing when a participant indicates they are having more than one baby\n* Participants can submit home measurements of, weight and blood pressure as frequently as they want through HealthKit.\n* Pregnancy outcome variables. (Miscarriage, stillbirth, birth of healthy baby, or pregnancy ended) will also be asked weekly.\n* If the baby is born, questions about labor and delivery, as well as weight, size and birth date of the baby will be asked. A reminder to fill out the outcome survey will be given 4 weeks after a user's due date."
