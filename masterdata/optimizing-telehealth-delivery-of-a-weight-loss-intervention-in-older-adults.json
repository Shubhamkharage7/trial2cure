            "briefSummary": "This study seeks to answer the fundamental questions of which initial, first-line weight loss intervention should be offered to older adults with obesity and multiple chronic conditions and how to address the high non-response rates observed with most conventional strategies. A sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design will permit the evaluation of treatment combinations that maximize weight loss and will provide data on constructing a future tailored, adaptive intervention. If successful, these findings will identify interventions that could markedly improve health and quality of life of these older adults, reduce long-term disability, and lower healthcare costs",
            "detailedDescription": "Purpose: Consistent with the research priorities of the National Institute on Aging, this research protocol will investigate the optimal intervention sequence to achieve weight loss in older adults with obesity and more than 2 chronic conditions, termed multiple chronic conditions (MCC). To this end, the specific aims are to: 1) test the superiority of an initial prescriptive or behavioral intervention using an adaptive strategy for early non-responders; 2) assess the patterns of initial weight loss and compare strategies for non-responders using an adaptive strategy; and 3) examine the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective for maintaining weight loss of the proposed sequences at 78 weeks (26 weeks post-intervention completion).\n\nProcedures (methods): The investigators will conduct a 52-week, two-stage, Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART) enrolling 180 older adults with obesity and MCC to compare two weight loss interventions: 1) a prescriptively-focused, medically-tailored, weight loss intervention(prescriptive), or 2) a behaviorally-focused, health coaching intervention (behavioral). Consistent with a SMART design, at 8 weeks, the investigators will randomize early non-responders (weight loss of \\< 2.5%) to (a) a combination of prescriptive and behavioral interventions; or (b) switching to either a prescriptive, medically-tailored model (or vice versa).\n\nAim 1 - Efficacy Test the superiority of an initial prescriptive vs. behavioral intervention on the differences in weight loss (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes, using an adaptive strategy for early non-responders in a 52-week, telehealth-based SMART. At 52-weeks, percent weight loss (primary outcome) will be greater among patients initially randomized to a prescriptive intervention, as will global health and physical function, anthropometry, behavioral treatment targets and risk factors, and clinical indices (secondary outcomes).\n\nAim 2 - Precision Medicine Assess the patterns of initial weight loss and compare strategies for non-responders to weight loss (combined prescriptive and behavioral, or switching initial treatment strategies \\[prescriptive to behavioral, or behavioral to prescriptive\\]). The investigators will estimate an adaptive strategy (dynamic treatment regime) to give the right intervention to the right participant. The investigators hypothesize that this dynamic regime will lead to a better outcome, on average, compared to the best non-adaptive (fixed) regime\n\nAim 3 - Cost-Effectiveness Examine the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective at 78-weeks (26 weeks post-intervention completion). For the initial, first-line interventions, the investigators will estimate the incremental cost per percent weight change and assess secondary outcomes of the incremental cost for maintaining at least a 5% weight loss, and quality-adjusted life years. The investigators will also model the cost-effectiveness of the precision medicine approach predicted to have the greatest individualized likelihood of weight loss response."
