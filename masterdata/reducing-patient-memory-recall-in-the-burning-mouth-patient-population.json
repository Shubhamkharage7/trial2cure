            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to learn about burning mouth syndrome symptoms in real time in patients with burning mouth syndrome. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n(1) To test the ability of a smartphone app to collect repeated observations of individual data to assess fluctuations in BMS symptoms (pain) at multiple points in the day as they happen; (2) To evaluate a panel of salivary biomarkers in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and to study their relationship with clinical variables. With a collaboration between Penn Dental Medicine and Wharton School of Business, our proposal aims to vastly improve the characterization of burning mouth syndrome through the use of a smartphone app and/or text-based notification.\n\nParticipants will attend 2 study visits where they will complete questionnaires and provide saliva samples and will respond to notifications/text message prompts on their smart phone 3 times a day for 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective study with the aims: (1) To test the ability of a smartphone app to collect repeated observations of individual data to assess fluctuations in BMS symptoms (pain) at multiple points in the day as they happen; (2) To evaluate a panel of salivary biomarkers in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and to study their relationship with clinical variables.\n\nParticipants will attend 2 study visits. Visit 1 of the study will consist of screening during the baseline visit. It will include administration of questionnaires, informed consent, collection of salivary samples, helping to download the app and/or helping to set up the smartphone to receive text notifications, and assisting with the demonstration of taking surveys on smartphones.\n\nTrack Your Happiness app, a smartphone and/or text-based notification system to take surveys, will collect data on people's experiences across a random sample of the moments of their lives. Participants will receives notifications 3 times per day at random times, and will be prompted to answer questions related to the burning mouth, to exercise, and a random selection of non-clinical Track Your Happiness questions, e.g., \"Are you interacting with anyone right now?\" \"How do you feel right now?\" Participants will receive these notifications for 12 weeks.\n\nThe final study visit (visit 2) will take place 12 weeks after Visit 1. Visit 2 will consist of questionnaires and collection of salivary samples."
