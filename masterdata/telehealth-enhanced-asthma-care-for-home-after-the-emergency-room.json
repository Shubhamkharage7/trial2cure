            "briefSummary": "The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of Telehealth-Enhanced Asthma Care for Home After the Emergency Room (TEACH-ER) vs. enhanced care (EC). TEACH-ER includes: 1) brief, pictorial, and health literacy-informed asthma education in the ED, with color- and shape-coded labels provided for home asthma medications; 2) virtual primary care follow-up within 1 week of discharge using in-home telemedicine (Zoom), featuring provider prompts for guideline-based preventive therapy and home delivery of prescribed medications with pictorial action plans; 3) two additional in-home virtual visits to reinforce teaching, review treatment plans, label medications, and support effective management practices. The investigators will enroll 430 children (ages 3-12 yrs) from the two dedicated pediatric EDs in our region, and follow all participants for a 12-month period. The investigators will call caregivers to complete blinded follow-up telephone surveys at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after discharge. The investigators will assess the effectiveness of TEACH-ER in reducing the need for additional asthma-related ED visits or hospitalizations in the 1-months after enrollment. Additional outcomes of interest include asthma symptoms, medication adherence, absenteeism from work and school, quality of life, and the delivery of care consistent with national asthma care guidelines."

After baseline and randomization, we will send the child's PCP a symptom report with guideline-based recommendations for preventive care and recommend a follow-up visit with the PCP. We will also give all providers a summary of the current national guidelines. We will provide systematic feedback to the family and child's PCP at intervals that parallel the TEACH-ER group's telemedicine assessments. This feedback will include prompting caregivers to schedule a recommended follow-up appointment with the PCP, and encouraging providers to adhere to the NHLBI guidelines.
