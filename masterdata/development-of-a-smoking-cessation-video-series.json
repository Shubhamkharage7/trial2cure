Participants (daily smokers) will be asked to watch a series of six videos (approximately 6.5 minutes each) which cover various empirically-supported smoking cessation strategies and tools. Examples of strategies included in the videos include noticing smoking cues and consequences and relaxation training. Participants' demographic information, motivation to change, reactions to the video series alliance with video therapist, and confidence in avoiding smoking will all be measured. Additionally, participants will be asked to report their smoking behavior at study baseline and follow-up."
