            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using the ketogenic diet (KD) in children who sustained moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The secondary objective is a preliminary evaluation of the outcomes of children who have had the standard of care plus the KD, compared to those with standard of care alone. Outcome measures for the secondary objective will include: need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt, duration of unconsciousness, need for any type of craniotomy, duration of post-traumatic amnesia, acute hospitalization length of stay, and cognitive and motor function at 12 months after injury. If this study demonstrates feasibility and safety, the information related to outcomes will be used to inform the planning of a future, larger, randomized study of the efficacy of the KD in children and adolescents with TBI. Specifically, this information will be used to assist with sample size calculations for this future study.",
            "detailedDescription": "The KD is an alternative feeding regimen that has been in use since 1921. It is a high fat, low carbohydrate and moderate protein diet. There are various forms of the KD. The classic KD consists of long-chain triglycerides with a fat-to-combined-protein-and-carbohydrate ratio that can vary. At our institution, it is standard of care to initiate a ketogenic diet at a ratio of 2:1, and to increase the ratio to 3:1 or 4:1 as needed to achieve ketosis. Clinically, the KD has been proven to be an effective therapy in children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy, as well as for those with type II diabetes. In addition, an international consensus was published in 2009 that recommended the use of the KD to treat epilepsy refractory as an alternative to at least two antiepileptic medications. Before initiating the KD for epilepsy management, labs such as urine and blood ketones, blood glucose and a basic metabolic panel including magnesium are commonly recommended. Risks for long-term use of the KD include but are not limited to the following: hypercholesterolemia, mineral deficiencies, acidosis, constipation, weight loss and nephrolithiasis. However, short-term use should significantly limit the occurrence of these potential complications."
