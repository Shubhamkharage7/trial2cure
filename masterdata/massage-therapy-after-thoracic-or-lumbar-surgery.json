            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to look at the effect of massage therapy on the pain, anxiety, and quality of life that pediatric patients have after undergoing spinal fusion surgery. This is a single-site, prospective, randomized, interventional study design that will involve post-thoracic and post-lumbar spinal fusion surgeries of pediatric patients from 7 to 19 years of age that present to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas. These patients will be identified prior to their scheduled spinal fusion surgery and recruited to enroll in the study. The planned spinal fusion surgeries are not considered part of this research project, but rather considered standard of care and would occur whether the patient is enrolled in this project or not. Enrolled participants will be followed during their inpatient stay and through their subsequent follow-up visits at weeks 2, 6, and 12. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a massage therapy group or a group that receives the standard (normal) care for recovery after surgery. The final study involvement will occur at week 16 (post-hospital discharge) where a study team member will administer a quality of life (PedsQL) questionnaire via phone or mail with the subject. Data will be collected after study related procedures are completed.",
            "detailedDescription": "There has been an increasing amount of spinal fusion surgeries in the United States. These patients struggle with anxiety and stress before surgery, and experience significant hardship during postoperative recovery including management of opioid related side effects, effective pain control, delay in mobilization, and prolonged length of stay. A growing body of research, however, has shown massage therapy (MT) as an effective alternative to conventional treatments. MT raises the temperature of local tissues, dilates capillaries, accelerates the circulation of blood and lymph, promotes the absorption of local tissue metabolism and mass inflammation, improves the nutritional supply of surrounding muscle groups, promotes their growth and development, and relieves pain.\n\nThe aim of this present study is to assess the effect of MT on perceived post-surgical pain, anxiety, and quality of life experienced by pediatric patients who have undergone thoracic and lumbar spinal fusion.\n\nPotential participants will be identified prior to their scheduled spinal fusion surgery and recruited to enroll in the study. The planned spinal fusion surgeries are not considered part of this research project, but rather considered standard of care and would occur whether the patient is enrolled in this project or not. After surgery, another review of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be done to determine the subject's continued eligibility for participation. If criteria are met, the child participant will be randomized into one of two study groups, 1) Massage Therapy Group or 2) A Control Group for their post-surgery recovery plan. Enrolled participants will be followed during their inpatient stay and through their subsequent follow-up visits at weeks 2, 6, and 12. The final study involvement will occur at week 16 (post-hospital discharge) where a study team member will administer a quality of life questionnaire via phone or mail with the subject.\n\nAll participants whom are randomized into the massage therapy group are treated by a certified pediatric massage therapist. At least two 30- minute massage therapy sessions are performed on postoperative days two and four or five. Either post-operative day 4 or 5 can be selected as a second in-patient massage therapy session as long as the session occurs Monday through Friday, as the massage therapy service is not offered during the weekend hours of Saturday or Sunday. If the participant's length of stay is six days or longer, the participant continues to receive treatment every other day for the duration of hospitalization. Each individual patient is treated according to what their needs are, which means one participant may prefer neck and shoulder massage and another may prefer legs and feet. The participant remains in a position of comfort which for spinal fusion patients is generally in the supine, sitting, or side laying position. A combination of therapies including myofascial release, compression, and Swedish massage will be employed. Light and medium touch are applied but never deep tissue. While scar mobilization is a desired outcome postoperatively, this is not an immediate goal. The incision site remains clean and covered without any manipulation. Rehabilitation goals are to maximize mobility and flexibility of surrounding structures but is only addressed by the physical therapy team. Massage therapy does not involve any form of stretching or range of motion techniques. The study team will obtain vital data (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, and O2 stats) along with VAS pain scale and anxiety rating scale measures before and after every session from the patient's medical records.\n\nFor those participants randomized into the control group, they will continue to receive the normal standard of care as usual for their recovery and will be monitored by hospital staff in obtaining the same data points (e.g., BP values, HR value, O2 levels) recorded clinically for post-op days 2 and 4/5; as the investigators are collecting in the massage group; however, no therapeutic intervention will occur. If the participant's length of stay is greater than five days the study staff will continue to record these values every other day for the duration of hospitalization. Study staff will retrieve these data variables via the patient's electronic medical record and enter data into the study database. A study member will visit with the subject on day 2, day 4/5 (and every other day if length of stay is greater than five days) to collect anxiety and pain scores measurements."
