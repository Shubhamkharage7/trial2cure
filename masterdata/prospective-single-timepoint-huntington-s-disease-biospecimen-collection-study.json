The disease sample collection and analysis will be the foundation for an extensive network of biospecimen access and linked datasets for future translational research.",
            "detailedDescription": "STUDY DESIGN:\n\n* This protocol is a single-center, single-cohort, bioresearch study enrolling up to 5 participants. The cohort is as follows:\n\n  o Cohort 1: Huntington's Disease (n=5)\n* The study will enroll participants per the eligibility criteria.\n* Participants will have 1 scheduled biospecimen collection visit(s). If the participant requires a recollection or is called for an extra sample donation, this will add additional volume and visit(s) to the collection schedule. The biospecimens collected from participants are whole blood.\n* The target blood volume of each phlebotomy visit will be 20 mL. The minimum accepted volume (in the event of tough venipuncture attempts or difficulty obtaining the blood) will be 5 mL. The maximum amount that can be drawn in a 6-week period will be 100 mL (whole blood 6-week maximum).\n* Confirmation of eligibility and medical record review by a member of the study staff will be completed for participants of the cohort before they are considered fully enrolled."
