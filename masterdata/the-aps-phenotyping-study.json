This study will also generate a biobank of specimens collected from these patients that will be available to investigators for future studies of ARDS, sepsis, and/or pneumonia.",
            "detailedDescription": "The APS phenotyping study will enroll hospitalized adult patients \u226518 years old who have or are at risk of developing ARDS, sepsis, or pneumonia. Participation in this study will involve collection of clinical data, completing questionnaires, and collection of samples such as blood, urine, and stool. Participants who are mechanically ventilated will also provide samples from their respiratory track. Data and samples will be collected both during and after hospitalization. Analyses to understand the mechanisms underlying ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis will be conducted, with goals including the classification of patients with ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis into biologically based phenotype categories and identifying new targets for future therapeutic trials."
