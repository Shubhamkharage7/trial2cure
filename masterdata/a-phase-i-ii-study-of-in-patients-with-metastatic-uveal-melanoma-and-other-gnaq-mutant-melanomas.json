            "detailedDescription": "This is a First in Human (FIH), phase I/II, open label, multi-center study of DYP688 as a single agent. There will be two parts to this study: a phase I, dose escalation part followed by a phase II part. Dose escalation will be conducted in patients with MUM and other melanomas harboring GNAQ/11 mutations. Once the MTD and/or RD(s) is determined in the dose escalation part, the study may continue with a phase II part. The phase II part will be conducted in two groups of patients with MUM, a prior tebentafusp-treated group and a tebentafusp-na\u00efve group. In addition to MUM, a third group of patients with non-uveal GNAQ/11 mutant melanomas may also be explored. This cohort may be opened based on emerging data from the dose escalation part of the study."
