            "briefSummary": "This phase II trials studies how well pembrolizumab and vactosertib work after standard of care chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver that can be removed by surgery (resectable hepatic metastases). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vactosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and vactosertib after standard of care chemotherapy, but before liver metastases surgery, may help shrink the cancer prior to surgery. This study also investigates pembrolizumab and vactosertib after liver metastases surgery, decrease the risk of the cancer recurring (coming back).",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To characterize the change in the populations of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) induced by neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus vactosertib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To establish the safety/toxicity profile of pembrolizumab-based treatment in the perioperative setting for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with resectable hepatic metastases.\n\nII. To explore the efficacy of pembrolizumab plus vactosertib in patients with CRC with resectable hepatic metastases.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the impact of pembrolizumab-based treatment on PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), in patients with mCRC.\n\nII. To determine the change in T cell repertoire within the tumor and blood induced by neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based treatment in patients with mCRC.\n\nIII. To explore molecular profiles to identify potentially predictive biomarkers for patients with metastatic CRC treated with immunotherapy (including but not limited to microsatellite instability (MSI) testing).\n\nIV. To correlate change in TIICs, PDL-1 expression, and T cell repertoires as well as molecular profiles with response/resistance and toxicity.\n\nV. To identify immune response messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression analysis to derive signatures associated with tumor response.\n\nVI. To identify genomic mutations and gene copy aberrations associated with response and resistance to therapy.\n\nVII. To correlate changes in microbiome composition and diversity with diet and lifestyle factors.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and vactosertib orally (PO) once a day (QD) for the first cycle 5 days a week and twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for cycle 2 and greater followed by a 2-day resting period for 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care surgical removal of liver metastases approximately 2 weeks (minimum 1 week) after last dose of vactosertib.\n\nOPTIONAL ADJUVANT TREATMENT: After surgery, eligible patients may also receive pembrolizumab and vactosertib every 6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients who do not undergo optional adjuvant treatment are followed up at 14 days and then every 90 days for up to 1 year. Patients who undergo optional adjuvant treatment are followed up at 30 days and then every 90 days for up to 2 years."

Has not recovered (i.e., =\\< grade 1 or at baseline) from AEs due to FOLFOX chemotherapy.\n\n   * Note: Patients with =\\< grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia are exceptions to this criterion and may qualify for the study.\n8. Has not recovered adequately from toxicity or complications of a surgery or other procedure, per the assessment of the treating investigator.\n9. Has received liver-directed therapy such as radiotherapy or yttrium-90 in the past year involving the lesion to be biopsied. (Neoadjuvant Arm only)\n10. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within 5 years prior.\n\n    \\* Note: Patients with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n11. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable (i.e., without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging \\[repeat imaging should be performed during the study screening\\]), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n12. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n13. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n14. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Anticoagulation that cannot be safely held to perform the liver biopsy is an example of a contraindication to participation.\n15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n\nHas received any prior immunotherapy including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137). (Neoadjuvant Arm Only).\n\n17. Has severe hypersensitivity (\\>= grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or to any of pembrolizumab's excipients.\n\n18. Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose of the trial drug. Administration of killed vaccines are allowed.\n\n19. Has inferior vena cava/cardiac involvement based on imaging. 20. Has had encephalopathy in the last 6 months. Those patients on rifaximin or lactulose to control their encephalopathy are not allowed.\n\n21. Has had a solid organ or hematologic transplant. 22. Has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A patient who is clinically stable following treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic thora- or paracentesis) is eligible.\n\n23. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III/IV), uncontrolled hypertension (\\>=150/90mmHg), unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction (\u2264 6 months prior to screening), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, clinically significant cardiac valvulopathy requiting treatment, active interstitial lung disease, or serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea.",
