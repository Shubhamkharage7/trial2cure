The device has already been demonstrated to be accurate compared to the gold standard in clinic urodynamics. This study will assess the patients and care givers ability and experience using the device in a home setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "For patients with neurogenic bladder, regular monitoring of bladder pressure and capacity is a critical component of maintaining renal and urinary health. This monitoring is currently done by in-office urodynamics testing (UDS). This testing is done intermittently, leaving open the possibility of worsening of bladder function and renal deterioration between testing sessions.\n\nThis study utilizes a novel pressure monitoring device which is portable and attaches to the end of a standard urinary catheter. The investigators will be investigating if this device can be used by patients or their caregivers in a home setting.\n\nThis study will enroll patients with neurogenic bladder that currently perform clean intermittent catheterization on a daily basis as part of their regular care. The patients will be asked to use the device at least twice a day for two weeks."
