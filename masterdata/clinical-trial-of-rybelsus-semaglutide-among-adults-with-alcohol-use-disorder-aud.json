The investigators will randomly assign 50 participants to receive semaglutide (titrated to 7 milligrams (mg) per day) or matched placebo for 8 weeks. The primary aims are to assess the safety and tolerability of semaglutide in this population and to evaluate its effects, relative to placebo, on alcohol cue-elicited craving and alcohol consumption.",
            "detailedDescription": "A screening visit will be conducted at which written informed consent will be obtained and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed. Subsequently, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to take oral semaglutide or matched placebo for 8 weeks, with the semaglutide dose titrated from 3 milligrams (mg)/day for the first 4 weeks to 7 milligrams (mg)/day for the second 4 weeks. Participants will complete 7 additional clinic visits (weekly during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period and biweekly during the second 4 weeks). At each visit, participants will also engage in a computerized behavioral intervention. At screening and again at the Week 6 visit, participants will complete an alcohol cue reactivity task. At the Week 1 visit, before ingesting the first dose of study medication, and again at the Week 8 visit, participants will complete a functional MRI session."
