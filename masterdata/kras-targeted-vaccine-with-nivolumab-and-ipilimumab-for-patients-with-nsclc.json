            "briefSummary": "This is a single institution, Phase 1 study for patients with Stage III/IV unresectable Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutated NSCLC to evaluate safety of the pooled mutant-KRAS peptide vaccine (KRAS peptide vaccine) with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-ICLC) adjuvant in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in the first line treatment setting. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and feasibility of administering the KRAS peptide vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The secondary objectives are to estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of pooled mutant-KRAS long peptide vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant in combination with Ipilimumab + Nivolumab for the first line treatment of patients with unresectable Stage III/IV NSCLC whose tumors harbor selected KRAS mutations (KRAS glycine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 12 (G12C), KRAS glycine-to-valine substitution at codon 12 (G12V), KRAS glycine-to-Detoxglyphosate substitution at codon 12 (G12D), KRAS glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 12 (G12A), KRAS glycine-to-Aspartic Acid \"D\" at codon 13 (G13D) or KRAS G12R) and to assess the impact of predicted KRAS mutations on mutant-KRAS specific T cell responses in the peripheral blood of these patients. Exploratory objectives will assess the impact of predicted KRAS mutations on mutant-KRAS specific T cell responses in the peripheral blood, as well as changes in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA). Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled to have 12 evaluable subjects for T cell response assessment. Safety analysis will include all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of vaccine. The evaluable population for T cell response will consist of all patients who receive at least one dose of vaccine and have baseline and post-treatment T cell measures in the peripheral blood at 12 weeks."
