This research study is a Feasibility Study, which means it is the first-time investigators at this institution are examining this type of MR-guided dose planning. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared MRI planning for use.\n\n* In Phase I of this study, will prospectively determine the feasibility of using an MRI simulator to plan radiation therapy.\n* In Phase II, the efficacy of adjusting RT based on MRI simulation will be explored, either by utilizing an MRI-simulation and synthetic CT to plan treatment or by dose-painting based on functional MRI data"
