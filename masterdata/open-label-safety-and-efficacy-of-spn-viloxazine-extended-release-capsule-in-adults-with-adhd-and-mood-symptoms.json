Adults 18 years and older with ADHD will be recruited, consented and screened for eligibility. Following the Screening Period (up to 4 weeks), eligible participants will be treated with Study medication for up to 14 weeks (Treatment Period). The total study duration is approximately 18 weeks, and there are up to 6 virtual study visits (or Televisits). All Televisits are conducted via an application downloaded to participant's mobile phone. There are up to 2 Televisits during the Screening period and 3 Televisits during the Treatment period. Subjects initiate SPN-812 dosing at 200 mg once daily during first week, and then titrate up to 400mg once daily during the second week. At the Investigator's discretion, based subject's clinical response and tolerability, the dose of SPN-812 can be increased or decreased to optimal dose within the range between 200 and 600 mg once daily during the remaining Treatment period. Participants will answer questions during structured clinical interviews with an investigator during Televisits and complete additional questionnaires and scales via the mobile app."

Has any history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, or has any other psychiatric disorders in the investigator's clinical judgement would interfere with their ability to participate in the study.\n9. Has any unstable, clinically significant cardiovascular condition that in the investigator's clinical judgement would preclude their participating in the study.\n10. Has any disease or taking any medication that could, in the Investigator's opinion, interfere with the assessments of safety, tolerability, or efficacy, or interfere with study conduct or interpretation of results.\n11. History of unexplained loss of consciousness, unexplained syncope, unexplained irregular heartbeat or palpitations or near drowning with hospital admission.\n12. In the Investigator's opinion, is unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.",
