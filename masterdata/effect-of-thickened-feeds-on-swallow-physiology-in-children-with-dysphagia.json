            "detailedDescription": "Infants with oropharyngeal dysphagia and in particular brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) are a significant driver of pediatric health care expenditure since the mechanism for their swallow dysfunction is incompletely understood and therefore frequently goes unrecognized and untreated. We hypothesize that infants with oropharyngeal dysphagia and BRUE have measurable differences in swallowing physiology to explain their symptoms of cyanotic choking spells, that these differences can be quantified using pharyngeal high resolution impedance-manometry compared to videofluoroscopic swallow study results, and that this swallowing dysfunction can be safely corrected with a change of formula viscosity. Through this research project, we will systematically investigate the effects of thickened feedings on swallow function in infants with dysphagia and BRUE and perform detailed physiology studies on pharyngeal and esophageal motility as critical mediators of improved outcomes."
