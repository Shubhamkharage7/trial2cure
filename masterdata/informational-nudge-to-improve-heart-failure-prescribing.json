Only 1/3 or fewer eligible Veterans are receiving SGLT2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, both medications that save lives and prevents HF hospitalizations. The investigators will combine insights from behavioral science and quality improvement science to create two types of 'nudges' - informational alerts and peer comparison feedback - to increase prescribing of these medications. The investigators will create two types of 'nudges' - informational alerts and peer comparison feedback - to increase prescribing of these medications. The investigators will compare the effect of these two nudge strategies alone and in combination compared to usual care. This project will develop simple, scalable, and low-cost strategies to improve the health of Veterans with HF."
