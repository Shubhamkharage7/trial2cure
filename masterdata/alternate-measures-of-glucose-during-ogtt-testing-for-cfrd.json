            "briefSummary": "Although early detection and treatment of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) can lead to significant clinical improvements and prolong life, rates of screening are poor likely due to the burdensome nature of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). The investigators propose to assess the feasibility and accuracy of two screening tools, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and a home OGTT kit (GTT@home). If this pilot study reveals acceptable accuracy of either device, this study will allow for future studies exploring home-based OGTT screening.",
