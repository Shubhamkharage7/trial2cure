Women will be provided with up to three nutrition education sessions and will be sent text message reminders to redeem their incentives every month and to provide them with nutrition tips. The study will use a co-design approach to utilize feedback from potential participants as well as participants at multiple time points in the process to improve the intervention and make it more relevant and impactful to our population.",
            "detailedDescription": "This protocol describes the implementation of an intervention to improve access to fruits and vegetables among pregnant Latina women in Hartford CT in partnership with Wholesome Wave of Bridgeport CT, a national leader in nutrition incentive programming and policy.\n\nThe target population are pregnant Latina women living in Hartford CT. Having access to the right foods as well as enough food during pregnancy promotes optimal fetal development. A prescription program that provides increased fruit and vegetable access to low-income pregnant women can help improve the diet of women during pregnancy.\n\nNutrition education sessions (either virtual or in person) will be attended by all participants with one session required and up to two additional sessions optional.\n\nFruits and vegetables may be purchased at diverse community locations or online for home delivery."
