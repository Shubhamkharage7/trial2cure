            "detailedDescription": "As childhood cancer survivors receive care locally from PCPs, the in-home, collaborative PCP model is designed to increase access to genetic services and uptake of genetic testing in childhood cancer survivors. In this model, individual survivors can access remote telegenetic services and genetic counselors will partner with PCPs to order genetic testing.\n\nThis study comprises of a 3-arm randomized Hybrid 1 Effectiveness and Implementation study in 360 CCSS survivors to evaluate the effectiveness of our in-home, collaborative PCP model of remote telegenetic services to increase uptake of cancer genetic testing in childhood cancer survivors compared to usual care options for genetic testing.\n\nAims are as follows:\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our in-home, collaborative PCP model of remote telegenetic services to increase uptake of genetic testing at 6 months as compared to usual care among childhood cancer survivors who meet criteria for cancer genetic testing. Our primary outcome will be a composite variable indicating whether a person had pre-test counseling or genetic testing.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of remote videoconferencing to provide greater increase in knowledge and decrease in distress and depression as compared to remote phone services, to examine the moderators of patient outcomes with remote telegenetic services, and to estimate intervention costs and incremental cost-effectiveness of the three study arms.\n\nTo conduct a multi-stakeholder, mixed-methods process evaluation to understand patient, provider and system factors associated with uptake of counseling and testing in our adapted in-home, collaborative PCP model and facilitators and barriers to uptake to provide recommendations for future implementation."
