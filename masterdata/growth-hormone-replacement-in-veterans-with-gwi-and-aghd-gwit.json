            "briefSummary": "The goal of the GWIT Study is to assess whether growth hormone replacement therapy is a safe and effective treatment for veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI) and adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD). The main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is growth hormone effective at reducing fat in the trunk of the body and symptoms of GWI among veterans with GWI and growth hormone deficiency?\n2. Do the results of the study suggest there is merit in pursuing a larger trial to examine the efficacy of growth hormone as a treatment for growth hormone deficiency among veterans with Gulf War Illness?\n\nTo determine eligibility for the study, veterans will be asked to complete several assessments including questionnaires, blood tests, and a scan of the brain. Participants who qualify for the study will receive recombinant human growth hormone for 6-months. A body composition scan will be performed at Day1, Day 90, and Day 180 of the intervention. Questionnaires and cognitive tests will also be collected before and after the trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "Veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI) often experience a range of debilitating symptoms, including fatigue, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and cognitive dysfunction. The factors contributing to these symptoms remain poorly understood, but adults with adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) experience similar symptoms. Growth hormone replacement therapy has been shown to improve fatigue, chronic pain, mood, cognitive function, and quality of life. Approximately 1 in 3 Veterans diagnosed with GWI also tests positive for AGHD, raising the question of whether growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) could be a potential avenue for improving their quality of life.\n\nThe objective of this research is to conduct a clinical trial to determine whether GHRT can improve body composition, cognitive function, sleep quality, fatigue, and mood in Veterans with GWI and AGHD. Data from this study will also provide important information on the safety of the intervention.\n\nThis research has the potential to reshape our understanding of GWI and its therapeutic management. If GHRT proves efficacious, it could prompt widespread screening and treatment for growth hormone deficiency among Gulf War Veterans, potentially ameliorating their symptoms and enhancing their functional recovery. Furthermore, the findings of this study may influence clinical practice guidelines, facilitating more effective communication and collaboration among Veterans, caregivers, researchers, and healthcare providers."
