            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of decoy-resistant interleukin-18 (DR-18) and how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that remains despite treatment (persistent) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). HCT is the only curative therapy for most forms of AML and MDS. However, relapse occurs in a third of patients and is the most common cause of death after HCT. DR-18, a variant of the human cytokine interleukin-18, binds to IL-18 binding probein (IL-18BP) and overcomes the inhibitory effect of the IL-18BP on IL-18, which may boost the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving DR-18 may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patient with relapsed or persistent AML or MDS after HCT.",

LVEF may be established with echocardiogram or MUGA scan, and left ejection fraction must be \u2265 35%\n* Liver dysfunction: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\> 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin \\> 3 x ULN\n* Active uncontrolled infection. NB: Examples of controlled infections:\n\n  * Bacterial infection may be still requiring antibiotics at the time of enrollment but clinical signs and symptoms of the infection should be improving. If the subject had bloodstream infection, negative blood cultures off antibiotics must be documented prior to initiating DR-18 treatment. For urinary tract infection, a repeat urine culture must be sterile prior to initiating DR-18. Radiographic improvement of bacterial pneumonia may lag behind clinical improvement so is not mandatory prior to DR-18 initiation\n  * Fungal infection may be still requiring antifungal medication at the time of enrollment, but evidence of clinical response to antifungal medication (such as regression of lesions on chest CT) must be available at the time of enrollment\n  * Asymptomatic shedding of respiratory viruses after cessation of antiviral therapy, or if not specifically treated with antiviral therapy, is permitted\n  * Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia or organ infection meeting institutional criteria for CMV treatment with antiviral therapy such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir or foscarnet must be on maintenance phase of treatment or must have completed treatment and must not be in the induction treatment phase at the time of enrollment. Low-level CMV viremia not meeting institutional criteria for antiviral therapy is permitted, including low-level viremia in patients receiving CMV prophylaxis with letermovir\n* Any of the following: Pulmonary dysfunction requiring supplemental oxygen, even intermittently, in the past 2 weeks; corrected diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) \\< 60% predicted; bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome; prior diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; prior diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonitis; cryptogenic organizing pneumonia under active treatment\n* Seizure in the past 4 weeks or significant underlying neurologic disease: Study participants must not have significant active underlying neurologic disease, such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, prior symptomatic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack, unless approved by principal investigator (PI). Peripheral neuropathy related to diabetes or prior chemotherapy is acceptable\n* Other medical, social, or psychiatric factor that interferes with medical appropriateness and/or ability to comply with study, as determined by the PI\n* Known allergic reactions to any of the components of study treatments\n* Concurrent use of other investigational anti-cancer agents\n* Peripheral blood T cell chimerism \\< 40%",
