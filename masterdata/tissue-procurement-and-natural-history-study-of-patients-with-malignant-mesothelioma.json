The majority of patients present with stage III or IV disease with 85-90% of patients considered unresectable at diagnosis.\n* Peritoneal mesothelioma has a better prognosis than pleural mesothelioma; nevertheless, patients undergoing therapy for peritoneal mesothelioma have few well-studied treatment options due in large part to the rarity of the disease.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of mesothelioma.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* All patients age greater than or equal to 2 years with malignant mesothelioma\n* Must be able and willing to provide informed consent if 18 or over; parent or guardian must be able and willing to provide consent for patients under the age of 18\n\nDesign:\n\n* Up to 1000 subjects will be enrolled.\n* Patients will be followed to determine the course of disease and to record any treatment received for mesothelioma.\n* Patients will undergo sampling of blood, urine, tumor and abnormal body fluids for tissue banking.\n* Studies which may be performed on banked material include genetic and genomic studies, establishment of cell cultures and immunologic studies.",
