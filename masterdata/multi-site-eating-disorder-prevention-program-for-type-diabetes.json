The Diabetes Body Project (DBP), is an adaptation of the Body Project which is the only eating disorder prevention program to have repeatedly produced effects when evaluated by independent researchers, produced stronger effects than credible alternative interventions, and affected objective outcomes. DBP has been adapted slightly for individuals with T1D who are at ultra-high risk for eating disorders. The study aims to test the effectiveness of the DBP of reducing body image concerns and reducing eating pathology and improving glycemic control."
