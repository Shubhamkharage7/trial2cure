The NIR light is delivered to specific brain areas by Cognilum, a wearable device developed by Jelikalite. The Cognilum system is a non-invasive headband medical device specifically designed to safely and comfortably deliver tPBM to autistic children. Cognilum has been designated as a non-significant risk breakthrough device by the Food and Drug Administration. This study will consist of a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial at SUNY Upstate Medical University with 40 autistic children using Cognilium device and measuring the impact using multiple clinically validated scales.\n\nHypothesis 1: Significant reduction of average Childhood Autism Rating Scores (CARS; before and after treatment comparison) in the active group compared to sham-control group.\n\nHypothesis 2: Significant change in average scores (before and after treatment comparison) on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale in the active group compared to sham control group."
