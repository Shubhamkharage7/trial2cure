            "detailedDescription": "The first phase of this study will involve performing 50 cases of nerve-sparing RARP on patients who are good candidates for nerve sparing. During these procedures, we will record the location and size of arteries encountered to create a detailed 3D map of the surgical arterial vasculature.\n\nIn the second phase, we will recruit another 50 patients. These patients will receive an IV injection of ICG before encountering the arteries to visualize them prior to resection. This phase will determine the optimal dosage and timing for the IV ICG injection.\n\nThe third phase will utilize the dosage and timing defined in the second phase. This phase will be a randomized trial involving 300 patients."
