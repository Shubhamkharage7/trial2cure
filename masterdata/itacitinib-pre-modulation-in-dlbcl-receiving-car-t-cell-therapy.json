            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 2, single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of once daily itacitinib oral administration in patients with diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who will receive CAR-T-cell therapy with axicabtagene ciloleucel (Axi-cel) and have been found to have high levels of systemic inflammation. Approximately n=27 adult males and females, 18 years or older, who will receive treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) at the Moffitt Cancer Center with a ferritin level greater than 400 ng/ml and C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 2 mg/dl (20 mg/l) at screening will be enrolled. Study regimen will consist of itacitinib 200 mg PO QD beginning at time of apheresis approximately 4-6 weeks prior to CAR-T-cell therapy and will continue until Day 30 (30 Days Post-CAR-T-cell therapy). The exact number of days between apheresis and CAR T cell infusion may vary based on CAR T cell manufacturing turnaround. A single infusion of axi-cel therapy will be administered on Day 0. Investigators hypothesize that pre-modulation with itacitinib started approximately 4 weeks prior to CAR-T-cell therapy with axi-cel will improve patient outcomes in those patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who express high levels of systemic inflammation."

Permitted methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy should be communicated to the participants in their understanding confirmed.(b) Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and before the first dose of Day 1 and must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through safety follow up. Permitted methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy should be communicated to the participants and their understanding confirmed.

Steroids should not be given within 5 days prior to leukapheresis. Concomitant bridging steroids (section 6.6) are allowed after leukapheresis.\n* Known hypersensitivity or severe reaction to itacitinib, similar compounds, or excipients or itacitinib.\n* Participants who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> Grade 1), with the exception of stable Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy and/or any grade alopecia.\n* Pregnant or nursing (breast-feeding) women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk to using itacitinib in pregnant or nursing women.\n* Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgement, interfere with full participation in the study, including administration of itacitinib and attending required study visits (if outpatient); pose a significant risk to the participant; or interfere with interpretation of study data.\n* Inability of the participant to swallow and retain oral medication.\n* Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are ineligible.
