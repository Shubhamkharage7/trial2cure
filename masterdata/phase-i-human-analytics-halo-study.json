This study seeks to use machine learning and data analysis techniques to increase diagnostic confidence and reduce time-to-diagnosis related to cardiovascular, oncologic, neurologic, and other diseases and disorders.\n\nThe study endeavors to develop ensemble multivariate biomarker risk scores to predict future development of diseases and disorders, improve diagnosis in preclinical states and increase diagnostic accuracy in the earliest clinical states. We also aim to evaluate data analysis techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce time to diagnosis, improve risk stratification for participants through machine learning algorithms and direct participants to relevant and applicable clinical trials upon physician review, approval and recommendation."
