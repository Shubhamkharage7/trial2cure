This single-site trial will include up to 60 adults with self-reported fear of dogs, snakes, and/or spiders who will be randomly assigned via the REDCap Randomization Module using a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive 12 sessions of exposure therapy over the course of 3 months via standard telemental health (TMH; n=15) vs. Doxy.me VR (n=15), a telemedicine-based virtual reality clinic."
