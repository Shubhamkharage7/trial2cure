Healthy adults who exclusively use e-cigarettes will undergo monitored e-cigarette abstinence over seven days (1 week) in a residential unit. The investigators will evaluate the contribution of nicotine to withdrawal expression by assigning participants to one of three conditions: active nicotine patch, placebo patch control, or no patch to control for expectancies. Standardized behavioral and biological measures associated with withdrawal including patient report, cognitive task performance, and biometrics will be collected throughout to establish a rigorous timecourse of withdrawal and evaluate the contribution of nicotine to these symptoms."
