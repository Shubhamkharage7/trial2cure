            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nDiseases involving blood, blood vessels, and immune systems are leading causes of death in the United States. Researchers studying these diseases need to compare blood samples from both healthy and sick individuals. Blood samples from healthy people are also used to establish what is normal when developing new tests for diseases and to make sure new testing equipment is working properly.\n\nObjective:\n\nThis natural history study will collect blood samples from healthy people. The blood will be used for various kinds of research.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy adults aged 18 years or older. Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have a telehealth visit or telephone call to review their medical history.\n\nThey will come to the NIH Clinical Center. They will have a needle inserted into a vein in their arm or hand. About 10 tablespoons of blood will be drawn through the needle.\n\nResearchers may perform a complete blood count, a type of blood test that can help evaluate the participant s overall health. They may do a blood type test.\n\nThe blood samples will also be used for genetic studies.\n\nSome blood samples may be stored for use in future research.\n\nParticipants may choose to return for repeat visits for up to 10 years. Review of their medical history may also be repeated at later visits. They will receive $50 per blood collection visit.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will serve to provide tissue samples from individuals with healthy vasculature for mechanistic studies of vascular inflammation and thrombosis.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo collect samples from healthy volunteers to:\n\n* Establish and validate technical assays and equipment (e.g. platelet aggregation, inflammasome activation, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, tissue factor activity, etc.)\n* Establish normal physiologic mechanisms and parameters in samples from healthy volunteers (e.g. platelet function, circulating autoantibody titers, etc.)\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThis protocol does not have an outcome measure, but rather will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices for human research solely for the purpose of obtaining blood samples to optimize assays, conduct mechanistic investigations, measure vascular biomarkers, and facilitate the study of vascular and immunologic diseases in patients enrolled in other studies."
