            "briefSummary": "This study will examine whether wearable sensors can be used to track changes in cognitive-motor performance in response to a disease or an intervention.\n\nThe investigators specific aims are twofold, first aim to explore whether and how a clinical condition such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) may impact motor-cognitive performance measurable using validated wearable devices (e.g., LEGSys, BalanSENS, and Frailty Meter). Second, the investigators will explore whether an exercise intervention provided via tele-medicine (tele-rehabilitation) can enhance motor-cognitive performance.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators specific research questions: (1) Which motor-cognitive parameters measurable by wearable sensors (e.g. gait, balance, frailty index, etc) are linked to specific diseases (e.g. COPD, CHF) (2) Which motor-cognitive parameters are most responsive to identify changes in patients ambulatory performance related to Tele-rehabilitation\n\nThe investigators will recruit a minimum of 15 per clinical condition with a maximum of 150 per clinical condition in subjects suffering from different disorders, which may impact motor-cognitive. Targeted disorders: COPD and CHF. Other chronic illness may also be recruited such as Diabetes, Peripheral Arterial Disease, Morbus Parkinson, Cancer, Neuropathy, Frailty, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Depression, and patients undergoing major surgical intervention. Fifteen or more people with the same disorder would form a group.\n\nThe investigators will measure motor-cognitive performance from each subject. For this purpose several sensors will be attached to the body using elastic straps. Each subject will be asked to dedicate approximately 1 hour of their time for each visit. A series of health related questionnaires will be used to evaluate the quality of life, clinical problems, cognition, and pain intensity levels, respectively. Medical history (from the subject's chart) and demographic information will be obtained.\n\nThis study consists of Core and Ancillary Measurements. Core Measurements (Motor cognitive test) will be performed during all visits whereas Ancillary Measurements may not be required for anyone.\n\nIf the subject is undergoing tele-rehabilitation intervention, which may also benefit functional status (e.g. improvement in balance), the investigators will re-examine motor-cognitive performance using the test described above to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed test in tracking outcomes in response to the intervention or predict outcomes based on baseline assessments. Specifically, depending on the type of intervention and frequency of standard of care visits for follow-up at the clinic, the investigators may re-assess functional performance at each follow-up standard of care visit, upon the availability of the subject. Please note that the number of follow up visits will not exceed 12 visits over the course of 12 months."
