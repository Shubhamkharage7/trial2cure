            "briefSummary": "The goal of this trial is to test if colonization with the gut bacteria Oxalobacter formigenes leads to a reduction in urinary oxalate excretion in patients with calcium oxalate kidney stone disease.\n\nThe study will recruit adult participants with a history of calcium oxalate kidney stones who are not colonized with Oxalobacter formigenes.\n\nParticipants will\n\n* ingest fixed diets containing low and moderately high amounts of oxalate for 4 days at a time\n* collect urine, blood and stool samples during the fixed diets\n* ingest a preparation of live Oxalobacter formigenes to induce colonization with Oxalobacter formigenes",
            "detailedDescription": "In this study the investigators propose to measure the excretion of urinary oxalate on a fixed diet with controlled amounts of oxalate, before and after inducing colonization with the gut bacteria Oxalobacter formigenes in individuals with a history of calcium oxalate kidney stones not already colonized with Oxalobacter formigenes.\n\nScreening and Pre-colonization phase. Between the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), the study will enroll 40 individuals with a history of idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney (20 males/20 females). Screening will include stool colonization testing, blood complete metabolic profile, 24-hr urine specimens collected at home on self-selected diets and anthropometric measurements.\n\nParticipants will ingest a low-oxalate (\\<60 mg/day) fixed diet for 4 consecutive days and collect two 24-hr urines and a stool sample after 2 days of dietary equilibration, as well as one fasted blood sample on the last morning.\n\nAfter a wash-out period of at least 1 week, participants will ingest a moderately high-oxalate (250-300 mg/day) fixed diet for 4 consecutive days and collect two 24-hr urines and a stool sample after 2 days of dietary equilibration, as well as one fasted blood sample on the last morning.\n\nColonization and Post-colonization phase. Participants will be colonized with Oxalobacter formigenes by ingesting a freshly thawed paste of live bacterial preparation of O. formigenes. They will collect a stool sample 1 week later to assess if colonization occured.\n\nAfter confirmation of successful colonization, participants will ingest a low-oxalate (\\<60 mg/day) fixed diet for 4 consecutive days and collect two 24-hr urines and a stool sample after 2 days of dietary equilibration, as well as one fasted blood sample on the last morning.\n\nAfter a wash-out period of at least 1 week, participants will ingest a moderately high-oxalate (250-300 mg/day) fixed diet for 4 consecutive days and collect two 24-hr urines and a stool sample after 2 days of dietary equilibration, as well as one fasted blood sample on the last morning.\n\nFollow-up phase Participants will be followed up every 6 months to assess sustainability of colonization, provide a stool sample and answer a simple questionnaire. A 24-hr urine collection will be requested once a year after colonization, on the same moderately high oxalate diet diet after 2 days of dietary equilibration."
