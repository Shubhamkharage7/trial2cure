The investigators will look at thinking abilities and brain images before and after chemotherapy to see if it can help identify people at risk for cognitive side effects of the treatment, and to better understand effects of treatment on brain structure and function.\n* The investigators are looking for participants who have either been recently recently diagnosed breast cancer participant or a healthy volunteer.\n* What is involved in the study:\n\n  * Memory and Thinking Tests\n  * Imaging: Either MRI/or MRI and PET Scans"
