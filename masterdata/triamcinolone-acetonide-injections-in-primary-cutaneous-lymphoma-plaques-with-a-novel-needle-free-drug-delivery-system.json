After the treatment, the participants will be followed for another three visits over the course of 4 months to see how the treated areas responded.\n\nIn order to account for 20% dropout, 11 patients per group (a needle free and a traditional treatment group in CBCL patients and the same two groups in CTCL patients) will be recruited."
