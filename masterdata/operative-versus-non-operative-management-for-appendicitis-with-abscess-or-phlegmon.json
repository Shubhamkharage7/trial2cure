            "detailedDescription": "Complicated appendicitis with abscess or phlegmon represents a challenging problem to emergency general surgeons, and the preferred treatment remains controversial. A variety of therapies have been recommended including early operative intervention, delayed operative intervention, and non-operative management. Recently, a prospective randomized controlled trial from a single center was conducted in Finland comparing operative and non-operative management of appendiceal abscess. Patients managed in the operative arm were found to have a shorter length of stay, fewer re-admissions, and fewer additional interventions than those managed in the non-operative group, but there is no high-quality randomized control trial conducted in the United States to support this. The investigators, therefore plan to carry out a multi-center, patient choice study comparing operative and non-operative management of complicated appendicitis with abscess or phlegmon in the United States."
