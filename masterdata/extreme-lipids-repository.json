The investigators plan to conduct sophisticated composition and functional analyses as well as genetic analysis to better understand the determinants of extreme lipid derangements.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be recruited from clinical encounters within the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Hospital by screening the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for those with lipid labs and values that satisfy criteria for extreme values. Identified participants will be recruited to provide health information via survey, permission to extract clinical information from the EMR, and blood collection for future analyses. Measurements will span direct measurement of circulating species, genetic analyses, and analysis of circulating cells. The blood specimens will be stored for future studies and collaborations and thus, will constitute a blood-based repository. All study procedures are experimental but do not involve an actual intervention."
