Following the trial, participants will complete self-report measures as well as a semi-structured interview to learn about their experience in using the app, any experienced difficulties, and recommendations for improving the acceptance and usage of the app.\n\nIntervention components: The intervention components include: tailored daily text intervention text message, educational feature, goal setting and monitoring, and an activity locator that allow participants to enter their zip code and view available resources for physical activity."
