            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to find objective biomarkers of vaso-occlusion (blood vessel blockage) in people with SCD. Using information from earlier studies and work being done, researchers have developed a strategy to image VOC, using positron emission tomography (PET).\n\nThe ability to see and measure VOC in SCD patients can help patient care, by showing when and how a VOC is occurring or going to occur. Studying this method will also help in future drug research, as it will allow researchers to deliver promising new medications that target hyper-adhesion and sickling in people with SCD.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to find objective biomarkers of vaso-occlusion (blood vessel blockage) in people with Sickle Cell Disease(SCD). Using information from earlier studies, and work being done at Washington University, a strategy to image vaso-occulusive crisis (VOC) has been developed, using positron emission tomography (PET) for anatomical localization only. 64Cu-LLP2A is the radio tracer used for the study.\n\nAim: To develop quantitative PET imaging of VOC in patients with SCD. The researchers hypothesize that the radio tracer 64Cu-LLP2A uptake increases proportionally to the intensity of pain in patients with VOC, compared to baseline values. This increase in uptake will be assessed focally in areas of pain as well as globally to reflect heightened systemic inflammation.\n\nPrimary and secondary study endpoint: The overarching hypothesis of this study is that PET tracer uptake of intensity of 64Cu-LLP2A is a real time, quantitative measure of hyper adhesion in VOC."
