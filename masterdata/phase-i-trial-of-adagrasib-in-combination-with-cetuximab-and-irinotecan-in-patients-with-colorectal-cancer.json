Patients treated for hepatitis C with no detectable viral load are permitted.\n* Pregnancy. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test during screening.\n* Breast-feeding or planning to breast feed during the study or within 6 months after end of treatment.\n* Any serious illness, uncontrolled inter-current illness, psychiatric illness, active or uncontrolled infection, or other medical history, including laboratory results, which, in the investigator's opinion, would be likely to interfere with the patient's participation in the study, or with the interpretation of results.",
