            "briefSummary": "While advancements in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) have improved image quality, it is unclear how these improvements are connected to the clinical evaluation of individuals with cardiovascular disease. The aim of this large prospective registry revolves around 4 key principles: 1) utilize CMR to gain additional pathophysiologic insights into cardiovascular disease, 2) understand how CMR compares to alternative cardiovascular diagnostic modalities, 3) determine how CMR affects clinical management decisions, and 4) establish a link between CMR findings and long term prognosis in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease. The ultimate aim is to utilize CMR to improve patient outcomes.\n\nCMR techniques to be studies include function, fibrosis, and flow. Focus areas include valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and vascular disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patient Population, Recruitment, and Consent:\n\nPatients presenting to the Houston Methodist DeBakey CMR Laboratory will be enrolled from April 2008 to April 2038. It is expected that up to 100,000 patients may be enrolled during this period.\n\nSubjects will be identified based on their referral to the Houston Methodist DeBakey CMR Laboratory for MRI studies during the proposed study period.\n\nAfter enrollment, a registered nurse or physician will perform a thorough structured patient interview and/or review of electronic health records to document baseline medical history including cardiac risk factors, symptoms, medication usage, and prior procedure history. A small blood sample will be drawn and stored for future biomarker and/or genetic testing analysis. Annual follow up for clinical status will be performed via review of electronic health records; structured telephone interviews with the patients, relatives, and/or their health care providers; and/or the social security death index database."
