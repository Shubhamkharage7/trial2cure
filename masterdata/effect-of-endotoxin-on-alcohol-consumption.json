Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive a single dose of 0.4ng/kg i.v. endotoxin or placebo during a single laboratory session to evaluate ad-libitum alcohol consumption.\n\nDuring the laboratory session, endotoxin (or placebo) administration will precede a 2-hour alcohol self-administration period.\n\nParticipants will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment to evaluate drinking behavior.\n\nAdverse events are evaluated during the laboratory session and follow-up, and will be tabulated."
