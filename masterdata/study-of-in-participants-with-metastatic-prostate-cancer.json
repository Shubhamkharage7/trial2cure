Participants receiving medical castration therapy with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues should continue this treatment during the study.\n   3. Measurable PSA \\>/=1 ng/mL AND\n   4. Evidence of progression within 6 months prior to screening according to one of the following:\n\n   (i) Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 criteria with or without PSA progression as per Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG3) (ii) Radiographic disease progression in bone defined as the appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions on bone scan as per Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG3).\n3. Participant has previously received a NHA (ie, abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide) and taxane as part of their treatment for prostate cancer (whether before or in the metastatic castration-resistant setting) or be ineligible for or refuse taxanes.\n4. For participants with HRR deficiency disease or breast cancer gene mutated disease, they disease must also have received a PARP inhibitor or be intolerant of this therapy.\n5. For participants who have high microsatellite instability or deficient DNA mismatch repair they must also have received at least one line of checkpoint inhibitors (ie, pembrolizumab), not be eligible for, or be intolerant to therapy as per NCCN or local treatment guidelines.\n6.

Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n13. Active hepatitis C infection (HCV). Participants testing positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if the polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.\n14. Participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be included under the following circumstances:\n\n    1. Negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and positive for anti-HBc antibody\n    2. Positive for HbsAg, but for \\> 6 months have had normal transaminases and HBV DNA levels between 0 - 2000 IU/mL (inactive carrier state) and willing to start and maintain antiviral treatment for at least the duration of the study.\n    3. HBV DNA levels \\> 2000 IU/mL but on prophylactic antiviral treatment for the past 3 months and will maintain the antiviral treatment during the study.\n15. Local requirements for the testing for infectious diseases and exclusions of applicable participants should be followed per local regulations.\n\n    Prior/Concomitant Therapy\n16. Participants may not receive full-dose long acting oral or parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic agents for therapeutic (as opposed to prophylactic) purpose from the time of informed consent to 28-days post infusion of AZD0754. Use of short acting direct oral anticoagulants for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes are permitted.\n17. Any concomitant medications known to be associated with Torsades de Points within 14 days prior and 28 days after AZD0754 infusion.\n18. Received the following:\n\n    1. Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to apheresis, or planned major surgery within 4 weeks of the study treatment administration (Note: participants with planned surgical procedures to be conducted under local anaesthesia may participate after discussion with the Sponsor).\n    2. Steroids (except inhaled steroids) or other immunomodulators (including interleukins, interferons, and thymosins) of systemic therapeutic dose, and systemic corticosteroids at doses exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent \\< 7 days prior to apheresis.\n19. Receipt of the last dose of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumour embolisation, or monoclonal antibodies, investigational product) within 5 half-lives or \u2264 21 days (whichever is shorter) prior to apheresis. Radiotherapy within 14 days. However, if the radiation portal covered \u2264 5% of the bone marrow reserve, the participant is eligible irrespective of the end date of radiotherapy. If sufficient washout time has not occurred due to the schedule or PK properties of an agent, a longer washout period will be required, as agreed by AstraZeneca and the Investigator.\n20. Any concurrent anticancer treatment with the following exceptions:\n\n    1. Protocol-defined LDC\n    2. Hormonal therapy for non cancer-related conditions (eg, hormone replacement therapy)\n    3. Androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinising-hormone replacement hormone agonist/antagonist is required if needed to maintain testosterone level in the castration range (levels \\< 50 ng/dL) and should be continued (unless bilateral orchiectomy) throughout the trial. Following apheresis, bridging therapy is permitted (if required) as outlined in Section 6.1.2\n21. Participants should not have received any live vaccines within 30 days prior to apheresis. Participants can receive coronavirus (COVID)-19 vaccines, at the discretion of the Investigator, following a benefit/risk evaluation for the individual participant and in accordance with local rules and regulations and vaccination guidelines. Note: If a COVID-19 vaccine is administered, it should ideally be done at least one week prior to LDC or after completion of the DLT period.\n\n    Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience\n22. Prior treatment with a CAR-T therapy directed at any target or any therapy that is targeted to STEAP2.\n23. Participants with a known life-threatening allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to AZD0754 or any of the excipients of the product, including dimethylsulfoxide.",
