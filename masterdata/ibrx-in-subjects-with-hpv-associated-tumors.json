The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the maximum tolerated dose of IBRX-042?\n* How well does the study drug treat cancer?\n* What effects the study drug may have on the human body and cancer?\n\nParticipants will receive IBRX-042 at one of three dose levels every 3 weeks for a total of 3 injections. Participants will undergo tests, exams, and procedures that are part of standard of care and for study purposes. IBRX-042 will be administered by injection every 3 weeks for a total of 3 injections.",
            "detailedDescription": "Up to 60 subjects may be screened for up to 18 subjects to receive at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects will be administered IBRX-042 by injection once every 3 weeks for a total of 3 injections.\n\nSubjects will receive study treatments until they report progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in their best interest to continue treatment.\n\nSubjects who progress, discontinue treatment, or complete the study will attend an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after the last study assessment. Additionally, subjects will attend a follow-up visit 6 months following administration of the last dose of IBRX-042. After the subject completes or withdraws from the study, the study team will contact subjects approximately every 3 months for a minimum of 1 year post administration of the first dose of study drug and then yearly until death to collect follow-up information, including survival status, collection of adverse events, and any current cancer treatment regimen. A clinic visit will be scheduled for 6 months after the last injection administered for collection of whole blood for exploratory immune and molecular profiling."

Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the investigational drugs used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for treatment-related complications.\n13. Serious pulmonary disease.\n14. Platelet count \\< 100,000 cells/mm3.\n15. Active hepatitis.\n16. Positive results of screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and/or hepatitis C virus.\n17.
