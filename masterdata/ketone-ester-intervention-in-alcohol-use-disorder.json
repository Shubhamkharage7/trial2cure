            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to study how a nutritional ketone ester may effect brain function and alcohol consumption in regular alcohol users. The study will see how the brain responds, once after drinking the ketone ester and once after drinking a \"placebo\", which will look and taste the same as the ketone ester drink.\n\nMetabolic ketosis induced by a ketogenic diet has been previously shown to elevate brain ketone bodies and reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms in humans with AUD, and reduce alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent rats. The study investigates whether metabolic ketosis induced by a one-dose nutritional ketone ester (KE) reduces brain reactivity to alcohol cues (fMRI), alcohol craving and alcohol consumption in humans with AUD, and if KE elevates ketone bodies using proton spectroscopy. This study uses a double blind, random ordered, 2-way crossover design in n=20 non-treatment seeking AUD who come in on two separate testing days: on one testing day the participants consume KE ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate), and on another testing day a drink with isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), after which participants are scanned for 1H-MRS and fMRI and complete an alcohol consumption paradigm each day after scanning.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a one month, prospective, double-blind, randomized, 2-way crossover design in n=20 non-treatment seeking AUD who come in for a screening day and two separate testing days: on one testing day the participants consume a drink with 1.9 kcal/kg of nutritional ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE), and on another testing day a drink with isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), after which participants are scanned for 1H-MRS and fMRI (20 subjects are scanned twice; 40 scans in total) and complete an alcohol consumption paradigm each day after scanning (40 in total). Blood labs for ketone bodies, ghrelin and leptin will be drawn during the study visists.\n\nThe KE \"(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate\" is a safe, effective, and non-invasive way to increases ketone levels within 1 hr to concentrations similar to KD, and does not require a study IND. KE-induced ketone levels remain heightened for 4 hrs, and one dose of KE has shown to increase athletes' performances, improve mood, and cognitive and daily activity performance in Alzheimer's disease, and decrease ghrelin levels and subjective appetite in healthy volunteers. The latter finding is relevant to AUD, since ghrelin has been positively associated with alcohol craving and alcohol self-administration in AUD patients.\n\nBefore study participation, subjects are screened for psychiatric and medical problems, fasting glucose, urine drug screen, pregnancy test if female.\n\nOn each testing day, both before and 30 min after the drink, ketone bodies, leptin and ghrelin are measured in blood. After 15 minutes of KE, participants undergo a 1-hour MRI scan during which, after standard structural scans, the investigators measure ketone body metabolites using 1H-MRS, reactivity to alcohol cues using functional MRI, resting state MRI, cerebral blood flow using perfusion and brain iron measurements.\n\nOn each study visit, four blood draws will be analyzed for ketone bodies, ghrelin and leptin at KE intake (t0), 15 minutes after when the MRI starts (t15), 10 after the MRI is done and after the priming drink (t85), and then at 140, and 200 minutes after (i.e., t140 and t200).\n\nDirectly after MRI scanning, participants perform an alcohol self-administation \"bar-lab\" paradigm. Alcohol craving and alcohol effects will be measured before and during the alcohol self-administration. Participants will then be asked what they thought the study was about, and whether they thought the experimental drink influenced them in any way. After this, participants will be breathalyzed, and receive a meal."
