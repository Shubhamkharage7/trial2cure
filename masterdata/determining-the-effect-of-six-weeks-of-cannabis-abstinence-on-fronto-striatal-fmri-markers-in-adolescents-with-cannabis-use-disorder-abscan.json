            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to understand the changes in neural correlates of reward in adolescents with and without Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). The study will collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data at 3 different timepoints with the primary goals of understanding striatal reward-based activation during a Monetary Incentive Delay Task and fronto-striatal fMRI resting-state functional connectivity. The study will also explore self-reported impulsivity. The long-term goal is to advance scientific understanding of neural changes associated with cannabis abstinence and inter-individual variability that cannot be otherwise measured in preexisting observational cohorts such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study.\n\nThis parallel intervention study will collect fMRI data in adolescents ages 15-18 years old with and without CUD at three different timepoints over the course of their intervention. Utilizing a validated paradigm, adolescents with CUD will be randomized to 6-weeks of either incentivized, biochemically verified abstinence via contingency management or monitoring with no required abstinence. Age- and sex-matched adolescents with no lifetime history of cannabis use will also complete the protocol. Participants will complete 8 study visits (3 with fMRI scans) involving urinalysis to confirm cannabis self-report and measures of impulsivity."
