            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial of carboplatin in combination with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in participants with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The study will take place in two parts: Phase 1a to define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and Phase 1b to further assess safety and preliminary clinical activity of the combination regimen.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved carboplatin for prostate cancer but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe U.S. FDA has approved 177Lu-PSMA-617 as a treatment option for prostate cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment visits, tumor biopsies, x-rays, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, and blood tests.\n\nIt is expected that about 35 people will take part in this research study.\n\nNovartis is supporting this research study by providing 177Lu-PSMA-617, as well as research funding."

Children under age 18 are excluded as prostate cancer is a disease of adults.\n* Progressive disease at study entry, as defined by either one of the following:\n\n  * Sequence of at least 2 rising PSA values at a minimum of 1-week intervals with the last result being \u22651.0 ng/mL if confirmed PSA rise is the only indication of progression. Patients who received an anti-androgen (flutamide, bicalutamide or nilutamide) must have PSA progression \u22654 weeks after the last dose.\n  * Radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue and/or per PCWG3 for bone (i.e. appearance of \u22652 new bone lesions), with or without PSA progression.\n* Presence of \u22651 metastatic lesion metastatic lesion present on baseline CT, MRI, or bone scan imaging obtained \u226428 days prior to beginning study therapy.\n* Prior receipt of at least one taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel or cabazitaxel) and at least one ARPI (abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide) in the localized, recurrent or metastatic setting. Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor(s) is permitted. Prior treatment with Ra-223 is permitted, providing that the last dose of Ra-223 was \u226590 days prior to study entry.\n* Presence of \u22651 PSMA-avid lesion (with uptake \\> liver) on baseline/screening 68GaPSMA-11 PSMA-PET.\n* Serum testosterone level must be \u226450ng/dL (1.73 nmol/L) at the screening visit.

For this reason and because chemotherapies and radioligand therapies are known to be teratogenic, men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

Female partners of child-bearing potential should also use highly effective birth control methods throughout the male participant's study treatment and for at least 14 weeks following the last dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. (Providing consents in as many languages as possible is encouraged)\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to planned cycle 1 day 1 of study treatment.\n* Participants who have received anti-neoplastic intervention or experimental antineoplastic therapy within 14 days of planned cycle 1 day 1 of study therapy.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants who have previously received 177Lu-PSMA-617.\n* Participants who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 177Lu-PSMA-617 and carboplatin.\n* Participants with untreated brain metastases. Participants with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging at least 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression and ongoing corticosteroids are not required. Participants with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy.\n* Symptomatic cord compression, or clinical or radiologic findings indicative of impending cord compression.\n* Concurrent active malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen. Patients with non-melanomatous skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, cancer not needing active therapy for at least 2 years, cancer for which the treating investigator deems the subject to be in remission, or any prior malignancy that was treated with curative intent (no evidence of disease for at least 3 years) are permitted to enroll.\n* The participant has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\<30ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).",
