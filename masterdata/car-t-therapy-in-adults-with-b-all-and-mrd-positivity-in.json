This trial will enroll 10 patients for apheresis and treatment with lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by UCD19 CAR T cell infusion. Patients will be assessed for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) (within 42 days after CAR T infusion), duration of B cell aplasia, overall response rate (at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months), and overall survival and event free survival (at 12- and 24- months) post UCD19 CAR T infusion."
