Data collected during this trial will be used to design the upcoming pivotal study .\n\nThe study will utilize an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (iDSMB) that will review safety data to allow dose escalation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a non randomized, open label, single center , phase 1/2 trial with a sequential enrollment in a 3+3 dose escalation design to establish the maximal tolerated dose of light (MTD).\n\nThe dose of light will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients until at least 1 patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).\n\nA DLT is defined as any grade \u2265 3 Adverse Event (AE), or any relevant grade 2 AE of Central Nervous System or any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) possibly, probably or definitively related to the intraoperative PDT (i.e., 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (5-ALA HCl) administration + brain cavity illumination), for which the onset date is within 28 days after the procedure, and where conservative therapy fails and surgical is required, according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.\n\nAfter dose escalation patient will be followed in the standard of care until visit at 6 months to evaluate the progression free survival."
