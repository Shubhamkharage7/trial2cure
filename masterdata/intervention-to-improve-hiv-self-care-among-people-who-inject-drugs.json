All participants will receive substance use treatment referral information if interested. Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Participants in both arms will receive a mobile application-facilitated incentivized directly observed therapy (iDOT) intervention. Participants in the control arm will receive iDOT alone. Participants in the intervention arm will receive iDOT in combination with the iSTRIVE intervention. After randomization, participants in the iSTRIVE intervention group will attend 6 therapy sessions focused on behavioral strategies for improving HIV self-care, meta-cognitive awareness of emotions and thoughts, cognitive restructuring, and assertive communication skills. Participants in the iSTRIVE intervention arm will also receive texts messages containing customized compassionate self-statements to enhance HIV-related self-care. All participants will be compensated for every research visit and adherence to the iDOT protocol."
