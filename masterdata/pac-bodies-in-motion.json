            "briefSummary": "In the proposed study, the investigators will examine the effectiveness of Bodie in Motion (BIM) program in improving the body image, eating concerns, and overall psychological well-being, in a racially/ethnically diverse group of female and male-identifying athletes with body image concerns. Based on previous research, participating athletes should have direct and immediate Well-Being (i.e., mental health) benefits from their involvement in BIM.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Primary Aim of this project is to modify (based on diverse college student athlete acceptability and effectiveness feedback) and then further test the effectiveness of the evidence-based Bodies in Motion (BIM) program in reducing the body image concerns, decreasing the disordered eating symptoms, and improving the psychological well-being (e.g., depression, anxiety) in a racially/ethnically diverse group of female and male-identifying student-athletes in the Pac-12 conference.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) control athletes who have been matched on race, ethnicity, sport, and gender (male vs. female-identifying), athletes completing the BIM treatment will have greater improvements on body image and eating concerns, and lower levels of depression and anxiety. These differences will occur immediately following completion of BIM and will be maintained at 6- and 12-months. In keeping with our mixed-methods approach, through qualitative interviews conducted with the athletes who have participated in the BIM program, the investigators will explore their perceptions of the program's efficacy, relative to how the awareness, perspectives, and skills developed from the program have, or have not, informed their relationship with themselves, their bodies, food, physical activity, and general psychological well-being. The investigators expect that, based on past research (Voelker, Petrie et al., 2021) that athletes will report increased awareness of self and body, positive shifts in how they view themselves and their bodies, and the adoption of psychological tools (e.g., mindful self-compassion) to cope more effectively with appearance stressors.\n\nThe secondary Aim is to determine if the BIM program's effectiveness differs based on athletes' race/ ethnicity within each gender (e.g., for female-identifying athletes). That is, does athlete race/ethnicity moderate their BIM outcomes.\n\nExploratory aims include examining if sport played and facilitators' professional training (e.g., sport nutritionist, sport psychologist) further moderate outcomes.\n\nStudent athletes will be recruited through self-selection into the Bodies in Motion (BIM) program from one of the seven participating schools who will be offering this treatment. Athletes who A) self-identify as experiencing body image concerns, or B) are referred by someone (e.g., nutritionist, athletic trainer) based on some expressed body dissatisfaction. Each university intervention site will offer BIM to its athletes as a clinical service. And upon enrolling in BIM, athletes will be presented with an overview of the ongoing research study and the opportunity to provide consent for their intervention data to be shared for research purposes. Consent to sharing data for research purposes will not be required for participating in BIM. Athletes participating in BIM who give consent to share their data for research purposes (via electronic consent documentation) will complete additional surveys related to treatment outcomes.\n\nOnce the investigators have the BIM intervention participants identified and consented into the study, the investigators will then go into the MH-CDE screener data to find \"matched\" participants at other schools.\n\nMatched-control participants will already be completing the Mental Health Common Data Elements (MH-CDEs) as part of their biannual mental health screeners in their respective athletics department. As part of their clinical care within the various athletic departments, student-athletes are asked to complete a variety of assessments (e.g., physical, MH-CDEs, etc.). The MH-CDEs are currently delivered via REDCap through a link provided in email. For the matched-control participants, the investigators will have a consent at the end of the MH-CDEs explaining the study and asking if the investigators can utilize their data for research purposes. The investigators will make it clear that participating in our study (i.e., allowing us to use their data) in no way affects their ability to participate in sports."
