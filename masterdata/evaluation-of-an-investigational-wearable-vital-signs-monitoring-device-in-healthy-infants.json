            "detailedDescription": "Vital sign monitoring of infants outside of a traditional healthcare setting has already been shown to significantly decrease mortality for children with single ventricle congenital heart disease (1V CHD), a fragile group of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, there is a critical need to develop an accurate, at-home vital sign monitoring system for infants to expand the benefits of remote monitoring to further patient populations. The investigators believe that allowing for continuous monitoring at a clinical standard with interpretations and alerts built into the technology will result in an even greater decline in mortality for infants with 1V CHD, improved clinical outcomes for all infants with CHD, and increased well-being for healthy infants.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the investigators are developing a health monitoring system that collects numerical data and physiological waveforms describing heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), pulse oximetry (SpO2), regional oxygen saturation, temperature, and infant motion."
