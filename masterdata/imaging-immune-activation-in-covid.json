Up to 20 participants will be enrolled over an accrual period of approximately 24 months. Each participant will undergo one PET-CT scan following 50 +/- 10 minutes uptake following a single bolus injection of \\[18F\\]F-AraG in order to determine the tissue distribution of tracer in pariticpants with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. A second optional \\[18F\\]F-AraG dose and PET-CT will be offered approximately 4 months following the initial imaging time point.",

The primary objective is to determine the anatomical distribution of \\[18F\\]F-AraG in participant with convalescent COVID-19 approximately 4 weeks and 5 months (optional, 4 months following first PET imaging visit) following onset of symptoms (N = 20). Tracer activity will also be compared with sex and age-matched uninfected historical control participants enrolled in prior studies. Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study who will be identified in the UCSF LIINC longitudinal COVID-19 cohort study. Each participant will undergo one PET-CT scan following 50 +/- 10 minutes uptake following a single bolus injection of \\[18F\\]F-AraG. A second optional \\[18F\\]F-AraG dose and PET-CT will be offered approximately 4 months following the initial imaging time point."
