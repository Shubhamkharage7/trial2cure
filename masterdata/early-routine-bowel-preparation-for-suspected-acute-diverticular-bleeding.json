            "briefSummary": "This investigation will utilize both a five-year retrospective analysis and a two-year prospective investigation. Variables including age; gender; presence of anticoagulation medication; hospital length of stay; total transfused red blood cell units; presence of heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or lung disease; history of diverticular disease; whether colonoscopy was performed; if therapeutic hemostasis was performed during colonoscopy; and information regarding prior colonoscopies in the past 10 years will be collected for analysis. A small number of early bowel preparation patients are expected in the retrospective study; therefore, a prospective study occurring over the next 12 months will be conducted. Patients agreeing to participate in the study would have a four-liter dose of PEG 3350 ordered, and the medication would be delivered within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Radiographic studies including computed tomography angiography, tagged RBC scan, and angiography will not be obtained in the first 24 hours of hospital admission and be considered only if the patient has ongoing hematochezia at the completion of their bowel preparation. After completion of the 12-month investigative period (or earlier if sufficient sample size is obtained for clinical significance), data will be analyzed for dissemination consideration.",
            "detailedDescription": "This investigation will utilize both a five-year retrospective analysis and a two-year prospective investigation. Patient cohorts and data will be obtained through utilization of the EPIC electronic medical record (EMR) and generating an individualized report to capture all possible patients. The report will include all admitted patients with a consult note written by the gastroenterology consult service at Methodist Dallas Medical Center. The consult note will be reviewed, and any patient not meeting the inclusion criteria or those meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be excluded. The patients remaining after this assessment will be included in the retrospective analysis. Variables including age; gender; presence of anticoagulation medication; hospital length of stay; total transfused red blood cell units; presence of heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or lung disease; history of diverticular disease; whether colonoscopy was performed; if therapeutic hemostasis was performed during colonoscopy; and information regarding prior colonoscopies in the past 10 years will be collected for analysis. A small number of early bowel preparation patients are expected in the retrospective study; therefore, a prospective study occurring over the next 12 months will be conducted. The gastroenterology consult service will assess patients with lower GI bleeding with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who qualify will be provided informed consent forms and offered the opportunity to enroll in the study. Patients agreeing to participate in the study would have a four-liter dose of PEG 3350 ordered, and the medication would be delivered within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Radiographic studies including computed tomography angiography, tagged RBC scan, and angiography will not be obtained in the first 24 hours of hospital admission and be considered only if the patient has ongoing hematochezia at the completion of their bowel preparation. The study is not evaluating effects of colonoscopy, and so any additional intervention performed by the attending gastroenterologist will be subject to their own discretion after the completion of the bowel preparation. After discharge, patient information and data variables will be collected from the EPIC EMR and included in an Excel document. After completion of the 12-month investigative period (or earlier if sufficient sample size is obtained for clinical significance), data will be analyzed for dissemination consideration. Disclaimer: Any cost associated with the procedures stated herein will be billed directly to insurance (as applicable)."
