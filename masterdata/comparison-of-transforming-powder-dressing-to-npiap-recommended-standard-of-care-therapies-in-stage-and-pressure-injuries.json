Pressure injuries are classified into four escalating stages, from intact skin to full thickness wounds with deep tissue loss and exposed bone. This study will compare current standard of care treatment (as recommended by the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel) to treatment with Altrazeal\u00ae in patients with stage 2, stage 3 and stage 4 pressure injury wounds. Altrazeal\u00ae is a Class 1, 501(k) exempt medical device listed with the FDA as a \"dressing, wound, hydrogel\" and has an extended wear time of up to 30 days. Subjects can be enrolled in the study either as an outpatient, or while hospitalized. Half of the subjects will be randomized to standard of care treatment, and the other half will be randomized to Altrazeal\u00ae. There are a total of up to 12 study visits taking place over 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pressure injuries, commonly known as pressure ulcers, affect over 2.5 million people in the United States. Pressure injuries are classified into four escalating stages, from intact skin with redness to full thickness wounds with deep tissue loss and exposed bone.\n\nThis study will focus on patients with stage 2, stage 3 and stage 4 pressure injury wounds. It will compare current standard of care treatment (as recommended by the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel) to treatment with Altrazeal\u00ae Transforming Powder Dressing (TPD). Altrazeal\u00ae is a Class 1, 501(k) exempt medical device listed with the FDA as a \"dressing, wound, hydrogel\" and has an extended wear time of up to 30 days. Altrazeal\u00ae is a powder dressing that conforms to the wound, covering and protecting it, shielding the wound from bacteria. Altrazeal\u00ae is used in conjunction with a secondary dressing when needed.\n\nThe primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether dressing changes can be reduced during treatment of pressure injuries. The study will also compare wound healing between the group receiving Altrazeal\u00ae and the group receiving standard of care dressings, as well as complications, pain, quality of life, and overall costs between the two groups.\n\nSubjects will be randomized into 2 groups, standard of care and Altrazeal\u00ae. Half of the subjects will receive current standard of care treatment, and the other half will receive treatment with Altrazeal\u00ae. This is an open-label study, meaning that both the subject and the treatment provider will know what study group the subject has been randomized to.\n\nThe first visit will be the screening visit to ensure patients meet eligibility criteria. Patients can be either an outpatient or hospitalized. Written informed consent will be obtained during this visit. A wound evaluation will be performed, and laboratory work ordered, if not done recently.\n\nOnce identified as meeting study criteria, the next visit is Baseline Visit, where randomization will occur and the first treatment will take place. Participants will be evaluated for 12 additional consecutive weeks, receiving wound evaluation, measurements, and getting treatment for the wound. A pain evaluation, quality of life survey related to having a wound, questionnaire regarding additional wound care performed between study visits. Participants will also answer questions regarding how much offloading devices or maneuvers were utilized, medications taken, and if any complications developed related to their wound care.\n\nIf the wound is healed prior to 12 weeks, the study will end when the wound is healed. Otherwise, the study will go on for 12 consecutive weeks. At the end of the study, the participant will be asked to complete a Subject Satisfaction Survey, answering questions regarding how the wound dressing worked for them. The surveys should take 5-10 minutes to complete."
