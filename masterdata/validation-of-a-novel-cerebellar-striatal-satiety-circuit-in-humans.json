            "briefSummary": "This study uses a noninvasive technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study satiety in healthy individuals.\n\nTMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, using a magnetic field to change activity in the brain. The magnetic field is produced by a coil that is held next to the scalp. In this study, the investigators will be stimulating the brain to learn more about the role of the cerebellum in satiety.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to conduct a circuit manipulation experiment to test the hypothesis that targeting the cerebellum can alter activity in response to food cues to advance the understanding of the involvement of the cerebellar-striatal circuit in feeding behavior.\n\nParticipants will undergo an initial screening session to complete informed consent and undergo baseline assessments including physical activity and food craving. Participants will additionally undergo an MRI scan that includes structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). These rsfMRI imagines will be used to isolate individual resting state networks for targeting of rTMS modulation.\n\nParticipants will then complete two separate testing sessions involving MRI imaging and food intake assessments before and after rTMS. One visit will involve consumption of a filling meal; the other visit will be completed following an overnight fast."
