Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)\n\n     * Patients with histologically proven HL will be eligible for transplantation after failing prior therapy.\n     * Patients with resistant disease (initial or at relapse): those who fail to achieve an objective partial response to three cycles of combination non-cross resistant chemotherapy will not be eligible for transplant in this trial.\n     * For stage I/II patients treated with primary chemotherapy-radiation, they must have failed (no CR or progression after CR) at least one salvage combination chemotherapy treatment regimen\n     * For advanced (stage III/IV) Hodgkin disease, patients must have failed an Adriamycin containing regimen (ABVD) or an alternative non-cross resistant regimen (e.g. MOPP)\n     * Patients with any high-risk features will also be eligible, including those who:\n\n       1. fail to achieve complete remission with initial combination chemotherapy\n       2. have bulky disease after initial therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) defined as residual mediastinal mass \u2265 5 cm or other residual mass \u2265 10 cm accompanied by other features of persisting disease (e.g., PET scan positive; high LDH; enlarging on serial x-rays or biopsy positive) will be eligible - if feasible, persistent disease should be proven by biopsy\n     * Patients should receive chemotherapy to attempt to achieve CR or minimal disease state for all patients pre-transplantation. The use of up to three cycles of non-cross resistant combination chemotherapy is advised.\n     * Residual areas of limited disease should be considered for radiotherapy after and not prior to transplantation.\n  3. HIV positive patients who are otherwise eligible for this study may be enrolled if they meet the following requirements:\n\n     * Are seen in the infectious disease (ID)/HIV clinic prior to enrollment on study for the purpose of determining eligibility and for local coordination of HIV care during the peri-transplant period.\n     * Are on maximally active anti-HIV regimen to control disease as determined appropriate by the ID/HIV physicians. For the majority of patients, this will be a highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)-type therapy including a protease inhibitor.\n     * CD4+ \u2265 50/\u00b5L\n     * HIV RNA viral load \u2264 100,000 copies per mL on each of samples 4 weeks apart. The most recent level must be within 30 days of enrollment.\n* Performance Status: Karnofsky Performance Status \u2265 80% for patients \u2265 16 years of age or Lansky Play Score \u2265 80 for patients \\< 16 years of age. Note: if poor performance status is due to lymphoma - KPS \u2265 60% or LPS \u2265 60 is acceptable\n* Organ Function\n\n  1. No evidence of serious organ dysfunction that is not attributable to tumor including:\n  1. Hematologic:\n\n     * hemoglobin \\> 8 gm/dL\n     * WBC \\> 2.5 x 109/L with an ANC \\> 1.5 x 109/L off G-CSF or GM-CSF for 10 days or Neulasta for 21 days\n     * platelets \\> 100 x 109/L without transfusion\n     * bone marrow cellularity of \\> 20% with \\<5% involvement with tumor\n  2. Renal: GFR \\> 50 ml/min/1.73m2 or serum creatinine \u2264 2.5 x ULN for age\n  3. Hepatic: no history of severe prior or ongoing chronic liver disease. Total bilirubin \u2264 2.0 mg/dl, AST and alkaline phosphatase \\<5x upper limit of normal\n  4. Cardiac: free of symptoms of uncontrolled cardiac disease including unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia. The ejection fraction by gated cardiac blood flow scan (MUGA) or Echocardiogram must be \\>40%\n  5. Pulmonary: no significant obstructive airways disease (FEV1 must be \u2265 50%) and must have acceptable diffusion capacity (corrected DLCO \\> 50% of predicted)\n  6. Central Nervous System: Patients with a history of CNS involvement by lymphoma or with relapsed primary CNS lymphoma will be eligible for Cy/TBI arm. Patients with active CNS disease are eligible if they have completed a standard treatment for CNS lymphoma and have no evidence of progressive CNS disease at the time of enrollment\n* Other Inclusion Criteria\n\n  1. At least 4 weeks from previous chemotherapy; 6 weeks from nitrosoureas\n  2. Women of child bearing potential and sexually active males with partners of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control for the duration of treatment\n  3. Patients who are carriers of Hepatitis B will be included in this study\n  4. Voluntary written consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding: Females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14 days prior to registration to rule out pregnancy\n* Eligible for any higher priority transplant protocols\n* Chemotherapy resistant disease\n* Unrelated active infection",
