            "briefSummary": "Empowered Relief (ER) is a 1-session pain relief skills intervention that is delivered in-person or online by certified clinicians to groups of patients with acute or chronic pain. Prior work in has shown ER efficacy for reducing chronic pain, pain-related distress, and other symptoms 6 months post-treatment. The purpose of this randomized trial is to conduct the first feasibility and early efficacy test of online Spanish ER delivered to Spanish-speaking adult patients with chronic pain. Participants will be followed for 1 month via 3 follow-up surveys (immediately after treatment, 2 weeks and 1 month post-treatment).",
            "detailedDescription": "Poor access to behavioral pain care contributes substantially to chronic pain burden, particularly for underserved populations such as non-English speaking patients. Empowered Relief (ER) is an evidence-based 1-session (two hour) intervention that rapidly equips individuals with effective pain relief skills. Published evidence from four randomized trials suggest benefits in pain and symptom reduction up to 6 months later. While Spanish ER is being delivered by certified instructors in the U.S., Chile, Spain, Mexico and Puerto Rico, no study has examined patient perceptions and early treatment outcomes for Spanish ER. The investigators will conduct a randomized feasibility and short-term efficacy trial in 110 Spanish speaking patients with chronic pain. The investigators will compare online Spanish Empowered Relief\u00ae (ER) vs. Usual Care (UC) in patients with chronic pain of any type (\\>= 3 months). Participants will be 1:1 randomized to either ER or UC. The study primary endpoint is change in pain intensity or pain interference from baseline to 1 month follow-up (short-term efficacy). UC will be invited to cross over to ER after their 1-month survey (treatment appraisal and satisfaction data only will be collected after receipt of ER).\n\nAim 1: Test the feasibility of online group-based Spanish ER. Hypothesis 1a: Outcome 1, participant ratings will be \\>80% for the 7-item treatment appraisal/satisfaction measure administered immediately after completion of ER.\n\nHypothesis 1b: Outcome 2, ER attendance will be \\>70%.\n\nAim 2 (preliminary efficacy): Compare ER vs. UC for reducing multi-primary outcomes (pain intensity or pain interference) and secondary outcomes at 1 month post-treatment.\n\nHypothesis 2a: Outcome 3, ER will be superior to UC for reducing pain intensity or pain interference from baseline to 1 month follow-up (multi-primary study endpoint).\n\nHypothesis 2b: Outcome 4, ER will be superior to UC for reducing 4 priority secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, pain catastrophizing, pain bothersomeness, and anxiety) from baseline to 1 month follow-up.\n\nHypothesis 2c: Outcome 5, ER will be superior to UC for reducing other secondary outcomes (satisfaction with social roles and responsibilities, anger, fatigue, pain self-efficacy, and depression) from baseline to 1 month follow-up. Patient outcomes will be longitudinally tracked at week 2 and 1 month after the intervention session for ER participants, and at week 2 and 1 month for the UC group."
