            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this phase 1 clinical trials is to determine whether niraparib (a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)) can be safely combined with irinotecan with manageable toxicity and reasonable efficacy. Emerging evidence suggest that PARPi is an effective therapeutic strategy in a wider subset of solid tumors that may have defective homologous recombination (HR) or DNA repair gene mutations. BReast CAncer gene (BRCA), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and various other DNA repair germline mutations predispose carriers to cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate and melanoma. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can work as chemopotentiators. There is significant interest in this combination, and the recommended phase II dose will be used in the upcoming NCI ComboMatch trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open label, non-randomized phase Ib dose finding study of niraparib and irinotecan combination therapy. For this study, individuals with metastatic solid tumor malignancies and BRCA1/2, ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM), or PALB2 mutations will be enrolled with specific tumors of interest including gastrointestinal cancers (e.g. colon, pancreas, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma), ovarian cancer, and breast cancer.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess safety and tolerability of niraparib and irinotecan combination therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumor malignancies and BRCA1/2, ATM, or PALB2 mutations.\n\nII. To determine the MTD and recommended phase II dose of niraparib with irinotecan combination therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the preliminary efficacy of niraparib and irinotecan combination therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumor malignancies and BRCA1/2, ATM, or PALB2 mutations.\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\nParticipants will be treated in cohorts of size three to six, and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable. Participants may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or death. Participants will be followed for 30 days after study drug discontinuation for safety and every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) for up to 2 years after start of therapy until disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)."

Must be able to take oral medications.\n12. Based on its mechanism of action and pre-clinical findings, irinotecan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Additionally, the effects of niraparib on the developing fetus are unknown. Therefore:\n\n    a. Females of childbearing potential and their male partners are advised to practice a highly effective method of contraception during treatment with niraparib and/or irinotecan and for 180 days following the last dose for females and 90 days following the last dose for males. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless one of the following applies:\n\n    i. Is considered to be permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\n\n    ii. Is postmenopausal, defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level consistently in the postmenopausal range (30 milli-international units per millilitre (mIU/mL) or higher) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to confirm a postmenopausal state.\n\n    b. A male participant of reproductive potential is eligible to participate if he agrees to the following starting with the first dose of study treatment through at least 90 days (a spermatogenesis cycle) after the last dose of study treatment:\n\n    i. refrain from donating sperm.\n\n    ii. Must agree to use a male condom (and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak).\n\n    c. Highly effective contraception is considered to be a method with a \\< 1% per year failure rate. Recommendations for highly effective contraception while taking niraparib include:\n\n    i. Ongoing use of injectable or implantable progesterone.\n\n    ii. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.\n\n    iii. Bilateral tubal occlusion.\n\n    iv. Complete (as opposed to periodic) abstinence\n\n    . v. Male sterilization, with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of absence of sperm in ejaculate.\n13. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n14. For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n15. Individuals with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For individuals with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study at clinician's discretion and not otherwise stated below.\n2. Prior allergic reaction to PARP inhibitor or irinotecan or their excipients. Prior PARP inhibitor or irinotecan (or topoisomerase 1 inhibitors) use is allowed.\n3. Individuals with known toxicity to irinotecan (e.g., grade 3 or 4 neutropenia) or suspected sensitivity.\n4. Individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous UGT1A1 polymorphisms (e.g., alleles \\*28/\\*28, \\*6/\\*6, or \\*6/\\*28) predicted to be associated with medium-to-high risk of irinotecan-related toxicity\n5. Individuals receiving any other investigational agents concurrently with the study drugs within 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, of the first dose of therapy preceding the study.\n6. Participants with unstable brain metastases are excluded. Patients with a history of brain metastases (\\>1cm) are permitted to enroll if they have been treated and have been stable for a minimum of one month on imaging. Patients may not currently receive steroids for their brain metastases. Patients with small, asymptomatic brain metastases (\\<1cm) may enroll.\n7. Individuals with a second primary malignancy\n8. Individuals with a prior history of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)\n9. Individuals with systolic blood pressure \\>140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>90 mmHg that has not been adequately treated or controlled\n10. History of a malabsorption syndrome or uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that may interfere with the absorption of oral study medication in the opinion of the investigator.\n11. Known or suspected diagnosis of Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or Acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n12. Known Gilbert's disease\n13. Individuals who are pregnant and/or breast feeding, or expecting to conceive children while receiving study treatment and/or for up to 180 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n14.
