            "briefSummary": "Rates of local disease control in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who are not candidates for surgical resection are suboptimal. Despite treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy approximately half of patients will develop recurrence of their cancer at the site of the original primary cancer. Salvage therapy options are largely ineffective and nearly all patients who develop local disease recurrence will succumb to their cancer. Recent clinical trials for lung cancer have demonstrated that local tumor control can be improved safely with accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy regimens in order to achieve radiation dose intensification. This clinical trial aims to adapt those techniques and assess the safety of such a regimen for the treatment of inoperable thoracic esophageal cancers."

Prior radiation therapy treatment plan reports must be reviewed by study PI to verify no overlap of treatment fields.\n* Severe active comorbidity as defined below:\n\n  * Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure within the last 6 months.\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.\n  * History of stroke, cerebral vascular accident, or transient ischemic attack within the last 6 months.\n  * Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration.\n  * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration.\n  * Peripheral neuropathy \\> grade 1 at time of registration.\n* Persistent complications from any major surgery within 4 weeks of study treatment start.\n* Any other major medical illness that in the investigator's opinion would prevent safe administration or completion of protocol therapy.\n* Pregnant or lactating woman. Women of childbearing potential with positive pregnancy test at baseline, or women who have not taken a pregnancy test at baseline. A man or woman who does not agree to use appropriate contraception.\n* Patients with HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are \\< 350 cells/mcL or they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to DHHS treatment guidelines is recommended.",
