            "briefSummary": "Hypothesis: More than 80% of the participants (n=40) will complete the intervention at three month (intervention completion) and the six month follow-up (retention rate as feasibility). More than 70% of the participants will report high overall study satisfaction (acceptability) with the intervention and study.\n\nThis pre-pilot will inform intervention and procedural refinements for the pilot.\n\nHypothesis: Participants who receive the intervention (n=57) will report more skin cancer-related preventive behaviors (e.g., mean of summed score of sun protection behaviors such as use of sunscreen, etc.) at three month and six month follow-up compared to those in the control condition (n=57, who will receive general information about physical activity and nutrition).",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1: The investigator will conduct individual interviews among key stakeholders such as health care providers and community leaders to plan a mobile skin cancer intervention among Hispanics. Data will be collected from individual interviews (n=10-12) among key stakeholders and triangulated with data from a funded pilot grant (focus groups and surveys with Hispanic community members) to gather information regarding Hispanics perceptions and behaviors related to skin cancer and suggestions for a WhatsApp intervention.\n\nAim 2: Employing a user-centered approach to develop a WhatsApp intervention to promote skin cancer risk-reduction behaviors among Hispanics and encourage engagement in the intervention. Use an iterative qualitative (focus groups with Hispanics, n=32; individual interviews with key stakeholders e.g., health care providers and community leaders, n=10-12) process to incorporate input from Hispanics and relevant stakeholders to develop a mobile WhatsApp intervention that is theory- and culturally-guided.\n\nAim 3: The investigators will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this mobile intervention in a single-arm pre-, post-test pilot study among at-risk Hispanics.\n\nAim 4: Refine the intervention and conduct a pilot RCT (n = 114) using this mobile program among Hispanics at risk for skin cancer and assess the preliminary effects of the mobile intervention at 3-month (intervention completion) and 6-month follow-ups."

Ten to twelve individual interviews for a 30-60 minute interview via Zoom and recorded.\n\nAim 3: A single-arm design: participants will receive WhatsApp messages about skin cancer for three months. The participants will need to complete a survey with the same questions in the pre-survey along with the acceptability and feasibility measures at three-month and six-month follow-ups.\n\nAim 4: A pilot RCT comparing two groups: skin cancer and physical activity and nutrition information.
