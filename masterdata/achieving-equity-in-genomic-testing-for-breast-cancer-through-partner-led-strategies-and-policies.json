The investigators have created a survey that is available online for any patient with cancer to fill out voluntarily regarding their experiences to date. The survey is available at: https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7VElf8oesWcB3bE",
            "detailedDescription": "The study has two main data-collecting phases. In phase 1, the investigators will engage multilevel stakeholders to respond to a survey assessing experience with and perceptions of genomic testing and its accessibility for patients with breast cancer in California. In phase 2, selected and interested survey participants who voluntarily provide their contact information on the survey will be asked to participate in an in-depth 1:1 semi-structured interview to explore disparities in genomic testing for breast cancer more closely. The investigators will then utilize their findings from both phases to present aggregate findings to an Expert Panel and Community Advisory Board and work together to develop policy recommendations. The policy recommendations will then be presented to policy makers, with the aim of identifying sustainable solutions that address breast cancer treatment and outcome disparities throughout Northern California."
