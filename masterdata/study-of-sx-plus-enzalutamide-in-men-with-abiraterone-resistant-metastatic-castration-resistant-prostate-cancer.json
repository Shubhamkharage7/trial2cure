Availability of archival tumor tissue for pathologic review and correlative studies. Tumor tissue (localized or metastatic) does not need to be received but rather identified and available (slides and blocks) upon later request for future pathologic review and possible correlative studies.\n4. Castrate levels of serum total testosterone (\\<50 ng/dl) OR ongoing documented ADT.\n5. Karnofsky performance status of 70 or higher.\n6. \u2265 18 years of age\n7. Life expectancy of \u2265 6 months\n8. Recovered to \u2264 Grade 2 toxicity from prior therapy (per CTCAE Version 5.0)\n9.

Willingness of patients who are not surgically sterile or with partners who are not postmenopausal to use medically acceptable methods of birth control for the duration of the study treatment, including 90 days after the last dose of study drug.\n11. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the release of personal health information.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior systemic anticancer treatment:\n\n   * Prior treatment with docetaxel or marketed antibody within 4 weeks of first dose of study treatment\n   * Prior radium-223 therapy within 6 weeks\n   * Prior PSMA-Lu177-617 therapy within 4 weeks\n2.

Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n7. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n8. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n9.

Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n13. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n14. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n15. Has a known uncontrolled Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection based on detectable HIV viral load and abnormal CD4 count of \\<350/mm3.\n16. Has a known active Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection.\n17. Has a known active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis) infection.\n18. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n19. Has known current psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n20. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n21. Concomitant medication(s) known to be (a) a strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4, or (b) QT prolonging as defined in the drug's approved label, with the exception of drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the care of the subject or if the Investigator believes that beginning therapy with such medication is vital to an individual subject's care while on study, and in either case, there is no alternative drug (if exceptions apply contact Syntrix medical monitor prior to enrollment).\n22. ECG demonstrating a QTc interval \\> 470 msec or patients with congenital long QT syndrome.\n23.
