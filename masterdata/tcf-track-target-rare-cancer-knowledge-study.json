The study leverages a remote consent and participation approach to open enrollment to all patients with rare tumors within the United States. Traditional, site-based patient consenting and participation is also available for enrollment to the study.\n\nEach participant will undergo comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) by Foundation Medicine Inc. (FMI) of their tumor as well as plasma circulating cell-free DNA. Plasma circulating cell-free DNA may be additionally collected for repeat CGP at various timepoints during the study.\n\nThe CGP findings will be provided by FMI directly to the treating physician and study sponsor TargetCancer Foundation (TCF), with TCF presenting cases with genomic findings to the Virtual Molecular Tumor Board (VMTB). The VMTB will analyze the findings and provide a written report to the treating physician on recommended treatments and/or relevant clinical trials; the treating physician makes all treatment decisions. The resultant treatments and treatment responses will be tracked longitudinally during the term of this study, thus linking molecularly informed treatments to specific patient outcomes."
