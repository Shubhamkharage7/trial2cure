Secondary objectives include further evaluating the impact of LF111 and DRSP 3.5 mg chewable tablets on BMD and bone turnover after 12 months (13 medication cycles) in comparison to non-hormonal contraceptive methods and assessing the general safety and tolerability of LF111 and DRSP 3.5 mg chewable tablets in comparison to non-hormonal contraceptive methods. Exploratory objectives include evaluating the impact of LF111 and DRSP 3.5 mg chewable tablets on body fat and lean mass after 12 months (13 medication cycles) of investigation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase IV, prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, non-randomized trial in female subjects between 14 to 45 years of age who are postmenarcheal for at least two years and premenopausal. Subjects who choose to take the trial medication (LF111 tablet or drospirenone \\[DRSP\\] 3.5 mg chewable tablet \\[USA only\\]) will be compared to subjects who choose to use non-hormonal contraceptive methods, enrolled in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will also be separated into two cohorts: cohort 1 as adolescents aged 14-17, and cohort 2 as adults aged 18-45.\n\nAt Visit 1 (screening), informed consent/assent will be obtained, and the screening procedures will be performed. At Visit 2 (allocation to treatment), after confirming the subject's eligibility, subjects who choose to use LF111 or DRSP 3.5 mg chewable tablets (USA only) for pregnancy prevention will be provided with LF111 or DRSP 3.5 mg chewable tablets. The subjects will attend additional on-site visits 6 months and 12 months after Visit 2 (end of investigational phase) or within one week after premature trial discontinuation for routine safety assessments.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of LF111 and DRSP 3.5 mg chewable tablets on bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine after 12 months (13 medication cycles) of investigation in comparison to non-hormonal contraceptive methods.

The TBLH Z-score applies only to Cohort 1 (adolescents) and the total body Z-score applies only to Cohort 2 (adults) when assessing study eligibility.\n* Low trauma fracture(s) defined as a fracture that results from a fall from a standing height or less, excluding fingers, toes, face, and skull.\n* Medical conditions associated with low bone mass:\n\n  * Metabolic bone disease such as osteogenesis imperfecta, Paget's disease of the bone, osteomalacia/rickets.\n  * Collagen vascular diseases such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n  * Chronic kidney disease stage 3 with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Bedside Schwartz equation for adolescents and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method for adult subjects.\n  * Gastrointestinal (malabsorptive) disease including inflammatory bowel disease, gastric bypass surgery and current post-gastrectomy syndrome.\n  * Liver disease.\n  * Abnormal bone mineral metabolism (hypocalcemia/hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia/hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia).\n* In adolescents only: Short stature defined as height-for-age percentile less than the fifth percentile.\n* Use of progestin-only contraceptive pills in the previous month or use of implantable hormonal contraceptives in the previous 6 months.\n* Laboratory values at screening which are considered clinically significant and which in the opinion of the investigator would be detrimental for participation in the study.\n* Ongoing pregnancy or wish for pregnancy.\n* Currently lactating or stopped lactating within the last 12 months.\n* Eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia).\n* Celiac disease.\n* Endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing's disease) not adequately controlled with a stable treatment regiment for \\> 2 months.\n* Rheumatoid arthritis.\n* Current or ever use of medications or supplements known to increase BMD including bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide, abaloparatide, romosozumab, calcitonin, fluoride and strontium.\n* Treatment with medications that are known to decrease bone mass:\n\n  * Glucocorticoids (oral, intravenous, chronic inhaled, chronic extensive topical \\[\\> 3 months\\]) within the previous 3 months. Note: Subjects taking chronic oral/intravenous glucocorticoids (prednisone \u2265 2.5 mg daily for \u2265 3 months, or the equivalent) will have a washout period of 12 months.\n  * Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate within the previous 24 months (if duration of use was less than 2 consecutive years).
