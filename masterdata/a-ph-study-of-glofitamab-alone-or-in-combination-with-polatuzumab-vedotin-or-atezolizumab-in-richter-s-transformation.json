            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, multicenter phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glofitamab as monotherapy and in combination with polatuzumab vedotin or atezolizumab for participants with Richter's Transformation (RT) that has transformed from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved glofitamab, obinutuzumab, polatuzumab vedotin, atezolizumab and tocilizumab for CLL with RT, but each drug has been approved for other uses.\n\nGlofitamab has been approved by the FDA for certain people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is similar to Richter's Transformation. Glofitamab has been studied as a single therapy and in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and atezolizumab in people with DLBCL.\n\nPolatuzumab vedotin is already an approved therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with chemoimmunotherapy.\n\nAtezolizumab is an approved therapy for other cancers.\n\nObinutuzumab is an approved therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nTocilizumab is approved for the treatment of an entity called cytokine release syndrome following another therapy called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy; it will be used to treat cytokine release syndrome if a participant develops it in this study.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility, clinic visits for study treatment, blood and urine tests, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Computed Topography (CT) scans, bone marrow biopsies, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for about 9 months and will be followed every 3-6 months for up to 10 years thereafter.\n\nIt is expected that about 66 people will take part in this research study.\n\nGenentech, Inc. is funding this research study by providing study drugs."
