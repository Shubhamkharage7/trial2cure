            "briefSummary": "Despite availability of evidence-based alcohol reduction interventions (EBI), unhealthy alcohol use remains a barrier to HIV medication adherence, viral suppression and retention in HIV care and consequently HIV treatment as prevention (TASP). Guided by complementary implementation and evaluation frameworks-the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance), The investigators will conduct a Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation evaluating implementation trial testing whether practice facilitation, an evidence-based multifaceted implementation strategy increases reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of stepped care for unhealthy alcohol use in three Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) HIV clinics located in Boston, San Diego, and Chapel Hill. The investigators will secondarily test whether practice facilitation is associated with decreased unhealthy alcohol use, and improved Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) adherence and viral suppression at the patient level. In practice facilitation, a practice coach will offer tools, resources, hands-on guidance, and content expertise to assist sites in offering a stepped care model of alcohol treatment to patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Stepped care will include brief intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy, and alcohol pharmacotherapy. The practice facilitation intervention will be rolled out sequentially across sites. There will be three phases at each site: pre-implementation planning, implementation with formative evaluation, and post-implementation summative evaluation. Using mixed methods, The investigators specifically propose to meet the following specific aims: (Aim 1) Tailor the practice facilitation intervention to each site using mixed methods (pre-implementation); (Aim 2a) Determine the effects of practice facilitation on implementation of stepped care (primary) and alcohol use and HIV-related outcomes (secondary) using interrupted time series analysis with synthetic controls (summative evaluation); (Aim 2b) Determine the effect of practice facilitation on reach, adoption, and maintenance of evidence-based alcohol treatment using mixed methods (formative evaluation); and (Aim 3) Describe barriers and facilitators to implementation of alcohol-related interventions at each site to describe maintenance and inform widespread sustainable implementation."
