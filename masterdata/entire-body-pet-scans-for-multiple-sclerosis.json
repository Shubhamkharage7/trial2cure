The pilot study will be conducted on 20 participants as a clinical research trial of PET amyloid and myelin imaging with the primary objective of identifying possible differences in F18-florbetapir radiotracer activity for MS patients compared to normal healthy subjects, and the secondary objective of monitoring psychological health of those participants who elect to be informed of imaging results and who complete a panel of psychometric scales before and after imaging results disclosure."
