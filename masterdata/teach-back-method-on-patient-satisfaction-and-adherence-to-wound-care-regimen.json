Investigators will ask the patient about their knowledge of wound care healing, provide the patient educational component, then ask the patient to repeat what was said. If the answer is wrong or incomplete, the researcher will go over the information again with the patient to clear up any misunderstandings.",

This study wishes to compare wound care adherence, patient experience, wound complications, and the number of phone calls made by patients to the office between the two cohorts\n\nprimary objective is to determine whether study participants who have received the teach-back method have an increase wound care adherence at one week post-operatively, compared to those who received the standard of care.\n\nTo characterize differences in the patient experience between the two interventional groups 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nTo determine whether the number of phone calls made post-operatively by patients will decrease in a 2 week follow-up time period.\n\nTo characterize the differences in patient wound care adherence at 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nTo determine whether there is a difference in complication incidence post-operatively"
