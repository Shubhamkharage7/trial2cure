The long-term goal of this project is to develop community-centered, culturally Appropriate, precision Interventions that can be delivered within Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) for Latino Families, to reduce Adverse Child Events (ACES) risks and treat childhood obesity. UCSD in conjunction with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) will conduct a 2x2 factorial trial with four groups meant to determine what combination of intervention components influence family protective factors (a key marker for reduced risk of the deleterious effects of systemic and family/individual stressors that are a critical part of ACEs) and childhood obesity."
