Participants may continue with their treatment if they have continuing benefit and if this is approved by their study doctor. Participants who are receiving TAK-500 either alone or with pembrolizumab will continue with their treatment until their disease progresses or until they or their study doctor decide they should stop this treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-500. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of TAK-500 when used as a single agent (SA) and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.\n\nThe study will be conducted in 2 phases: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Phase. The study will enroll approximately 313 participants (approximately 82 in the Dose Escalation Phase and approximately 231 in Dose Expansion Phase). The dose escalation phase will determine the recommended dose of TAK-500 along with the combination agents for the dose expansion phase. All the participants will be assigned to one of the 9 arms:\n\n* Dose Escalation: TAK-500 Single Agent (SA)\n* Dose Escalation: TAK-500 + Pembrolizumab\n* Dose Expansion: 2L NSCLC: TAK-500 recommended dose 1 for expansion (RDE 1) + Pembrolizumab\n* Dose Expansion: 2L NSCLC: TAK-500 recommended dose 2 for expansion (RDE 2) + Pembrolizumab\n* Dose Expansion: 3L NSCLC: TAK-500 (RDE 1) SA\n* Dose Expansion: 3L NSCLC: TAK-500 (RDE 2) SA\n* Dose Expansion: 2L Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: TAK-500 (RDE 1) + Pembrolizumab\n* Dose Expansion: 2L Pancreatic Adeno: TAK-500 (RDE 1) SA\n* Dose Expansion: 3L RCC: TAK-500 (RDE 1) + Pembrolizumab\n\nThis multi-center trial will be conducted globally. Participants with demonstrated clinical benefit may continue treatment beyond 1 year if approved by the sponsor."
