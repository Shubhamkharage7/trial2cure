            "detailedDescription": "A primary diverting stoma is widely used by surgeons in order to bypass low rectal anastomosis and reduce morbidity associated with anastomotic leaks. Typically, a stoma is created for all high-risk patients which mean that many patients are exposed to potentially serious complications associated with the stoma itself without any clinical benefit.\n\nCOLO BT\u2122 is a local, temporary bypass device that provides protection of the anastomosis and safely postpones stoma. COLO BT\u2122 is designed to avoid stoma creation in all patients except those patients whose anastomoses have not healed after surgery, allowing the others to return to normal activity more quickly and safely."
