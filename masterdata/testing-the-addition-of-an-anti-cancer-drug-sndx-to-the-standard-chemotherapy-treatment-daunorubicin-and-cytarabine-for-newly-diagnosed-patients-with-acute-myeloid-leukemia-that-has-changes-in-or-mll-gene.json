            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of SNDX-5613 when given in combination with the standard chemotherapy treatment (daunorubicin and cytarabine) in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia that has changes in the NPM1 gene or MLL/KMT2A gene. SNDX-5613 blocks signals passed from one molecule to another inside cancer cells that are needed for cancer cell survival. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Adding SNDX-5613 to the standard chemotherapy treatment may be able to shrink or stabilize the cancer for longer than the standard chemotherapy treatment alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and safety of revumenib (SNDX-5613) combined with 7 + 3 induction in newly diagnosed, untreated, NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD wild type and NPM1-mutated/FLT3-TKD wild type or MLL(KMT2A)-rearranged, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients \\>= 18-75 years old who are candidates for intensive induction therapy.\n\nII. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and safety of SNDX-5613 combined with one cycle of consolidation with high dose cytarabine in newly diagnosed AML patients in complete response/complete response with incomplete count recovery (CR/Cri) after intensive induction therapy with 7+3 for NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD wild type and NPM1-mutated/FLT3-TKD wild type or MLL (KMT2A)-rearranged AML patients \\>= 18-75 years old who are candidates for intensive therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of SNDX-5613 with this combination regimen and characterize clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with antifungal agents.\n\nII. To determine the number of patients with CR/CRi out of the total number of patients treated at each dose level of this regimen.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Explore potential biomarker indicators of response and resistance in AML samples.\n\nII. To determine the measurable residual disease negative (MRD) response (CR/Cri) and its relation to CR/Cri status out of the total number of patients treated at each dose level of this regimen.\n\nIII. Determine number of patients that undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) out of the total number of patients treated at each dose level of this regimen.\n\nIV. Assess changes in OATP1B and CYP3A plasma biomarkers during treatment with SNDX-5613 with or without antifungal agents.\n\nV. Determine duration of response.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of revumenib followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nINDUCTION: Patients receive revumenib orally (PO) every 12 hours (Q12h) on days 2-28, daunorubicin intravenously (IV) over 15 to 30 minutes on days 1-3, and cytarabine by continuous IV infusion (CIV) on days 1-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a response to Induction treatment continue to Consolidation treatment. Patients with persistent disease continue to Re-Induction treatment. Patients also undergo a transthoracic echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) during screening, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy during screening and at the end of Induction, and collection of blood during screening, on days 2, 3, 15, and at the end of Induction.\n\nRE-INDUCTION: Patients receive revumenib PO Q12h on days 2-28, daunorubicin IV over 15 to 30 minutes on days 1-2, and cytarabine CIV on days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a response to Re-Induction treatment continue to Consolidation. Patients also undergo a transthoracic ECHO or MUGA on day 1 and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at the end of Re-Induction.\n\nCONSOLIDATION: Patients receive revumenib PO Q12h on days 2-28 and cytarabine CIV on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at the end of Consolidation, and collection of blood on days 2, 3, 15, and at the end of Consolidation.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days or until death, whichever occurs first."

Male patients of childbearing potential having intercourse with females of childbearing potential must agree to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or have their partner use 2 forms of contraception from screening visit until 120 days until the last dose of study treatment. They must also refrain from sperm donation from screening visit until 120 days following the last dose of study treatment\n* Patients must have previously untreated AML with no prior treatment other than hydroxyurea. No chemotherapy for AML outside of hydroxyurea for treatment of leukostasis or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for initially suspected acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (that is ruled out) is allowed\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SNDX-5613 is a menin-KMT2A inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with SNDX-5613, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with SNDX-5613. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Isolated myeloid sarcoma (i.e., patients must have blood or marrow involvement with AML to enter the study)\n* Acute promyelocytic leukemia (French-American-British \\[FAB\\] M3)\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by AML\n* Uncontrolled symptomatic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with active bleeding or signs of thrombosis\n* Patients with Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) \\>= 450 ms at screening; patients with right, left, or partial bundle branch blocks or a pacemaker who are asymptomatic are eligible regardless of QTC if cleared by cardiology for enrollment in the trial. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic event such as congenital long QT syndrome or family history of long QT syndrome\n* Patients who will exceed a lifetime anthracycline exposure of \\> 550 mg/m\\^2 daunorubicin or equivalent (or \\> 400 mg/m\\^2 daunorubicin or equivalent in the event of prior mediastinal radiation) if they receive the maximum potential exposure to anthracyclines per protocol (including both induction and reinduction cycles)\n* Patients with any gastrointestinal issue of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract that might affect oral drug absorption or ingestion (eg, gastric bypass, gastroparesis, etc)\n* Patients who have cirrhosis with a Child-Pugh score of B or C\n* Patients with Down Syndrome due to higher rates of chemotherapy-associated toxicities, and may have different pharmacokinetics, as well.
