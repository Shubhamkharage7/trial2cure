Study Phase I will test the feasibility and acceptability of a study evaluating a psychoeducational intervention relative to a control condition for improving self-efficacy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who are initiating multimodality treatment. It is expected that this phase will enroll 20 participants. Study Phase II will test the efficacy of the psychoeducational intervention after it has been refined using findings from Study Phase I. It is expected this phase will enroll 100 participants.\n\nIn this study, participants will complete survey questions and will be randomly assigned to either receive the intervention (consisting of 4 coaching sessions with a study clinician, a comprehensive patient education guidebook, and a coaching session workbook) or enhanced usual care (consisting of an information resource guide for navigating information online).\n\nIt is expected that about 120 people will take part in this research study."
