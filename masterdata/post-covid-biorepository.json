            "detailedDescription": "Living patients or their healthcare surrogates will provide informed consent prior to participation in the biorepository. Surrogate decision makers who cannot consent in person will be consented in accordance to the KUMC remote consent guidelines. Biospecimens to be collected include serum, plasma and whole blood. Blood samples will be collected during face-to-face encounters in the Post-COVID-19 clinic within the TUKHS pulmonary clinic or will be coordinated with other outpatient follow-up appointments (including separate procedure/lab-related visits) or separate study visits for ongoing, indepent studies. Samples will be collected at time of consent as well as at potential follow-up visits at approximately 3, 6, 12, and 12 months from enrollment. Blood samples will be processed, aliquoted, and stored at -80\u00b0C. A portion of the blood samples will be kept for DNA and RNA isolation, and a portion of plasma collected might be utilized to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Biospecimens will be labeled with the patient's study ID number, date of sample processing, and specimen type. Biospecimens will be stored through the duration of the study. If the patient chooses to withdraw consent, his or her samples in the biorepository will be destroyed. Biospecimens that have been previously used or disseminated will continue to be utilized. Future research may include whole genome testing, and these results will not be shared with the patient or their standard of care physician.\n\nPatient data and historical radiographic imaging from after the date of consent will be collected using TUKHS medical records and stored in RedCap. The data to be collected is outlined in the data collection sheets."
