            "detailedDescription": "This study will test whether BGB-11417 (sonrotoclax) can be used to improve outcomes in participants with Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia (WM) both when used alone in those who have not responded well to conventional treatments and when used in combination with zanubrutinib in those who have not yet received treatment. The main goals of the study are to determine how many participants may no longer have evidence of cancer or have some improvement in the signs and symptoms of cancer after treatment, and to determine what adverse events, or side effects, participants might experience.\n\nBCL2 is a key protein involved in cell death, and abnormal levels of BCL2 are associated with many cancers. Blocking the action of BCL2 proteins is a promising approach with potential therapeutic benefits in participants with different types of cancers, including WM. This study will enroll approximately 105 participants. All participants will receive sonrotoclax orally as a tablet.\n\nThe study will take place at multiple centers worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 5 years. Treatments will continue until participants experience worsening disease status, too many side effects, or withdraw consent."
