            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the TruSignal sensor LED platform SpO2 sensor accuracy study with human volunteer participants is to collect SpO2 data from P-SA01PL and P-SP01PL prototype sensors and reference data to develop a calibration model for new TruSignal LED platform at different pigmentation values according to the Monk Skin Scale.",
            "detailedDescription": "The rapid measure of oxygen saturation level using the pulse oximeter is an important vital sign, which is one of the most used monitoring devices in clinics. Blood oxygen levels are indicated as SpO2, showing the percent saturation of oxygen, and it becomes a non-invasive continuous oxygen monitoring for different ages.\n\nGE Healthcare (GEHC) pulse oximetry is a transmissive pulse oximetry where the sensor is placed on a thin part of the patients body, usually a fingertip, where the probe passes two wavelengths of light through the body part to a photodetector. These two wavelengths of light are generated with carefully selected LEDs to maintain clinical accuracy constantly. The principle of pulse oximetry is based on the variation in the ratio of light absorbances. Pulse oximetry technology enables SpO2 with enhanced accuracy, durability, and infection control with single-patient use.\n\nGEs current LED selection is based on early 1990s clinical studies and investigations and it has not been re-assessed ever since due to large dependence with various SpO2 monitoring systems, which requires separate validation in the clinics. In order to reduce component cost profiles and component availability risks, this study aims to select new LEDs for the next generation GE SpO2 probes and sensors. We aim to introduce and develop new SpO2 platforms to improve efficiency of modern LEDs.\n\nThe effect of skin pigmentation may affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry measurement. To respond to the recent concern related to effect of skin pigmentation in SpO2 accuracy (and expected changes in SpO2 standard and FDA Pulse Oximetry Guidance), the development data is collected with equal number of participants from light, medium, and darkly pigmented participant subgroups.\n\nHere we will collect SpO2 data with simultaneous transfer standard SpO2 to develop a calibration model for the new LED platform. Transfer standard is a validated pulse oximetry equipment with a calibration directly traceable to CO-oximetry. Test method and protocol is developed according to ISO 80601-2-61:2017 annex EE.3 (PROCEDURE for non-invasive laboratory testing on healthy adult volunteers).\n\nFunding for this study will be provided by GE HealthCare (GEHC). The purpose of the TruSignal sensor LED platform SpO2 sensor accuracy study with human volunteer participants is to collect SpO2 data from P-SA01PL and P-SP01PL prototype sensors and reference data to develop a calibration model for new TruSignal LED platform at different pigmentation values according to the Monk Skin Scale."
