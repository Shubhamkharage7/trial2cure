            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial comparing mitral valve (MV) transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) to surgical repair (1:1 ratio) in patients with primary, degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR). The trial will be conducted in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, and is designed as a strategy trial. Thus, all devices legally marketed for TEER of primary degenerative MR in a particular country are eligible to be used in this trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of MV TEER compared with surgical repair in patients with primary, degenerative MR. The secondary aim is to analyze the relationship between the adequacy of MR correction at one-year post intervention and longer-term clinical outcomes (death, heart failure hospitalizations/urgent care visits, valve re-interventions, and quality of life). The tertiary aim of this trial is to evaluate a range of patient-centered outcomes (quality of life, functional status, and discharge location) of transcatheter edge-to-edge MV repair compared with MV surgical repair in patients with primary, degenerative mitral regurgitation.\n\nThe patient population for this trial consists of adult patients with severe, primary degenerative MR for whom the local heart team has verified that an indication for MV intervention is present and for whom both transcatheter edge-to-edge and surgical repair strategies are anatomically feasible.\n\nBecause the use of the commercial edge-to-edge mitral repair device in the U.S. is approved only in patients considered to be at prohibitive risk of MV surgery by a heart team, use of such devices in this trial is considered investigational by the FDA. As such, this trial will be conducted under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE ).\n\nOutcomes will be measured from randomization over a period of 5 years post intervention. The estimated enrollment period is 36 months, and all patients will be followed from randomization for up to 10 years post intervention for particular endpoints. Long-term follow-up will include leveraging administrative datasets linked to clinical trial data."

The EQ-5D descriptive system is a preference-based HRQL measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ- 5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).",

All patients who meet eligibility criteria will be included in the study regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients \u226565 yrs with moderately-severe or severe (3+ or 4+/4+) primary degenerative (Carpentier type II) MR defined by transthoracic echocardiography\n* Clinical indication for MV intervention and anatomic candidate for both MV transcatheter edge-to-edge and surgical repair per local heart team assessment\n* Patients across the surgical risk spectrum (low, intermediate, and high risk) depending on the local heart team assessment (see 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease)\n* Patients with AF who meet an indication for concomitant ablation may be included provided the local heart team verifies they are eligible for both catheter-based and surgical ablation.\n* Ability to perform 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and complete Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) instrument\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Non-degenerative types of primary MR (e.g., cleft leaflet)\n* Secondary or functional MR\n* Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy\n* Presence of an IVC filter or pacing/ICD leads that would interfere with TEER per local heart team assessment\n* Known allergic reactions to intravenous contrast\n* Febrile illness within 30-days prior to randomization\n* Any absolute contraindication to transesophageal echocardiography\n* Any contraindication to systemic heparinization including active bleeding diatheses, and heparin induced thrombocytopenia\n* Patients with CAD requiring revascularization\n* Any prior mitral valve intervention or any prior repair of atrial septal defect\n* Any prior MV intervention or any prior repair of atrial septal defect\n* Need for any of the following concomitant procedures: aortic valve or aortic surgery, tricuspid valve surgery\n* Need for any emergency intervention or surgery\n* Active endocarditis\n* Hemodynamic instability defined as cardiac index \\<2.0 l/min/m2 or systolic blood pressure \\<90mmHg or need for inotropic support or any mechanical circulatory support\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction \\<25%\n* Intracardiac mass or thrombus\n* Co-morbid medical or oncologic condition for which local heart team believes that meaningful survival beyond 2 years is unlikely\n* Active substance abuse\n* Suspected inability to adhere to follow-up\n* Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention, assessment of which has not completed its primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the present study endpoints.",
