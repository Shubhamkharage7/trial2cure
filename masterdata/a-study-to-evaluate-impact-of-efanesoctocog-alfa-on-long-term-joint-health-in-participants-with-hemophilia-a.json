Decision to initiate treatment with commercially available efanesoctocog alfa will be made by the treating physician independently from the decision to include patients in the study. No study medication is provided. The data related to efanesoctocog alfa effectiveness, safety and usage will be collected prospectively during routine visits (expected annual/semi-annual visits) for up to 5 years following enrollment /treatment initiation."
