Subjects with a marrow CR (See the protocol) after Cycle 2 will continue Tagraxofusp for Cycles 3 to 12 (up to 1 year of treatment) at 12 mcg/kg IV for 5 consecutive days every 28 days. In subjects without a marrow CR after 2 cycles of treatment, azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SQ or IV will be added on Days 1-7 every 28 days for up to 4 additional cycles of treatment.\n\nA treatment cycle is 28 days for Cycle 3 to Cycle 12. Subjects who achieve a marrow CR receiving tagraxofusp only after Cycle 4, will continue tagraxofusp at 12 mcg/kg IV for 5 consecutive days every 28 days until Cycle 12. Subjects who continue to achieve an overall response (CR, CRi, PR, MLFS, marrow CR) receiving tagraxofusp and azacitidine will continue tagraxofusp at 12 mcg/kg IV for 3 consecutive days and azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SQ or IV on Days 1-7 every 28 days until Cycle 12. Please see the protocol. Patients without an overall response to tagraxofusp + azacitidine after completion of 4 cycles of this combination will be discontinued from study treatment."

Cytoreduction with hydroxyurea, leukapheresis and/or cyclophosphamide is allowed prior to treatment. Hydroxyurea must be discontinued \u2265 12 hours prior to treatment initiation. Cyclophosphamide must be discontinued \u2265 5 days prior to treatment initiation.\n* Age \u2265 18 years at the time of consent.\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0-2.\n* Demonstrate adequate organ function within 28 days prior to registration.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 45%.\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration.

Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, the HCV viral load must be undetectable to be eligible for this trial.\n* Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information.\n* As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:\n\n* Subjects who are suitable for and are willing to receive intensive chemotherapy.\n* Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.\n* Known CNS involvement with AML. NOTE: Subjects with clinical suspicion or signs of neurologic deficit should undergo a screening lumbar puncture prior to enrollment to confirm lack of CNS leukemia.\n* Subject has previously received tagraxofusp.\n* Treatment with chemotherapy, wide-field radiation, or biologic therapy within 14 days of study entry. NOTE: hydroxyurea, leukapheresis and/or cyclophosphamide are allowed prior to study entry per the protocol.\n* Treatment with investigational drug within 14 days of study entry.\n* Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant within 60 days.\n* Receiving immunosuppression therapy, with the exception of prednisone \u2264 10mg/d, for the treatment or prophylaxis of GVHD. If the patient has been on immunosuppressant treatment or prophylaxis for GVHD, the treatment must have been discontinued at least 14 days prior to study treatment and there must be no evidence of Grade \u2265 2 GVHD.\n* History of other malignancies (excluding MDS, CMML, MDS/MPN, MPN's) within 2 years prior to study entry, with the exception of: adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, breast, prostate; basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; previous malignancy confined and surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative intent. Subjects receiving maintenance or adjuvant therapy for organ-confined malignancy such as breast or prostate cancer are eligible. Maintenance and/or adjuvant chemotherapy must be discontinued \\>72 hours prior to treatment initiation. Those with substantial potential for recurrence and/or ongoing active malignancy must be discussed with the sponsor-investigator before study entry.\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease including:\n\n  * Uncontrolled CHF\n  * Cardiac insufficiency Grade III or IV per New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification\n  * Uncontrolled angina/hypertension/arrhythmia\n  * Clinically significant abnormalities on a 12-lead electrocardiogram\n  * History of myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months of study entry\n* Uncontrolled significant pulmonary disease (e.g., COPD, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications during the study.\n* Active uncontrolled or severe systemic infection. Enrollment is possible after control of infection, at discretion of the treating physician.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study).\n* Other severe medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgement of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.
