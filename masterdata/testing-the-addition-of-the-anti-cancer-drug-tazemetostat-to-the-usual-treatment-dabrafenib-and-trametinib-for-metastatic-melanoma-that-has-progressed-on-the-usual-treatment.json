            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II trial investigates the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of tazemetostat in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with melanoma that has a specific mutation in the BRAF gene (BRAFV600) and that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Tazemetostat, dabrafenib, and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving tazemetostat in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib may stabilize BRAFV600 mutated melanoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To identify a maximum tolerated dose for the EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat hydrobromide (tazemetostat), when used in combination with dual BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib mesylate \\[dabrafenib\\]) and MEK inhibitor (trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide \\[trametinib\\]) therapy in BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant, BRAF\\^V600-mutated metastatic melanoma. (Phase 1) II. To determine if the addition of the EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat, to BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy improves progression-free survival over single-agent EZH2 inhibitor therapy in patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant, BRAF\\^V600-mutated melanomas harboring an EZH2 alteration. (Phase 2)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase 1) II. To determine the overall response rate of single-agent EZH2 inhibitor therapy (tazemetostat) and triplet EZH2 inhibitor (tazemetostat), BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitor (trametinib) therapy in patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant BRAF\\^V600-mutated melanomas harboring an EZH2 alteration. (Phase 2)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To explore alterations in the gene expression profile (ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\]-sequencing), H3K27 methylome (immunohistochemistry \\[IHC\\], chromatin immunoprecipitation \\[ChIP\\]-Sequencing), and open chromatin landscape (assay for transposase accessible chromatin \\[ATAC\\]-sequencing) with EZH2 inhibition in fresh clinical or patient derived xenograft (PDX)-derived tumor samples, which may reveal underlying transcriptional/epigenetic pathways mediating response to treatment.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation trial of tazemetostat followed by a phase II trial. Patients in the phase I trial receive treatment as in Arm II. Patients in the phase II trial are randomized to Arm I or Arm II.\n\nARM I: Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy, computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the study. At the time of progression, patients may crossover to Arm II after completion of radiation therapy.\n\nARM II: Patients receive tazemetostat PO BID, dabrafenib PO BID, and trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy, CT scan, MRI, multigated acquistion scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then annually thereafter."
