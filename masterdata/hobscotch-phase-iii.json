            "detailedDescription": "HOBSCOTCH (Home Based Self-management and Cognitive Training Changes lives) is a home-based self-management program to treat cognitive symptoms and improve quality of life, while minimizing the barriers of access to care. The program is based on Problem Solving Therapy (PST) and teaches problem solving strategies and compensatory mechanisms to help manage cognitive dysfunction and enhance quality of life.\n\nHOBSCOTCH Phase III is a study to examine an entirely virtual version of the program. While HOBSCOTCH was shown to be effective as an in-person and telephone-based program in previous trials (HOBSCOTCH Phase I and II), this study aims to test a version of the program adapted for entirely virtual delivery. This is a single-center study, with the HOBSCOTCH intervention being delivered by staff affiliated with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, NH."
