However, DBS programming is not standardized and multiple clinic visits are frequently required to adequately control symptoms. The investigators aim to longitudinally record brain signals from patients using a novel neurostimulator that can record brain signals. The investigators will correlate brain signals to clinical severity scores to identify pathological rhythms in the absence of DBS, and we will study the effects of DBS on these signals in order to guide clinical programming.",
            "detailedDescription": "The development of newer technologies has allowed clinicians and researchers to better understand pathophysiological underpinnings of different disorders managed with neuromodulation. The is now the ability to stream brain signals from a newly FDA approved device, the Medtronic Percept. The investigators will study the longitudinal effects of DBS on the brain signals that are found to correlate with tremor severity as measured with wireless wearable sensors."
