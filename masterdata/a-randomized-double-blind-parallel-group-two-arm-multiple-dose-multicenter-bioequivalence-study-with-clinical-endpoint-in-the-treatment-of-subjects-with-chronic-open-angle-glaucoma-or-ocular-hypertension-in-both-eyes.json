They will undergo a washout period of 4 days to 4 weeks (28 days) based on their current medication (if available). Based on stratification criteria, IOP and CCT information available at baseline visit for each subject, the subjects will be randomized in such way that ratio of treatment distribution will be nearer to 1:1 between the treatment arms, and within the combined stratification criteria. The Primary Endpoint is mean difference in the IOP of both eyes between the two treatment groups at 3 time points, i.e., at 00.00 hour, 04.00 hours (4 hours \u00b11 hour after 00.00 hour), and 08.00 hours (8 hours \u00b11 hour after 00.00 hour) at Day 14 (Week 2) (\u00b1 4 days) and Day 42 (Week 6) (\u00b1 4 days) visits.\n\nThe Secondary Endpoint: the incidence of all adverse events reported during the study will be summarized by treatment group. Test and reference products will be compared for safety by analyzing nature, severity and frequency of treatment emergent adverse events."

Underwent within 6 months prior to baseline any other intraocular surgery (e.g., cataract surgery).\n16. Underwent within 12 months prior to baseline any refractive surgery, filtering surgery, or laser surgery for IOP reduction (e.g., laser trabeculoplasty).\n17. Amblyopia - only one sighted eye.\n18. Subjects with a history of IOP previously uncontrolled on bimatoprost monotherapy.\n19. Significant ocular surface findings (e.g., hyperemia or irritation, mild or greater) in either eye found on gross macroscopic or slit lamp examination.\n20. Severe retinal disease or other severe ocular pathology, such as glaucomatous damage with a cup/disk ratio greater than 0.8 (not including physiological cupping in the Investigators' opinion) or split fixation.\n21. Chronic use of any systemic medication that may affect IOP with less than 3 months stable dosing regimen (i.e., sympathomimetic agents, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, alpha-agonists, alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, etc.)\n22. Central Corneal thickness (CCT) \\<450 microns or \\>650 microns.\n23. Known history or presence of any uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatic impairment, etc.)\n24. History of recurrent ocular seasonal allergies within the past 2 years.\n25. Any other medical condition or serious intercurrent illness that, in the Investigator's opinion, may make it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study and would limit adherence to the study requirements.\n26. Participation in any clinical study within 30 days before the first dose of the study drug.\n27. Subjects with known history of positive serology for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.\n28.
