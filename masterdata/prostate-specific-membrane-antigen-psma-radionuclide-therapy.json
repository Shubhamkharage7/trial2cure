During these visits, participants will also be asked to report any change in their medications. Participants will not need to visit the study doctor more often than their usual treatment unless they have other medical needs. However, if participants experience any significant change in their medical condition they may be asked to have additional tests such as computed tomography (CT) scans, blood tests, etc."
