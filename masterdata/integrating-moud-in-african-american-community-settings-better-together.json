            "briefSummary": "A multisite effectiveness-implementation study will be conducted in three sites to evaluate interventions to improve engagement and retention in MOUD with buprenorphine treatment of Black persons with OUD. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with the Better Together Integrated Collaborative Community MOUD care model (BT-MOUD) will result in better retention in treatment than standard-of-care MOUD with buprenorphine provided in the hub buprenorphine clinic only (HC-MOUD Only) through 24 weeks following randomization. BT-MOUD provides MOUD with buprenorphine in nonmedical community-based settings via telemedicine from a hub buprenorphine clinic combined with Recovery Guiding, a manual guided coaching developed for this approach, provided onsite in the community organization.",
            "detailedDescription": "This multi-site hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study conducted in Washington, District of Columbia (DC), Chicago, and Miami-Dade County will evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of providing MOUD with buprenorphine onsite (via telemedicine from a hub buprenorphine clinic) combined with Recovery Guiding in nonmedical community-based settings (the Better Together Integrated Collaborative Community MOUD care model - BT-MOUD) compared to standard-of-care MOUD with buprenorphine provided in the hub buprenorphine clinic only (HC-MOUD Only) and 2) BT-MOUD implementation barriers and facilitators. In the BT-MOUD intervention, community sites serve as \"spokes\" for telemedicine provision of MOUD by buprenorphine providers based in a \"hub\" buprenorphine clinic. A trained and supervised Recovery Guide with roots or connections with the community provides manual-guided Recovery Guiding on-site in the community site. Recovery Guiding includes psychoeducation (about OUD and effective buprenorphine MOUD) and behavioral counseling to promote engagement in MOUD with buprenorphine, retention in care, medication adherence, and behavioral change supportive of recovery. In HC-MOUD Only, participants will receive MOUD with buprenorphine and other available services in the hub buprenorphine clinic only. A Peer Outreach Specialist (POS) will assist with outreach and recruitment of all participants across conditions and with maintaining high rates of follow-up in research assessments. This study will test the hypothesis that BT-MOUD is more effective than HC-MOUD Only in retaining Black persons with OUD in MOUD with buprenorphine through six months post-randomization."
