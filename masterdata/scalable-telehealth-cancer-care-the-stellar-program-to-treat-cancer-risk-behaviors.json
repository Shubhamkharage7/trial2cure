We will look at the number, proportion, and representativeness of participants in terms of disease characteristics, socioeconomic status, telehealth readiness, and race/ethnicity.\n* Evaluate the effects of the STELLAR program relative to enhanced usual care (information provision) on cancer risk behaviors, patient care access, care quality, and communication.\n\nParticipants will be provided goals related to their physical activity, smoking, and/or weight loss and asked to track their health behaviors via an app, excel file, or on paper. At baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months into the study, participants will provide survey responses and physical measurements like height and weight. Additionally, those in the STELLAR group will complete 16 telehealth sessions with study staff to discuss progress towards their study goals.\n\nResearchers will compare the STELLAR intervention group to the Enhanced Usual Care group to see if the STELLAR intervention group is able to reach more participants that Enhances Care only.",
