            "briefSummary": "This research study is investigating whether completing breathing exercises before surgery helps heart transplant patients recover after surgery. Previous studies have shown that breathing exercises can improve breathing, cough, and swallow function in patients with other diseases/conditions. The current study will investigate the impact of a preoperative respiratory muscle strength training program on breathing and cough function, swallow function, patient-reported eating and swallowing fatigue, and health outcomes in individuals undergoing heart transplantation.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* undergo tests of breathing, cough, and swallow function\n* complete questionnaires about the treatment, their swallow function\n* complete breathing exercises daily",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will involve three in-person research evaluations (two to our lab, one in the hospital) that will last 45 minutes- 1 hour and will consist of a screening, breathing and cough testing, swallow function testing, and completion of questionnaires. Following the initial research evaluation, individuals will complete daily exercises of active or sham respiratory muscle strength training for several weeks with one telehealth or in-person session per week. The exercises will take 10-15 minutes to complete, and individuals will fill out training logs daily. Prior to transplantation and after completion of the breathing exercises, individuals will undergo a second research evaluation. Then, following surgery, individuals will undergo a third research evaluation and outcomes will be tracked via the electronic health records system."
