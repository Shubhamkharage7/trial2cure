            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot study, which will include approximately five eyes of 5 patients. This study proposes that a sustained release steroid insert (Yutiq)1 be implanted along with a glaucoma drainage device (Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) Model FP7) when the patient is undergoing glaucoma tube implant surgery or combined glaucoma tube implant and cataract surgery. The primary aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy (controlling intraocular pressure) of the Yutiq inserts to reduce post-operative scarring in surgical glaucoma patients. It is expected that post-operative week 12 onwards there will be a clinically and statistically significant lower IOP in the study eyes than eyes in a group undergoing the same surgery without the Yutiq insert. The estimated duration of the present study is 3 years."

Pregnant or lactating females or females of child bearing age who are not willing to use contraception for the duration of the study.\n11. Patients for whom any of the protocol procedures may pose a special risk not outweighed by the potential benefits of participating in the study.\n12. Patients who are unlikely to comply with the study protocol.\n13. Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that could increase the risk associated with study participation or could interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, could make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n14. Treatment with an investigational drug or device within 30 days preceding the glaucoma surgery.\n15. Any eye needing urgent glaucoma surgery i.e. within 5 days of the baseline visit (to allow time for patients to review the study documents).",
