            "detailedDescription": "This is a study of SON-1010, a single-chain human Interleukin-12 (IL12) cytokine linked to a single-chain variable region (scFv) antibody fragment, known as the fully human albumin binding domain (FHAB). The albumin binding domain moiety of SON-1010 attaches to albumin in the bloodstream, resulting in significantly enhanced drug PK properties, potentially lower risk than IL12 alone, and a broader therapeutic index. The study is designed to safely and rapidly establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with up to 5 dose-escalation groups and to expand the dataset at the recommended RP2D."

Confirmation of Gilberts diagnosis requires: elevated unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin values; normal complete blood count (in previous 12 months), blood smear and reticulocyte count; normal transaminases and alkaline phosphatase in previous 12 months.\n   4. Chemistry: albumin \u22653.0 g/dL at screening\n9.

Females who are not of childbearing potential (have had a tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, or are \u22651 year postmenopause) or have a partner who has had a vasectomy do not need to use any contraception.\n\n   Nonchildbearing potential is defined as surgically sterile or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea). A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level \\>40 IU/L at screening will confirm postmenopausal status. If a patient is not sexually active, but becomes active, then she and her male partner must use 2 methods of adequate contraception.\n10. Males and their female partners must use a highly effective method of birth control if female partner(s) is of childbearing potential and must not donate sperm during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study intervention.\n11. Willing and able to provide signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol.\n12.

History of any active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals within 14 days before the first dose of study intervention, including COVID-19 as determined by the currently recommended testing strategy for acute infection.\n8. Any acute noninfectious illness not resolved by14 days before day 1.\n9. History of or known or suspected autoimmune disease (exception(s): patients with vitiligo, Type I diabetes, resolved childhood atopic dermatitis, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism that is clinically euthyroid at Screening are allowed). Other exceptions may be allowed following discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor for patients who have not received treatment for their autoimmune disorder in the past 3 years.\n10. Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks before study entry and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases.\n11. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as not resolved to baseline or to grade 1 by the CTCAE V 5.0 criteria (NCI 2017) except for alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and hypothyroidism secondary to prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy if currently being treated and clinically euthyroid.\n12.

Limited doses of systemic steroids (eg, in patients with exacerbation of reactive airway disease) must have been completed at least 10 days before enrollment. Steroid use to prevent IV contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies is allowed at any time before enrollment.\n15. Active known second malignancy except any of the following:\n\n    * Adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or Stage 0 carcinoma in situ\n    * Adequately treated Stage I cancer from which the patient is currently in remission and has been in remission for \u22652 years\n    * Low-risk prostate cancer with Gleason score \\<7 and prostate-specific antigen \\<10 ng/mL\n    * Any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for \u22652 years\n16.
