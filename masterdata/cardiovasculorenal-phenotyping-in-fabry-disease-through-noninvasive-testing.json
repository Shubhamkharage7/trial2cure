            "briefSummary": "A longitudinal pilot study will be conducted to determine if there are additional testing modalities that are effective in broadly phenotyping subclinical dysfunction in patients with Fabry disease. Individual patients will undergo serial testing over a two-year period to evaluate for changes in their cardiovasculaorenal function during this period. Novel modalities evaluated will include measures of arterial stiffness, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), and novel serum and urine biomarkers. The benefit of these measures being evaluated is that they are noninvasive, can be performed rapidly, and have reduced costs compared to the current standard screening modalities. Results from these evaluations will be compared to cMRI and standard urine and serum biomarkers performed clinically per local standard of care. The results will also be compared to both published normative data and data from patients with diabetes mellitus, who have a similar microvascular disease process to patients with Fabry disease."
