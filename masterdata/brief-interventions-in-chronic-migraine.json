This trial is being completed to study whether changing an individual's behaviors may have an impact as a treatment for migraine headaches.\n\nEligible participants will be randomized to one of the four arms. This study will be conducted remotely without in-person contact.\n\nStudy Hypothesis:\n\n* There is a main effect of attending either the Empowered Relief and Health Education intervention on reductions in migraine-related disability 1 month after completing either intervention\n* There is a main effect of Empowered Relief and Health Education interventions on reducing pain-related catastrophizing and migraine symptom severity 1 month after completing either intervention (secondary hypothesis)\n* The expected reductions in migraine-related disability, pain catastrophizing, and migraine symptom severity will be maintained at secondary time points (2 months, 3 months, and 6 months after completing either intervention) (secondary hypothesis)"

Such a data-use agreement will be executed through the PI and ICPSR through the University of Michigan."
