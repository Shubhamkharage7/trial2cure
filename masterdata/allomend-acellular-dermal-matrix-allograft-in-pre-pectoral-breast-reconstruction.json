It is made from donated human full-thickness skin. After the epidermal and hypodermal layers are removed, the tissue is treated by a proprietary cleansing process.\n\nAlloMend\u00ae is intended to be used in conjunction with a breast implant or tissue expander to stabilize implant position and minimize implant loss during post-single or double mastectomy, unilateral or bilateral pre-pectoral breast reconstruction in women 18 years of age or older. AlloMend\u00ae may be used in either one-stage (direct-to-implant) or two-stage (expander-to-implant) procedures."
