The 4+2 algorithm-based dose-escalation design will be used to help identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Single agent LYT-200 and in combination with venetoclax and/or hypomethylating agents (HMA) safety and tolerability evaluation is the primary study endpoint, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Anti-tumor Activity of LYT- 200 single agent and in combination with venetoclax and/or HMAs are key secondary study endpoints."
