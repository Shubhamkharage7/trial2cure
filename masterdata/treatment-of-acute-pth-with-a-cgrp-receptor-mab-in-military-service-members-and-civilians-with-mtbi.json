This study is designed to assess a calcitonin gene-related peptide (cGRP) monoclonal antibody (erenumab) for the preventive treatment of PTH based on the rationale that headache posttrauma is similar to migraine and is mediated by the activation of the trigeminal vascular system and subsequent release of cGRP. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of erenumab 140 mg for the treatment of PTH in military service members and civilians with mTBI at military treatment facilities across the United States."
