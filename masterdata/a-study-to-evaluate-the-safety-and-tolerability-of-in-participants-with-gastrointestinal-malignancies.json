In this dose escalation combination study, participants with advanced pancreatic cancer will receive escalating doses of AB680 in combination with Zimberelimab at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses. AB680, Zimberelimab, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine are all administered via IV infusion.\n\nIn the dose expansion portion of the study in front-line (1L) pancreatic patients, participants will receive AB680 at the RP2D determined from the dose escalation study in combination with Zimberelimab at the RP2D and nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses or AB680 at the RP2D in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses. In the dose-expansion portion of the study in second-line (2L) pancreatic patients, participants will receive AB680 at the RP2D determined from the dose-escalation study in combination with Zimberelimab at the RP2D and nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses."

Prior adjuvant therapy may include Nab- paclitaxel or gemcitabine\n  * Participants initially diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who have undergone chemotherapy then resection and had no evidence of disease are eligible if relapse of metastatic disease has occurred and if the last dose of chemotherapy was received more than 6 months before study entry\n* Must have at least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The measurable lesion must be outside of a radiation field if the participant received prior radiation\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1\n* Confirmation that an archival tissue sample is available; if not, a new biopsy of a tumor must be obtained\n* Prior radiation therapy for metastatic disease must have been completed\n* Immunosuppressive doses of systemic medications, such as corticosteroids or absorbed topical corticosteroids (doses \\> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 2 weeks (14 days) before investigational product administration. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids (\u2264 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent) or short pulses of corticosteroids (\u2264 3 days) may be permitted\n* Prior surgery that required general anesthesia or other major surgery as defined by the Investigator must be completed at least 4 weeks before investigational product administration\n* Negative tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody (or hepatitis C qualitative ribonucleic acid \\[RNA; qualitative\\]), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 antibody at screening\n* Adequate organ and marrow function\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Significant cardiovascular disease (NYHA Class III-IV), myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 12 months of the first dose of investigational agent or history of arterial thromboembolic event, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable arrhythmia, or unstable angina within 3 months or venous thromboses within 1 month of the first dose of investigational agent.\n* Any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or history of a syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this study\n* History of a syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this study\n* Prior malignancy active within the previous year except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or prostate cancer\n* Has not recovered (ie, \u2264 Grade 1 or baseline) from a non-hematologic AEs due to a previously administered agent, except \u2264 Grade 2 alopecia or \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
