Randomization means a participant is placed into a group by chance. Participants will have an equal chance of being placed in either group.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility and questionnaires.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last about 10 weeks.\n\nIt is expected that about 80 people will participate in this randomized clinical trial."
