Secondary objectives include pre/post, and longitudinal measurement of distress in intervention participants and a paired family member who is in an observational arm.",

Following preparatory sessions in outpatient palliative care clinic or by telehealth (2-4 sessions lasting 60-90 minutes each), psilocybin will be administered as a 25mg capsule during an 8-hour monitored session. Integration sessions (2-3 sessions lasting up to 90 minutes each) will take place in the outpatient palliative care clinic or by phone or tele-heath. Primary and secondary objectives are complete at one-week post treatment, longitudinal exploratory measures collected up to 12 months post baseline.\n\nParallel assessment of health care utilization, including choices regarding anti-cancer treatment and resource utilization, and family member distress, family communication, well-being and bereavement will be conducted at concurrent time points."
