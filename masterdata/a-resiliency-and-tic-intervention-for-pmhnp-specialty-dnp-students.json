Specifically, the investigators will examine if the educational intervention is feasible, acceptable and helpful to students, and can decrease burnout and increase resiliency.",
            "detailedDescription": "Students in the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and certificate programs during their final, clinical year of the program will be asked to complete anonymous online surveys before each semester (Spring, Summer, and Fall) that measure levels of burnout, resiliency, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), perceived stress, and knowledge related to trauma-informed care principles and ways to promote their resiliency. Students in the Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) specialty will receive an educational intervention related to trauma-informed care and resiliency during an in-person clinical immersion in January, May, and August 2023; after each session, they will be asked to complete an anonymous online post-intervention survey. Each survey includes a disclosure statement and list of University and national mental health resources in case participants experience any emotional distress related to the topics/questions related to the survey."
