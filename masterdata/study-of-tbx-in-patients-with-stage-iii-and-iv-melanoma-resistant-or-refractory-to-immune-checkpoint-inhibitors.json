Each dose cohort will initially enroll 3 patients. Enrollment and treatment of the first 3 patients in the first cohort will be staggered to allow for evaluation of safety. After each cohort has been enrolled and all patients in the cohort have completed Cycle 1, a Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review cumulative safety data to determine whether to proceed with further dose escalation.\n\nEach cohort may be expanded in groups of 3 patients to a maximum of 12 patients. Up to six TBX 3400 dose levels will be evaluated during the Dose Escalation Phase of the study.",
