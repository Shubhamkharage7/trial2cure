The main question it aims to answer is whether positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) find cancerous tissue better than other types of imagining.\n\nParticipants will undergo a single PET/MRI scan, followed by a separate MRI scan with a tracer. Study participation will last about 3 hours.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research is to utilize new imaging methods to aid in assessing whether imaging shows presence of tumor. Developing imaging technologies is critical for more accurately identifying location and amount of tumor, which will then lead to improvements in future cancer therapy.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate imaging methods known as PET and MRI to improve detection of cancerous tissue better than the types of imaging that are currently available.\n\nThese methods are conducted on the same machine as conventional MRI that uses a powerful magnet, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed images. Both the PET and MRI methods look at the number of proteins a tumor has. The more proteins, the more likely there is tumor relative to normal brain tissue."
