            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety and effectiveness of tafasitamab, acalabrutinib, and obinutuzumab in treating patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). CLL and SLL are types of cancer that develops from a specific white blood cell called B cells or B lymphocytes. Tafasitamab and obinutuzumab are monoclonal antibodies that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Acalabrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It blocks a protein called BTK, which is present on B-cell cancers such as CLL at abnormal levels. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and spreading. Giving tafasitamab, acalabrutinib, and obinutuzumab may kill more cancer cells in patients with previously untreated CLL and SLL.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate safety and minimal residual disease negativity.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate early indications of efficacy as response.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine progression-free survival. II. Determine overall survival. III. Define the population based on molecular correlates and determinants of CLL or SLL.\n\nIV. Associations between molecular correlates and determinants of CLL/SLL and response.\n\nV. Patient reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over a rate titrated up to 400 mg/hour on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 for cycle 1 then on day 1 for cycles 2-6 and tafasitamab IV over 1.5-2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22 for cycle 2, on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for cycles 3-4, and on days 1 and 15 for cycles 5-7. Patients also receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood sample collection and computed tomography (CT) scans throughout the trial. Patients may undergo an echocardiography (ECHO) at baseline as clinically indicated and may also undergo bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration at baseline and/or follow-up.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years."
