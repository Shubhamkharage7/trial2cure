            "briefSummary": "In response to large numbers of senior center clients who suffer untreated depression and the dearth of geriatric mental health providers, the investigators have simplified Behavioral Activation to be delivered by lay volunteers (\"Do More, Feel Better\"; DMFB). The focus of Behavioral Activation is to guide clients to reengage in daily pleasant and rewarding activities, and reduce depressive symptoms. If the investigators can show that the lay delivery model has positive impact in comparison to MSW-delivered Behavioral Activation, the investigators will have identified an effective intervention that can be used by a large untapped workforce of older adult volunteers across the nation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This Collaborative R01 application (UW, Cornell, USF) proposes to conduct an effectiveness trial of lay-delivered Behavioral Activation (\"Do More, Feel Better\"; DMFB), in comparison to MSW-delivered Behavioral Activation (MSW BA), for depressed (PHQ-9\\>10 and Ham-D\\>14) older (60+) senior center clients. The primary aim tests the effectiveness of DMFB, in comparison to MSW BA, on increasing overall activity level (target) and reducing depression symptoms. The investigators will test whether increased activity level predicts greater reduction in depression severity and whether increased activity's impact on depression is non-inferior across conditions. Secondarily, the investigators will test hypotheses associated with overall functioning, satisfaction with treatment, and client-level moderators. Lastly the investigators will explore longer-term client outcomes, delivery cost, and preparing for sustainability by exploring client, provider, and center factors related to intervention fidelity."
