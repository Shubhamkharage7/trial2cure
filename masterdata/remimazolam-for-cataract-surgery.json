            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to assess any post operative cognitive changes following benzodiazepine administration during cataract surgery. The investigators will compare effects of Midazolam vs. Remimazolam on cognition at the time of discharge from the post operative care unit and the next day following surgery.\n\nCognitive changes will be assessed by administration of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\n\nParticipants will:\n\n1. Complete MoCA testing prior to surgery\n2. Randomize in either Midazolam or study drug Remimazolam\n3. Complete MoCA testing after surgery at the time of discharge in the post anesthesia care unit and the next day of surgery at the time of post operative surgical visit.\n4. Complete Patient Satisfaction Survey at the time of discharge from the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)",
            "detailedDescription": "Cataract surgery (clouded natural lens of eye removed and clear artificial lens implanted) is the most common eye surgery performed in elderly patients. Although cataract surgery is a minor surgery, many patients are anxious and therefore benzodiazepine such as midazolam is administered during surgery to allay a patient's anxiety.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to look at any difference in postoperative cognitive changes as well as recovery times in the PACU following administration of midazolam or remimazolam.\n\nPatients will be asked to participate in a clinical trial where they will be randomly assigned to midazolam or remimazolam group. Cognitive changes will be assessed by administration of MoCA test. MoCA test is a validated, objective short (about 10-15 minutes) screening tool for detection of mild neurocognitive dysfunction. Given the short half life of remimazolam, investigators hypothesize that any cognitive changes will be less with remimazolam compared to midazolam.\n\nPatients will be asked to complete MoCA prior to surgery, in the recovery room following surgery, and the next day during their post-operative clinic visit. In addition, patients will be asked to rate their satisfaction of their anesthetic during their surgery.\n\nThe participant will be in this research study from the day of surgery until the first post-operative visit, the following day."
