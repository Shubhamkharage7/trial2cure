            "briefSummary": "Sixteen institutions will be selected from a HRSA uniform data system and have data collected for up to 3 years. Eight institutions will begin the iPATH practice transformation during year one, the other eight institutions will begin iPATH in year two. FQHC administrators, clinicians and staff will be enrolled to participate in the iPATH transformation in their clinic and will participate in qualitative interviews. Patient HbA1c data from the clinics will be collected for comparative data analysis during each year of the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "A collaborative network of research teams from Stanford, Harvard, The Ohio State University, and Impactivo, LLC propose practice-relevant research focused on diabetes care in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Some 37.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes and significant racial and socioeconomic disparities persist in care quality and patient safety. FQHCs serve 1 in 7 U.S. racial/ethnic minorities and shoulder a higher prevalence of diabetes (21% FQHC, 11% U.S.), offering a promising venue for innovating in equity-focused diabetes care. The iPATH project will refine and implement an approach to practice transformation originally conceived to support FQHCs' pursuit of National Committee for Quality Assurance recognition as patient-centered medical homes. A pilot demonstrated significant decreases (average 31% reduction) in poorly controlled diabetes (A1c\\>9%) among patients at 7 clinics affiliated with an FQHC in Puerto Rico in 2017-20. Improvements in patients' diabetes control were sustained pre- to post- Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAim 1. Refine the iPATH implementation approach by identifying organizational conditions and processes at FQHCs that promoted or impeded the effectiveness of type 2 diabetes care for NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations pre- and post-pandemic. Research teams will simultaneously conduct 12 in-depth regional case studies, enabling contrast between FQHCs considered high-performing and low-performing for diabetes control. Teams will identify actionable, how-to implementation factors for ensuring chronic, preventive, and acute care for patients with diabetes. Employing an innovative Rapid Data Collection and Reporting methodology, teams will rapidly collect, analyze, and share data to accelerate dissemination of customized feedback to FQHC leaders and to inform adaptation and implementation of the iPATH practice transformation.\n\nAim 2. Implement a multi-level, multi-component, technology-enabled practice transformation strategy to improve type 2 diabetes for patients at 8 multi-clinic FQHCs. Teams will adapt, tailor, implement, test, and spread an equity-focused practice transformation strategy across FQHCs located in California, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Puerto Rico. The iPATH implementation approach will be modularized and customizable to accommodate organizational readiness, patient needs, and social contexts, tailoring practice transformation efforts to each unique FQHC.\n\nAim 3. Comprehensively evaluate the iPATH implementation approach with a hybrid type 2 study, including a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. Including formative, process, and summative evaluation elements guided by the Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment model, the study will evaluate impact of practice transformation and identify process elements affecting implementation effectiveness. Analyses will leverage FQHC data by race and ethnicity to examine health disparities."
