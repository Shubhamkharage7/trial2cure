Blood samples will be collected from participants with active/poorly controlled immune-mediated skin diseases and mild/latent/well-controlled immune-mediated skin diseases. A one-time sample from 15 general dermatology outpatients who do not have a known or suspected diagnosis of bullous diseases, immune-mediated dermatologic condition, or cutaneous malignancy will also be collected to serve as control. Blood samples from both participant populations will be analyzed for coagulation and inflammatory markers and compared. The results of this study may help inform future studies on the utility of analyzing coagulation and fibrinolysis profiles of patients with autoimmune skin diseases.",
