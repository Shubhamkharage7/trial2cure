Participants will either participate in functional power training, music-based walking training, or a combination of both. The study will use a sequential multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. Successful completion of this study will lay the foundation for subsequent research trials, contributing to valuable evidence for personalized rehabilitation medicine for older Veterans."
