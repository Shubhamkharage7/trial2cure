            "briefSummary": "Daily consumption of Orange Juice (OJ) protects skin against UV-induced damages and wrinkling, improves skin barrier function and overall skin health by decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein glycation. The positive effects of OJ on skin appearance are associated with improvements of the stratum corneum lipidomic and skin microbiome.",
            "detailedDescription": "There is a lack of clinical evidence on how 100% orange juice (OJ) affects skin health. Women make over 90% of the decisions on food purchases for family. Skin health is a major concern for women because skin ageing becomes visibly noticeable after age 30 due to UV exposure, oxidative stress, and collagen glycation. The investigators hypothesize that micronutrients in OJ, including vitamin C, flavanones, and carotenoids, protect skin against photoaging and wrinkling by alleviating oxidative stress, inflammation, and collagen glycation. The investigators further propose that daily OJ consumption (16 oz) will improve skin elasticity, barrier function, overall skin appearance and health. The study hypotheses will be tested in a 12-week clinical trial in 24 women aged 45-65 using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Placebo will be formulated using decarbonated Fanta\u00ae orange soda to match the color, taste, and calorie content of OJ, but will contain no micronutrients. This research will measure UV-induced skin erythema, wrinkles, smoothness, roughness, elasticity, hydration, pH, melanin, and transepidermal water loss (a skin barrier index) of skin on both face and forearm. Skin strips and swabs will be collected and preserved for future assessments of skin lipids and colonized microorganisms (skin microbiome) because they are key factors affecting skin health. Positive results from this pilot trial will provide clinical evidence on the effectiveness of OJ to maintain skin health and reduce ageing. This research will be carried out by a research team with the experience and facilities for skin research."
