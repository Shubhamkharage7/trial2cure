            "briefSummary": "This project examines, in chronic pain, the mechanisms of immersive virtual reality compared to the mechanisms of placebo hypoalgesia. The potential of developing new non-pharmacological premises for low-risk interventions for pain management is high.",
            "detailedDescription": "Virtual reality (VR) has been seen as an intervention for alleviating clinical chronic (and acute) pain. An approach to pain management utilizing VR presents opportunities for reducing pain and suffering by using immersive, aesthetic, and multisensory stimulation. Investigator will analyze the behavioral and neural mechanisms of active VR against sham VR as two methods that investigate descending pain modulation. Thus, the central hypothesis is that those who respond to placebos will likely respond to active VR. If VR-induced analgesia depends upon the release of endogenous opioids.\n\nIn this project, the investigators will determine the effects of VR at the neural and clinical levels directly for TMD participants, inviting participants from an existing Colloca Lab-based cohort phenotyped for diagnosis, grade, and low/high impact pain profiles and prospective TMD participants in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University. These participants have agreed to be recontacted for further research.\n\nIn this study, based on our PAF study and modulation of autonomic measurements via VR, we will determine the role of acute and 3-week VR intervention to help restore PAF oscillations to normal. PAF and autonomic measurements will be collected in TMD participants characterized by low/high-impact pain. All participants will go through Active VR, Sham VR and NH phases (3-week each) where participants will be monitored for changes in cortical excitability via PAF oscillations and clinical benefit via EMA."
