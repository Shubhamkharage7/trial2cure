This research will ultimately help to improve health and survival in black populations with HTN.",
            "detailedDescription": "By studying standardized behaviors and regulators of BP during sleep and behavioral stresses across all circadian phases, this protocol will allow us specifically to:\n\n1. To determine if poor sleep, while controlling for circadian phase, contributes to the higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites.\n2. To determine if reduced BP responses to standardized behavioral changes across the day and night contribute to the higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites.\n3. To determine if reduced circadian amplitude of BP contributes to the higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites."
