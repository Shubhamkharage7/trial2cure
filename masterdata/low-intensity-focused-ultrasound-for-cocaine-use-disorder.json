Data analysis will serve to show if 1) LIFU is safe and effective and to 2) examine the effects of LIFU on dAI BOLD activity and craving in response to cocaine cue-exposure. The study will screen 60 individuals with Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) to arrive at 30 enrolled subjects, based on a 2:1 screen/randomization ratio.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized single-blind, active, sham-controlled study.\n\nThis study will enroll thirty (30) individuals, aged 18 years and older, that meet the criteria for CUD. Participants will be recruited from the general population and will be asked to complete cognitive testing and measures, self-reported craving measures, and diagnostic exams including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). Participants will also undergo functional MRI which entails being shown cocaine-related photos at regular intervals.\n\nAll participants will receive LIFU and sham interventions, but will be randomized to one of two sessions, and will return one month after the second session for an in-person follow-up. In total, there are five (5) in-person visits and two (2) phone calls to assess for adverse events, conducted over eight (8) weeks."
