Enrolled patients will be risk-assessed and assigned to specific regimens based on a combination of their post-operative cTTMV-HPV DNA, as determined by results from NavDx kits by Naveris, and pathologic features. All patients will receive a dose of 40 mg/m2 IV weekly concurrently with radiation therapy. Patients ineligible to receive cisplatin at this dose will undergo modified sydtemic therapy. Patients will recieve concurrent radiation in a dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions to the primary tumor bed, ipsilateral neck +/- contralateral neck. Based on risk-stratification, some patients will receive a sequential boost of 10 Gy over 5 fractions or 20 Gy over 10 fractions."

Patients with synchronous or multifocal oropharyngeal cancers are not excluded, as long as at least one of these tumors meet inclusion criteria for the trial.\n* Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:\n\n  * Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of enrollment\n  * Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or known coagulation defects\n* Moderate to severe hearing loss.\n* Active connective tissue disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematous, scleroderma) requiring immunosuppression.\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women.\n* Prior allergic reaction to cisplatin.\n* Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of chemoradiation. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral vaccine). Season influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.",
