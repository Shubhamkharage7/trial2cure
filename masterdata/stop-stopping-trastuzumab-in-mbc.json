Exceptional response\" is considered as cancer progression being controlled for three years or more since starting anti-HER2 treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single arm, phase II study of cessation of anti-HER2 systemic therapy in exceptional responders with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), defined as individuals free of disease progression after at least 3 years of first-line treatment.\n\nThis research study will include two different groups (cohorts) of patients. Those not wanting to stop anti-HER2 maintenance treatment will be included in a non-randomized, observational cohort (cohort 1). Those willing to stop maintenance anti-HER2 treatment you will be included in cohort 2.\n\nThis study is trying to understand whether blood samples that may contain traces of DNA from cancer, known as \"circulating tumor DNA\" or \"ctDNA\" are able to help identify which patients can successfully stop treatment without a change in their cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include: an initial screening phase followed by periodic visits with blood work, questionnaires, and body scans.\n\nIt is expected that about 82 people will take part in this research study (52 in cohort 2 (stopping treatment), 30 in cohort 1 (continuing treatment). This study is expected to last 1 year with 10 years of follow up.\n\nThe Susan G. Komen Foundation, the Gateway for Cancer Research - both nonprofit foundations supporting cancer research - and the National Institutes of Health are supporting this research study by providing funds. This study is also being supported by Johns Hopkins University on behalf of the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC). The TBCRC is a group of academic medical centers across the United States that work together to conduct breast cancer research."

If tissue block is unavailable, 20 unstained 10uM slides will be accepted (less than 20 slides may be acceptable with documentation of Sponsor-Investigator approval and would not require an eligibility exception). Tumor tissue must be received by coordinating site prior to study enrollment.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1\n* For intervention arm only (cohort 2): willingness to stop anti-HER2 systemic therapy\n* Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures\n* Ability to understand the study requirements and document informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature and the risks of this study\n* Participants with another prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of this trial are eligible\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who are receiving any investigational agents to treat breast cancer\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* All English- speaking patients will participate in the PRO measures.
