            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n- Pembrolizumab\n\nStandard treatment will include:\n\n* CAR T-cell therapy (either axicabtagene-ciloleucel or lisocabtagene maraleucel)\n* Cyclophosphamide\n* Fludarabine Participants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years and will be followed for 5 years. It is expected that about 35 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab for this specific disease after two or more lines of therapy, but not in combination with CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nThe CAR T-cell therapies to be used in this study are axicabtagene-ciloleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel. The U.S. FDA has approved axicabtageneciloleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel as treatment options for this disease, but not in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\nA small subset of patients with T-cell histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma and EBV+ large B-cell lymphoma will also be included."

If archival tissue is unavailable or is determined to be inadequate, tumor tissue must be obtained from a biopsy performed at screening, unless an exception is given after consultation with the sponsor-investigator.\n* Eligible for standard of care CAR T-cell therapy with progression after at least two prior lines of therapy OR refractory to initial chemoimmunotherapy OR relapse within 12 months of front-line chemoimmunotherapy OR one prior line of therapy and not fit for HSCT.\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 50% on cardiac multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or cardiac echocardiogram (ECHO).\n* Adequate hematologic function (unless due to underlying disease, as established for example, by extensive bone marrow involvement or due to hypersplenism secondary to the involvement of the spleen by lymphoma per the investigator), defined as follows:\n\n  * ANC \u2265 1,000/\u03bcL\n  * Hemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL\n  * Platelet count \u2265 50,000/\u03bcL\n* Participants must have adequate organ as defined below:\n\n  * Total bilirubin \u22641.5 \u00d7ULN OR direct bilirubin \u2264ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels \\>1.5 \u00d7 ULN\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u22642.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u22645 \u00d7 ULN for participants with liver involvement)\n  * Adequate renal function defined by serum creatinine \u22641.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft-Gault) \u2265 40 ml/min for patients with serum creatinine \\>1.5 x ULN\n* At least one bi-dimensionally FDG-avid measurable lymphoma lesion on PET/CT scan, defined as \u2265 1.5 cm in its longest dimension on CT scan, or \u2265 1 cm if extranodal (and measurable).\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use effective contraception when sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed consent form and 6 months for WOCBP and for men after the last administration of study treatment. A woman is considered of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for continuous 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. The investigator or a designated associate is requested to advise the patient how to achieve highly effective birth control, e.g. intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, use of two forms of birth control, and sexual abstinence. The use of condoms by male patients is required unless the female partner is permanently sterile.\n* Age \u226518 years.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients in urgent need of cytoreductive therapy.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of other malignancies, except:\n\n  * Malignancy treated medically or surgically with curative intent and with no known active disease present for \u22652 years before study registration\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\n  * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.\n  * Localized prostate cancer and low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance\n  * In the opinion of the treating investigator, there is limited potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy of the investigational regimen. Such exceptions must be approved by the Sponsor-Investigator.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to study registration. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* Less than 6 months of response to prior PD-L1 inhibitor or PD-1 inhibitor or grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events.\n* Prior treatment with CAR T-cell therapy.\n* Lactating or pregnant. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at screening. WOCBP will require a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to starting treatment, but eligibility for study enrollment may be confirmed based on testing at screening.\n* Known active lymphomatous involvement of the central nervous system. History of prior CNS involvement is allowed.\n* Recent infection requiring intravenous antibiotics that was completed \u22647 days before the first dose of study drug, or any uncontrolled active systemic infection.\n* Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus infection.\n* History of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection.\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of study registration.
