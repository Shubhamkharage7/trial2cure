After assuring adherence to CGM wear, participants will receive a non-blinded CGM and will share their blood glucose levels with the study team. Clinical personnel will remotely monitor patients in real-time for 3 months and communicate regularly over secure text messaging with participants and their parents. Following active remote monitoring, the participants will wear a non-blinded CGM for 3 months. Primary outcome assessment will be the change in HbA1c after 3 months of real-time remote continuous glucose monitoring."
