            "briefSummary": "Statins reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, but only 30% of eligible primary care patients nationally are on statins. Clinical decision support (CDS) interventions in the electronic health record (EHR) can deliver education to providers and increase adherence to guideline recommendations via many potential forms of delivery. Interruptive alerts are an effective form of CDS but disrupt clinician workflow and increase alert fatigue in an age of clinician burnout and frustration with the EHR. Non-interruptive reminders are proposed as an alternative method of delivering CDS; however, they require active pursuit by the provider, and their effectiveness compared to interruptive alerts has not been rigorously studied. The investigators propose a randomized trial comparing the effect of interruptive vs. non-interruptive reminders displayed to clinicians to increase statin prescribing in primary care clinics."
