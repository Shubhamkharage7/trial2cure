Being able to predict who is at increased risk of post-HCT complications can help better inform patients and providers on the risks and benefits of undergoing HCT and determine whether certain patients should have closer post-HCT monitoring due to an increased risk of complications.",

To develop novel pre-transplant tools for determining risk of post-HCT pulmonary complications.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients undergo a clinical evaluation consisting of a six-minute walk test, hand grip strength test, and gait speed test on study. Patients' medical records are also reviewed for a year on study."
