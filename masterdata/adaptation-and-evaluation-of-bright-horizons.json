Bright Horizons is a brief intervention that teaches emotion regulation, coping skills, and problem solving. The intervention also uses goal setting to reduce alcohol and other substance use and to connect to individuals with treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to understand how Bright Horizons impacts adolescents who have a recent binge substance use event. Participants will receive a lesson on binge substance use and answer questions at three different time points: when participants enroll in the study; 4 weeks later; and 4 weeks after that visit. Evaluation questions will ask about participants' substance use, family and peer relationships, and other emotions and behaviors.\n\nControl participants will receive the Bright Horizons intervention after enrollment of all intervention participants is complete."
