The investigators do not plan to share transcripts from in-depth qualitative interviews or recorded study assessment visits.\n\nData will be maintained on secure servers behind the firewalls at the two study sites: Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). De-identified or limited datasets containing individual-level data on which publications are based will be made available to qualified researchers for specified analyses. The investigators will make the data available to users only under a data-use agreement (DUA).",

Data may then be accessed by qualified researchers via KPWA's Secure File Transfer (SFT) site. User registration will be required in order to access or download data files. As part of the registration process, users must agree to the conditions of use governing access to the data, including restrictions against attempting to identify study participants, destruction of the data after analyses are completed, reporting responsibilities, restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties, and proper acknowledgment of the data resource.\n\nIndividuals interested in using UCSF data will be required to complete the same data request form. The UCSF Industry Contracts Division (ICD), which oversees incoming and outgoing transfer of all UCSF data, will review the form for compliance with UCSF policies."
