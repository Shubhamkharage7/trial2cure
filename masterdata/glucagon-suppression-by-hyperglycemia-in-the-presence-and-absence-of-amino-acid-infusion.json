            "detailedDescription": "T2DM and prediabetes are characterized by abnormal post-prandial suppression of glucagon, which contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia by increasing endogenous glucose production (EGP). In rodents, altered glucagon signaling changes \u03b1-cell function and mass - an effect mediated by changes in circulating AA concentrations. Are the elevated concentrations of branched-chain AA and other AA metabolites in T2DM a cause or an effect of global \u03b1-cell dysfunction? To measure glucagon secretion, as well as glucagon action, we have developed a population model of glucagon kinetics allowing us to deconvolve secretion from glucagon concentrations in a manner similar to Van Cauter's model for insulin secretion from C-peptide. This enables better characterization of \u03b1-cell function in humans. In addition to our novel methodology, we can characterize \u03b1-cell responsiveness to a graded glucose infusion, by quantifying (G50) - the change in glucose concentration necessary to suppress glucagon secretion by 50%. These experiments will determine if the glucagon secretion in response to AA differs in obese individuals with T2DM from that observed in obese individuals without T2DM."
