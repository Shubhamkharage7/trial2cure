            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare different forms of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for improving the outcomes of Exposure with Response Prevention (ERP) in youth and young adults with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Researchers will compare three groups: ERP with one of two different active (\"real\") forms of TMS vs. ERP with sham (\"fake\") TMS. The main questions this study aims to answer are: 1) whether TMS normalizes functioning in brain circuits that contribute to compulsive behavior, and 2) whether TMS reduces compulsions during ERP. Participants will:\n\n* Complete clinical interviews, questionnaires, and computerized tasks\n* Complete two MRIs (brain scans)\n* Receive daily TMS followed by ERP for two weeks (10 sessions)",
            "detailedDescription": "Pediatric OCD is a public health problem and many remain symptomatic even after receiving efficacious treatments. The success of exposure and response prevention (ERP), a first-line behavioral treatment, depends on the ability to refrain from compulsions during exposure tasks. Improving this \"therapy critical behavior\" is a potentially important strategy for ERP augmentation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be leveraged to stimulate healthier functioning of brain circuits underlying therapy critical behaviors. The overall objective of this project is to test whether augmenting ERP with rTMS over cortical nodes of select cortico-striatal circuits implicated in compulsivity can normalize connectivity and enhance response prevention in youth and young adults with OCD. This project will use a masked RCT design to test whether ERP+TMS engages 1) hypothesized circuits involved in compulsivity and 2) observed response prevention during ERP exposure tasks. Youth ages 12-21 years with OCD will complete a full course of ERP plus randomly assigned TMS regimens of sham, inhibitory theta burst stimulation (iTBS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortext (dlPFC), or continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to the presupplementary motor area (pSMA; n=20 per group). Milestones for the R61 phase are determination that at least one active rTMS condition a) changes resting state functional connectivity in the hypothesized circuit within- and between-subjects and b) is safe and feasible."
