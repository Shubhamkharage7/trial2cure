This will be the first prospective study of this particular formulation in addition to standard of care in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. We will treat 40 consecutive patients with borderline resectable, locally advanced and advanced pancreatic cancer patients who present with weight loss and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with this advanced formulation of Pancreaze."
