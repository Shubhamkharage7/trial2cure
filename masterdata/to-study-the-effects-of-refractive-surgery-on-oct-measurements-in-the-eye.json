            "briefSummary": "Corrective eye surgeries, such as Lasik, are widely used to correct focusing problems such as myopia, or nearsightedness. Often these patients develop other conditions like myopic maculopathy or glaucoma which require monitoring with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Since OCT is a light-based test and changes the refractive status of the eye (in the cornea or the lens), it can potentially affect the results of the OCT measurements but has not been sufficiently studied. This pilot study aims at studying the potential change in OCT parameters in the eye after undergoing such surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "Refractive surgeries are widely used in patients with ametropia. Refractive surgery is most commonly performed in patients with myopia. These patients often have a predilection for developing other conditions in the posterior segment of the eye, like myopic maculopathy or glaucoma which require monitoring with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Since OCT is a light-based test and changes in the refractive status of the eye (in the cornea or the lens) can potentially affect the results of the OCT measurements. Literature review reveals that the effect of significant changes in refractive power of the eye on the parameters of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has not been sufficiently studied. Some authors simulated the effect of refractive surgery using a contact lens but had diverging results. This prospective pilot study aims at studying the potential change in OCT parameters in the eye after undergoing refractive surgery."
