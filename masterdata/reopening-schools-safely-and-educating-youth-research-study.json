Aim 1 involves a qualitative assessment of rural Latino community's social, ethical, behavioral needs and resources for students to return to school and maintain onsite learning. Aim 2 includes a clustered RCT in schools. Aim 3 involves qualitative assessment of implementation outcomes of the Yakima School District (YSD) testing program and risk communication intervention with school stakeholders, parents, and children.",
            "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVE:\n\nAim 1. Identify the rural Latino community's social, ethical, behavioral needs and resources for students to return to school and maintain onsite learning using qualitative assessments with school stakeholders, parents, and students.\n\nAim 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk communication on student attendance and participation in SARS-CoV-2 testing using a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two intervention arms: intervention (SARS-CoV-2 Risk Communication) and comparison (control group) arm.\n\nAim 3. Assess implementation outcomes of the Yakima School District testing program and risk communication intervention with school stakeholders, parents, and children guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework.\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\nThe study has three aims and involves a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) where K-5 elementary schools will be the unit of randomization. Aim 1 will involve conducting qualitative assessments with school stakeholders, parents and students to to assess social, ethical, cultural, and behavioral concerns related to COVID-19 in the community. This data will be used to guide the development of the risk communication strategies (e.g., comic books and videos). Aim 2 includes a clustered RCT conducted in Yakima School District elementary schools to evaluate the effect of risk communication on testing uptake. We will assess primary outcome on students; parent/guardian will provide informed consent through either an online, paper, or telephone process to enroll in the study. Following consent, parent/guardians of participants will receive instructions on study procedures and complete the enrollment questionnaire either via online, on paper, or over the telephone with a study staff member. If the students attend a school that is randomized into the intervention group, they will receive the risk communication as three comic books and their parents will receive two videos at regular intervals throughout the study in English and Spanish. The communication intervention will highlight benefits of and address barriers to preventative behaviors, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19 vaccines. Participants in the comparison group will receive the risk communication comic books and videos at the end of the study as part of the delayed intervention. Secondary outcome measures will be assessed for one index child in all families who have children enrolled in the study.\n\nTo prepare for this large trial, the study will institute a pilot study conducting weekly novel coronavirus surveillance testing in one school during April - June 2021 to understand the implementation steps and the workflow of working with schools. The larger RCT trial will be implemented in 14 K-5 schools in Fall 2021 - Spring 2023 school year.\n\nAll students in the Yakima School District has access to the Yakima School District's COVID-19 static testing site. Screening and symptomatic testing will be available (but not mandated) to Yakima School District students through the static site. School attendance and SARS-CoV-2 test results on students enrolled in our research study will come from schools.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION:\n\nThe schools participating in the study come from an agricultural region of Washington state.\n\nSTUDY TIME PERIOD:\n\nAugust 2021-March 2023.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES: The primary analysis will be based on the average number of onsite learning hours per week over the study period for each student. The data will be analyzed using a linear mixed effects model with district and randomization arm as fixed effects, and school and classroom within school as random effects. Analyses will test for any difference between the randomization arms using \u03b1 = 0.05 and report the comparisons between arms.\n\nSTUDY OUTCOMES:\n\nThe primary outcome for children will be absenteeism (hours per week missing onsite learning).\n\nThe secondary outcome will be assessed in parent/child dyads. Parents will share their child's physical activity and emotional regulation; and will be assessed for perceived stress, COVID-related stress, and depressive symptomatology for parents."
