            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to is to determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of siltuximab prophylaxis of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity occurring after epcoritamab subcutaneous administration for participants with large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL).\n\nParticipants will receive siltuximab, prior to the infusion of epcoritamab. Epcoritamab is administered in 28 day cycles for one year. After this infusion, the physician will continue to watch participants for side effects and follow the condition for a minimum of 60 days.",
            "detailedDescription": "Siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-6 (IL-6) from binding to its receptor, preventing it from acting. IL-6 is a cytokine, a type of protein that is a cause of inflammatory reactions. Decreasing levels of IL-6 has been shown to reduce symptoms of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potential side effect of epcoritamab. Addition of siltuximab to the medications given before epcoritamab, may prevent, or reduce the severity, of CRS. Siltuximab is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Epcoritamab is a so-called bispecific antibody, which is a molecule that can bind simultaneously to two different receptors. Epcoritamab binds to a receptor called CD3 with one part of the antibody and to a receptor called CD20 with another part of the antibody. CD20 is expressed on the normal, healthy B cells but also on the cancerous lymphoma cells of B cell origin. CD3 is expressed on T cells, which are important cells of the immune system and help the body fight cancers, infections, etc. By simultaneous binding to CD3 and CD20, Epcoritamab brings T cells and B cells close together and activates the T cells to kill the B cells, including the cancerous ones.\n\nEpcoritamab is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat participants with Follicular Lymphoma."

A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\\< 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of \\< 1% per year during the treatment period. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma\n* Active central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy\n* Active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic or other infection requiring systemic therapy within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. This includes participants with COVID-19 infection\n* History of active chronic infection by hepatitis B or C or Cytomegalovirus (CMV) requiring treatment or prophylaxis. Resolved infections (either by treatment or immune response) are not exclusion criterion.\n* Active malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervix, bladder, breast). History of prior malignancy is not excluded.\n* HIV seropositivity.\n* Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because siltuximab therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with siltuximab, breastfeeding should be continued and not restarted for 3 months after the last dose of siltuximab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* Participants with history of clinically relevant and active CNS pathology such as epilepsy, seizure disorders, paresis, aphasia, uncontrolled cerebrovascular disease, severe brain injuries, dementia and Parkinson's disease.",
