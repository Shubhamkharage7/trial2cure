            "briefSummary": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in early childhood causing serious motor and sensory impairments. Effective interventions for the recovery of motor functions are of profound significance to children with CP, their families, caregivers, and health professionals. Robot-assisted rehabilitation represents a frontier with potential to improve motor functions and induce brain reorganization in children with CP.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is designed to test whether robot-assisted hand training with Amadeo improves manual functions and induces cerebral neural plasticity in children with CP. To evaluate the efficacy of the robot-assisted hand training, investigators will measure manual motor and sensory functions with behavioral tasks and assess neural activities in the sensorimotor cortical network with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) one day before, one day after, and two months after the robot-assisted training. The study will provide direct evidence on the effectiveness of the robot-assisted training in recovering of manual functions in children with CP. It will provide detailed insights on potential experience-dependent neuraplastic changes in the brain of children with CP. It has the potential to insight the development of more effective rehabilitation for children with CP and also children with other neurological disorders, like pediatric stroke. It may uncover factors that will be predictive of functional improvements in individual CP patient."
