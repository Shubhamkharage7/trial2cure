            "briefSummary": "We will be performing this study in 2 phases: Phase 1 will be an open label pilot study of 10 male participants. All participants in the pilot study will receive active treatment. If data from the pilot study is suggestive of symptom improvement, we will continue on to phase 2, which is a sham controlled, randomized blinded study. Participants in phase 2 will be randomized to receive either active treatment or sham. Potentially total of 114 participants for both phases will be enrolled.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the Emsella Chair to sham and to determine whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of sexual dysfunction, specifically erectile dysfunction (EjD) in men.",
            "detailedDescription": "Male sexual health is an often overlooked and ignored facet of mens well-being. However, this can have significant effects on quality of life for both the man afflicted by sexual dysfunction as well as their partner. Most commonly we think of erectile dysfunction (ED) as the main factor of male sexual dysfunction, but ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD) and other problems relating to orgasm are also important. EjD is exceedingly common especially in the aging male population, and includes premature ejaculation (PE), delayed ejaculation (DE), anejaculation (absence of ejaculation during orgasm), retrograde ejaculation, and painful ejaculation. Medications such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis) are PDE-5 inhibitors that are commonly used for the treatment of ED, but there are very few medications specifically formulated to treat EjD. More conservative management options for the treatment of ED include vacuum erection devices, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes. The usual next step after failure of the above options includes intracavernosal injections which involve directly injecting erectogenic medication into the penis, intraurethral injections, or finally surgery. Ejaculatory dysfunction on the other hand, whether it be premature, delayed, retrograde, or anejaculation all have much less treatment options. Most of these include either the off-label use of medications to treat other conditions or sex therapy / psychotherapy.\n\nTreatments including pudendal neuromodulation or pudendal canal decompression have shown significant improvement in ED and EjD. Due to side effects and the lack of patient compliance to oral medication, non-oral medication treatments are in high demand for this condition. Neuromodulation therapies have become increasingly popular for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction. These neuromodulation therapies often work by stimulating the sacral nerve. The Emsella Chair is a conservative neuromodulation therapy that may have a role for patients who are not surgical candidates or who desire a noninvasive treatment option. The Emsella Chair uses high intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to induce deep pelvic floor muscle contractions, the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over 28 minutes. The treatment awakens deconditioned pelvic floor muscles, delivers the stimulations, and then relaxes the muscles. The repetition of these phases leads to pelvic floor adaptation and remodulation. this treatment could provide similar improvement for men with sexual dysfunction given the significant overlap in anatomy and physiology, as well as studies that have shown improvement in sexual dysfunction with pelvic floor muscle therapy."
