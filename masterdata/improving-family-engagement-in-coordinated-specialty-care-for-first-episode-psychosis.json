First, 5 family member participants will be recruited into a three-month trial of FAMES and implementation toolkit. The investigators will then conduct a 16-month non-randomized, stepped-wedge trial with 50 family members from 5 CSC programs in community-based mental health clinics.",
            "detailedDescription": "FAMES involves three distinct and revolving components - early, continuous, and motivational contact - that incorporate motivational techniques and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5TH Edition (DSM-5) Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI).\n\nThe overarching objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a brief provider-led FAmily Engagement Motivational Strategy (FAMES) and its accompanying implementation toolkit. The investigators will also preliminary examine whether FAMES improves family engagement and retention in treatment, and motivation.\n\nA total of 50 participants with a loved one enrolled in CSC program for FEP will be recruited from five CSC programs in Washington State to take part in a non-randomized stepped-wedge pilot trial. Each CSC program will represent a cluster and serve as its own control. A two-month implementation transition period will occur at each CSC program and during which providers will be introduced to the intervention using the implementation toolkits and trained to conduct FAMES. A 12-month open cohort design will be utilized to recruit approximately 50 family members during the study period."
