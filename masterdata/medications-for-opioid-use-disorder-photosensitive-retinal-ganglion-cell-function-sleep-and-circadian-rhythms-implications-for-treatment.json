            "briefSummary": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a treatable medical illness with three medications FDA approved for treatment. However, persons with OUD report significant sleep disturbance, even when treated with medications for opioid use disorder, leading to high rates of relapse. In this project, we will investigate a special set of photosensitive neurons in the retina as an underlying mechanism for circadian rhythm and sleep disturbance from opioid use and medications for OUD that could lead to novel intervention and improve treatment outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Three medications for OUD (MOUD) are FDA-approved and regularly used to treat OUD: methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). However, persons who use opioids, including those prescribed MOUDs, report sleep disruption. In addition to the sleep centers of the brain, mu opioid receptors (MORs) are also expressed in the retina (including the human retina), specifically in ganglion cells that are critically important for non-image forming photoreception including circadian regulation of sleep-wake behavior. Pre-clinical studies show that activation of MORs on these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) reduces the electrophysiological response to light, impacting critical ipRGC functions such as synchronization of sleep-wake behavior and circadian rhythms to light (photoentrainment), light-induced melatonin suppression, and the post-illumination pupillary reflex (PIPR). Together, these results suggest that activation of MORs in the ipRGCs by opioid use and/or MOUDs may impair downstream ipRGC functions. This multi-disciplinary study will examine the novel overarching hypothesis that persistent alterations in sleep/wake behavior in OUD patients undergoing treatment are mediated by impaired ipRGC function, and biomarkers of this pathway can predict recovery and relapse. Three aims will be tested in a sample of 200 participants, 150 of whom will be engaged in MOUD therapy (e.g., 50 each on methadone, buprenorphine, and XR-NTX, respectively) and 50 of whom will be non-opioid using control participants. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that MOUD differentially impacts function of ipRGC responses. Aim 2 will examine whether MOUD differentially impacts daytime sleepiness, daily sleep-wake behavior, sleep architecture, and sleep-disordered breathing. Finally, Aim 3 will determine if ipRGC function predicts opioid relapse among MOUD groups at 1-, 3- and 6- month follow-up. Compared to non-opioid using controls or persons receiving an opioid antagonist (XR-NTX), we predict that participants who are receiving an agonist (methadone) or partial-agonist (buprenorphine) MOUD will have the most ipRGC interference, as evidenced by reduced PIPR, attenuated light-induced melatonin suppression, reduced circadian rhythmic amplitude, increased sleep latency, and increased sleep fragmentation. Importantly, we hypothesize that impaired ipRGC function will predict worse treatment outcomes as indicated by opioid use by 6-month follow-up. Finally, an exploratory aim will examine whether the MOUD groups show different relationships between opioid craving/withdrawal symptoms and sleep-wake behavior over a 10-day assessment of the participants' daily lives within the normal environment. The results of this study will be highly significant because it would support the use of the pupillary response to light and other indicators of ipRGC function as novel biomarkers to predict the response and outcomes to MOUDs."

Subjects are then seated in a dimly lit room (\\< 5 lux, background light) for 30 minute to dark adapt and to ensure complete pupil dilation prior to the study. The PIPR is measured in six, 80-second test periods in which the stimulus, either Blue (470 nm) or Red (623 nm), is presented to the dilated eye while the pupil response of the un-dilated eye is measured (consensual pupil response). During a test period, after an initial 20-second fixation period, the stimulus is presented for 1 second followed by a 60-second fixation period. The red stimulus primarily serves as a control for any nonspecific influences on the PIPR.",
