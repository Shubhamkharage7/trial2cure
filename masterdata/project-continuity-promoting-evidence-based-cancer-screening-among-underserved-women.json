            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this pilot project is to gather information about the extent to which women residing in high SEV neighborhoods who choose HPV self-sampling relative to in-clinic Pap/HPV testing adhere to the cancer screening continuum steps, for which they are eligible. The women will self-select into HPV self-sampling versus in-clinic Pap/HPV testing combined with follow-up telephone calls and text messages from community clinical navigators and CHWs.\n\nThe research components of this study involve: 1) offering women the opportunity to complete the HPV self-test in a non-clinical setting to be returned via a mailer or handed to the community clinical navigator or CHW and 2) asking women to respond to questions about their cancer history and knowledge of cervical cancer prevention and screening. All other components of this study are part of clinical care. All other planned activities align with clinically based recommendations and guidelines (e.g., follow-up for colposcopy for + Paps)"
