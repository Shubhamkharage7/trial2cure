            "briefSummary": "Similar to the paradigm established in other hematologic malignancies that are considered curable, the achievement of MRD(-) status is necessary for long term disease control in MM. The fact that the majority of patients remain MRD (+) after induction therapy and AHCT points to the opportunity to deploy novel agents with complementary mechanism of action and favorable toxicity profile to reach and maintain MRD (-) status.\n\nGiven its favorable toxicity profile, the convenience of oral administration, and compelling single agent activity even in heavily pretreated MM, iberdomide is likely amenable to long term therapy in patients with high-risk of relapse/progression identified by the persistence of MRD(+). The investigators intend to develop combination(s) of iberdomide with other agents with complementary mechanism of action in the consolidation setting post AHCT in order to achieve and sustain MRD (-)."
