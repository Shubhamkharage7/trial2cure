Patients will be treated per standard of care as determined by the Investigator and will document topical ophthalmic medications.\n\nThe original DEFENDO Study duration was for a total of 34 weeks: a screening period of 2 weeks, followed by enrollment in 8 weeks of OXERVATE\u2122 treatment and an Off- Treatment Follow-Up of 6 months.\n\nAfter completing enrollment in the original DEFENDO Study, patients will be invited to enter the DEFENDO Long- Term Follow-up Study (all standard of care is permitted).\n\nTwo additional long-term follow-up visits will occur at 24- and 30-months to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes."
