            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSome head and facial abnormalities are rare and present at birth. Others are more common, and may not show up until puberty. These conditions have different causes and characteristics. Researchers want to learn more about these conditions by comparing people with face, head, and neck abnormalities to family members and to healthy volunteers without such conditions.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo learn more about abnormal development of the face, head, and neck. To determine their genetic variants.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople who have not had surgery for facial trauma:\n\nPeople ages 2 and older with craniofacial abnormalities (may participate offsite)\n\nUnaffected relatives ages 2 and older\n\nHealthy volunteers ages 6 and older\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history and physical exam focusing on head, face, and neck\n\nParticipants may be followed for several years. Visits may require staying near the clinic for a few days.\n\nA visit is required for the following developmental stages, along with follow-up visits:\n\nAge 2-6\n\nAge 6-10\n\nAge 11-17\n\nAge 18 and older\n\nVisits may include:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nOral exam\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nCheek swab: a cotton swab will be wiped across the inside of the cheek several times.\n\nCone beam CT scan (CBCT): x-rays create an image of the head, face, teeth, and neck. Participants will\n\nstand still or sit on a chair for about 20 minutes while the scanner rotates around the head.\n\nPhotos of the head and face\n\nOffsite participants will provide:\n\nCopies of medical and dental records\n\nLeftover tissue samples from previous surgery\n\nBlood sample or cheek swab",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is a natural history study that will examine craniofacial anomalies that affect the normal development of the facial skeleton, including birth defects and dentofacial developmental abnormalities that express themselves with the growth of the individual. Craniofacial anomalies may be rare and present at birth, such as hemifacial microsomia (1 in every 7500 live births), or common, such as dentofacial deformities including the Habsburg Jaw or mandibular prognathism (1% of the US population) that becomes apparent as a child enters puberty. These are striking disorders as they involve the face and surrounding structures, which is a focal point of self-identity and are intimately tied to quality of life and daily function.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo characterize and determine genetic variants of rare and common craniofacial anomalies\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To establish a curated craniofacial phenomic/genomic database\n2. To collect data related to clinically-indicated procedures and care performed at the NIH\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nPhenotypic and genomic characterization of craniofacial anomalies will be performed. Phenotypes from affected subjects and healthy volunteers will be assessed using extensive clinical evaluations, 3D one-beam computed tomography-based geometric morphometric, cephalometric analyses and surface morphology. Genetic variants will be identified through genomic analysis and compared with genetic patterns obtained from healthy volunteers.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nTo create a database with phenotypic and genetic data, collected from long term follow up of subjects (females and males) with craniofacial disorders and healthy volunteers, and to link the data with their clinical information to understand the craniofacial disorders."
