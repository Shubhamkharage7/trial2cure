            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of the MAP for Coaches, a web-based Musculoskeletal Athletic injury Prevention training course, in youth sport coaches. The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the MAP for Coaches effective in increasing coaches' sport-specific knowledge of musculoskeletal injuries (types, incidence, risk factors, mechanisms, and best prevention practices, with focus on neuromuscular training warm-up exercise programs)?\n* Is the MAP for Coaches effective in increasing coaches' motivation (self-efficacy and intention) to use sport-specific neuromuscular training warm-up exercise programs?\n\nThe additional questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Are the effects of the MAP for Coaches sustained in the short- and long-term?\n* Is the MAP for Coaches effective in promoting the use of sport-specific neuromuscular training warm-up exercise programs in youth sport coaches?\n\nRegardless of group, participants will receive the MAP for Coaches eLearning training course; however, the participants allocated to the control group will have their post-test survey completed right after they review the sport-specific 2-page injury prevention e-book containing an overview of the MAP for Coaches training course, including an infographic summary (Summarized MAP for Coaches eLearning Training Course). The intervention group will complete the post-test survey after the full training including both the course summary and the detailed course modules (the full training).\n\nThe investigators will compare the two groups to see if an exposure to the (Full) MAP for Coaches eLearning Training Course improves study outcomes compared with the control group."
