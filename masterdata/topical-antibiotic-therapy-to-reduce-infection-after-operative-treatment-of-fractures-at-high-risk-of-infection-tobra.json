These sensitivity analyses will consider the following alternative end points of deep SSI: infection by gram-negative bacteria, infection by gram-positive bacteria, polymicrobial pathogenic infections, culture negative infections, and cellulitis/skin infections.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To compare the safety of treatment with a combination of local Vancomycin and Tobramycin versus Vancomycin powder alone as measured by the proportion of antibiotic resistance in each arm."
