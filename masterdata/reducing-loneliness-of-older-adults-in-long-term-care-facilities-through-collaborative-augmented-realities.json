            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the use of head-mounted display (HMD) augmented reality (AR) in older adults residing in long term care communities. The main questions it aims to answer are: what is the feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction of HMD AR vs two-dimensional audio-video communication? Older adults and their designated family member will complete HMD AR activities in 8 session visits over 4 weeks. Researchers will compare HMD AR to 2-D audio-visual (AV) comparison group on feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction with the interactive communication technology.",
            "detailedDescription": "For both interventions, the bandwidth within the family members' homes will be measured and a hotspot created if necessary to facilitate data streaming. For each session, a trained research assistant (RA) will be physically present at the Long-term Care (LTC) to troubleshoot for technological issues. The RA will observe the staff member establish the Interactive Communication technology (ICT) connection between the older adult and family member, assisting as needed. The RA and staff member will remain within the room; the RA will monitor for technological issues. The staff member will monitor the older adults' reactions.\n\nHMD-AR Intervention Experimental Setup. For the older adults, equipment set-up will be in a dedicated room at the LTC that allows for environmental overlays. Equipment includes two Kinect cameras, one HMD and one E4 wrist sensor that the older adult will wear to measure stress through physiological sensing. The family member will be consulted for placement of the 2 Kinect cameras in their home.\n\nAR Activities. At least one meal session and one activity session will be conducted. The remaining sessions will consist of activities based on the preference of the older adult-family member. Staff will be trained to turn on the headset, computers, and ensure communication connection between the older adult and family member.\n\n2D Audio-visual Intervention The 2D audio-visual sessions will take place in a dedicated room at the LTC. Staff will initiate the connection between the older adult and family member. In the unlikely event a family member does not have a device for the 2D audio-visual visits, a computer tablet will be supplied for use during the study."
