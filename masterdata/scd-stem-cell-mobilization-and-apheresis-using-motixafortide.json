Investigators also want to see if the drug will help the body increase the number of stem cells that can be collected for possible future transplant use.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE\n\n* To characterize the safety and tolerability of motixafortide in participants with SCD as determined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n\n* To characterize the efficacy of a single dose (Part A) or two doses (Part B) of motixafortide for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization and apheresis collection in participants with SCD as determined by the yield of CD34+ cells (CD34+ cells/kg).\n* To measure the mobilization effects of single-day (Part A) or daily dosing (Part B) dosing with motixafortide in the peripheral blood in participants with SCD as determined by peak peripheral blood CD34+ counts\n* To recommend a phase 2 dosing strategy based on safety, efficacy, and mobilization effects",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is divided into 2 parts. Participants will be assigned to a part based on when they enroll. Early in the study, participants will be assigned to part A. Later in the study, participants will be assigned to part B. In both parts, participants will receive the study drug, motixafortide, by an injection under the skin. About 8 hours after the injection, stem cells will be collected. Participants will follow-up within 7-10 days after the study drug and stem cell collection. Study staff will contact participants about 30 days after the last drug dose administration."
