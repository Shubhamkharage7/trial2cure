            "detailedDescription": "The study will be a single-center, investigator-initiated protocol to assess the reliability of the Kinect Motion Analysis 2.0 Motion Tracking System for Range Of Motion (ROM) assessment in patients with Shoulder Adhesive Capsulitis undergoing ultrasound guided capsular distention procedures (standard of care for adhesive capsulitis). Secondarily, the study will describe the relationship between range of motion of the shoulder girdle in the four quadrants of normalized reachable workspace by the Kinect 2.0, PROMIS person-reported outcome scores for pain, pain interference and function (general mobility and upper extremity function), and VAS pain scores.\n\nStudy participants are anticipated to remain in the study for 12 weeks: an initial visit followed by 6- and 12-week follow up visits. Given the nature of scheduling appointments in medical clinics, 12 weeks is an approximation; the actual duration may occasionally be 1-2 weeks longer if needed to successfully complete the follow-up visit.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that, for shoulder adhesive capsulitis, the Kinect Motion Analysis 2.0 system will provide reliable results in a shorter and more efficient amount of time in comparison to traditional goniometer methods."
