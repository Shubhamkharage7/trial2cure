            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of systemic therapy on cognition in older breast cancer patients, explore change in APE, LM and Cognition domains, measure associations between cognitive decline and QOL, and describe how genetic polymorphisms, inflammatory biomarkers, sleep and physical measures moderate cognitive outcomes. This study is being done nationally, with recruiting sites at Georgetown University, Montgomery General Hospital, Virginia Cancer Specialists, Washington Hospital Center, Reston Breast Care Specialists, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Moffitt Cancer Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Indiana University and University of California, Los Angeles.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cancer is the leading cause of death in the US and breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in our country. Older women (women 60 and older) presently account for nearly half of all new cases of breast cancer. With the \"graying of America\" and advances in treatment for breast cancer, the absolute number of older women undergoing breast cancer treatment and surviving their disease will almost double by the year 2030. Systemic hormonal and non-hormonal chemotherapy is credited with improvements in survival, and rates of use of these modalities have increased substantially over the past two decades. Preliminary work has found that older women are interested in chemotherapy even for small returns in survival extension. However, cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in most studies of breast cancer systemic treatments, but virtually all of this research has been conducted in younger populations. Since aging itself is associated with cognitive declines, it seems very likely that older women are particularly vulnerable to the adverse cognitive effects of systemic therapy; our preliminary work strongly suggests that this is the case, but this has never been empirically tested.\n\nThis study will be the first large-scale, prospective, controlled investigation to evaluate cognitive changes in older cancer patients and it will provide the basis for the next generation of mechanistic, treatment and intervention studies. These will be important since data from younger patients cannot be directly translated into the older population. Investigators will use the vulnerability model of cancer survivorship to prospectively describe the magnitude of systemic therapy effects on cognition in older (age \\>60 years) breast cancer patients over a 60 month period, explore change in APE, LM and Cognition domains, test associations between cognition and quality of life (QOL), and evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms, inflammatory biomarkers, sleep and physical measures moderate cognitive outcomes.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of oncologists, geriatricians, neurologists, neuro- and cognitive psychologists, behavioral scientists and consumers from Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), Moffitt Cancer Center, City of Hope National Medical Center (COH), Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC), Indiana University (IU), Boston University (BU), University of California (UCLA), University of South Florida (USF) and their satellites, will work together to prospectively enroll 850 newly diagnosed older breast cancer cases from LCCC, MSKCC, Moffitt, COH, HUMC, IU and tertiary referral centers with high volumes. An equal number of non-cancer friend controls will be recruited. Friend controls were chosen since they will be similar to patients in most ways except for exposure to cancer and its treatments and they should be motivated to participate. If friends are not available, controls matched to cases on age, education, race, and area (DC/NY/FL/CA/NJ/IU) will be recruited from the community.\n\nInvestigators will administer baseline neuropsychological testing prior to any systemic treatment (or at enrollment for controls), survey women about subjective cognitive function, sleep, psychosocial factors, QOL and activities of daily living (IADLS). Subjects will take part in physical measurements, including grip strength, sit to stand and walk speed tests. Investigators will abstract clinical data from medical records. Investigators will obtain blood or saliva to test for APOE, COMT and other genetic polymorphisms at enrollment; these results will not be provided to participants since this is considered a research test). Subjects have the option to provide blood for biomarker research and for biobanking. Subjects will also provide one week of sleep monitoring. Subjects at IU will have the option to participate in neuroimaging. Investigators conduct follow-up interviews and repeat the neuropsychological testing, physical measures, blood/saliva collection, sleep monitoring and optional neuroimaging 12 months after baseline assessment; this time point corresponds to 3-6 months post-treatment among women who receive chemotherapy. Our primary cognitive outcome will be change in summary score on tests in the Attention, Processing Speed, and Executive Function domain, Learning and Memory domain, and Subjective Cognition domain. In secondary analyses, investigators examine changes in scores on additional domains to assess broader cognitive function and examine questions of differential impact.\n\nData from this study will guide future interventions to better select older women for whom the benefits of systemic therapy outweigh the harms and to develop approaches to mitigate negative consequences of systemic treatment when it is indicated, improving the quality of care for the growing population of older breast cancer patients."
