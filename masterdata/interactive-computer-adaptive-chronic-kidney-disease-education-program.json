            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to evaluate a culturally tailored computerized education program in hospitalized African-American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main question it aims to answer are: does computerized adaptive education (CAE) increase patients' knowledge about CKD self-care and renal replacement therapy (RRT) options compared to usual care (UC) and will CAE will be increase patients' intent to participate in CKD self-care and RRT preparation compared to UC",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to evaluate a culturally tailored adaptive computerized education program in hospitalized African-American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The investigator's first hypothesis is that computerized adaptive education (CAE) will be more effective than standard of care in improving knowledge about self-care for advanced CKD and renal replacement therapy (RRT) options (Primary Outcome). The primary outcome is knowledge about CKD and knowledge about RRT. The study team will measure this using the Kidney Disease Knowledge Survey (KiKs). The investigator's second hypothesis is that CAE will increase patients' intent to participate in CKD self-care (to take diabetes and/or hypertension meds, see a nephrologist, and make additional lifestyle changes like smoking cessation, exercise, low-salt diet) compared to standard of care. The study team will measure this using an investigator-developed Health Intent Survey and measure patient activation through the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Similarly, the investigator hypothesizes that CAE will increase patients' intent to obtain non-catheter access prior to dialysis initiation, to initiate self-care dialysis (peritoneal (PD) or home hemodialysis (HHD), and/or have transplant evaluation compared to standard of care. The study team will measure this using an investigator-developed Health Intent Survey. The investigator's final hypothesis is that CAE will increase patients' action at 30 days post-discharge in participating in CKD self-care and CKD health-seeking behavior compared to standard of care controls."
