The target population represents participants who have tremor that is not adequately controlled by PD medications and that interferes with their activities of daily living (ADL) and/or with their performance of tasks.",

The maximum total duration of the study for each participant will be 23 weeks, with a maximum treatment duration of 17 weeks. For each participant, the study consists of a Screening Period (up to 4 weeks), a 5-week Dose Titration and Optimization Period, a 12-week Maintenance Period, and a 2-week Safety Follow-up Period."

Note: Use of botulinum toxin for other reasons (eg, cosmetic, excessive salivation, dystonia) is permitted as long as the location of use is anatomically distinct from the region with tremor.\n* Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs or other products (eg, St. John's Wort) known to be inducers of cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4) (cause \\> 30% reduction of sensitive substrates area under the plasma concentration-time curve \\[AUC\\]), which cannot be discontinued at least 4 weeks before baseline, or planned use at any time during the study.\n* Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs or other products (eg, grapefruit) known to be strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, which cannot be discontinued 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before baseline, or planned use at any time during the study.\n* Use of proton pump inhibitors, which cannot be discontinued at least 2 weeks before baseline, or planned use at any time during the study. (Occasional use of antacids or histamine receptor type 2 \\[H2\\] receptor antagonists will be permitted, but antacids should be taken at least 4 hours apart from study intervention; H2 receptor antagonists should be taken at least 4 hours after and/or 12 hours before study intervention).\n\nDiagnostic Assessments\n\n* Known use of recreational drugs, inclusive of the following: phencyclidine, cocaine, opioids, barbiturates, amphetamines, or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine \\[ecstasy\\].\n* Opioid use at stable doses, either regularly or PRN, for pain management, as prescribed, is permitted.
