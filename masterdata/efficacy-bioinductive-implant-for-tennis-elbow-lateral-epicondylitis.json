A bioinductive patch is an implant that may foster tendon regrowth and healing following surgery. Patients will be randomize into one of two groups: control and investigational. Patients in the \"control group\" will receive the normal surgery for patients who do not respond to physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and anti-inflammatory treatment. Patients in the \"experimental group\" will receive the same surgical treatment, with the addition of the bioinductive patch. This patch will be implanted during surgery. Then, using a combination of ultrasound studies and other measures, the investigators will assess how well the patch works compared to surgery alone.",

Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: control and investigational. All surgical patients will have failed non surgery options for 6 months (physical therapy, lifestyle changes, anti-inflammatories, injections) Patients in the \"control group\" will receive the standard surgery (open lateral epicondylectomy) . Patients in the \"experimental group\" will receive the same surgical treatment, with the addition of the bioinductive patch. This patch will be implanted during surgery.
