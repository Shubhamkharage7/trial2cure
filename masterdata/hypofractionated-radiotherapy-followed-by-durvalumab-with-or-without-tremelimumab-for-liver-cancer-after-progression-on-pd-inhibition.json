            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well standard of care hypofractionated radiation therapy followed by durvalumab with or without tremelimumab works in treating patients with hepatocellular cancer (liver cancer) that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and that is growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressing) after treatment with PD-1 inhibitor immunotherapy. In some patients, cancer cells and immune cells start to express signals that stop the body's immune system from killing the cancer. New drugs being developed, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, are designed to target and block these signals and may help increase the immune response to prevent or slow down cancer growth. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may help the immune system work even better. Giving durvalumab with or without tremelimumab after radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with liver cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine objective response rate (ORR) of durvalumab (D) and D + tremelimumab (T) after radiation therapy (RT) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with progression on prior PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety of D and D + T in advanced HCC patients with progression on prior PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n\nII. Determine the efficacy of D and D + T in advanced HCC patients with progression on prior PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Profile peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) immune cells and plasma samples before RT, after RT, and during D or D + T immunotherapy.\n\nII. Explore relationship between plasma biomarkers and PBMC immune profiles, the proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs), (safety endpoint), and clinical outcomes (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS).\n\nIII. Profile immune cells in archival pre-treatment tumor tissue for all patients and on-/post-treatment tumor samples and/or non-tumor liver tissue samples when available, and explore for relationship with safety/tolerability and clinical outcomes.\n\nIV. Determine incidence of tumor PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in pre-treatment archival tumor samples in all patients, and in on-/post-treatment tumor samples if repeat tumor sampling is obtained for clinical indications.\n\nV. Explore relationship between tumor PD-L1 status and clinical outcomes. VI. Explore relationship between viral hepatitis status, viral load, safety/tolerability, and clinical outcomes.\n\nVII. Measure tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response to immunotherapy plus RT and explore for relationship with clinical outcomes.\n\nVIII. Explore relationship between site of RT (liver, bone, other soft tissue), number of RT sites (1 or \\> 1), safety/tolerability, clinical outcomes, and changes in immune cell profiles on treatment.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo standard of care hypofractionated RT over 5 fractions once daily (QD) for 5 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 3-10 days after completion of RT, patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nThis arm will close after the 6th participant is enrolled.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo standard of care hypofractionated RT over 5 fractions QD for 5 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 3-10 days after completion of RT, patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment with durvalumab repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who complete the first dose of tremelimumab and demonstrate clinical benefit based upon radiographic tumor regression and/or other clinical response without progression for at least 6 cycles or 6 months on treatment, whichever is shorter, and subsequently have evidence of progressive disease during the durvalumab monotherapy portion may receive a repeat dose of tremelimumab at the next scheduled cycle of treatment with durvalumab per physician discretion.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months."

Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease \\[e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease\\], diverticulitis \\[with the exception of diverticulosis\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome \\[granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.\\]). The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    * Patients with vitiligo or alopecia\n    * Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement\n    * Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy\n    * Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone\n    * Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation with the study physician\n11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent\n12. History of another primary malignancy except for:\n\n    * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease \\>= 2 years before the first dose of investigational product (IP) and of low potential risk for recurrence\n    * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\n    * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease\n13. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n14. History of active primary immunodeficiency.\n15. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis (TB) testing in line with local practice).\n16. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n17. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab/tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\n    * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent\n    * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., computed tomography \\[CT\\] scan premedication)\n18. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to 30 days after the last dose of IP.\n19. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening through the duration of study participation and for at least 6 months after receiving combination of durvalumab plus tremelimumab and 3 months after last dose of durvalumab.\n20. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to IP, any of the study drugs, or any of the study drug excipients.\n21. Prior randomization or treatment in a previous durvalumab and/or tremelimumab clinical study regardless of treatment arm assignment.\n22. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).\n23. Any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject unsuitable for trial participation.",
