There are also new ways to use image-guided biopsy and therapy. These could help manage prostate cancer. Researchers want to study how imaging can provide a profile of prostate cancer. They want to collect data to make diagnosis and treatments better.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo gather data about the radiological and clinical course of prostate cancer. To study imaging-based biomarkers of prostate cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nMen ages 18 and older with diagnosed or suspected prostate cancer\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will give permission for researchers to use their medical history and records. Their data will be reviewed, collected, and analyzed. These include results of their tests and scans.\n\nSponsoring Institution: National Cancer Institute",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become an established method for localizing clinically significant prostate cancer, and identification of imaging-based prognostic markers represents an active research area.\n* Multiple treatments are available for patients with localized prostate cancer, including radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and focal ablation; however, therapy-specific indication and imaging-based response biomarkers are poorly understood.\n* As mpMRI is considered a standard of care , there is no patient consent for research related to imaging biomarkers and their correlation with other clinical and pathologic features.\n* Translation of imaging, clinical, and pathological-based features into treatment decisions has yet to be fully characterized for development of a decision-support system.\n* Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to enable the collection of data to enable research in the development of computer aided diagnosis, decision support and deep learning/artificial intelligence research.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To evaluate radiological profiling of patients with prostate cancer in support of the Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB) for identification of imaging-based prognostic markers in prostate cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients with an increased risk for prostate cancer, with a diagnosis of prostatic cancer or suspicious for prostatic cancer lesions.\n* Age \\> 18 years.\n\nDesign:\n\n-Imaging evaluation and clinical profiling of patients with an increased risk of prostate cancer, with prostate cancer or suspected of prostate cancer (obtained during visits to NIH or from external providers) will be collected over the course of at least 5 years and analyzed."
