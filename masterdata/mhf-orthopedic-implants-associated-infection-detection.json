The acquired images will be processed and viewed on a MIMVista or similar workstation. The uptake pattern of \\[F-18\\]MHF around infected orthopedic knee implant will be determined and compared with its uptake pattern around non-infected knee implants.\n\nThis study will look at how \\[18F\\]MHF goes into normal knee replacements and those with suspected infection.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a study that will test a compound (chemical substance) that has a small amount of radioactivity attached to it. This substance has a natural tendency to go to bacterial infections. The substance is called \\[18F\\]MHF and it is given in the form of an injection into a vein. After the substance reaches the infected body region, scans called PET or Positron Emission Tomography, are done. This is similar to having CAT scans or x-rays. Usually a compound called \\[18\\]FDG is used for PET scans to detect bacterial infections but this substance can't distinguish between bacterial infections and inflammation. This substance called \\[18F\\]MHF does not go to inflamed tissue and may allow bacterial infections to be seen better.\n\nThis study will look at how \\[18F\\]MHF goes into normal knee replacements and those with suspected infection. This will hopefully lead to the development of better imaging techniques to look at bacterial infections. \\[18F\\]MHF is approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for research."
