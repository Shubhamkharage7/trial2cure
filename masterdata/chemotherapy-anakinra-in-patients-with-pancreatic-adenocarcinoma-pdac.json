            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, single-arm, prospective phase II study conducted by Baylor Scott and White Research Institute in Dallas.\n\nThe study will enroll patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma that are planned to receive pre-operative chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and post operative treatment. Local surgical/biopsy and pathology reports will constitute adequate documentation of histology/cytology for study inclusion.\n\nPatients will receive pre- and post-operative chemotherapy plus Anakinra. Specifically, the pre-operative chemotherapy regimen will be a combination of Nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin, while post-operative chemotherapy will use 5-Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Patients will also receive growth factor (Neupogen followed by Neulasta) for safety and to ensure that treatment is not delayed due to neutropenic effects of chemotherapy.\n\nAnakinra will be self-administered by the participants through out the treatment period. A treatment break of 2 days will be given prior to the surgery day."
