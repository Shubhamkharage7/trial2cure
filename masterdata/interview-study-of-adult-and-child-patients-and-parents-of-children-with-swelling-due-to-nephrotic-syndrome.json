Interviews with patients (child and adult) and parents of young children will be conducted. The information collected from the interviews will be used to develop a survey to use when testing new medications for Nephrotic Syndrome.\n\nPlease consider participating in a 1-hour long interview with the Prepare-NS research study to discuss children and adults experiences with swelling.",

The measures to be developed include an Observer Reported Outcome (ObsRO) and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO). The ObsRO and PRO substudies are Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved at release.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to produce core outcome sets of patient-rated and observer reported Fluid Overload (edema) measures that can be applied across the fluid overload severity continuum, fit to help drug development in this area."
