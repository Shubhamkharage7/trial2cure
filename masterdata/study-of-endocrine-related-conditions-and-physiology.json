            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nEndocrine disorders involve changes to glands that produce hormones. Hormones are released by these glands into the blood so they can direct the function of other tissues in the body. Researchers want to study people who may have endocrine disorders. They want to learn more about the conditions that affect endocrine glands.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study adults with a variety of endocrine disorders for research and physician education.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older who have an endocrine or metabolic-related disorder\n\nHealthy volunteers 18 and older\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a review of their medical records.\n\nParticipants will have a physical exam and medical history.\n\nThe length of the study and the schedule will vary by participant. Tests may include:\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nStool and saliva samples\n\nImaging studies: Participants will lie on a table while a machine takes pictures of the body. They may be injected with a substance to make their organs more visible in the pictures.\n\nTests of endocrine tissue function\n\nConsultation with other specialists\n\nSleep study\n\nMedical photographs\n\nParticipants may be treated for their endocrine disorder. This could include:\n\nSurgery. If tissue is removed during surgery, it may be studied.\n\nRadiation\n\nMedicine\n\nParticipants may have genetic testing. This will be done with a small amount of blood, cells from a cheek swab, or saliva.\n\nSponsoring Institution: National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes and Kidney Disease",
            "detailedDescription": "This protocol is designed to allow inpatient and outpatient evaluation of adults with a variety of\n\nendocrine disorders for purposes of research and physician education in our accredited internal medicine endocrinology training programs. Participants will receive clinical care per standard of practice for their condition. Data collected from standard clinical practice will be retained for future research. The research-directed evaluations may include collection and retention for future use of blood, feces, saliva, or urine samples or evaluation of tissue that was routinely collected for clinical care. In some patients with endocrine disorders, laboratory or radiological studies will be performed to confirm a diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient, using standard approaches in current clinical practice. In some cases, the patient will receive medical, radiation or surgical treatment for their disorder."
