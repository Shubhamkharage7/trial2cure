The overall goal of this study is to refine and test the NSAT as a systematic approach to provide individualized nutrition needs screening and referral for patients being discharged from the acute care setting at Jefferson Health. The investigators hypothesize the NSAT will be successful in identifying individualized nutrition referrals that are deemed acceptable and appropriate by enrolled participants."
