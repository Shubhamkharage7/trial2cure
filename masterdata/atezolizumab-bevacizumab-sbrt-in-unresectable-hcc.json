            "briefSummary": "This research study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the drugs atezolizumab and bevacizumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nThis study involves the following interventions:\n\n* Atezolizumab\n* Bevacizumab\n* Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm phase 1B study designed to evaluate the combination of Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT for treating and limiting the recurrence of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved atezolizumab and bevacizumab for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The FDA has not approved the combination of radiation therapy, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab.\n\nAtezolizumab is believed to work by increasing the immune system's response to cancer cells. Bevacizumab is believed to work by inhibiting cancer cells from growing by targeting a specific protein in the cancer cells. Radiation therapy is a standard of care treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Radiation therapy has also been shown to increase the effects of drugs like atezolizumab and bevacizumab.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will be in this research study for as long as the study drugs are safe and beneficial to them. Participants will then be followed for up to 5 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 20-32 people will take part in this research study.\n\nGenentech, a biotechnology company, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the study, including the study drugs."

Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist.) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n* History of severe anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the Atezolizumab or Bevacizumab formulation.\n* Patients with untreated or incompletely treated varices with bleeding or high risk for bleeding. Patients must undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and all size of varices (small to large) must be assessed and treated per local standard of care prior to study registration. Patients who have undergone an EGD within 6 months prior to initiation of study treatment do not need to repeat the procedure.\n* Moderate or severe ascites.\n* Evidence of abdominal free air that is not explained by paracentesis or recent surgical procedure.\n* Serious, non-healing or dehiscing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.\n* History of hepatic encephalopathy.\n* Active co-infection of HBV and HCV. Participants with a history of HCV infection but who are negative for HCV RNA by PCR will be considered non-infected with HCV.\n* Known history of HIV infection.\n* Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Asymptomatic patients with CNS metastases newly detected at screening are eligible for the study after receiving radiotherapy or surgery, with no need to repeat the screening brain scan. Asymptomatic patients with treated CNS lesions are eligible, provided that all of the following criteria are met:\n\n  * Measurable disease, per RECIST v1.1, must be present outside the CNS.\n  * Participant has no history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage.\n  * Metastases are limited to the cerebellum or the supratentorial region (i.e. no metastases to the midbrain, pons, medulla, or spinal cord).\n  * No evidence of interim progression between completion of CNS-directed therapy and initiation of study treatment.\n  * Participant has not undergone stereotactic radiotherapy within 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment, whole-brain radiotherapy within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment, neurosurgical resection within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* Current or recent (within 10 days of first dose of study treatment) use of aspirin (\\>325 mg/day) or treatment with dipyramidole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and cilostazol.\n* Chronic daily treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the exception of daily Aspirin 81 mg. Occasional use of NSAIDs for the symptomatic relief of medical conditions such as headache or fever is allowed.\n* Uncontrolled tumor-related pain. Participants requiring pain medication must be on a stable regimen at study entry.\n\n  * Symptomatic lesions (e.g. bone metastases or metastases causing nerve impingement amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be treated prior to enrollment. Patients should be recovered from the effects of radiation. There is no required minimum recovery period.)\n  * Asymptomatic metastatic lesions that would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain with further growth (e.g. epidural metastasis that is not currently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to enrollment.\n* Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently). Participants with indwelling catheters (e.g. PleurX\u00ae) are allowed.\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium \\>1.5 mmol/L, calcium \\>12 mg/dL, or corrected serum calcium \\> ULN)\n* Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 \\[IL-2\\]) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Participants who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g. 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study.\n  * Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g. fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n* Inadequately controlled arterial hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) \u2265150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg), based on an average of \u2265 3 BP readings on \u2265 2 sessions. Anti-hypertensive therapy to achieve these parameters is allowable.\n* Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.",
