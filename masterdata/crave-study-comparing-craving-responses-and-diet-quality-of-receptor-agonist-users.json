            "briefSummary": "This study aims to assess the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists, semaglutide and tirzepatide, on food cravings and diet quality in individuals with overweight or obesity. Over 24 weeks, up to 150 adult participants will be monitored using questionnaires and dietary records at 0, 12, and 24 weeks to measure changes in diet quality, disordered eating, food cravings, and hunger. This research, conducted with Seen Medical Group at Knownwell Health Clinic, seeks to fill the gap in literature on the dietary quality effects of GLP-1RAs.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to evaluate the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) medications, specifically semaglutide and tirzepatide, on food cravings and diet quality among individuals diagnosed with overweight and obesity. Participants will be recruited through Knownwell Health clinical staff, who will refer eligible patients to the UCD research team for further information and screening.\n\nAt Knownwell Clinic, standard care for patients on GLP-1RA medications includes blood draws, blood pressure evaluations, body composition analysis (Seca), and indirect calorimetry testing. These procedures will be conducted at baseline (week 0), midpoint (weeks 8-12), and end of titration/max dose (week 24).\n\nParticipants will complete a series of virtual questionnaires on nutrition, eating habits, and diet quality, along with a 3-day food diary. Regular medical appointments will follow Knownwell Clinic's standards of care. Participants must procure their own GLP-1RA medication. This study adds questionnaires to assess: dietary quality (photo-based food records), hunger (hunger VAS survey) and food cravings (FCI-II) related to GLP-1RA use."
