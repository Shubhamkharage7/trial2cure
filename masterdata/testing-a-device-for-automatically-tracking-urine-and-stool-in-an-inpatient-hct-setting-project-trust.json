The device includes components that can be outfitted onto existing toilets.\n\nIn this study, participants hospital room will be outfitted with the prototype toilet device. Participants will use the toilet as usual throughout the duration of their inpatient stay. Sometimes output will be measured by the device, and other times output will be measured manually by nurses."
