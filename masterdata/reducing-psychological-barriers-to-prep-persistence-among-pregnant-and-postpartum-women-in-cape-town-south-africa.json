            "briefSummary": "Pregnant women in South Africa (SA) are at high risk of HIV acquisition. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use during pregnancy is both safe and effective in preventing HIV. However, posttraumatic stress (associated with intimate partner violence and/or other traumas) and depression negatively impact PrEP adherence among women in SA. Addressing posttraumatic stress and depression will likely improve PrEP adherence and persistence (i.e., sustained PrEP adherence over time) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which are periods of dramatically increased HIV risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive behavioral intervention that targets common underlying factors of posttraumatic stress and depression to improve PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and the postpartum transition. The specific aims of the project are to (1) explore the mechanisms by which posttraumatic stress and depression impact PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy via qualitative interviews; (2) develop a brief PrEP adherence and persistence intervention (\\~4 sessions) that reduces the negative impact of psychological mechanisms common to posttraumatic stress and depression on PrEP use, and builds behavioral skills to improve self-care; and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and signals of preliminary efficacy of the intervention, which will be integrated into antenatal care, in a pilot randomized controlled trial. All data will be collected in the Midwife Obstetrics Unit (MOU) in Gugulethu, a peri-urban settlement and former township community outside of Cape Town, SA."

These sessions will likely target two pathways to PrEP adherence and persistence: (1) decreased withdrawal and avoidance and (2) behavioral skill building to increase self-care/health behaviors. To decrease withdrawal and avoidance, we will likely include CBT-based exercises that improve distress tolerance and coping. To help participants build new behavioral skills, we will likely incorporate behavioral activation and problem-solving. Behavioral activation is a CBT strategy that promotes scheduling activities that align with an individual's values, which will also break maladaptive patterns of withdrawal and avoidance. Problem-solving is an empirically-supported treatment for depression; training patients to problem-solve adaptively will help them \"approach\" PrEP use by navigating barriers.",
