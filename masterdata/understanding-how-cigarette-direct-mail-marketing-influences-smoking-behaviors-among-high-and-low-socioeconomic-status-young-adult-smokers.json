            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nSmoking is a major public health problem in the U.S. Almost a half a million Americans die from it in a year. One thing that contributes to why people smoke is the marketing of cigarettes. Cigarette direct mail marketing usually targets young smokers of lower socioeconomic status. Researchers want to find out more about how this kind of marketing influences smoking behavior in young people from different socioeconomic levels.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo study the effects of cigarette direct mail marketing on beliefs, responses, and arousal. To study how these things may differ among young adult smokers of high and low socioeconomic status.\n\nEligibility:\n\nVolunteer adults ages 18 to 29 who smoke.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 1 visit.\n\nParticipants will be asked questions about their health and recent smoking.\n\nA nurse will check their vital signs.\n\nParticipants will have a simple eye exam.\n\nThey will give blood and urine samples.\n\nParticipants will be connected to equipment. This will collect data while they look at pictures.\n\nThen they will have a 10-minute break. A nurse will observe them during the break.\n\nParticipants will have their breath analyzed.\n\nParticipants will answer questions. The topics will include:\n\nEducation\n\nJob\n\nIncome\n\nFamily history\n\nTobacco use\n\nExposure to pro-smoking and anti-smoking messages\n\nHistory of drug and alcohol use",
            "detailedDescription": "Smoking remains a public health problem in the US, and cigarette marketing has been concluded as one of the causal factors for the epidemic. Previous studies on cigarette direct mail marketing yielded a limited data on mechanisms influencing smoking behavior. Therefore, there is a need for a study that would provide a stronger evidence on how direct mail marketing influences smoking behavior. The proposed study will consist of two parts where pilot data are to be collected in Part 1, and further data are to be collected in Part 2 conducted as a randomized comparative trial. Up to a total of 530 volunteers ages 18-29 are to be recruited for the study. After meeting the eligibility and enrolling onto the study, participants will have their biospecimens collected followed by an experiment in which they are to be shown images on the computer. Study participants will then take a break and afterwards will provide additional sociodemographic and psychosocial information through an audio computer assisted self-administered interview."

Two groups are chosen based on their social determinants and prevalence of smoking.\n\n  1. Low SES: Young adults who do not have a four-year college degree, are not currently enrolled in a four-year college, were born in the US, and have an annual income less than $50,000. This is the group that has been shown to have the highest prevalence of smoking.\n  2. High SES: Young adults who are currently enrolled in or graduated from a four year college. This is the group that has been shown to have the lowest prevalence of smoking.\n* English proficiency: since study materials are available only in English, only participants who are able to understand English and follow instructions in English are to be enrolled.\n* Cognitive ability: Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.\n* General health: Participants need to be generally healthy, as defined as someone with no known significant health problems. Participants can have chronic health conditions if the condition is well managed.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Inability, in the judgment of the investigator, to understand and follow the requirements of the protocol.\n* Currently enrolled in high school.\n* Participants with eye conditions that restrict their ability to track an object with their eyes.\n* Participants with myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism who cannot pass a simple vision test even with corrective lenses.\n* Participants with medical condition(s) that may be triggered by infrared radiation (e.g., epilepsy).\n* Self-reported use of alcohol, recreational drugs or prescription medications used for recreational purposes (e. g. amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, ketamines, LSD, opiates and opioids, tranquilizers or opioid analgesics) that may influence their judgement at the time of study in the past 12 hours before the study visit.\n* Participants who cannot see an object located between 15 to 27 inches away from them (the required distance between the computer screen and the participants for accurate eye-tracking), even with corrective contact lenses.",
