The investigators also want to know employment helps with other aspects of the Veteran's life including starting and staying on necessary medications, mental health needs, and feeling a part of society.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the employment outcomes of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) compared to Treatment-as-Usual Vocational Rehabilitation (TAU-VR) in 120 Veterans who are recovering from opioid use disorder (OUD) over 15 months. Specifically, the investigators will see which treatment yields more weeks worked in a competitive job with the hypothesis that IPS will result in better outcomes than TAU-VR. The investigators will interview Veterans in both IPS and TAU-VR groups to investigate the contextual barriers and facilitators of implementing vocational services among Veterans with OUD with the aim to provide solutions and leverage facilitators of success as the VHA expands supported employment services to a new priority population. Investigators will evaluate the impact of vocational services on adherence to prescribed treatment and OUD relapse rates. This study is especially timely given the societal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment and occupational functioning."
