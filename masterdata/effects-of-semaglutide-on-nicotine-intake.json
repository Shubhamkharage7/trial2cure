            "briefSummary": "Tobacco use remains the foremost cause of preventable deaths in the U.S. and worldwide. Advancing new smoking cessation therapies, including those targeting novel biological mechanisms, is a critical public health priority. Accumulating evidence from preclinical studies suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce intake and/or reinstatement of addictive drugs, including nicotine. However, translational work is necessary to establish whether GLP-1 receptor agonists alter aspects of nicotine response and smoking behavior in smokers. Human laboratory studies play a pivotal role in drug development by providing a time- and cost-efficient means of validating preclinical findings, also providing an ideal platform for studying mechanisms of medication effects. This is an experimental investigation to examine the effects of an approved GLP-1 receptor agonist on nicotine intake and reinstatement. Dependent smokers will be enrolled in a double-blind, parallel-arm trial with laboratory endpoints. Laboratory procedures will include a validated procedure for measuring smoking lapse/reinstatement after overnight abstinence. This study will provide initial laboratory evidence for the potential efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists as adjunctive treatments for smoking cessation."
