Child-Pugh score B7 or B8 with a World Health Organisation Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (WHO/ECOG PS) of 0-1 at enrolment, or\n2. Child-Pugh class A with a WHO/ECOG PS of 2 at enrolment, or\n3. Child-Pugh class A with a WHO/ECOG PS of 0-1 and with evidence of chronic main trunk portal vein thrombosis at enrolment\n\nParticipants must not have received any prior systemic therapy for HCC. Participants may have previously received locoregional therapy (LRT) but must no longer be suitable for additional LRT. Any local treatment needs to have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. The study consists of 4 periods: screening (Day-28 to Day -1), Treatment period, safety follow-up and survival follow-up."
