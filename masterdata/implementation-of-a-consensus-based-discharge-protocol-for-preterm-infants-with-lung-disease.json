            "briefSummary": "The researchers have worked to create consensus recommendations among national efforts to help with the transition and coordination of care for preterm infants with lung disease around discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit to home. This study looks to evaluate implementation of the recommendations at Boston Children's Hospital and referring NICU's (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women's Hospital). Specifically, the research team will be looking at follow-up rates, healthcare utilization, and parental satisfaction/feedback with implementation of these guidelines.",
            "detailedDescription": "Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have complex care needs around discharge. BPD affects up to 40% of former preterm infants born at \\<28 weeks gestation, with about 10,000 new cases of BPD in the United States every year. Healthcare utilization in this population in the first two years of life is high, with increased hospitalizations, visits, and medication usage. Coordinated follow-up programs may help improve outcomes and reduce rates of hospitalization in this population. However, guidelines do not exist to identify which infants discharging from the NICU should be targeted for specialty follow-up for their respiratory disease, the time frame and format that this should occur, and which evaluations should be performed routinely around discharge.\n\nThis will be an implementation study, measuring outcomes 3 months prior and 3 months after enactment of a discharge bundle for preterm infants with BPD at local NICUs (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) who will be followed by Boston Children's Hospital."
