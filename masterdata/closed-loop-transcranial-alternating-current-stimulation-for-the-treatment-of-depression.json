We will recruit up to 35 participants with unipolar, non-psychotic MDD. Participation will include seven visits, two of them remotely (with an in-person option as needed), and one electronic survey.\n\nPotential participants fill-in an electronic pre-screening form. If potentially eligible, a remote screening visit is performed. If eligible, participants attend five consecutive, daily stimulation sessions. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline (Day 1 of stimulation, D1), Day five of stimulation (D5), and at their follow-up visit (14 days after the completion of stimulation, FU2) using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17).\n\nFor a subset of patients, electroencephalography (EEG) is collected at D1 prior to stimulation and after stimulation and again at FU2.\n\nFor a subset of patients, self-scoring surveys will be sent bi-weekly until 12 weeks after treatment."
