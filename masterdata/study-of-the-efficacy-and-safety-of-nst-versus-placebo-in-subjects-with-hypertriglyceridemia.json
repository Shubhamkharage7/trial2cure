A 3-week screening period that includes a TG qualifying period, and\n2. A 28-days, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled treatment period.\n\nSubjects will return to the study site for a follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose.\n\nApproximately 50 subjects will be randomized at approximately 15-30 centres in USA."

Fasting TG levels \u2265500 mg/dL and \u22642000 mg/dL (based on an average \\[arithmetic mean\\] of Visit 1 and Visit 2). Note: In cases in which a subject's average TG level from Visit 1 and Visit 2 falls outside the range for entry into the study, an additional visit (Visit 2a) can be arranged up to 7 days after Visit 2 for an additional measurement of fasting TG levels. If a third sample is collected, entry into the double-blind treatment period will be based on the average of the highest TG value from Visit 1 and 2 and the Visit 2a value. Neither one of the two values used for the arithmetic mean can be less than 400 mg/dL;\n5. If using oral or injectable weight loss drug, subjects must maintain stable dose of all oral and injectable weight loss drugs (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists) for at least 3 months prior to study period.\n6. Willingness to maintain stable diet and physical activity level throughout the study\n7. If a smoker, no plans to change smoking habits during the study period.\n8. Agree to use appropriate contraceptive methods based on biological sex and child-bearing potential as outlined in Section 12.5 of the protocol.\n9. Agree to abstain from sperm or egg donation through 90 or 30 days, respectively, after administration of the last dose of IP.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n1. Body mass index \\>50 kg/m2;\n2.

Subjects at risk of developing pancreatitis (e.g., known cholelithiasis, known alcohol abuse or multiple incidences of acute pancreatitis) per the PI's assessment are excluded. Subjects with a history of acute pancreatitis due to gallstones who have been treated with cholecystectomy are allowed.\n7. History of symptomatic gallstone disease unless treated with cholecystectomy;\n8. History of nephrotic range (\\>3 g/day) proteinuria;\n9. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\< 45 mL/min/1.73 m2\n10. QTcF interval of \\>450ms for males or \\>470 for females\n11. A history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalaemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)\n12.

Known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV);\n20. Positive test for HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B Core Total or hepatitis C antibody at screening (Visit 1 \\[Week -3\\]), except for those who have been successfully treated for hepatitis C infection and have achieved sustained virologic response for \u22651 year and who have a negative reflex HCV RNA test;\n21. Anticipation of major surgery during the screening or double-blind treatment periods of the study;\n22. Treatment with chronic prescription pharmacotherapy for metabolic or CV disease management or risk factor modification (e.g., antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications) that has not been stable for \u226528 days prior to screening (Visit 1 \\[Week -3\\]);\n23.

Unexplained CK concentration \\>5 \u00d7 ULN or CK elevation due to known muscle disease (e.g., polymyositis, mitochondrial dysfunction);\n29. Other recent or current serious disease that may interfere with the conduct of the study (renal, ophthalmic, pulmonary, hepatic, biliary, gastrointestinal, mental disorder, infectious disease, or cancer);\n30. Blood donation of \u22651 pint (0.5 L) within 30 days prior to screening (Visit 1 \\[Week -3\\]), or plasma donation within 7 days prior to screening (Visit 1 \\[Week -3\\]);\n31. History of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse within 1 year of screening. Alcohol abuse is defined as \\>21 standard drinks per week in men and \\>14 standard drinks per week in women, on average;\n32.
