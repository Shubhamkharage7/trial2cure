Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either a placebo or TAF/EVG vaginal insert as well as be randomized (1:1:1) to 3 different tissue sampling time points post-treatment (24hr, 48hr and 72hr after the last dose). Participants will be asked to complete 8 study visits with clinical and behavioral evaluations, and a subset will complete an in-depth interview to assess acceptability of vaginal insert use."
