Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify and compare the effect of collagen protein versus placebo supplementation on indirect markers of musculotendinous unit recovery following eccentric calf exercises.",

Additionally, will consume a daily dose of two 30-g amount of collagen peptides derived from bovine hide (commercially available as Vital Proteins or Peptan) or placebo (30 g of pure maltodextrin with no amino acids) mixed in 300 ml of orange Gatorade zero.\n\nGatorade zero, maltodextrin, and collagen is going to be stored in the locked cabinet in the lab. Research team will mix the supplement (placebo or maltodextrin) with Gatorade zero in a non-clear bottle and will administer it to the participants on-site."
