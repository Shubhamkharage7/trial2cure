The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n- Will StrataMGT be non-inferior regarding patient quality of life compared to standard of care?\n\nParticipants will use either StrataMGT or estrogen vaginal cream to treat GSM for 3 consecutive months. After the baseline assessment, participants will be assessed monthly for quality of life, clinical signs, symptoms, pathology and adverse reactions."
