Control patients will receive an alternative home-based computer program not designed for cognitive remediation but of the same duration.\n\nThe primary outcome will be performance on neuropsychological testing in the intervention sample compared to controls. Secondary outcomes will be the measures of self-efficacy, work productivity, quality of life, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and healthcare utilization. Healthcare utilization variables include annual total cost (current year and prior), number and cost of ER/hospital/outpatient visits, number of hospital visits, hospital length of stay, number preventive visits, total number claims, and number of new medications initiated. In addition, acute changes in neuropsychological testing induced by a bout of physical activity (i.e. self-paced walking during the Six-Minute Walk Test) will be examined, and that pattern of change will be compared between intervention and control groups at each data collection point.\n\nEach subject will participate for a total of 6 months."
