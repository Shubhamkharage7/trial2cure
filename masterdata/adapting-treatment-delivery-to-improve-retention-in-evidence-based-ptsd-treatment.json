However, retention in PTSD EBPs is poor. Premature dropout is associated with worse clinical outcomes and greater healthcare utilization. Delivery of PTSD EBPs in a massed format, typically three or more days per week delivered within a month, have shown promise for increasing retention. The present study is a pilot feasibility and acceptability study comparing massed PTSD treatment to treatment as usual (e.g., typically weekly treatment)."
