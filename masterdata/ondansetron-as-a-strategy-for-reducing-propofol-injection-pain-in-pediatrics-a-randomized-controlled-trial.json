The investigators want to see if in pediatric patients, giving Zofran prior to propofol, reduces the pain that patients often experience when propofol is injected through an IV. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: lidocaine (common standard of care), or Zofran. The investigators hope to show a means of improving pain control in their patients undergoing anesthesia.",
            "detailedDescription": "Propofol is a drug commonly used at the beginning of anesthesia (induction). Patients often experience discomfort when propofol is injected through an IV. Ondansetron (Zofran) is a drug that is commonly used to treat nausea after anesthesia. In adult studies, it has been shown that there is significantly less pain when Zofran is given just before propofol is given. The investigators want to see if giving Zofran prior to propofol reduces the pain and discomfort experienced by pediatric patients.\n\nThis study is a randomized, single-site clinical trial that will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: lidocaine (common standard of care), or Zofran. During induction the treating anesthesiologist will be blinded to the study arm, however they will be unblinded at the end of induction. All subjects will receive Zofran at some point during the surgery - for patients not in the Zofran arm, they will receive it at the end of the case as usual. A blinded observer will score the subject's pain during propofol injection and vital signs will be recorded.\n\nSubjects will be identified by the study team from the surgery schedule. Patients ages 2-17 undergoing surgery with peripheral vascular access (an IV) will be approached. Consent and assent (when appropriate) will be obtained. Subjects will not be compensated. Participation will consist only of the single duration of the surgery.\n\nIn this study the investigators hope to show a means of improving pain control in their patients undergoing anesthesia."
