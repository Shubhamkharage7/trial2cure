The study will address the following objectives:\n\n* Objective 1: Determine if daily consumption of egg fractions differentially alter HDL profiles across age groups.\n* Objective 2: Determine if daily consumption of egg fractions differentially alter immune cell profiles across age groups.\n\nParticipants will be asked to consume egg whites, egg yolks, and whole eggs on a daily basis for 4-weeks each, and avoid eating eggs for a total of 8 weeks at different points in the study. Participants will additionally be provided guidance on following a generally healthy diet, and will be asked to complete surveys about dietary intake and physical activity, as well as provide blood samples throughout the course of the study.\n\nResearchers will compare whether daily consumption of egg whites, egg yolks, and whole eggs differentially alter markers of HDL function and T cell profiles in younger vs. older adults."
