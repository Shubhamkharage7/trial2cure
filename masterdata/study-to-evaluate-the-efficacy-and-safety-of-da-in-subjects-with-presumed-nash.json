Subjects who cannot get an MRI scan.\n9. Subjects who have a history of cirrhosis, a VCTE \u2265 14 kPa, portal hypertension as evidenced by a history of splenomegaly \\> 15 cm, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, varices on imaging/endoscopy or history of variceal bleeding, or a Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score \\> 10.\n10.

Subjects who have a presence of clinically significant cardiac (including Grade III/IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association Criteria \\[Appendix 10.2\\]). This includes subjects with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or stroke within 90 days prior to the first Screening Period visit.\n13. Subjects with a history of acute cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled arrhythmia, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular disease, etc.) within 12 weeks prior to the first Screening Period visit.\n14. Subjects with a history of drug abuse or alcohol addiction within 12 weeks prior to the first Screening Period visit.\n15. Subjects with a positive screen for drugs of abuse (ie, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiate metabolite, and phencyclidine). Subjects who have been prescribed benzodiazepine or opiates for stable chronic medical illness may still qualify for the study at the discretion of the Investigator and review of the Medical Monitor.\n16. Subjects who have physical (severe disorders in liver, heart, kidney, lung, blood, endocrine system, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal system, etc.) or mental (cognitive impairment, mental illness) conditions that may affect the subject's ability to participate in the clinical trial.\n17.
