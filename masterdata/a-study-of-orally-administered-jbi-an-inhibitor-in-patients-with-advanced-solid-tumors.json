Expansion cohorts of participants, treated at the RP2D, with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and other neuroendocrine-derived cancers will be enrolled to obtain additional safety and efficacy data. Starting dose will be 10 mg orally once daily, 4 days on and 3 days off cycle."
