Terlipressin dosing should continue up to 24 h after achievement of an HRS response (either Partial or Full) based on Serum Creatinine (SCr)/AKI stage or up to day 14.\n\nFor those Cohorts where terlipressin will be administered combined with R2R01 (i.e., Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6), the first R2R01 administration will commence immediately following the first terlipressin administration. Like terlipressin treatment, R2R01 dosing should continue up to 24 h after achievement of an HRS response (either Partial or Full) based on SCr/AKI stage or up to day 14.\n\nAll patients in all Cohorts will be followed for up to 90 days after the first dose of study drug.\n\nThis study will be conducted across approximately 25 centers in EU, UK, US, and Canada.\n\nThe screening period will occur within 14 days prior to the first dose administration.\n\nThe treatment duration is up to 14 days with a follow-up period of approximately 76 days.\n\nThe expected total duration of study participation is up to 15 weeks for each subject."

Superimposed acute liver injury induced by drugs, herbal preparation or dietary supplements, with the exception of alcoholic hepatitis.\n12. Estimated life expectancy less than 5 days.\n13. Hypoxia (\\<90%) or worsening respiratory symptoms.\n14. Proteinuria \\> 500 mg/day.\n15. Tubular epithelial casts, heme granular casts.\n16. Haematuria or microhaematuria (more than 50 red blood cells per high power field).\n17. Abnormal renal ultra-sonography unless there is a known chronic structural disease (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy).\n18. Current or recent (within 4 weeks) renal replacement therapy (RRT).\n19. Severe cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases including, but not limited to, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure requiring increasing doses of drug therapy, persisting symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or any other cardiovascular disease judged by the Investigator to be severe.\n20. Transjugular intra-hepatic systemic shunt (TIPS) unless it is known to be non-functioning or occluded.\n21. Ongoing use of vasopressors, unless used for only 48 h before screening; in this case a wash-out period of 8 h before enrollment will be necessary. Patients receiving midodrine and octreotide may be enrolled but treatment must be discontinued prior to enrollment.\n22. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to terlipressin or other component of the study treatment.\n23. Subject is not suitable to participate in the study for any reason (including, but not limited to co-morbidities, history of non-compliance with study visits, procedures, or drug administration) in the opinion of the Investigator.\n24. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or post-menopausal for at least 1 year) are excluded from participation in the study unless they agree to use highly effective contraception.\n25. Males who have no sterilization history and whose female partners have child-bearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the period from the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF) through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. A male patient must agree to immediately inform the Investigator if his partner becomes pregnant during the study.",
