This includes screening, baseline, week 2 stress task, Week 3 2-day imaging paradigm, and clinical safety assessments at weeks 2 and 3.",

Participants will undergo a standardized stress task at week 2, and a standardized 2-day fear learning and extinction protocol at week 3, with functional MRI (fMRI) brain activation accompanying fear extinction recall and fearful faces tasks on the second day."

Patients must be free of concurrent psychotropic medication including those acting on serotonergic pathways, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and psychostimulants, treatments for addictions, and medications that are either strong inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19, substrates of UGT1A9, UGT2B7, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, or substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6, and which have a narrow therapeutic index for at least 4 weeks prior to the initiation of treatment.\n6. Inability to understand study procedures or informed consent process, or significant personality dysfunction likely to interfere with study participation (assessed during the clinical interview) or inability to comply with study procedures (such as planned extended travel) assessed on clinical interview.\n7. Serious current unstable medical illness, or a condition for which hospitalization may be likely within the next year as assessed by medical history and physical exam. If any questions about medical safety emerge with screening procedures, consent will be formally obtained to contact patient's PCP in order to determine whether any medical concerns making participation unsafe or not feasible (such as need for extended inpatient care or medications with concern for significant drug interactions and/or safe utilization of CBD) are present.\n8. Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs or 12 lead ECG at screening. Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis at screening.\n9. Pregnant women (to be ruled out by urine \u00df-HCG) and women of childbearing potential who are not using medically accepted forms of contraception (such as IUD, oral contraceptives, barrier devices, condoms and foam, or implanted progesterone rods stabilized for at least 3 months). Men must also be using at least one medically accepted form of contraception.\n10. Any concurrent psychotherapy initiated within 3 months of baseline, or ongoing psychotherapy of any duration directed specifically toward treatment of SAD. Prohibited psychotherapy includes CBT, DBT, ACT, mindfulness-based approaches or psychodynamic therapy focusing on exploring specific, dynamic causes of the SAD symptomatology and providing management skills. General supportive therapy initiated greater than 3 months prior is acceptable.\n11.

Patients with a history of head trauma causing loss of consciousness, seizure or ongoing cognitive impairment.\n13. Contraindications for MRI including metal implants, surgical clips, probability of metal fragments, or braces that are prohibited due to severe risk of injury.\n14. Left-handed\n15. A prior history of a diagnosis of moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction or current bilirubin \\>=1.5X ULN and/or ALT or AST as 2X ULN, and/or if clinically significant signs and symptoms that are together suggestive of significant hepatic injury (i.e., nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, anorexia, fatigue, jaundice, dark urine).",
