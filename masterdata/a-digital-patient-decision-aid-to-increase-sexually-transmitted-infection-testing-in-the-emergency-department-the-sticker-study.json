            "briefSummary": "This study is a pilot randomized trial of STIckER in which 40 providers (20 trained in using the STIckER decision aid and 20 providing standard care) will enroll a total of 140 sexually active young Emergency Department (ED) patients over six months in a pediatric and adult ED setting. The primary goal is to determine if sexually active young individuals who use STIckER are more likely to undergo STI testing. By developing an effective automated digital tool to increase STI testing, the investigators aim to improve evidence-based sexual health education, reduce STI rates, and enhance the health outcomes of young individuals nationwide.",
            "detailedDescription": "Improving sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening is vital to combat the STI epidemic, especially among adolescents and young adults (AYA) aged 15-24 years in the United States. Inadequate testing for STIs in different body areas contributes to disease transmission. Emergency Departments (EDs) treat a significant number of young individuals, many of whom come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and minority communities. Previous research has shown inconsistent use of contraception in this population, and despite the willingness of ED providers to support sexual health interventions, time and resource limitations present implementation challenges. To address this issue, the investigators propose developing STIckER (STI ChecK in the ER), a digital patient decision aid for STI testing in the ED that promotes shared decision-making. STIckER involves three steps: (1) patients complete a nonjudgmental sexual health screening assessment by scanning a quick-response (QR) code, (2) educational modules facilitate shared decision-making (SDM) by connecting personalized STI risk with evidence-based testing recommendations, and (3) a confidential, color-coded digital infographic aids the patient-provider discussion on STI testing."
