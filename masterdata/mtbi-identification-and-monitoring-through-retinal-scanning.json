Preliminary data obtained from hospitalized patients with a clinically-confirmed traumatic brain injury (TBI) and uninjured controls indicates that the device can detect changes in ocular fixation, alignment, and saccades that are related to brain injury. This study seeks to evaluate the ability of the Rebion trauma tool to assess perturbations in eye movements resulting from TBI. The study will enroll 60 TBI patients and 20 controls."
