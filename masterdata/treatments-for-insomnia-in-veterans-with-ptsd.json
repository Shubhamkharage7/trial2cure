            "briefSummary": "This randomized trial will compare a novel treatment, Acceptance of the Behavioral Changes to Treat Insomnia (ABC-I) to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) among Veterans with comorbid Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and insomnia disorder. ABC-I combines the behavioral components of CBT-I with components of another behavioral therapy (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and has been shown to improve treatment adherence.\n\nThe study objectives are: 1) to evaluate the benefits of ABC-I in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder compared to CBT-I, and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of ABC-I in improving insomnia symptoms and sleep quality among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder as compared to CBT-I.\n\nVeterans with insomnia and comorbid PTSD who receive care at Sepulveda and West Los Angeles facilities will be recruited for the study. Those who pass an initial eligibility screen will be enrolled and written informed consent will be obtained. A baseline assessment will be completed that includes measures of sleep, PTSD, and quality of life. Veterans who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to the ABC-I (n=100) or CBT-I (n=100) treatment. Both treatments will be provided in 5 one-on-one sessions by a trained instructor who is supervised by a behavioral sleep medicine specialist. All randomized participants (n=200) will have 3 follow-up assessments (post-treatment, 3-months, and 6-months after randomization). The follow-up assessments will collect information on PTSD symptoms, insomnia symptoms and sleep quality.",
            "detailedDescription": "Poor sleep is a nearly universal experience after trauma and in the context of PTSD non-pharmacological therapies are considered first-line treatments, yet VA/DoD clinical practice guidelines acknowledged the paucity of available evidence on the treatment of insomnia disorder in the context of PTSD. There is evidence of sleep-related benefits with CBT-I for individuals with insomnia and psychiatric comorbidities, but challenges remain. Insomnia treatments studied among Veterans with PTSD have typically been combined treatments to address both conditions. While promising, these treatments are difficult to implement because of their length and complexity. Furthermore, studies generally have not compared novel sleep-focused treatments to CBT-I (i.e., standard care for insomnia), making it difficult to support a change in the allocation of clinical resources to train providers in new sleep-focused interventions.\n\nThis randomized trial will compare a novel treatment, Acceptance of the Behavioral Changes to Treat Insomnia (ABC-I) to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) among Veterans with comorbid Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and insomnia disorder. ABC-I combines the behavioral components of CBT-I with components of another behavioral therapy (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and has been shown to improve treatment adherence.\n\nThe study objectives are: 1) to evaluate the benefits of ABC-I in reducing PTSD symptoms among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder compared to CBT-I, and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of ABC-I in improving insomnia symptoms and sleep quality among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder as compared to CBT-I.\n\nVeterans with insomnia and comorbid PTSD who receive care at Sepulveda and West Los Angeles facilities will be recruited for the study.

Both treatments will be provided in 5 one-on-one sessions by a trained instructor who is supervised by a behavioral sleep medicine specialist. All randomized participants (n=200) will have 3 follow-up assessments (post-treatment, 3-months, and 6-months after randomization). The follow-up assessments will collect information on PTSD symptoms, insomnia symptoms and sleep quality. The analytic plan will simultaneously address superiority of ABC-I over CBT-I for improving PTSD symptoms and non-inferiority of ABC-I compared to CBT-I for improving insomnia symptoms."
