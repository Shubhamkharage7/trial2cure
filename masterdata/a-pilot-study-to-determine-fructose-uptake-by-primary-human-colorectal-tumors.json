            "briefSummary": "This proposed study is designed to investigate the specific uptake of fructose by human colorectal tumors. In this study, subjects with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery will receive an oral sugar solution containing fructose or xylose prior to surgery. The tumor will then be resected, and a portion of the tissue will be used to measure the abundance of fructose and xylose. The study hypothesis is that the tumors will take up fructose sugar but not xylose sugar. A comparison of the sugar uptake between the tumor and normal tissues from the adjacent intestinal epithelium and smooth muscle and the liver will be conducted. This proposal will confirm that human colorectal cancer tumors can directly absorb dietary sugars, which has never been demonstrated.",
            "detailedDescription": "This prospective pilot study is designed to investigate the uptake of dietary fructose and xylose by primary human colon tumors. In this study, the recruited patients with colorectal cancer will receive an oral sugar solution containing either Fructose sugar or Xylose sugar before surgery. The tumor will then be resected and a portion of the tumor, normal intestinal tissue, blood, urine, and liver will be used to quantify fructose and xylose.\n\n* Research question Can primary human tumors take up fructose or xylose?\n* A statement of the hypothesis The hypothesis is that fructose, but not xylose, can be directly absorbed and stored by primary human colon tumors.\n* Design Prospective, non-randomized, pilot, feasibility, single-center, open-label, phase 1, investigator-initiated study to evaluate the uptake of dietary fructose and xylose by primary human colon tumors with 12 subjects in 2 cohorts: Cohort 1: 6 subjects will consume a sugar solution containing fructose and Cohort 2: 6 subjects will consume a sugar solution containing xylose. Eligible subjects that are scheduled to undergo colorectal resection for cancer treatment will be invited to participate in the study in consecutive order from the practice of colorectal surgeons at the time of their preoperative clinic visit. First, Cohort 1 subjects will be enrolled followed by the Cohort 2 subjects.\n\nN=12 Subjects Cohort 1: Fructose sugar solution =6 Subjects Cohort 2: Xylose sugar solution=6 Subjects"
