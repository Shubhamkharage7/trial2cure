This study will provide information and instruction on several aspects of infant care including, sleep, nutrition, building a healthy relationship with your baby, and healthy screen time use.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is a randomized controlled trial that will recruit parents/caregivers and infants infants living in the Greater Chicago area . The study will follow these infants until they are three years old.\n\nThe intervention arm will receive education about nutrition, resources, and specific instructions on feeding and caring for their infants. The control arm will receive education about infant development and helpful tips about infant sleep, screen time, and building healthy relationships. In addition, all caregivers will be asked to fill out surveys and come to research visits during the study period. There will be a total of 4 study visits during the three years of the study. There will be optional blood, stool, and skin testing of the child at each study visit. Two visits will take place during the first year of life, followed by visits around the child's 2nd and 3rd birthdays."
