            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, multicenter, phase I study of PIT565 in patients with R/R B-NHL and R/R B-ALL.\n\nThe study comprises a dose escalation part of PIT565 in two independent groups (group A: R/R B-NHL and B: R/R B-ALL) and a dose expansion part in three independent groups (relapsed and/or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (R/R LBCL) who received CAR-T therapy (A2) or not (A1), and R/R B-ALL (B1)).\n\nDuring the dose escalation, the safety (including the dose-dose limiting toxicity (DLT) relationship) and tolerability of PIT565 will be assessed, and schedule(s), route(s) of administration and dose(s) will be identified for use in the expansion part based on the review of these data. The recommended dose (RD) will also be guided by the available information on pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary anti-tumor activity. The dose escalation will be guided by an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) following the Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) principle.\n\nDifferent schedules (once weekly (Q1W) or once every 2 weeks (Q2W) with and without priming dose) and routes of administrations (intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.)) will be explored in the dose escalation groups.\n\nThe dose expansion will further explore the MTD(s) and/or RD(s) and the selected schedule(s) and route of administration(s) in the three patients' groups."
