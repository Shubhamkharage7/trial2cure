            "briefSummary": "There is an unmet need for patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is known that local tumor ablation can increase tumor immunogenicity by releasing tumor associated antigens, potentially increasing the response to immune therapy not just locally, but systemically. In addition, there is now positive data with immune therapy in advanced HCC, there is renewed interest in the combination of local therapy and systemic therapy in Barcelona Clinic Liver Clinic B (BCLC B) patients with systemic therapies other than sorafenib. Based on this data, the investigators plan to examine the atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination with Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with BCLC B HCC.",
            "detailedDescription": "Targeting the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway with atezolizumab has demonstrated activity in patients with advanced malignancies who have failed standard-of-care therapies. Objective responses have been observed across a broad range of malignancies, including Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), melanoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma (see Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for detailed efficacy results).\n\nAtezolizumab has been generally well tolerated. Adverse events with potentially immune-related causes consistent with an immunotherapeutic agent, including rash, influenza-like illness endocrinopathies, hepatitis or transaminitis, pneumonitis colitis, and myasthenia gravis, have been observed (see Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for detailed safety results). To date, these events have been manageable with treatment or interruption of atezolizumab treatment.\n\nThe combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in HCC has been well studied in both the phase 1 G030140 study and the phase 3 IMBrave150 study with response rates of 36% and 27% respectively. A phase 2 study of bevacizumab and TACE showed that the combination can be safely administered on the same day. Given concern for risk of bleeding with bevacizumab, all patients on these two studies had recent Endoscopic Gastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) and no patients with untreated varices were included. The risk of bleeding on both studies were reported as low, and risk of benefit was presented as outweighing risk.\n\nThis trial will enroll patients with HCC who have BCLC B disease and are not candidates for curative treatment but are candidates for TACE. Typically, these patients would be treated with local treatment alone, but given the relatively poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this population is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates. The benefit-risk ratio for atezolizumab and bevacizumab in combination with TACE is expected to be acceptable in this setting."

Patients with known coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting the above criteria, or LVEF \\< 50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is optimized in the opinion of the treating physician, in consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate.\n* History of stroke, prolonged reversible ischemic neurological deficit or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study\n* Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, during treatment with atezolizumab, and for 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab.\n* Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study\n* Malignancies within 2 years prior to study start, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., expected 5-year Overall Survival (OS) \\> 90%) treated with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent)\n* Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently)\n\n  a. Patients with indwelling catheters (e.g., PleurX\u00ae) are allowed.\n* Inadequately controlled arterial hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure \\[BP\\] \u2265150 mmHg and/or diastolic BP \\>100 mmHg), based on an average of \u2265 3 BP readings on \u2265 2 sessions. Anti-hypertensive therapy to achieve these parameters is allowable\n* Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1\n* History of hemoptysis (\u2265 2.5 mL of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month prior to Day 1\n* Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy\n* Current or recent (within 10 days of first dose of study treatment) use of aspirin (\\>325 mg/day) or treatment with dipyramidole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and cilostazol\n* Current or recent (\\< 10 days prior to initiation of study treatment) use of aspirin (\\> 325 mg/day), or clopidogrel (\\> 75 mg/day) Note: The use of full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulants for therapeutic purpose is permitted as long as the INR and/or aPTT is within therapeutic limits (according to institution standards) within 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment and the patient has been on a stable dose of anticoagulants for \u2265 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Prophylactic use of anticoagulants is allowed. However, the use of direct oral anticoagulant therapies such as dabigatran (Pradaxa\u00ae) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto\u00ae) is not recommended due to bleeding risk.\n* Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 3 days of treatment start\n* Proteinuria, as demonstrated by urine dipstick or \u22651.0 g of protein in a 24-hour urine collection. All patients with \u22652+ protein on dipstick urinalysis at baseline must undergo a 24-hour urine collection for protein.\n* Chronic daily treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (occasional use for the symptomatic relief of medical conditions such as headache or fever is allowed)\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan. History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n* Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n* Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti- cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), anti- Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and anti- Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapeutic antibodies\n* Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 \\[IL-2\\]) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of the atezolizumab formulation\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the bevacizumab or atezolizumab formulation\n* History of Grade \u2265 4 venous thromboembolism\n* History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, or active GI bleeding within 6 months prior to randomization\n* Serious, non-healing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture",
