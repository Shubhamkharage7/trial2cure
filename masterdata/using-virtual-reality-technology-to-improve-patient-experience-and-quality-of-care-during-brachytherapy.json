            "detailedDescription": "This will be a prospective pilot study conducted at UAMS. All subjects will experience VR distraction using a crossover design in which each subject receives four rounds of brachytherapy: two rounds with VR distraction and two rounds without VR distraction. Brachytherapy will be conducted per SoC workflow. Subjects will be placed into four treatment-sequence groups in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio via permuted block randomization with randomized block sizes of four or eight.\n\nThe four treatment-sequence groups will follow the four-session treatment schedules outlined below, in which \"V\" denotes the sessions when VR distraction is used while \"N\" denotes the sessions when it is not:\n\n* Sequence Group A will be treated according to schedule VVNN.\n* Sequence Group B will be treated according to schedule VNNV.\n* Sequence Group C will be treated according to schedule NNVV.\n* Sequence Group D will be treated according to schedule NVVN."
