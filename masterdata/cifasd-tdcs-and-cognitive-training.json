            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of cognitive training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for children and adolescents (ages 8 - 17 years) with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE).",
            "detailedDescription": "Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has profound detrimental effects on brain development and, as a result, has permanent consequences for cognition, learning, and behavior. Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) commonly have a range of neurocognitive impairments that directly lead to practical problems with learning, attention, working memory, task planning/execution, and decision making, among other areas of functioning. Despite the profound public health burden posed by FASD, there have been very few treatment studies in this population. This study will examine the effects of a cognitive remediation training augmented with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in children and adolescents with PAE. The study involves a baseline visit with cognitive testing, 5 sessions of tDCS (including the baseline visit) with active and sham arms, a 6th visit for cognitive testing."
