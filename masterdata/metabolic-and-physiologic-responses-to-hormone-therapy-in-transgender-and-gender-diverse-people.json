The first visit requires a collection of breath, exercise testing, and body scans. Between visits participant are to eat three days of provided meals and wear an activity monitor. The second study visit will be 3-14 days after the first and includes blood draws, a meal test, and a muscle biopsy. If individuals are not on gender affirming hormone therapy at the time of participation, they may be able to participate again if you decide to pursue gender affirming hormone therapy later on."
