Results from this study will inform clinical recommendations regarding self-management best practices for AYAs with T1D prior to transitioning to adult medical care.",

Families will participate in one of two 6-month treatments: 1) SHIFT2, engaging in monthly sessions with transition coaches providing education on diabetes management and healthcare transition, or 2) Enhanced treatment (TAU+), engaging in routine medical care and receiving monthly education (no coaches)."
