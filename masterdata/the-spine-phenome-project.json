The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are to:\n\n1. Primary outcomes of this research effort include composite measures that differentiate between control and patient populations, predict injury or reinjury risk, identify low back and neck pain patient phenotypes, and evaluate treatment effectiveness.\n2. Secondary outcomes of this research effort include an assessment of wearable motion sensor accuracy, characterization of motion assessment utility, biopsychosocial profiling of control and low back and neck pain patient populations, and differentiation of sincere and insincere motion assessment efforts.\n\nParticipants will complete questionnaires and wear a motion monitor that will assess your back and/or neck. This session will be approximately 40-70 minutes. The research team will follow up with participants at 3 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years to complete a short series of questionnaires and a motion assessment test."
