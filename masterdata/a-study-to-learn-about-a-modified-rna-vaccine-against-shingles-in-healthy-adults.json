            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this clinical study is to learn about the safety, extent of the side effects (reaction to vaccine), and immune response (your immune system's reaction) of the study vaccine called Varicella Zoster Virus modRNA (VZV modRNA). We are seeking for healthy participants who are between 50 and 69 years of age.\n\nThis study will be conducted in 2 substudies: Substudy A (Phase 1) and Substudy B (Phase 2).\n\nSubstudy A:\n\nThis substudy is the Phase 1 portion of the study. In this substudy, participants will receive 1 of 3 VZV modRNA vaccine candidates (different construct, different dose levels and different formulation \\[frozen or freeze dry powder\\]) or the approved shingles vaccine intramuscularly.\n\nParticipants will be assigned in 1 of 14 groups in the study. Vaccination will be given either as a 2-dose series using one of two dosing schedules (either 2-months apart or 6-months apart), or (in one of the groups), as a single VZV modRNA vaccine at the first vaccination visit and saline at the second vaccination visit.\n\nParticipants will take part in this study for 8 to 12 months depending on the group they are assigned to. Some group(s) will continue into persistence-of-immunity (overtime assessment of effect of vaccine) portion of the study. Those participants assigned to these selected groups will be involved in the study for up to 5 years.\n\nSubstudy B:\n\nThis substudy is the Phase 2 portion of the study. In this part of the study, participants will receive either VZV modRNA vaccine at selected dose level/schedule/formulation or approved shingles vaccine. This selection will be determined from Substudy A.\n\nParticipants will be involved in this study for up to 5 years."
