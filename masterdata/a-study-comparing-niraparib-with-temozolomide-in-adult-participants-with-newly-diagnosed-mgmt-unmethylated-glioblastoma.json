The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nDoes niraparib improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to TMZ?\n\nDoes niraparib improve overall survival (OS) compared to TMZ?\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: niraparib or TMZ.\n\n* study drug (Niraparib) or\n* comparator drug (Temozolomide - which is the standard approved treatment for MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma).\n\nThe study medication will be taken daily while receiving standard of care radiation therapy (RT) for 6-7 weeks.\n\nParticipants may continue to take the niraparib or TMZ adjuvantly as long as the cancer does not get worse or completion of 6 cycles of treatment (TMZ). A total of 450 participants will be enrolled in the study.\n\nParticipants' tasks will include:\n\n* Complete study visits as scheduled\n* Complete a diary to record study medication"
