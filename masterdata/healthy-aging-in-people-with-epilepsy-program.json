Can providing education on healthy aging, chronic disease management, dementia, and modifiable lifestyle dementia risk factors improve dementia knowledge and health literacy among older adults with epilepsy?\n2. Can aging related education and resources improve quality of life among older adults with epilepsy?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Complete a 12-week group educational program.\n* Complete pre- and post-program evaluation."
