Because scrambled images do not include an object stimulus, the images are used as \"catch trials\" to determine the subjects' baseline tendency to give positive responses to a question about the subjects' recognition experience. Each object category will include four unique real images and one scrambled image. Each image will be repeated 10 times (i.e., trials) for each 16-min session. The pre-stimulus interval will vary randomly from trial to trial between 4 and 8 seconds to prevent stimulus timing predictability. The stimuli will be presented in a randomized order to prevent category predictability."
