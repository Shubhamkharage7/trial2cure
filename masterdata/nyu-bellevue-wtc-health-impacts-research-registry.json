The populations served consist predominantly of a) local residents who were impacted by the disperion of the WTC dusts and fumes, b) individuals involved in cleaning and debris removal of local commercial spaces, and c) responders to the WTC collapse. These populations are recruited from past and ongoing programs that we have developed as well as from ongoing collaborations with community organizations that include: the Beyond Ground Zero Network, 9/11 Environmental Action committee, and the WTC Residents Coalition. In addition, there is collaboration with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center and the centers involved in the ongoing WTC Workers and Volunteer Medical Screening and Monitoring Program. We would now like to access the data from this treatment program to create a NYU/Bellevue WTC Health Impacts Research Registry to increase knowledge about the health effects of exposure to World Trade Center dust."
