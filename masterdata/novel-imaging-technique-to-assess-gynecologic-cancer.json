DCE MRI is a new imaging technique that uses additional computer processing to collect information continuously during scanning, which produces more detailed images faster than traditional MRI, which reduces the risk of movement-related blurring and provides important information about tumor activity.\n\nThe DCE MRI scan in this study will be done in a standard MRI scanner, using a contrast agent (gadobutrol; Gadavist\u00ae) that has been approved by the FDA."
