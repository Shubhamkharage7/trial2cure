Additionally, potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between intervention status and weight loss response at 6 months in both nonresponders and responders will be examined and a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the cost of the intervention will be conducted.\n\nThis study addresses key gaps in the literature about the weight loss effects of identifying nonresponders early and characterizing individuals who need more intense personalized strategies. The investigators hypothesize that changes between baseline and 3 months will be more pronounced among the nonresponders in the intervention group compared to the nonresponders in the active control group."
