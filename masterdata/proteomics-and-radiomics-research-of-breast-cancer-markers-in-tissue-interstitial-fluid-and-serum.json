The purpose of this research is to collect fresh breast nodule/cancer and surrounding non-cancerous tissue for proteomic studies of the interstitial fluid to identify a profile distinguishing breast cancer which will also permit future research on stored interstitial fluid, blood or tissue samples. Specific markers identified from interstitial fluid study will be investigated in blood samples to develop serum markers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Additionally, we will perform both prospective and retrospective research on breast cancer involving clinical, demographic, epidemiologic information, treatment, follow-up and outcomes on breast nodule/cancer cases collected."

This will allow researchers to examine the samples to determine if blood changes over time after surgery, and what type of result may indicate a risk for recurrence.\n\nAny remaining blood samples not used for the study will remain in the laboratory for future research."
