            "briefSummary": "Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that prolonged (3-month) treatment with galantamine inhibits NADPH IsoLG-protein adducts formation and improves markers of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in AAs.\n\nAim 1a: The investigators will determine if galantamine inhibits NADPH IsoLG-protein adducts formation, superoxide production, and immune cell activation compared to placebo.\n\nFor this purpose, the investigators will study peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), a critical source of systemic oxidative stress, collected from study participants.\n\nAim 1b: The investigators will determine if galantamine reduces intracellular Iso-LGs, ICAM-1, and 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker of vascular oxidative stress, in ECs harvested from study participants.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To determine if prolonged (3-month) treatment with galantamine improves endothelial dysfunction as measured by vascular reactivity in AAs. The investigators will measure vascular reactivity in response to ischemia in two vascular beds: (a) in conduit arteries (brachial artery) using brachial artery diameter flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and (b) in the microvasculature (MBV) using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in skeletal muscle.\n\nThis proposal will study a novel mechanism that could alter the oxidative and immunogenic responses that contributes to endothelial dysfunction in AAs and will offer a potential pathway for the development of more effective therapies aimed at decreasing the progression of endothelial dysfunction to cardiovascular disease in this population.",
            "detailedDescription": "Endothelial dysfunction, a pro-thrombotic, inflammatory condition that causes impaired vascular reactivity is an early reversible step in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple studies consistently shown that African Americans (AAs) have impaired endothelial function compared to whites. African Americans also experience disproportionately higher CV morbidity and 20% higher mortality than whites or Hispanics. Endothelial dysfunction is caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide which interferes with endothelial-derived nitric oxide signaling pathways. One of the major sources of superoxide is NADPH oxidase; our previous work found that activation of NADPH oxidase contributes to vascular oxidation through the formation of highly immunogenic isolevuglandins (IsoLG-protein adducts) in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which stimulates antigen presenting cells (APC) and inflammatory mediators. Inflammation and oxidative stress are modulated by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The investigators and others found that AAs have reduced PNS activity compared with whites.\n\nThe investigators preliminary data in obese AA women found that stimulation of the PNS cholinergic transmission with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine, blocked the production of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines induced by lipids.\n\nThe overall goal of the current proposal is to determine if prolonged treatment with galantamine improves endothelial dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress in AAs. For this purpose, the investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study to test the effect of 3-month treatment with galantamine (16 mg/day) on vascular oxidative stress and impaired vascular reactivity in AAs.\n\nSpecifically, the investigators will evaluate whether galantamine treatment inhibits the activation of NADPH-IsoLG formation and the subsequent immunogenic responses in PBMCs. Furthermore, the investigators will determine if galantamine decreases markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in harvested endothelial cells (ECs) and improves vascular reactivity in the same study subjects. The planned studies will provide a comprehensive assessment of the mechanism underlying the effect of increased PNS cholinergic transmission on endothelial dysfunction.\n\nIf the investigators' hypothesis is correct, and galantamine improves endothelial dysfunction in AAs, a population with a high risk for CVD, they will discover a novel mechanism that could alter the oxidative and immunogenic responses in this population and will offer a potential pathway for the development of more effective therapies aimed at decreasing CVD."
