            "briefSummary": "Overall Objective: To determine the efficacy of rbLf supplementation in a healthy adult population, specifically with regard to iron regulation (primary), gut health (secondary), and immune function (secondary). Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of rbLf on iron regulation, exercise performance, gut health, and immune function as compared to cow's milk derived bLf.\n\nParticipants: To account for an approximate \\~10% dropout rate (and rounding up to ensure equal number of enrolled participants per group), n=25 per group for males (N=50) and n=30 per group for females (N=60) will be enrolled for a total sample size of N=110.\n\nProcedures: Participation in this study will include 6 in-person visits over 14 weeks. Anemia will be checked and excluded at the first visit using a single finger prick, followed by a 10-20 min exercise test on a treadmill to evaluate exercise capacity. On visit 2 participants will perform three 3-15 minute exercise tests on a treadmill with rest in between each test in order to determine exercise performance. A finger prick will be performed before and after each run to determine lactate levels. After visits 2 participants will be randomized to their respective supplement group recombinant Bovine Lactoferrin supplement (rbLf) (Male and Fame), a bovine-milk derived Lactoferrin supplement (Female), or a placebo (Male) once daily for 4 weeks. Blood samples will be obtained prior to and after each supplement phase to determine change in iron levels and red blood cell capacity. After a 2-week washout participants will return to complete the same testing outcomes and will receive the subsequent supplement. At visit 6 a final blood sample will be collected."
