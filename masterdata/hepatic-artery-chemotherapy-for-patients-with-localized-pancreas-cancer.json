            "briefSummary": "This is a window-of-opportunity study which will evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-dose neoadjuvant Hepatic Artery (HA) chemotherapy (FUDR/oxaliplatin) in patients with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) eligible for surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy.\n\nCurrent standard-of-care therapy for patients with localized PDAC includes surgical resection and six months of systemic chemotherapy. Because the sequence of these treatments (surgery and chemotherapy) is not well established, we will include both patients planned to undergo surgery before chemotherapy, as well as patients planned to receive systemic chemotherapy before surgery. This will allow us to test the safety and feasibility of adding single-dose neoadjuvant HA chemotherapy prior to surgery across the real-world treatment strategies employed in typical clinical practice. Moreover, the window-of-opportunity design is intended to make sure that all patients receive HA chemotherapy in addition to standard-of-care surgery and systemic chemotherapy, so as not to withhold the treatment approach currently associated with best outcomes.\n\nThe primary endpoint is safety and feasibility, and patients will be followed for 30 days after resection of their primary tumors to assess these outcomes. Following the short-term follow-up period, patients move to long-term follow-up, which will occur every three months after resection of the primary tumor, for a period of up to three years. Long-term secondary endpoints include disease free survival (DFS), liver metastasis-free survival (LMFS), and overall survival (OS).",

This will allow us to test the safety and feasibility of adding single-dose neoadjuvant HA chemotherapy prior to surgery across the real-world treatment strategies employed in typical clinical practice. Moreover, the window-of-opportunity design is intended to make sure that all patients receive HA chemotherapy in addition to standard-of-care surgery and systemic chemotherapy, so as not to withhold the treatment approach currently associated with best outcomes.\n\nDuring an initial screening period (0 to 28 days before the treatment period), informed consent will be obtained and all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be confirmed for participation. Once deemed appropriate for participation, patients will be enrolled and begin study treatment. On Day 1 of the treatment period, patients will undergo standard-of-care diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm the absence of metastatic disease not seen on staging imaging, as well as tissue acquisition (blood and liver biopsies) for pre-specified correlative scientific studies. On Day 2 (\u00b11 day), patients will receive the interventional treatment, which is neoadjuvant HA chemotherapy. On Day 14 (\u00b15 business days), patients will undergo standard-of-care resection of their primary tumor, as well as tissue acquisition (blood, liver biopsies, primary tumor, regional lymph nodes) for pre-specified correlative scientific studies.\n\nThe primary endpoint is safety and feasibility, and patients will be followed for 30 days after resection of their primary tumors to assess these outcomes. This includes safety evaluations on treatment period Day 1 (diagnostic laparoscopy), Day 2 (\u00b11 day, HA chemotherapy), Day 4 (+2 business days), Day 14 (\u00b15 business days, day of primary tumor resection), every day throughout the perioperative hospitalization, and at outpatient follow-up (30 days \u00b110 business days after surgery for resection of the primary tumor).\n\nFollowing the short-term follow-up period, patients move to long-term follow-up, which will occur every three months (\u00b120 business days) after resection of the primary tumor, for a period of up to three years. Long-term secondary endpoints include DFS, LMFS, and OS.\n\nAs mentioned, a biobanking effort is built into this study to support prespecified correlative scientific objectives. This includes acquisition of peripheral blood and liver biopsies at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy (Day 1), acquisition of peripheral blood, liver biopsies, the primary tumor, and regional lymph nodes at the time of resection of the primary tumor (Day 14 \u00b15 days), and acquisition of peripheral blood at outpatient follow-up appointments. Correlative studies include multisite immune profiling, assessment of the HOMB both before and after HA chemotherapy, and dynamic assessment of ctDNA."
