To do this, we have an online study designed to better understand how treatments people living with lung cancer receive impact their quality of life. Participants will complete surveys once a month for 12 months.\n\nWhat does participation involve?\n\n1. Emailing the study team to learn more and get access to the study website.\n2. Once a month for 12 months you will receive a survey by email.\n3. Complete these surveys on a smartphone, tablet, or computer at your convenience and receive an e-gift card for your time.",
            "detailedDescription": "PEER is an international study, that is Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant.\n\nThe study objective is to collect longitudinal data to facilitate a rigorous understanding of the diagnostic and treatment experiences of people diagnosed with lung cancer and to identify determinants of treatment heterogeneity. Study data will be used to understand the diagnostic and treatment pathways, explore patient-experience data in different domains (financial impact/quality of life/symptoms) and test the hypothesis that different classes of therapies (chemotherapy/ immunotherapy/ targeted therapy/ surgery/ radiation) impact patient experience (eg., physical function).\n\nStudy participants will consent and register for the study and complete an initial baseline survey. They will then be followed for 12 months and receive a monthly survey (11 surveys in total) via email. The development of the surveys was guided by input from patients, clinicians, FDA experts, and incorporates questions from existing patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures.\n\nSummarized study results will also be posted on LUNGevity's website. External researchers will be able to apply to have limited access to de-identified data."
