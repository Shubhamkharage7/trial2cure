Patients will be enrolled and dosed according to the most current protocol. This study is made of two Parts. Part 1 includes a dose escalation into 7 cohorts and patient allocation to these cohorts will be via slot allocation. Each cohort has a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 patients for a total of 21 - 42 patients. The patient population of the dose escalation phase will include patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR classical mutations or Ex20ins mutations, or uncommon mutations. Part 2 includes an expansion phase and the expansion phase will explore one or more dose levels of PLB1004 in NSCLC patients with EGFR Ex20ins mutations, classical mutations, or uncommon mutations."
