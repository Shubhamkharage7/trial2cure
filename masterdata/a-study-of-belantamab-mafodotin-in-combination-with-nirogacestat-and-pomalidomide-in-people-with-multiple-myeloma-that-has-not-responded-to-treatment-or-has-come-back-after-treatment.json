The researchers will test different doses of belantamab mafodotin to find the safest dose to give with nirogacestat and pomalidomide. The researchers also want to find out whether belantamab mafodotin plus nirogacestat and pomalidomide is an effective treatment for this type of bone marrow cancer, and the researchers will do tests that show whether the study treatment slows or stops the growth of cancer."
