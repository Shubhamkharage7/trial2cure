To detect molecular MRD, the investigators will perform ultra-deep, error-corrected panel-based sequencing (MyeloSeq-HD) at Day 30 in post-transplant MDS patients. The investigators will treat patients with detectable molecular MRD with DEC-C to determine if pre-emptive, MRD-guided therapy with DEC-C decreases relapse rates and improves progression-free survival."
