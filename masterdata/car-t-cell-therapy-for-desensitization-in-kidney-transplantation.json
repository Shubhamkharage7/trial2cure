            "briefSummary": "This research study is for people who have been waiting for a kidney transplant for at least one year, and who have a cPRA of 99.5% or higher. Having a cPRA of 99.5% or higher means that your immune system would reject 99.5% of kidneys available for transplant. The study will test whether new products called Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells (CAR T Cells), when given with chemotherapy, is safe and will reduce cPRA.\n\nThe main study will last up to 2 years: Participants will have up to 30 clinic or hospital visits over a one-year period. If a transplant takes place, there will be 9 more visits after transplant. Long term follow up is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 15 years after receiving CAR T cell.\n\nThe primary objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering CART BCMA + huCART-19 following lymphodepletion, including determination of optimal tolerated regimen (OTR) and/or recommended phase 2 regimen, according to the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in highly sensitized patients awaiting kidney transplant.",
            "detailedDescription": "CTOT-46 will enroll up to up to 20 highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates at 3 centers. There will be a safety run-in and 3 treatment cohorts to assess the safety and pharmacodynamics of CART-BCMA and huCART-19.\n\nFollowing screening and enrollment, the subject will undergo leukapheresis to collect T cells for CAR T cell manufacturing. Subsequently, subjects will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by CART-BCMA and huCART19 cell infusions. A secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of study treatment to reduce cPRA and determine the duration cPRA reduction."

Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives of investigational drug, whichever is longer) of screening\n20. Pregnant, currently breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the primary or post-transplant follow up of the study.\n21. Past or current social or medical problems; or findings from physical examination or laboratory testing that are not listed above, which in the opinion of investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study\n\nLymphodepleting Chemotherapy Eligibility:\n\nStudy entry eligibility must be re-assessed prior to starting lymphodepletion. In addition, subjects must undergo respiratory viral testing on nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs (per institutional practice) for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza within 7 days prior to the first planned lymphodepletion chemotherapy.\n\n1. If the subject is positive for influenza, Tamiflu\u00ae or equivalent should be administered per package insert. The subject must complete treatment and symptoms must be improving and either resolved or nearly resolved in the judgment of the treating investigator prior to receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CAR T cells. Repeat influenza testing is not required prior to initiating lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CAR T cell infusion.\n2. If the subject tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the subject will be managed per institutional practice. Subject will be eligible to initiate lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CAR T cell infusion once cleared from requirement for isolation according to institutional and/or CDC guidance.\n3. If testing is positive for another respiratory virus (e.g., as part of a multiplex respiratory pathogen panel in the course of testing for influenza or SARS-CoV-2), the lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CAR T cell infusion will be delayed for at least 7 days to be sure clinical symptoms of a viral infection do not develop. If clinical symptoms develop, the lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CAR T cell infusion will be delayed until resolution of these symptoms.\n\nCAR T Cell Infusion Eligibility:\n\nThe criteria below will be assessed by the investigator following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and before administration of CAR T cells. Subjects who do not satisfy these criteria may have CAR T cell infusion delayed until such time as criteria are satisfied. Subjects who receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy but in whom CAR T cell infusion is delayed \\>4 weeks after the first day of lymphodepleting chemotherapy will receive a second cycle of lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR T cell infusion. For subjects receiving fludarabine, a second cycle of cyclophosphamide can be administered, but fludarabine will not be repeated.\n\n1. Subjects must not have developed deterioration in performance status or overall clinical condition or new laboratory abnormalities that would, in the opinion of the treating investigator, render it unsafe to proceed with CAR T cell infusion. The following are specific conditions that warrant delaying CAR T cell infusion:\n\n   1. Requirement for supplemental oxygen to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation \u226595%.\n   2. Presence of clinically significant radiographic abnormalities on chest x-ray. Chest x-ray is not required to evaluate for radiographic abnormalities in the absence of suggestive symptoms or exam findings.\n   3. New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management.
