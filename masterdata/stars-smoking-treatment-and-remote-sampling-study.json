This will be decided randomly. Participants have a 50%chance of receiving varenicline, a 25% chance of receiving nicotine products, and a 25% chance of receiving neither. If the participant is assigned to a group that receives free samples, they will be mailed to them free of charge. There is no requirement to use them, and it is completely up to the participants. There is also no requirement to quit in this study.\n\nThe study lasts for six months, and will involve six total surveys. In addition, investigators ask that participants complete daily diaries (about 1 minute each) for the first 4 weeks of the study. Both varenicline and nicotine replacement products are well-established medications that help smokers quit."
