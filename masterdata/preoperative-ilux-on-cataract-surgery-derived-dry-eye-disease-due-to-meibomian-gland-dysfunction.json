Patients in the control arm will receive no Systane iLux treatment at the baseline visit two weeks prior to cataract surgery. Patients will be assessed on baseline metrics for dry eye disease stemming and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) at the baseline visit two weeks prior to cataract surgery. These metrics include tear break up time (TBUT), standard patient evaluation of eye dryness questionnaire (SPEED), ocular surface and surface disease index (OSDI) surveys, and lipid layer thickness (LLT). At the follow up visit four weeks after cataract surgery, these same metrics will be assessed again for any significant changes."
