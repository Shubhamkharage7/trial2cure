In particular, the project seeks to determine whether BA targets different neural mechanisms for behavioral avoidance associated with low motivation as compared to threat avoidance. A group of healthy controls will also be scanned as a comparator group for behavioral and imaging measures.",

The investigators plan to recruit 40 healthy controls and 96 treatment-seeking adolescents for an overall sample of \\~136 participants, Individuals who reach the age of majority (18) during the study will be re-consented as adults and allowed to continue participating in the study.\n\nA healthy control group will be included to assess stability in behavioral and neuroimaging measures over the course of participation in the study.\n\nThe fMRI scan schedule will include three task-based sessions (baseline, after session 7, and after endpoint) and two (sessions 3 \\& 9). \"behavioral-scheduling-in-the-scanner\" sessions Primary results will focus on symptom change within patients and their association to measures of low motivation and threat avoidance."
