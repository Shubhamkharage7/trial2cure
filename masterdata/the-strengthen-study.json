            "briefSummary": "This study uses two different types of interventions including electrical brain stimulation delivered during sleep, and brief, daily meditation training. The investigators are trying to figure out whether these techniques, either alone or in combination with each other, can positively impact the brain networks that support our ability to think flexibly and to regulate our emotions. 48 participants will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for up to 9 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will evaluate the independent and synergistic effect of Cognitive Flexibility (CF)/Emotional Regulation (ER) - targeted meditation and CF/ER-targeted Transcranial Electrical Stimulation with Temporal Interference (TES-TI) during sleep in low-risk participants (n = 48).\n\nAfter informed consent, all participants will undergo a set of baseline assessments, including self-report measures, behavioral tasks, functional and structural MRI, and a baseline in-laboratory sleep study.\n\nFollowing these assessments, participants undergo four weeks of the study intervention. The participants will be assigned into one of four groups. Each group consists of 12 participants.\n\nAfter completing the 4-week intervention, participants will repeat the behavioral, self-report, and imaging assessments given at baseline. Participants will also complete a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) at baseline, the week after intervention, and at 4-months following intervention. At the 4-month follow-up, participants may complete another round of self-report and behavioral measures.\n\nThe Primary Objectives are to:\n\n* Evaluate the effects of the following on CF and ER networks:\n\n  1. meditation practice alone\n  2. meditation practice and high-dose TES-TI\n  3. meditation practice and low-dose TES-TI\n  4. TES-TI alone\n\nThe Secondary Objectives are to:\n\n* Evaluate the differential synergies between Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep TES-TI intervention and the restoration of CF verses ER circuits"

The data may be shared with other researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and outside the University. Outside researchers may be at other universities, private companies, or other kinds of organizations. The banked data will be labeled with a code instead of a participant's name. When the data is shared with other investigators for research projects, they will not be able to use the code to figure out which data belongs to a particular subject. The research team will maintain a link between the data and subject identifiable information kept by the study team. This link will not be shared with anyone outside of the study team. Participants will be able to request to have their data removed from the bank by contacting the research team at any time.",
