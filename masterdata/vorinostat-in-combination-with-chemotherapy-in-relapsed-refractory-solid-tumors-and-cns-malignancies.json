The baseline disease evaluation will be obtained following hematologic recovery from the first cycle of chemotherapy, after which combination therapy with vorinostat will be given in subsequent cycles (2-12) w/ modifications if needed. Vorinostat dose escalation in subsequent patient cohorts will occur based on DLT to determine a MTD."

This is called a Phase I study because the goal is to find the highest dose of vorinostat that investigators can give safely when it is used together with the chemotherapy drugs vincristine, irinotecan and temozolomide. Investigators are using vorinostat because it seems to work against cancer in test tubes and animals. It may be most effective when it is given with chemotherapy. The combination of these three agents together has never been given to children. Vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide are approved and used for the treatment of other types of cancer in adults and children. Vorinostat is approved and used to treat cancer in adults. The combination of these four drugs together is experimental. Investigators do not know if this combination of medicines will work in people. There is a lot that investigators do not yet know about this combination of medicines.",
