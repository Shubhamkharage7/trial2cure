NF scans alternate between up-regulate and down-regulate blocks in which participants are cued to increase or decrease activity in the target region while receiving feedback on activity in the region at the bottom of the screen in the form of a line graph. The experimental group receives feedback from the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the control group receives feedback from a control region of the brain."
