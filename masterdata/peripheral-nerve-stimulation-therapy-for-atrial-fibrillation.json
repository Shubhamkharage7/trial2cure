The three arms include treatment with a wrist-worn neuromodulation (\"wrist device\"), treatment with an ear-worn neuromodulation device (\"ear device\") and sham stimulation with wrist-worn device that does not actually deliver stimulation (\"sham device\"). ECG patches will be worn on the chest to measure AF episode onset and duration (\"ECG Patch\"). Additionally, a wrist-worn monitoring device will be used for the measurement of heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and other biomarkers (\"Cardiac Measurement Device (CMD)\"). Finally, subjects will track AF episode onset, duration, and symptom type in an AF diary."
