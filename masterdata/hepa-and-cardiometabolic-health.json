            "detailedDescription": "This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial will recruit 52 non-diabetic adults and will investigate potential benefits of HEPA air purifiers on improving cardiometabolic profiles. Participants will be contacted and recruited to the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. After consenting, participants will be block randomized to HEPA and control groups for 6-month interventions by sex. After 6-month wash-out period, participants will be switched to the other arm of the intervention. During the trial, project specialists will complete a series of home visits before and after each intervention session to set up air purifiers and indoor and outdoor air pollution monitors, as well as conduct interview to collect questionnaire data, measure body weight and blood pressure, and collect biospecimen. In aim 1, the researcher will assess the effect of a 6-month residential HEPA intervention on changes of type 2 diabetes-related metabolic outcomes in 52 adults. In aim 2, the researchers will examine the association between reduction in indoor PM2.5 exposure brought by the intervention and changes in metabolic outcomes adjusting for ambient PM2.5 exposure. In aim 3, the researchers will explore major pathophysiologic changes pertinent to the cardio-metabolic profile of type 2 diabetes relevance in response to the intervention and changes in PM2.5 exposure."
