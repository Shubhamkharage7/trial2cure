The device is inserted for temporary use up to 28 days.\n\nStudy participants will have a history of Foley catheter use or self-catheterization to drain their bladder.Participants may include men in urinary retention with no prior intervention.\n\nThe hypothesis is that the Blue Halo Coil Catheter will reduce the post void residual to \\<75 cc with volitional voiding.\n\nThe Blue Halo Coil Catheter is comprised of a Coiled Retention portion with a guidewire accommodating tip, a short prostate catheter segment, and a pusher/delivery catheter segment, that when left in place allows for the temporary collection of urine prior to conversion to short segment without an external collection device. The tip of the Blue Halo Coil Catheter utilizes a horizontal coil retention device. A monofilament suture is attached to the prostate catheter segment to allow for ease of positioning and removal. The suture also allows for repositioning should the device slip back into the bladder."
