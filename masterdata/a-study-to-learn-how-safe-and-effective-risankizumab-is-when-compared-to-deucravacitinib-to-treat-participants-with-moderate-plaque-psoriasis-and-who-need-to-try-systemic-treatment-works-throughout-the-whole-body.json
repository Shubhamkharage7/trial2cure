            "briefSummary": "Psoriasis is a long-term skin disease which causes red, itchy, scaly patches most commonly on the knees, elbows, scalp, and torso (chest, back, and abdomen). In participants with psoriasis, certain skin cells multiply much faster and the skin can develop rough patches that may be red or white with scales. There are many types of psoriasis, but plaque psoriasis is the most common. The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, but researchers think it may be caused by the body's immune system not working properly.\n\nThis study is designed to enroll 336 participants 18 years of age and older with have been diagnosed with moderate chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to Baseline (Day 1) and who have not previously been treated with a biologic treatment (natural substance that is made by using living cells in a laboratory). This is a Phase 4, randomized, open-label, assessor blinded, active comparator study with 2 Parts. Phase 4 studies test treatments that have already been approved to treat patients with a condition or disease. This study is open-label, which means that both participants and study doctors know which study treatment is given to participants\n\nParticipants will be administered subcutaneous (SC) treatment of risankizumab every 12 weeks for up to 44 weeks or provided deucravacitinib oral tablets to be taken once daily.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care (due to study procedures). Participants will attend regular (weekly, monthly) visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires."
