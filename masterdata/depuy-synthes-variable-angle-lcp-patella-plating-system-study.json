The purpose of this study is to see how well the Depuy Synthes LCP Variable Plating System work in fixing a broken kneecap (patella). Depuy says that the device will improve healing when compared to traditional ways of repairing a broken patella.\n\nThe goal of this randomized control trial is to learn how well the LCP Variable Plating System works to fix a broken patella (kneecap) compared to traditional fixation methods, in male and females, age 18 to 74, with a patellar fracture, and being treated at Hartford HealthCare The Bone and Joint Institute or Hartford Hospital. The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n* To understand if the Depuy Synthes LCP Variable Angle Plating System will provide a better way to help patients recover from a broken patella.\n\nParticipants will evaluated at specific time points: post-op day 1, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 month post-surgery. Participants will be asked to:\n\n* Complete surveys at all evaluation timepoints.\n* Have x-rays(radiographs) taken at the 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, and 1 year timepoints.\n* Participants will have a passive range of motion tests done at 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, and 1 year timepoints.\n* Participants would have strength and balance tests done at the 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, and 1 year timepoints."
