Two protocol acceptable methods of contraception in tandem.\n\n       Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for \u226512 months prior to the planned date of the Baseline Visit without an alternative medical cause.
