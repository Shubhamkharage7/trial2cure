            "briefSummary": "This research study is evaluating a combination therapy of 3 drugs as possible treatments for recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nThe three drugs being used in the study are:\n\n* Pembrolizumab (MK3475)\n* Ibrutinib\n* Rituximab (or biosimilar)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open label, multi-center, phase Ib/II trial of Pembrolizumab, Ibrutinib and Rituximab in participants with refractory/relapsed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma.\n\n* A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose(s) of the investigational intervention to use for further studies.\n* Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. The dose of investigational intervention in Phase II will depend on the results from Phase Ib\n* \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\n  * The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab, ibrutinib or rituximab for refractory/relapsed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) but these have been approved for other uses including other types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n  * Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer, and information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab may be beneficial in this type of cancer. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients; an antibody that is made in the lab is also known as humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to block the action of the receptor, PD-1. PD-1 works to help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. There are now several approved antibodies for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.\n  * Ibrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is believed to block a type of protein called a kinase that helps lymphoma cells live and grow. By blocking this, it is possible that the study drug will kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.\n  * Rituximab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. Rituximab works with the immune system and has shown evidence for clinical activity when administered in combinations to treat lymphoma.\n* The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n* The three drugs being used in the study are:\n\n  * Pembrolizumab (MK3475)\n  * Ibrutinib\n  * Rituximab (or biosimilar)\n* Participants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years as long as they do not have serious side effects and their disease does not get worse. Once off study, participants will be followed every 3 months for the rest of their life.\n* Phase I Enrollment: Approximately 9 to 12 participants\n* Phase II Enrollment :Approximately 25 patients\n\nMerck \\& Co., Inc, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the research study and the study drug, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)"
