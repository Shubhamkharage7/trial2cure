With the advancement of phone sensors and wearable fitness tracking devices these factors are now more straightforward to gather and measure. The use of smartphones by a large segment of the population allows for data collection on an unprecedented scale. The investigators aim to amass activity and cardiovascular health data on thousands of participants as well as provide significantly more quantitative data on type,duration, and intensity of daily activities.\n\nIn the second phase of the MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study (Randomized Assessment of Physical Activity Prompts In A Large Ambulatory Population) the researchers will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial of four different physical activity prompts (intervention) and their effect on the level of physical activity in the study population as measured by change in step count.",
            "detailedDescription": "MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study is a smartphone-based mobile cardiovascular health research study. The study will utilize the mobile health capabilities of smartphones and wearables to assess daily activity measures of the general public and compare these to measures of cardiovascular health - risk factors and fitness. How people divide their time among exercise, sedentary behavior, and sleep all affect cardiovascular health, yet these largely go unmeasured. With the advancement in phone sensors and wearables these factors are now more straightforward to gather and measure. The use of smartphones by a large segment of the population allows for data collection on an unprecedented scale. The investigators aim to amass activity and cardiovascular health data on thousands of participants as well as provide much more quantitative data on type,duration, and intensity of daily activities. The MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health mobile application provides a platform for the investigation of methods aimed to aid participants in increasing heart healthy activities. The overall goal of the study is to develop an extensive source of data which will inform future cardiovascular health guidelines.\n\nIn the second phase of the MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study (Randomized Assessment of Physical Activity Prompts In A Large Ambulatory Population) the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial of four different physical activity prompts (intervention) and their effect on increasing physical activity in the study population as measured by change in step count.\n\nOf note to supplement the activity data the investigators will ask participants who have completed a genetic analysis to share their that data with the MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study research team. The investigators believe the opportunity to overlay activity, heart risk and genetic data for participants is a great tool for discovery."
