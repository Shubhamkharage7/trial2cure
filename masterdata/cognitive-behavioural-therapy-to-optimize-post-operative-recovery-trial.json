            "briefSummary": "Psychological factors such as stress, distress, anxiety, depression, and poor coping strategies may be associated with ongoing pain following injuries such as fractures. To study this relationship, patients will undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is designed to modify such thoughts with the goal of reducing ongoing pain and improving quality of life. The goal of this study is to determine if CBT, versus usual care, reduces the prevalence of moderate to severe persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) over 12-months post-fracture in patients with an open or closed fracture of the appendicular skeleton, treated with internal fixation.",
            "detailedDescription": "The relationship between psychological factors, behaviors, and cognitive processes and the sensation of pain is well documented. Stress, distress, anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, fear-avoidance behaviors, and poor coping strategies appear to have a significant positive relationship with both acute and chronic pain. Evidence suggests that these psychological factors can cause alterations along the spinal and supraspinal pain pathways which influence the perception of pain. Previous studies suggest that patients' beliefs and expectations may be associated with clinical outcomes, including self-reported pain. Previous studies in trauma patients have demonstrated patients' beliefs and expectations regarding their recovery following surgery are associated with functional limitations, lower rates of return to work, and reduced quality of life one year after injury. Furthermore, up to two thirds of patients with operative managed extremity fractures demonstrate unhelpful illness beliefs that increase risks of negative outcomes, including persistent pain. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), that are designed to modify unhelpful beliefs and behaviours have the potential to reduce persistent post-surgical pain and its associated effects among trauma patients.\n\nOur primary objective is to determine if CBT, versus usual care, reduces the prevalence of moderate to severe PPSP over 12 months post-fracture in participants with an open or closed fracture of the appendicular skeleton. Our secondary objectives are to determine if CBT, versus usual care: 1) increases physical functioning, 2) improves mental functioning, 3) accelerates return to function, 4) reduces pain severity, and 5) reduces pain interference over 12 months post-fracture, and 6) reduces the proportion of participants prescribed opioid class medications (and average dose) at 6 and 12 months post-fracture. This trial is a multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1,000 participants with an open fracture of the appendicular skeleton or closed fracture of the lower extremity or pelvis treated with internal fixation."
