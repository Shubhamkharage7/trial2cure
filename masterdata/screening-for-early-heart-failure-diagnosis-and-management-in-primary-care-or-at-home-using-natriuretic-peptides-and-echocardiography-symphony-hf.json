They will be managed and followed up as per routine clinical care. They will be remotely monitored for HF events by follow up through electronic records and routinely collected data.\n\nOR\n\n\"Investigational arm\" - patients in this arm will have a blood sample performed for measurement of N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Patients with an elevated Roche NT-proBNP (\u2265125 pg/mL) will undergo a transthoracic echocardiogram, clinical examination for signs of HF, HF symptom assessment, an ECG). Patients will undergo echocardiography with a CE-marked, FDA-approved handheld point of care (POC) EchoNous echocardiogram device in all countries. The US2.ai algorithm (which is also CE-marked and FDA-approved) will generate an AI-automated echocardiogram report. In Scotland all patients will also undergo a conventional echocardiogram. Patients who are classified as having heart failure (Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \\[HFrEF\\], Heart failure with moderately reduced ejection fraction \\[HFmrEF\\] and Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction \\[HFpEF\\]) will be referred for appropriate follow up. In all countries when a handheld echocardiogram reported by AI-automated software does not provide diagnostic images a conventional echocardiogram will be undertaken."
