            "briefSummary": "An investigator-initiated, prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized single institution clinical evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of branched and fenestrated-branched endovascular stent grafts to preserve branch vessels when used in the treatment of patients with thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms. The study evaluates non-FDA-approved off the shelf and custom made branched and fenestrated-branched stent grafts manufactured by Cook Medical.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are to determine whether fenestrated-branched and branched endovascular grafts are a safe and effective method of treating patients with thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms.",
            "detailedDescription": "A branched thoracic endograft is a commercially manufactured endograft that has reinforced fenestrations or branches in the graft through which covered stent grafts can be deployed to preserve blood flow into visceral branch vessels.\n\nThe branched stent graft is deployed to reline the peri-visceral abdominal aorta. Proximal and distal fixation and seal can be achieved using the branched device, additional Cook Alpha Thoracic devices and/or the Cook Zenith\u00ae Flex\u00ae device depending on the aortic anatomy.\n\nOnce the aortic stent grafts are deployed, the branches are then created. Wires and catheters are used to cross through the reinforced fenestrations into the target visceral arteries. Covered stents are then deployed to extend from the modified aortic graft to the target vessel. The branch stents must create a hemostatic seal with the main endograft as these branches will be constructed within the aneurysm sac. Single or multiple stents may be required for any given branch."
