The study will recruit 20 adult participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from nephrology clinics in the Bronx. The diet emphasizes limiting animal and high saturated fat foods with focus on anti-inflammatory foods/food components specific to the cultural context of the participant. The diet will also be tailored to needs of the CKD population including a focus on lowering sodium intake. The intervention will be delivered by an experienced nutritionist with expertise providing dietary counseling to patients with CKD. The investigative team will assess whether the diet is feasible, acceptable, and safe in patients with CKD through dietary intake assessments, questionnaires and serum biomarkers. Information from study will help inform the study design and intervention of a future large-scale, study aimed at improving CKD outcomes. The clinical site for the proposed study is at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center."
