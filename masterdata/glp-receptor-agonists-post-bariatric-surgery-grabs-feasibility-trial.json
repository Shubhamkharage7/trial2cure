            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of Tirzepatide in patients with persistent obesity (BMI \\> 30) 12 months after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass). The investigators also aim to determine the frequency of side effects with Tirzepatide in this patient population. Patients who take tirzepatide 12 months after bariatric surgery will be compared to patients who receive a placebo.",
            "detailedDescription": "Obesity affects nearly half of the U.S. population, impacting health outcomes including diabetes, cardiovascular risk, longevity, and quality of life. While bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass stands as the most effective intervention, 65% of individuals experience persistent obesity when undergoing surgical weight loss alone. Given the wide-ranging impact of obesity on health outcomes, a critical need exists to explore the efficacy of adjuvant weight loss therapies after gastric bypass surgery. Tirzepatide (TRZ), a type of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, shows remarkable effectiveness in medical obesity with 25% weight loss after sustained therapy. However, nearly two-thirds of patients taking medications like TRZ have mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. These medication side-effects could be a consequence of gastroparesis via vagal stimulation of the stomach, and may represent a major driver of weight loss. Limited data exist regarding use of these newer agents, such as TRZ, in patients who have undergone gastric bypass, which disrupts vagal nerves responsible for managing food transit and gastric emptying. This is a major and timely scientific gap in understanding whether gastric bypass surgery might mitigate these GI symptoms while allowing for enhanced weight loss with adjuvant TRZ use in the post-operative period. The investigators propose a pilot, phase II, open-label trial enrolling patients twelve months after gastric bypass with a nadir Body Mass Index \u2265 30 kg/m2. Study subjects will be randomized to either 24 weeks of TRZ or post-surgery standard of care. Our proposal consists of two aims. First, the investigators will determine the impact of adjuvant TRZ administration on weight, total fat mass, and lean body mass in patients with a history of gastric bypass (Aim 1). Second, the investigators aim to investigate the frequency and severity of GI discomfort associated with TRZ utilizing a validated patient reported outcome questionnaire, and they will investigate the impact of TRZ on GI motility in patients with prior Gastric Bypass (Aim 2)."

Should patients not tolerate a higher dose a second time, they will have the dose again lowered by 2.5 mg and kept at the lower dose for the remainder of the study, except for patients who do not tolerate two attempts at 5 mg. For patients who fail to titrate to at least 5 mg TRZ, a third attempt at an increased dose will be attempted 4 weeks after the second decrease in dose.
