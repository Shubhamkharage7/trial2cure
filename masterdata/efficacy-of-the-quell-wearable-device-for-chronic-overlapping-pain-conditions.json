Participants will attend two quantitative sensory testing visits in order to determine their level of pain sensitivity, one at the beginning of the study and the second at the 3-month Follow-up session. Participants will be asked to test out the Quell device to check for sensation tolerance, and will then be randomized into one of the two treatment groups: the High Intensity Quell group or the Low Intensity Quell group. Participants will be asked to wear the device for at least 3 hours every day and to complete daily assessments, along with a total of three sets of questionnaires: one at the start of the study, the second 6 weeks from the date of consent, and the third 3 months after the date of consent. A member of the research staff will call participants once a week for a brief phone interview throughout the study. Participants will be in this study for 3 months."
