Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue.\n   * Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Have adequate organ function as defined in the following table (Table 1). Blood must be collected within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to treatment (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137).\n* Patients must not have received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents or radiation therapy for PNS SCC but could have received treatment for prior cancers if greater than 2 years (refer to Item 8 for further details).",
