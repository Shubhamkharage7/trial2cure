The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n\u2022 how well does this medication help improve MGUS associated peripheral neuropathy\n\nParticipants will be asked be asked to get some testing done prior to starting the trial in order for us to assess your nerve damage or peripheral neuropathy. This will include blood tests, a complete neurologic examination, surveys and tests called electromyogram and nerve conduction studies. Participants that qualify for the trial will take DARZALEX FASPRO\u00ae once a week for two months, followed by every other week from months 3 to month 6."

Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of HBV vaccination, do not need to be testing for HBV DNA by PCR.\n   3. Seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response \\[SVR\\], defined as a viremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy).\n7. Patients who have implanted deep brain stimulators and vagal nerve stimulators.\n8. Clinically significant cardiac disease, including:\n\n   1.
