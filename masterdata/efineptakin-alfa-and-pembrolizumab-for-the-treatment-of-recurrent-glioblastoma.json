            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests the safety and side effects of efineptakin alfa and pembrolizumab in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent). Efineptakin alfa is an immunotherapy drug that works by helping the immune system fight tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving efineptakin alfa and pembrolizumab may kill more tumor cells in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the efficacy of pembrolizumab + efineptakin alfa (NT-I7) in combination with surgery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) using the rate of overall survival at 9 months.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess progression-free survival in recurrent GBM patients treated with pembrolizumab + NT-I7 in combination with surgery.\n\nII. To determine the objective response rate in recurrent GBM patients treated with pembrolizumab + NT-I7 in combination with surgery.\n\nIII. To assess changes in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) over time in recurrent GBM patients treated with pembrolizumab + NT-I7 in combination with surgery.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the adverse event (AE) and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab + NT-I7 in combination with surgery in patients with recurrent GBM.\n\nII. To assess the anti-glioma immune response in patients with recurrent GBM, before and after pembrolizumab and NT-I7 treatment, including assessment of cytokine profiling, immune cell phenotyping, function, and activation in the pre/post-treatment blood and tumor tissue when available.\n\nIII. To test tumor mutation burden on tumor/immune cells by validated comprehensive genomic profiling.\n\nIV. To evaluate the changes for tumor microenvironment (TME) post pembrolizumab and NT-I7 and their correlations with treatment response and survival.\n\nV. To evaluate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (CD4, CD8, Treg, etc) in the tumor tissue pre- and post-treatment (when available).\n\nVI. To assess changes in repertoire breadth and clonality by T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing.\n\nVII. To explore potential tissue and blood biomarkers that may predict response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nBEFORE SURGERY: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and efineptakin alfa intramuscularly (IM) on day 1. Patients then undergo surgery 1 week later.\n\nAFTER SURGERY: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes and efineptakin alfa IM on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 42 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 2-3 months until disease progression (if applicable), and then every 6 months for up to 5 years from study registration."
