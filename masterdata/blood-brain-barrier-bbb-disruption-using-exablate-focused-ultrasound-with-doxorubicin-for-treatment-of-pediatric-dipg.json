The study will be conducted at up to three sites in the United States. Patients will undergo 3 treatment cycles, approximately 4 -6 weeks apart. The study aims to establish feasibility and safety of Exablate BBBD in conjunction with Doxorubicin in the treatment of pediatric DIPG and assess preliminary efficacy in this patient population."
