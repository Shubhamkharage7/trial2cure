The aims are:\n\nAIM 1: To test the hypothesis that muscle fatigue is attenuated in older adults consuming beef compared to older adults consuming a plant-based diet.\n\nAIM2: To test the hypothesis that daily beef consumption improves biochemical indicators related to muscle fatigue.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to consume either a beef-based diet or vegetarian diet under controlled-feeding conditions for 8 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, participants will cross-over to consume either the beef diet or vegetarian diet for 8 weeks. Body composition and functional muscle outcomes will be measured during each 8-week feeding period. Blood samples will also be collected."
