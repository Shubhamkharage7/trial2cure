The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does occupational therapy integrating horses improve self-regulation in autistic youth\n* Does occupational therapy integrating horses affect salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase\n\nParticipants will receive 10 weeks of occupational therapy, and will be asked to provide saliva samples each week.\n\nResearchers will compare occupational therapy integrating horses to occupational therapy in a clinic to see if integrating horses affects self-regulation.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this project is to quantify the unique benefits of integrating horses in occupational therapy compared to occupational therapy in a clinic (i.e., OTEE HORS vs. OT Clinic) for improving self-regulation in youth with ASD.\n\nTo address both aims we will randomize 64 youth with ASD ages 6-11 years old to OTEE HORS or OT clinic.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Examine the preliminary efficacy of OTEE HORS compared to OT Clinic on self-regulation. Hypotheses: The OTEE HORS group will demonstrate significantly larger improvements than the OT Clinic group in five domains of self-regulation (hyperactivity \\[primary\\], irritability, emotional reactivity, dysphoria, and individual goal attainment).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Identify potential physiological mechanisms that explain how integration of horses in occupational therapy impacts self-regulation in youth with ASD. Hypotheses 2A \\& B: The OTEE HORS group will demonstrate significantly larger decreases in salivary cortisol after each 60-minute therapy session and after the 10-week treatment course in comparison to the OT Clinic group. Hypotheses 2C \\& 2D: The OTEE HORS group will demonstrate significantly greater increases in salivary alpha-amylase after each 60-minute therapy session, and significantly greater decreases in salivary alpha-amylase over time as measured after the 10-week treatment course in comparison to the OT Clinic group. Exploratory Hypothesis 2E: Changes in physiological measures will significantly correlate with changes in Aim 1 behavioral measures."
