            "detailedDescription": "Background: T2D disproportionately impacts Latino children, families and communities. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) established that T2D can be prevented in high-risk adults through intensive lifestyle intervention. Although the DPP has been translated to a variety of adult populations and settings, engagement and effectiveness is diminished in minority communities and there are no family-focused diabetes prevention trials for Latinos. The culturally-grounded approach is guided by an Ecodevelopmental model that considers community, family, peer, and individual-level factors that influence health behaviors and health outcomes over time. The study will test the efficacy of a 16-week family-focused lifestyle intervention for reducing T2D risk and increasing QoL among high-risk Latino families as compared to control families. The study will use Integrative Mixed Methods to understand how family structures and processes influence intervention outcomes."
