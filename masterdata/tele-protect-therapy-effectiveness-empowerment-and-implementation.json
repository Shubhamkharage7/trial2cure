            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this randomized trial is to conduct a fully powered effectiveness trial of video-delivered PROTECT (Tele-PROTECT) compared to a video-delivered depression education (DepEd) control condition to be delivered to 140 English- and Spanish-speaking NYC elder abuse victims. Investigators hypothesize three main aims:\n\n1. Effectiveness Aim: Tele-PROTECT participants will have significantly greater and clinically meaningful reductions in depression when compared to the DepEd control;\n2. Abuse Impact Aim: Tele-PROTECT participants will demonstrate greater safety related empowerment compared to DepEd control, which can help participants take steps to reduce risk;\n3. Implementation Aim: Stakeholders' views of the factors impacting the implementation of Tele-PROTECT based on characteristics of the intervention, agency setting, and population served will contribute to a national dissemination of Tele-PROTECT\n\nParticipants will\n\n* Receive 9 weeks of tele health psychotherapy delivered by a Master's level mental health clinician from the Weill Cornell Medicine research team. Participants will be assigned to \"Tele-PROTECT\" or \"DepEd\" psychotherapy randomly.\n* Participate in one baseline assessment and four follow-up assessments at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 administered by a trained member of the research team.",
            "detailedDescription": "The WHO estimates that 1 in 6 older adults have experienced elder abuse in the past year with rates in the community increasing by as much as 83.6% during the pandemic. Elder abuse (EA) takes a serious physical and emotional toll on older adults, including premature mortality, physical injuries and financial losses. EA victims in NYC are more likely to be women than men, and more likely to be women of color.\n\nPrevious work by the investigators has demonstrated that 1/3 of victims have clinically significant depressive symptoms. Abused older adults with depression have higher rates of mortality and suicidal ideation. Depression is an additional barrier to implementing safety steps to reduce victimization. PRoviding Options To Elderly Clients Together (PROTECT) is a behavioral intervention for depressed elder abuse victims. It is the only manualized therapy for depressed elder abuse victims designed to be integrated with elder abuse services. It is aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan \"to deliver high quality, impactful research and promote translation of such research into clinical practice\" and to serve \"underrepresented and underserved communities.\"\n\nThe investigators developed PROTECT to work in synergy with abuse resolution services. PROTECT reduces depression by increasing engagement in pleasurable and rewarding activities and taking steps towards goals to reduce threat. PROTECT has been designed in an iterative process with partners at the New York City (NYC) Dept. for the Aging (DFTA). In the investigators' pilot randomized controlled trial, PROTECT showed an increase in behavioral activation (BADS) and significantly decreased depression as compared to a referral control condition. PROTECT has been adopted by DFTA (Community PROTECT) to increase its use.\n\nIn collaboration with partners at DFTA and five NYC elder abuse agencies, the investigators propose a fully powered effectiveness trial of video-delivered PROTECT (Tele-PROTECT) compared to a video- delivered depression education (DepEd) control condition to be delivered to 140 English- and Spanish- speaking NYC elder abuse victims. In partnership with a national elder abuse organization (NAPSA), and using the CFIR, the investigators will examine factors that could affect future implementation of Tele-PROTECT nationally."

Further, the Center will use NDA technologies to submit data in accordance with the NDA Data Sharing Terms and Conditions. This project will share data comparing the effectiveness of the Tele-PROTECT Intervention against the Depression Education (DepEd) Intervention. Investigators will comply with NIMH's procedures for data deposition into NDCT, and will let NDCT policies dictate the timetable upon which and avenues through which others will be allowed to access those data. Investigators will make the dataset available to other researchers after the main results have been published. Investigators will de- identify the data in the final datasets prior to release for sharing.",
