            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of ADELANTE on viral suppression among Latinos with HIV and viral non-suppression. Participants will receive ADELANTE (5-session, community health worker-delivered, problem-solving intervention) or enhanced care condition (ECC, 5 reminder phone calls). We will evaluate the overall effectiveness of ADELANTE compared with ECC on rates of viral suppression and emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Our hypothesis is that ADELANTE participants will achieve higher rates of viral suppression and will have lower rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations compared with ECC at 12 months post-randomization.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be Latinx/Hispanic individuals age \u226518 years who are at least 6 months since initiation of HIV treatment and have evidence of viral non-suppression (HIV RNA \u2265200 cpm). Participants will be recruited from two Ryan White-funded clinics in geographic priority areas in the US Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Plan due to high HIV incidences and prevalence. In the intervention, a bilingual (English-Spanish speaking) community health worker (CHW) will deliver a manualized problem-solving intervention that is framed around an HIV-focused telenovela, or drama-based film. The CHW will deliver five sessions within 6 months. The CHW will assist in problem-solving to improve behavioral activation and self-management skills and help participants adhere to HIV treatment and attend medical appointments. The CHW will also link patients to resources. In the enhanced care condition, participants will receive 5 phone calls. They will not receive the intervention or access to navigation beyond routine care. Measurements will occur at baseline, month-3, month-6, and month-12 post randomization by study staff blinded to the allocation status of participants. Participants will be remunerated for each assessment."
