            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the initial (phase I) portion of this study is to find a dose level and administration schedule of the study drug, 225Ac-J591, that can be given without severe side effects. The purpose of the second (phase II) portion of the study is to determine the proportion of those with PSMA-positive tumors with \\>50% PSA decline following 225Ac-J591 treatment in two regimens.",
            "detailedDescription": "This clinical trial is for men with progressive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose level of the study drug, 225Ac-J591, that can be given without severe side effects. The research study is being done because the standard treatments for prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the disease. These treatments, however, are not curative. Patients who choose to participate in this study will have a screening visit to determine whether or not they are eligible to participate in the study. The treatment phase is comprised of 8 weeks for the fractionated dose cohort (starting from cycle 1, day 1). For the multiple-dose cohort, the dose-limiting toxicity evaluation period is from date of first treatment through treatment on cycle 3, day 1. Following treatment, short-term follow up is planned until radiographic progression, expected to be 6 months.The study medication is called 225Ac-J591, and will be administered as a single fractionated cycle day 1 and day 15 in the fractionated dose regimen and as a single dose per cycle repeated every 6 weeks in the multiple dose regimen. Upon completion of investigational treatment with 225Ac-J591, subjects will undergo 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC injection and same day PET/CT at the end of study visit to document treatment response. 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC is comprised of gallium-68, which is a positron-emitting radionuclide linked to PSMA-HBED-CC (aka PSMA11), which is a small molecule targeting PSMA. 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC will be administered intravenously prior to PET/CT at screening and at follow up imaging x2. Subsequent survival data and additional treatment(s) information will be captured from their routine standard of care (SOC) visits. During the other study visits, participants will undergo routine tests and procedures, such as physical examinations, and blood tests. Some blood tests will be done for research purposes only. After completion of therapy, participants may be contacted on a periodic basis to see how they are doing.\n\nKey eligibility:\n\n* Open to men age 18 and older.\n* Diagnosis of progressive metastatic prostate cancer\n* Have been previously treated for their disease with particular types of therapy"
