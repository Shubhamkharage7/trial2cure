Data will be collected from enrolled pregnant women and the healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in their care or the care of their infants, if applicable.",
            "detailedDescription": "The outcomes of interest include major congenital malformation (MCM; primary outcome), minor congenital malformation, spontaneous abortion (SAB), stillbirth, elective termination, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm birth, postnatal growth deficiency, and infant developmental deficiency.\n\nPregnancy outcomes will be assessed throughout pregnancy, with data collection occurring at enrollment, the end of the second trimester, and pregnancy outcome. Infant outcomes will be assessed throughout the infant's first year of life, with active data collection by the registry occurring at 4 and 12 months after delivery. Enrolled pregnant women and the healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in their care or the care of their infants, if applicable, will serve as data reporters to the registry.\n\nThe registry is strictly observational; the schedule of office visits and all treatment regimens will be determined by HCPs. Only data that are documented in patients' medical records during the course of medical care will be collected. No additional laboratory tests or HCP assessments will be required as part of this registry."
