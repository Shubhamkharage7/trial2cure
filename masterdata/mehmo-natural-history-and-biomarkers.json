A major impediment to the testing of potential therapeutic interventions is the lack of well-defined outcome measures. This protocol seeks to identify biochemical and clinical markers to monitor disease progression, and better understand the natural history of these conditions.\n\nAny person diagnosed with MEHMO syndrome or related conditions, who can travel to the NIH Clinical Center can participate in this study.\n\nThe study involves:\n\n* General health assessment and evaluation\n* Imaging studies\n* Laboratory tests\n* Collection of blood, urine, spinal fluid, skin biopsy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description: This is a prospective natural history study of individuals who have MEHMO syndrome or eIF2-pathway related conditions, or who are carriers of EIF2S3-related conditions to generate hypotheses for further understanding of disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis, management, and treatment. The protocol aims to enroll and follow affected or carrier individuals longitudinally to establish a repository of concurrent evaluations and biomaterials, as well as to enroll unaffected individuals for collection of informative comparable data and samples.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nCharacterize the presentation of MEHMO syndrome and eIF2 pathway related conditions.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. Identify disease-reflective fluid biomarkers\n2. Develop a disease severity rating scale or classification algorithm\n3. Assess tolerability and feasibility of study evaluations\n4. Establish a repository of participant data and samples for future research\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nFrequency and time-to-event of signs and symptoms.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n1. Mean difference of candidate fluid biomarkers level in affected versus carrier versus unaffected individuals\n2. Correlation of rating scale or classification algorithm to age, genotype, or other variables\n3. Frequency of completed evaluations and reasons for Noncompletion\n\nStudy Population: 25 affected individuals 1-week of age or older 25 EIF2S3-variant carrier individuals 1-month of age or older 50 unaffected individuals 1 month of age or older of any sex, race, ethnicity, geographic location who can participate without increased risk to personal health."
