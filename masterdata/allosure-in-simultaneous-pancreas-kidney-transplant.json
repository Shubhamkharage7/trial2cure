Limited biomarkers are utilized to monitor the health of the allografts. For kidney transplantation serum creatinine remains the most commonly monitored biomarker; for the pancreas allograft blood glucose and serum amylase and lipase are measured. However, these biomarkers are imprecise and non-specific for rejection.\n\nIn kidney transplantation cell free donor derived DNA at of value of \\>1% has emerged as an effective immune monitoring tool as a marker for renal allograft rejection and injury. Thus far, a discriminatory donor derived cell free DNA value for a stable and rejecting allografts has not been established for recipients of combined kidney-pancreas transplants.\n\nStudy aim will be to help establish a normal range of donor derived cell free DNA in stable kidney-pancreas graft function in combined kidney pancreas transplant recipients while determining changes in cell free DNA in kidney-pancreas recipients with biopsy proven allograft rejection."
