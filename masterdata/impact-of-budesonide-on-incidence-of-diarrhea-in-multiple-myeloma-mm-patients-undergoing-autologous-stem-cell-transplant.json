PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement system used to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials based on symptom frequency, severity, interference, amount, and presence/absence. PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 (absent) to 4 (very frequent, severe, etc.), or 0/1 for absent/present."
