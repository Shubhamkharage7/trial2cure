            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeriodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) is the most common periodic fever syndrome of childhood. Symptoms can include swelling of the glands in the throat, mouth ulcers, and tonsillitis. Removal of the tonsils can stop the periodic flareups. But researchers do not know how PFAPA develops. In this natural history study, researchers will collect specimens and data from people with PFAPA to see what they might have in common.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo collect blood and other specimens from people with PFAPA to learn more about the illness.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 1 month or older with symptoms of PFAPA or another tonsil disorder.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. Their medical records will be reviewed. Researchers will ask about a family history of PFAPA.\n\nThe following specimens may be collected:\n\nBlood. Blood will be drawn either from a needle inserted into a vein or from a prick in the finger or heel.\n\nMucus and cells. A stick with soft padding on the tip may be rubbed inside the nostrils or mouth.\n\nStool.\n\nSaliva.\n\nTissue samples may be taken if participants are having surgery to remove the tonsils or adenoids. Participants having surgery may also have a nasopharyngeal wash; salt water will be squirted into the back of the throat and then sucked back out with a syringe.\n\nMost participants will provide specimens only once. They can do this in person at the clinic; they can also have their local health providers send specimens to the researchers. Some participants may have optional follow-up visits over 10 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThe purpose of this multisite study is to collect specimens and data from patients with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome and other tonsil disorders for genetic, immunologic, cellular, molecular, and microbial research into the pathogenesis of these conditions. Specimens include blood, saliva, buccal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal wash, and/or stool. If a participant is scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, then leftover clinical specimens will also be collected for research. Participants may either be seen in person at the study sites or may be seen remotely via telehealth and provide send-in samples collected locally.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo collect samples to understand the immunologic mechanisms and genetic and microbial risk factors for PFAPA and other tonsil disorders.\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\n1. Identify genetic risk variants for PFAPA and other tonsil disorders.\n2. Characterize immune cell populations, gene expression (including at the single-cell level), epigenetic features, and protein expression ex vivo in blood, tissue, washes, or swabs from people with PFAPA and other tonsil disorders.\n3. Characterize the tonsillar/adenoid, oral, nasal and/or stool microbiota in people with PFAPA and other tonsil disorders.\n4. Characterize clinical outcomes following tonsillectomy and other clinically indicated treatments.\n\nSecondary Objective: To understand the characteristics and function of unique cell populations in the pharyngeal lymphoid tissues (tonsils and adenoids) and how immune responses to antigens are generated in these tissues.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n1. Study responses to antigens and infection in the mucosal lymphoid tissue and peripheral blood.\n2. Characterize unique immune cell populations present in the mucosal tissue.\n3. Characterize immunologic and molecular pathways in the tissue cells."
