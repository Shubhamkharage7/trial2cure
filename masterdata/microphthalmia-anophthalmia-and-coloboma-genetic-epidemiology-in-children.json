            "detailedDescription": "This study is focused on gathering data on individuals diagnosed with some of the more common visually threatening congenital eye defects collectively referred to as MAC complex; anophthalmia (total absence of the globe), microphthalmia (anomalously small eye in the orbit), and coloboma (failure of the closure of the fetal fissure).\n\nOur long-term goal is to improve prevention efforts for and clinical management of MAC. The objectives of the current study are to 1) better define the MAC phenotype and 2) characterize the role of known and newly identified pathogenic genetic variants that confer MAC susceptibility.\n\nTo do this, the investigators are leveraging resources to identify MAC cases through the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR), Texas Children's Hospital (TCH), and through direct referrals from our study partners. The investigators intend to conduct secondary analyses by leveraging the existing collaborative relationship with the New York State Newborn Screening Program (NYSNSP). Also, the investigators are utilizing the resources of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center to comprehensively phenotype cases with MAC, and the National Eye Institute (NEI) Ophthalmic Genomics Laboratory to identify genetic variants underlying MAC phenotypes."
