This study does not involve any experimental treatments.\n\nParticipants will have a physical examination and laboratory tests on blood, stool, or urine. Blood samples may be collected at regular intervals, but no more than 450 ml (15 ounces) of blood will be drawn from adults, and no more than 7 ml (1-1/2 teaspoons) per kg (2.2 pounds) of body weight from children, in any 6-week period. Other tests may include x-rays, electrocardiogram (EKG), or tissue biopsy (surgical removal of a small tissue sample), depending on the individual s condition.\n\nPatients may be offered treatment or may be referred to another study that is more appropriate for the problem. Any treatment provided in this study will be according to standard medical practice for the patient s specific medical problem. Patients responses to treatment will be evaluated at regularly scheduled clinic visits. The length of time between visits and the total duration of the study for a given individual will be determined by the study doctor, based on that person s medical condition.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is designed as a prospective study to evaluate and treat patients with parasitic infection. Patients with known or suspected parasitic infection will be enrolled and will be evaluated for the presence of a parasitic infection. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit will include a medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, and specialized diagnostic procedures for possible parasitic infections. Treatment plans will be individualized for each patient's particular condition, and the number and length of additional visits and diagnostic evaluations will vary accordingly. Specific treatment regimens will be in accordance with standard medical practice."
