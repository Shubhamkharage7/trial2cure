            "detailedDescription": "This is a research study to find out if vaccination with either two or four investigational vaccines given at 2 separate visits will be safe, and to evaluate if the vaccines improve immune system response to help the body get rid of HIV in the cells.\n\nStudy participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the vaccines, or a placebo injection with no vaccine.\n\nVaccines will be given as an intramuscular (IM) injection on Day 0 and 28 days later. After each injection, participants will be evaluated and monitored at the research clinic for any reactions. There are 11 non-vaccination study visits requiring blood tests and exams and 6 phone visits. In addition a leukapheresis (a blood collection procedure) will occur at 2 timepoints in the study."

Use of any other investigational treatment within 6 months prior to enrollment, with the exception of Phase II or higher studies of antiretroviral agents.\n\n    NOTE: Co-enrollment with other studies under an IND using an FDA approved medication that are not otherwise listed as prohibited will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n14. For any serious illness requiring systemic treatment or hospitalization, the participant must either complete therapy or be clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the site investigator, for at least 90 days prior to enrollment.\n15. History of inflammatory diseases involving the peripheral or central nervous system, including but not limited to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), myasthenia gravis, optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation.\n16. History of pregnancy, head trauma or major surgery within 90 days prior to enrollment, that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation.\n\n    NOTE: Minor surgery within 90 days prior to screening and not resulting in reduced mobility will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n17. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition, other than HIV infection, that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation.\n18. History of malignancy within the last 3 years. NOTE: History of non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell skin cancer) is not exclusionary with documentation of resolution per topical treatment or complete resection as determined by a dermatologist at least 3 months prior to enrollment.\n19.

Unstable asthma (e.g. sudden acute attacks occurring without an obvious trigger) or asthma requiring:\n\n    1. Daily steroid or long-acting beta-agonist prevention\n    2. Hospitalization in the last two years\n30. Active chronic skin problems such as eczema or psoriasis not controlled with topical treatments.\n31. Inability to communicate effectively with study personnel.",
