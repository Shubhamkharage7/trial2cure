            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of abemaciclib and how well it works with radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients with high-risk adipocytic retroperitoneal sarcoma. Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving abemaciclib together with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink tumors in patients with high-risk adipocytic retroperitoneal sarcoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of abemaciclib.\n\nPrior to surgery, patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radiation therapy over 28 fractions starting on cycle 1 day 15 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of radiation therapy, patients may undergo surgery. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."
