            "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot study is to assess the impact of yoga as a treatment modality in pediatric patients age 8-18 diagnosed with idiopathic overactive bladder as measured by validated questionnaires and urinary biomarkers. The main question it aims to answer is: Does yoga help improve overactive bladder symptoms in this patient population? Participants will take part in a weekly yoga session for a total of 6 weeks with validated questionnaires and urinary samples for biomarkers to be completed at the beginning, middle and end of the study. This study will follow a cross-over study design and patients will receive standard of care while not in the active treatment arm.",
            "detailedDescription": "Detrusor overactivity, otherwise known as overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common disease of voiding dysfunction in children and is characterized by urgency with or without incontinence. Current understanding of OAB suggests that it is a component of central sensitization whereby the central nervous system is in a persistent state of high reactivity. In this state, patients have lower thresholds for pain and for normal physiologic signals such as the sensation of bladder fullness. Yoga has been shown to favor parasympathetic output and appears to be effective in reversing central sensitization for patients with chronic pain. Further, both central sensitization and OAB have been associated with inflammation and so observation of urinary markers of inflammation allow an objective measurement, along with subjective symptom reporting, to measure treatment effects. Children with OAB are likely to become adults with similar urinary complaints and are also more likely to have anxiety, depression and other problems throughout development and maturation. Treatment for OAB in children is comprised of first conservative management with behavioral therapies including biofeedback, subsequent addition of pharmacologic treatment options and finally more invasive therapies including intradetrusor botulinum toxin injections and neuromodulation.\n\nYoga has been shown to have some positive health benefits in pediatric patients with pulmonary dysfunction, epilepsy, anxiety/depression and even in pediatric oncology patients with regards to quality of life during treatment. Additionally, yoga has been assessed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of urinary incontinence and overactive bladder in predominantly adult female populations. That said, to date there have been no studies assessing the impact of yoga on detrusor overactivity in pediatric patient populations (\\< 19 years old). This is a pilot study in which the investigators hypothesize that yoga will lead to improved quality of life, reduced urinary symptoms and reduced expression of inflammatory urinary biomarkers."

The first group will be comprised of 8-12-year-old and the second group will be comprised of 13 - 18-year-old. These will be divided within each treatment arm (i.e Arm 1.1 and 1.2) and the interventions will remain the same.",
