If the participant does not have symptoms of a UTI at enrollment, the antibiotic will be taken only if needed at home upon the first occurrence of a UTI.\n* At the time of consent, participants will also be given 250 mg of the probiotic, S.\n\nboulardii, taken once daily for 6 months, irrespective of symptoms.\n\n- Throughout the study, participants will receive their standard clinical care for recurrent UTI treatment, which includes bowel and bladder dysfunction management and other prescribed non-antibiotic interventions at the managing provider's clinical discretion."
