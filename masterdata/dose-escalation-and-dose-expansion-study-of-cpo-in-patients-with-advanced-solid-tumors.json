            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of CPO-100 administered intravenously in cycles of 3 weekly doses with 1 week rest (1 cycle = 4 weeks) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study has three parts. Part A-1 is a dose-escalation phase with a modified \"3+3\" design in patients with metastatic or unresectable advanced solid tumors to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) as a single agent. Two patients will be enrolled at each of the first 2 dose levels and observed for safety during the first cycle. If there are no \u2265Grade 2 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) that are clinically significant and attributed to the study drug as assessed by the investigator during Cycle 1 for any of the patients in the first two dose levels, the 3rd dose level and beyond will follow the traditional 3+3 design. Dose escalation during the \"3+3\" period for each subsequent cohort of patients will be guided by the incidence of CPO-100-related adverse events (AE) as graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) CTCAE v5.0 in the first 4 weeks of dosing \\[the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) evaluation period\\].\n\nIn Part A-2, the starting dose for this part will be 45 mg/m2. This dose was established in Part A-1 as being that dose at which the use of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ()G-CSF is indicated given that the only Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events noted were related to neutropenia and was well managed with G-CSF support. Prophylactic use of G-CSF will be permitted in Cycle 1 based on the investigator judgement.\n\nThis additional intervention of primary prophylaxis will be explored in order to determine if the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) under these circumstances is reduced. Dose escalation during the 3+3 period for each subsequent cohort of patients will be guided by the incidence of CPO-100-related adverse events (AE) as graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 in the first 4 weeks of dosing (the DLT evaluation period).\n\nAfter the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of weekly dosing schedule has been established, a recommended Phase 2 dose will be selected based on evaluation of the PK, and safety and tolerability profile on all available Part A study data by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The selection of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will consider all available clinical and non-clinical CPO-100 data as well as relevant docetaxel published data.\n\nPart B expansion phase will further evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as the preliminary antitumor activity at the selected RP2D. Four cohorts of patients are included in Part B:\n\n* Cohort 1: taxane na\u00efve advanced/metastatic gastric, head and neck, lung, and ovarian cancers\n* Cohort 2: taxane na\u00efve advanced/metastatic breast cancer\n* Cohort 3: taxane na\u00efve advanced /metastatic prostate cancer\n* Cohort 4: advanced/metastatic breast or ovarian cancer who have either progressed on a taxane or have developed progressive disease within 6 months of receiving a taxane.\n\nThe taxane na\u00efve patient population is defined as patients who have not received taxane or taxane-based therapies for their metastatic diseases or patients who had suboptimal taxane exposure defined as having received less than 2 cycles of taxane or taxane-based therapies due to intolerability for their metastatic diseases. Patients who have received taxane or taxane-based therapies for their neoadjuvant treatment or patients who have received taxane or taxane-based therapies for their adjuvant treatment without disease progression during treatment are also considered taxane na\u00efve, as long as they have not received taxane or taxane-based therapies to treat the metastatic diseases.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 60 patients can be enrolled in Parts A-1 and A-2. The exact number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels tested. A total of 60 patients, 15 patients in each cohort will be enrolled in Part B.\n\nThe total duration of the study is estimated to be approximately 5 years. Patients may continue receiving CPO-100 until criteria for withdrawal are met. Patients deriving clinical benefit may continue to receive study medication for as long as they are benefiting from treatment. In the event the study closes or terminates while patients are still benefiting from and receiving CPO-100, every effort will be made to continue drug supply."

With the exception of Cohort 4 above, taxane na\u00efve patients must not have received taxane or taxane based therapies for their metastatic diseases. Patients who had suboptimal taxane exposure defined as having received less than 2 cycles of taxane or taxane based therapies due to intolerability for their metastatic diseases, patients who have received taxane or taxane based therapies for their neoadjuvant treatment or patients who have received taxane or taxane based therapies for their adjuvant treatment without disease progression during treatment are also considered taxane na\u00efve, as long as they have not received taxane or taxane based therapies to treat the metastatic diseases.\n\nExclusion Criteria - Part A and B\n\n1. Most recent chemotherapy \u226414 days or have residual NCI CTCAE greater than Grade 1 chemotherapy-related side effects, with the exception of alopecia.\n2. Use of any experimental drug \u226428 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of CPO-100. For study drugs for which 5 half-lives is \u226428 days, a minimum of 14 days between termination of the study drug and administration of CPO-100 is required.\n3. Wide field radiotherapy (including therapeutic radioisotopes such as strontium 89 and lutetium 177) administered \u226428 days or limited field radiation for palliation \u22647 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from side effects of such therapy.\n4. Major surgical procedures \u226428 days of beginning study drug, or minor surgical procedures \u22647 days. No waiting required following port-a-cath placement.\n5.
