The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* To evaluate the efficacy of CIN-103 on symptoms of IBS-D when given to patients with IBS-D compared to a placebo.\n* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CIN-103 when given to patients with IBS-D compared to a placebo\n\nParticipants will attend the following visits:\n\n* Screening Period (1 Visit)\n* Baseline Period (1 Visit)\n\n  * Will complete daily diary and other Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) as described in the protocol to assess eligibility for continued participation.\n* 12-Week Treatment Period (5 Visits)\n\n  * Study drug taken twice daily by mouth.\n  * Will complete daily diaries and other PROs as described in the protocol.\n* Follow- Up Period (1 Visit)\n\nResearchers will compare CIN-103 Dose 1, CIN-103 Dose 2, and placebo, to evaluate the clinical response to multiple dose strengths of CIN-103 relative to placebo on abdominal pain and stool consistency along with safety and tolerability."
