            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\n- The blood-brain barrier separates the brain from the rest of the body. Epilepsy is a neurological disease that causes seizures. It can affect this barrier. Researchers think a contrast agent called mangafodipir might be better able to show areas of the brain that epilepsy affects.\n\nObjective:\n\n- To see if mangafodipir is well tolerated and safe. To see if it can show, on an MRI, areas of the brain that epilepsy affects.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* People ages 18-60 who:\n* Have epilepsy not controlled by drugs\n* Prior or concurrent enrollment in 18-N-0066 is required\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with:\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Participants will have up to 6 visits in 1-3 months. Those with epilepsy will have an inpatient stay lasting 2-10 days. Visits may include:\n* Video-EEG monitoring for participants with epilepsy\n* An IV catheter put in place: a needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.\n* Getting mangafodipir through the IV.\n* 5 MRI scans over a 10-day period: a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. They are in the cylinder for 45-90 minutes, lying still for up to 10 minutes at a time. The scanner makes loud knocking sounds. Participants will get earplugs.\n* A final MRI at least 2 weeks after receiving mangafodipir. Gadolinium is given through an IV catheter....",
            "detailedDescription": "Objective:\n\nThe primary goals of this pilot study are to (1) describe the safety profile of administration of mangafodipir in patients with epilepsy and (2) investigate the prevalence of blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy using peri-ictal manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) and interictal gadolinium dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and determine if these methods will allow for visualization of seizure foci. Secondary objectives are further exploration of MEMRI and DCE-MRI properties in patients with epilepsy.\n\nStudy population:\n\n40 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.\n\nDesign:\n\nScreening of enrolled participants will include a medical history, physical exam, blood and urine laboratory testing. Patients will be imaged interictally with a gadolinium enhanced MRI session. The administration of mangafodipir will be done as an inpatient during long-term video EEG recording, to ensure administration in the periictal period. Patients will receive a baseline MRI scan, IV mangafodipir injection and will then be serially scanned with non-contrast MRI scans.\n\nOutcome measures:\n\nThe primary outcomes are (1) description of the safety profile of mangafodipir administration in patients with epilepsy, and (2) evaluation of the utility of MEMRI and/or DCE-MRI in identifying focal BBBD in the seizure onset zone identified by standard clinical, EEG, and imaging studies, and the homologous contralateral region."
