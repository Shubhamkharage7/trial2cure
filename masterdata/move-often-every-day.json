            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess a novel, widely-accessible intervention to both promote active breaks from work and improve cognitive and psychological performances at work in motivationally-accessible bouts. This will be done by interrupting prolonged sitting with 1-4 short (1-4 minutes), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) bouts with no equipment, and simple video-based instructions. The short bouts will be referred to as \"exercise snacks.\" In this proposed exercise snacks intervention, investigators explicitly target a population with sedentary jobs due to the generalizability.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will answer a short 5-10-minute survey to determine eligibility. Eligible candidates will be invited to attend a 30-minute self-directed orientation session to provide a description of the consent form, study objectives and time commitments, the purpose of randomization, and the importance of completing follow-up assessments regardless of outcome. After the orientation sessions, interested and eligible individuals will be sent the e-consent form.\n\nAfter participants consent to the study, they will be invited to take the baseline survey, and get assistance with study account set-ups (Garmin, GroupMe). Researchers will handle account set ups. Participants will be asked to download both apps and sign into the apps with the study provided accounts. Many individuals may have GroupMe accounts and will be asked to make a profile for their buddy chat with whatever name they prefer (able to hide their real name if preferred). Baseline measures will last for 2 weeks. And then the 6-week intervention will begin.\n\nAll consented participants will receive a 6-week intervention. The study is a 2x2 factorial design with 4 different group. We will be assessing the length of snacktivities (1 minute versus 4 minutes) as well as frequency of snacktivities through the day (1 per day versus 4 per day). Therefore, participants will be randomized into 4 groups: One 1-minute snacktivity per day, four 1-minute snacktivities per day, one 4-minute snacktivity per day, or four 4-minute snacktivities per day.\n\nThe intervention will consist of the following empirically supported components shown to promote engagement, adherence, and behavior change:\n\n1. Self-monitoring of activity: Participants will be instructed to timestamp and track their snacktivities each day using their phone. Each participant will receive bracelets (1 or 4) that can used to track progress. For example, participants will be taught how they can move the bracelets from one arm to the other to act as a visual aid of how many snacktivities they have done each day.\n2. Nightly reporting: Participants will be sent nightly texts to track progress on snacktivities as well as productivity, alertness, and physical energy.\n3. Weekly progress reports and tailored feedback: Each week of completion the participant will get a report of their adherence to the protocol for that week and their goals for next week. Embedded in the progress report will be a link for an interactive action plan survey to plan next week's exercises; the action plan is personalized, and incorporates motivational interviewing and problem-solving strategies. Action planning has high acceptability and is identified as an effective behavioral technique that enhances self-monitoring.\n4. Relatable modeling: Social modeling theory supports the use of relatable models representing the learner in behavior change and motivation. Dr. Oppezzo's previous work showed high acceptability when the exercise video models were representative of a diverse -body, -ethnicity, and -aged population. Each snacktivity instructional video will feature diverse models performing the moves in work clothes.\n5. Barrier problem solving: At baseline, study team members will work with participants to identify a feasible, safe, and comfortably private workday location for performing the activity breaks.\n6. Peer support: participants will be assigned a peer buddy who will act as a health-buddy motivational coach. This person will be in a private group-chat with their designated buddy (another participant) and our study account. The study account will monitor conversation and give motivational prompts, when needed, to boost conversation amongst the 2 buddies.\n\nDuring the maintenance phase (after the intervention phase and lasting 6 months), participants will take part in booster sessions. The first 2 booster sessions will be completed every month, and the following 2 booster sessions will be completed every 6 weeks, following a scaffolded design to ease participants off of the program.\n\nDuring the follow-up, investigators will collect behavioral data only via zoom. At the end of the study, we will conduct semi-structured interviews on study experience."
