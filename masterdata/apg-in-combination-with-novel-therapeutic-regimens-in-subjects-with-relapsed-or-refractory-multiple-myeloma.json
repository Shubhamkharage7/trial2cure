The study consists of dose escalation and dose expansion phases. The study consists of will start with 2 arms noted below, both arms are independent.\n\nArm A: APG-2575 will be administered in combination with Pd to determine the MTD and /RP2D of APG-2575 in subjects with R/R MM.\n\n3+3 design will be utilized in dose escalation phase of APG-2575 in combination with Pd. The starting target dose of APG-2575 is 400 mg (dose level; DL1) and will be escalated in subsequent cohorts to 600 mg (DL2), 800 mg (DL3) accordingly. Dose reduction to 200 mg (DL-1) is acceptable if APG-2575 at dose of 400 mg cannot be tolerated. This rule-based design proceeds with cohorts of three patients. If none of the three patients enrolled in DL1 experiences a DLT, another three patients will be treated at DL2, and so on. However, if one patient experiences a DLT, three more patients will be treated at the same dose level. The dose escalation continues until at least two patients among a cohort of three to six patients experience DLT. MTD is conventionally defined as the highest dose level at which \u2264 33% of patients experience DLT. Higher dose level would be considered after a comprehensive analyses of safety data in the context of 800 mg can be well tolerated, otherwise, 800 mg (DL3) should be considered as MTD (Arm A). RP2D (Arm A) will be determined based on efficacy and safety profile of APG-2575 in combination with Pd.\n\nPatients will receive APG-2575 at target dose once daily for 28 days plus pomalidomide (4 mg ) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg for patients \u2264 75 years old or 20 mg for patients \\> 75 years old) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a repeated 28-day cycle"
