Realizing there is a knowledge gap in applying ESG to morbidly obese patients with NAFLD, the investigators propose studying the efficacy of weight control and functional outcomes of ESG. This prospective pilot study is aimed to study the safety profiles, quality of life, and changes and improvements in the anthropometric, metabolic, and biochemical changes in these patients."
