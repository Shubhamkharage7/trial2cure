            "briefSummary": "Steering Teens Safe (STS) is an evidence-based and parent-focused intervention developed by the investigators, which aims to improve safe teen driving practices by enhancing parental communication skills. The objective of this translation study is to assess the effect of STS on driving outcomes among teen drivers who have committed a traffic violation, and to assess the adoption and implementation fidelity of STS in a county court setting and among these high-risk teen drivers and their parents. The investigators will test the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the effects of the intervention on parent-teen communications and risky driving outcomes (risky driving events, unsafe driving behaviors, and recidivism) among teen drivers with a traffic violation(s). Aim 2: Assess the adoption of the intervention and implementation fidelity We will enroll 90 parent-teen dyads, comprised a teen driver (16 to 17 years) who committed a moving violation and a parent/legal guardian, from the Ohio Franklin County Juvenile Traffic Court following the teens' mandatory court hearing. Enrolled dyads will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups (n=45/group): 1) Control, device installation only with no feedback to nor communication training for parents, or 2) Intervention, device feedback to teens and parents, and parents will also receive individualized virtual communication training. The expected outcome is to establish the effectiveness of STS augmented with driving feedback technology, and to establish the implementation fidelity of STS in a court setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are the leading cause of death among teenagers in the United States. Teen drivers who have committed a traffic violation are at an even greater risk for MVCs than their counterparts. While parent-focused interventions are an effective strategy to improve teen driving safety, most of these interventions target teen drivers are implemented as universal interventions (for teens of all risk profiles). Evidence on the effectiveness of these evidence-based interventions when translated and implemented among high-risk teen drivers such as those with a traffic citation is lacking.\n\nThe current project is significant because it will translate the STS program to the needs of high-risk teen drivers who have committed a traffic violation and their parents. This study is innovative because it partners with the local court system, and utilizes novel and cutting-edge in-vehicle technology. The findings of the current study will have a significant impact on juvenile traffic court's practices and policies aimed to improve teen driving safety by reducing MVC-related crashes, injuries, and deaths."

Recruitment will occur at the Franklin County Juvenile Traffic Court in Ohio following the parent-teen dyad's mandatory court appearance. After completing informed consent/assent and the baseline assessment, enrolled parent-teen dyads will be randomly assigned into either the Control or Intervention Group using a stratified block randomization.
