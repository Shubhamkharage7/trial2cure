            "briefSummary": "The goal of this investigator-initiated single-site clinical trial is to compare the overall quality of life of participants taking Relugolix combination therapy (Rel-CT) following excisional surgery for endometriosis to participants that do not take Rel-CT following the same surgery. Rel-CT is an FDA approved form of medical treatment for endometriosis. It is known to work in treating endometriosis pain. However, investigators do not know whether or not there is a benefit to beginning Rel-CT immediately following surgery. This study will test if patients who take Rel-CT after surgery have better quality of life and less chance the endometriosis comes back, requiring additional surgery.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\n- Does taking Rel-CT following excisional surgery for endometriosis result in higher Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) scores, indicating a positive impact on overall health-related quality of life and well-being?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One treatment group will take study drug Rel-CT after having excisional surgery, and the other treatment group will just have the surgery alone.\n* Be asked to complete questionnaires, called the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) at 4 timepoints. The first time is before surgery, then at follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The survey has 30 questions that ask about pain, control, powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image.\n\nResearchers will compare the two treatment groups (Rel-CT and non Rel-CT) to see if there is a change in EHP-30 scores.",
            "detailedDescription": "The design of this study will be an unblinded randomized controlled trial of medical suppression with once daily Relugolix combination therapy (Rel-CT) following excisional surgery for endometriosis performed by high volume minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons. Women over the age of 18 scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis will be screened and if agree and consented to participate will be randomized to either Rel-CT following surgery or no post-operative hormonal suppression using a block randomization with blocks 2 and 4. The surgeon will not have access to the randomization schedule to reduce selection bias. Inclusion criteria will include: 1) Patients over the age of 18 planning to undergo an elective laparoscopic/robotic procedure for known or suspected endometriosis. Exclusion criteria will include: 1) Patients with known contraindications to REL-CT; 2) Any form of hormonal suppression of endometriosis within 4-weeks of the index surgical procedure; 3) Primary language other than English/Spanish; 4) Patients without histologic evidence of endometriosis following their surgical procedure; 5) Patients interested in pregnancy within the 12 months following their surgical procedure.\n\nThe primary outcome will be change in Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) score. A preoperative EHP-30 will be completed by all patients enrolled in the study within 4 weeks of their scheduled surgical procedure and then again postoperatively at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Investigators expect that postoperative use of REL-CT will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in EHP-30 scores compared to surgery alone. In addition, investigators will gather data on our secondary outcomes: These data could be very helpful in informing providers and patients of the utility of medical suppression of endometriosis using REL-CT following surgery."
