            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of various cancers, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
            "detailedDescription": "IPF is a progressive scarring condition of the lung that primarily affects adults aged 60 and above. There is a tremendous need to identify therapies that can stop the progression of fibrosis in IPF. No such drugs exist to date, and preclinical studies suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab may halt the progression of IPF.\n\nAdults between the ages of 50 and 80 years with IPF and meeting further inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. Presently, there are two medications that are considered the standard-of-care for the treatment of IPF. Subjects will be able to continue standard-of-care while taking the study drug.\n\nThe primary research procedures are experimental treatment with atezolizumab over 24 weeks administered at a standard dose and route of administration approved for the treatment of cancer. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab with or without standard of care therapy in subjects with IPF. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine change in forced vital capacity, qualitative radiographic change in extent of fibrosis, and patient-reported outcomes with atezolizumab in subjects with IPF over 28 weeks."
