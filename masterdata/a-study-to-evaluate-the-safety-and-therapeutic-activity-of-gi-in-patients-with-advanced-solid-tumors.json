            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1/2a, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor effect of GI-102 as a single agent over a range of advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. This study is adaptive in nature. While GI-102 is being investigated as a single agent in this trial, GI-102 has the potential of being combined with other agents. Based on the data from ongoing nonclinical studies and the dose escalation phase, additional combination therapies \\[GI-102 + drug(s) X\\] may be proposed and added to this study protocol via an amendment.\n\nThis study will comprise two phases.\n\n* GI-102 monotherapy dose escalation phase\n* GI-102 monotherapy dose expansion phase\n\nGI-102 is a novel bi-specific Fc fusion protein containing the CD80 ectodomain as an N-terminal moiety and an interleukin (IL)-2 variant as a C-terminal moiety configurated via a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) Fc. GI-102 has unique characteristics by having bispecificity to CD80 and IL2R\u03b2\u03b3. The CD80 portion is responsible for targeting tumor/immune cells while blocking CTLA-4 expressed on the Treg cells. The IL-2v of GI-102 is designed to abolish IL-2R\u03b1 affinity and therefore minimize the effect on Treg while it has very outstanding effect on NK and CD8 T cell proliferation and activity through IL-2Rbr affinity."
