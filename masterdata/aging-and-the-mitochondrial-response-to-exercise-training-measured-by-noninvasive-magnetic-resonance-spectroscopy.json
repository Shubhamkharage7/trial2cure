            "briefSummary": "The goal of the study is to determine whether aerobic or resistant exercise can improve in vivo mitochondrial capacity of skeletal muscle cells similarly in healthy younger, middle aged and older adults. This confers long-term changes in this tissue which in-turn contribute to improved metabolic health and functional capacity through epigenetic regulation of novel exercise response genes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of the study is to understand the biological pathways and molecules driving the exercise response variation of the muscle mitochondria in vivo to elucidate the underlying mechanisms for the health benefits of exercise training in young, middle aged and older adults. This knowledge will improve investigators understanding of biological basis for targeted \"precision medicine\" exercise and non-exercise interventions to improve age related conditions. The mitochondrial capacity measurement via non-invasive 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31-MRS) will provide a tangible link between the two primary foci of the parent MoTrPAC study: molecular drivers of exercise response and key phenotypic health outcomes."

We will follow up on any data irregularities identified by the Bioinformatics Core as part of their data cleaning process. The Bioinformatics Core will then make our MRS summary data ancillary study data to the community together with the MoTrPAC main study data and data from any other ancillary studies that arise. We are familiar with the NIH policies regarding data sharing, and during our data transfer to the main MoTrPAC study we will comply with local, state, and federal laws, such as the Privacy Rule, a Federal regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."
