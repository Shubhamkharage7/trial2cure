            "briefSummary": "A prospective observational study in infants with biliary atresia and controls to determine whether the composition of the intestinal microbiome is specific for biliary atresia will be conducted.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is \"infants with biliary atresia have a unique microbiome signature at the time of diagnosis and changes in population dynamics occur during disease progression\". The microbiome will be determined at diagnosis and at well-defined time points during the natural history of the disease.",
            "detailedDescription": "Biliary atresia, the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis, results from a fibrosing and inflammatory obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts of unknown etiology. Infants with neonatal cholestasis will be enrolled at the time of diagnosis. Those that undergo exploratory laparotomy and are diagnosed with biliary atresia will form the \"biliary atresia\".\n\nThe development of the normal bacterial flora is a dynamic process that varies in early postnatal ages and may be influenced by disease states. To control for age differences, the composition of the microbiome in subjects with other causes of neonatal liver diseases (non-biliary atresia or disease-controls) and age-matched healthy subjects (normal controls) will be determined.\n\nSubjects with biliary atresia will be enrolled at diagnosis, at which time a stool sample and a 2 mL blood sample will be obtained. Thereafter, a stool sample will be obtained at 3\u00b11 months after hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) and at 24\u00b16 months of age. A stool sample and a 2 ml blood sample will also be obtained if/when subjects are admitted to the hospital for an evaluation and treatment of presumed infection (example: ascending cholangitis) and at the time of liver transplantation.\n\nSimilar samples will also be obtained from healthy subjects (normal controls) and patients diagnosed with other cholestatic syndromes (non-biliary atresia or disease-controls) at ages that match those of subjects with biliary atresia. Samples will be used for bacterial DNA isolation, which will be used for bacterial and mammalian gene sequencing using next-generation sequencing methods, followed by statistical analysis to identify unique microbiome compositions or alterations that are associated with particular disease (biliary atresia or non-BA controls) or clinical outcomes including response to HPE, ascending cholangitis and progression of liver disease."
