The research components of this study will be the use of the two evaluation timepoints for assessment of efficacy of pre-resection chemotherapy (including the evaluation criteria defined within this protocol), and the collection of correlative blood and tissue samples.\n\nChemotherapy will begin with FOLFIRINOX - a standard regimen used in pancreatic cancer treatment, consisting of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. At the first planned analysis, if a switch is indicated based on prespecified criteria (see Section 8.2 for the specific adaptive decision criteria), gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel - another standard regimen in this setting - will be used. Radiation therapy may be used prior to surgery, based on findings on the final pre-operative scan per standard of care."
