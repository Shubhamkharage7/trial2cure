Studies demonstrate that 1 in 5 will develop breast cancer related lymphedema secondary to the treatments that they receive. BCRL at this time has no cure, however early detection can prevent the progression to late stage BCRL. At this time a technique of arm massage, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), is used for treatment. This study investigates a new method of MLD, which is guided by the individual patients' lymphatic anatomy through use of ICG-lymphography."
