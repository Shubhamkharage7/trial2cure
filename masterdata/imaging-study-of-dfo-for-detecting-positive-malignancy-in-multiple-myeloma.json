A radiopharmaceutical tracer uses a small amount of radioactive material that is injected into a vein to help image different areas of the body. \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 targets a specialized protein called CD46, which is in certain multiple myeloma cancer cells, and \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 PET scans may improve detection of multiple myeloma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the sensitivity of metastatic lesion detection in multiple myeloma using zirconium Zr 89-DFO-YS5 (\\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 PET, as compared with fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) PET imaging.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety of \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5. II. To determine the average organ uptake of \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5. III. To descriptively report the patterns of intra-tumoral uptake of \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 on whole body PET, including by site of disease, uptake by tumor type, inter-tumoral and inter-patient heterogeneity, and tumor-to-background signal.\n\nIV. To calculate the dosimetry of \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 in patients with multiple myeloma.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the association between uptake (standardized uptake value maximum \\[SUVmax\\]) of \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 with 1q amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on tumor biopsies (when available; FISH may be conducted as part of routine, standard-of-care).\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on participant preference.\n\nCOHORT A: Participants receive \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 intravenously (IV) and undergo a single PET/CT or PET/MRI scan 5-7 days post-injection. Participants also receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 IV and undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI scan within 28 days prior to day 1.\n\nCOHORT B: Participants receive \\[89Zr\\]DFO-YS5 IV and undergo four PET/CT or PET/MRI scans on days 1, 2, 3-4, and 5-7 post-injection. Participants also receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 IV and undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI scan within 28 days prior to day 1.\n\nPatients are followed up at 30 days after final scan."
