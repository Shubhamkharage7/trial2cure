            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests the impact of lung cancer screening care coordination interventions implemented at the system-level on lung cancer screening adherence in community settings. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Although lung cancer screening (LCS) with yearly low-dose chest computed tomography has the potential to decrease lung deaths, the use of this screening technique remains low. In addition, studies have shown that adherence to lung cancer screening in clinical settings is far lower that those found in clinical trials. Improved care coordination services that include comprehensive, system-wide tracking of screening outcomes for all LCS participants, results reporting with direct-to-patient information, direct patient and physician communication, and active reviews of non-adherent patients and stepped support interventions may increase patient adherence to LCS. Coordination services at the system-level may decrease barriers and improve adherence to lung cancer screening in community settings.",
