During each of the PALS sessions, parents will receive instruction on four responsive parenting constructs: contingent responsiveness, warm sensitivity (responses include high levels of affection and understanding of child states), maintaining vs. redirecting attention to objects and topics of conversation, and verbal scaffolding .In addition to direct instruction, parents will video-record themselves interacting with their child and engage in self-reflection of their own parenting behavior.",
