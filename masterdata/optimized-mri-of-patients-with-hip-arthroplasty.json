The results of the two methods will be compared in reference to the size of the artifact-degraded regions, visibility of the normal structures and the rate of abnormality detection.Primary Objective: To assess the size of the artifact-degraded regions, defined as regions of the image where underlying anatomic structure are obscured, between modified and standard MRI protocols. Secondary Objectives: (1) To assess the visibility of normal structures between modified and standard MRI protocols. (2) To assess the abnormality detection rate using modified and standard MRI protocols."
