            "briefSummary": "Investigators are studying how a device called The Lung Master device can help people breathe better. The investigational device increases the amount of air our lungs can hold, which is important for overall lung health. The Lung Master is not approved by the FDA.\n\nThe study has two visits approximately one month apart. In the first visit participants will take a spirometry test, particularly forced vital capacity (FVC), to measure volume change in the lungs. Participants will take the investigational device home to use daily, either in the morning or evening. Use will be recorded in a diary. After one month, participants will return for another spirometry test. Each study visit will take about one to two hours to complete.",
            "detailedDescription": "Shortness of breath,or dyspnea, occurs when the lungs do not receive enough oxygen leading to discomfort when breathing. This occurs in a quarter of individuals seen in an outpatient setting. Several factors can relate to breathlessness, including lung disorders, heart conditions, or stress. Patients with breathlessness often experience physical limitations in their daily activities. Various treatments for dyspnea are available, however, chronic breathlessness syndrome, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), still can persist even when treatment is available.\n\nThe Lung Master (Pulmonary Exerciser) is a breathing device used for the respiratory treatment and rehabilitation of chronic breathlessness syndrome. The Lung Master increases resistance during inhalation and exhalation, which works to strengthen the respiratory muscle and improve overall lung function. Therefore, this study will focus on determining how the Lung Master increases lung capacity in healthy individuals. The device is considered investigational and has not been approved by the FDA.\n\nTwo groups of healthy participants will be sought for the study: ages 19 to 35 and ages 65 and above. Each participant will have two in-office study visits approximately one month apart. Each visit will take around one to two hours to complete. At the visits, a breathing test called a spirometry test will be done. During the one month interim, the study device will be used at home and the use recorded in a diary. The device must be used least once every day, either in the morning or in the evening for 5 to 20 minutes. You will be contacted after two weeks, and then return the device at the second study visit."

For each session, the participants will try to concentrate on 35-50 breaths in and breaths out which is about 2-5 minutes. Every session can involve using the Pulmonary Exerciser for a minimum of 5 minutes and a maximum of 20 minutes.
