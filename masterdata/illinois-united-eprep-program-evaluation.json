Within the United States, one-third of married couples are distressed and almost half of first marriages end in divorce/separation. Relationship distress is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, including worsened mental and physical health problems in partners as well as internalizing and externalizing problems in children. Newly developed online intervention programs for distressed couples have shown to be efficacious, but their overall reach to the general population remains limited. The current research is designed to implement and evaluate the ePREP relationship intervention with couples throughout the state of Illinois."
