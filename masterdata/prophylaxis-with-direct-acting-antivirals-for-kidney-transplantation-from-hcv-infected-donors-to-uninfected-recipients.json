            "briefSummary": "This study is being done to find out the best time to start medication for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in HCV-negative recipients of HCV-positive (HCV D+/R-) kidney transplants. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups:\n\nArm 1 - Prophylaxis: This group will start the HCV medication before transplant and will take a shorter course of HCV medication for 2 weeks.\n\nArm 2 - Transmit and Treat: This group will start the HCV medication after transplant and will take the full course (12 weeks) of HCV medication.",
            "detailedDescription": "In the past, HCV-positive (HCV+) kidneys were not given to HCV-negative recipients. But over the last few years, medications have been created that cure HCV in nearly 100% of patients. HCV+ transplants to HCV-negative recipients have become increasingly common now that HCV can be cured.\n\nThere are two approaches to giving HCV medication to recipients of these transplants. The first is a prophylaxis approach. With prophylaxis, HCV medication is started before transplant and continued for a shorter course after transplant. The second is a transmit-and-treat approach. With transmit-and-treat, HCV medication is started after transplant and continued for the full, recommended course. Both approaches have successfully cured HCV in HCV-negative recipients of HCV+ organs.\n\nThis research will use a study drug called sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL). It contains two drugs for treating HCV in one pill. We will compare giving SOF/VEL for 2 weeks starting pre-transplant (prophylaxis) to giving SOF/VEL for 12 weeks starting no later than 14 days post-transplant (transmit-and-treat).\n\nSOF/VEL belongs to a group of medications called direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). These drugs prevent HCV from multiplying and spreading in the human body. SOF/VEL are already approved and used for 12 weeks to treat HCV infection. The use of SOF/VEL for 2 weeks in preventing HCV infection has not been studied. The FDA is allowing SOF/VEL to be used in this study."
