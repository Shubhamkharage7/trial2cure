To develop even better tests and to improve the ways samples are handled for testing researchers need to experiment with samples from healthy people.\n\nObjective:\n\nThis natural history study will collect blood and urine from healthy people. The samples will build a repository that will be used for all kinds of research.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people aged 18 years or older.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 1 study visit. The visit will last up to 2 hours.\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will answer questions about their health history. They will list any medications they take. They will consent to donate samples for research and future use:\n\nBlood: Up to 4.5 tablespoons of blood may be collected from a needle inserted into a vein.\n\nUrine: Participants will be given a sterile container to provide a sample.\n\nSome participants may be asked to provide other types of samples.\n\nSome participants may be asked to provide new samples if their first ones are depleted.",
