            "briefSummary": "The main goal of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between fremanezumab's ability to prevent migraine and improved sleep quality in migraine patients (fremanezumab is a FDA-approved humanized CGRP monoclonal antibody for the treatment of migraine).\n\nThis is a within-person study design that examines treatment effects (changes) using high-resolution assessments. To complete the study, each participant will be observed using daily assessments of migraine and sleep outcomes before treatment (baseline: 0 to 30 days), and at 1, 2, and 3 months after treatment (injection 1: days 31-60, injection 2: days 61-90, injection 3: days 91-120). In essence, this creates an interrupted time-series design where repeated interventions are introduced at fixed intervals.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study involves 5 visits to the headache clinic:\n\nIn clinic visit 1 (day 0), subjects will learn about the study and if they agree to participate, will be consented and screened for eligibility. Those deemed to be eligible will be asked to fill a headache questionnaire and then taught how to fill at home a daily e-diary for sleep and a daily e-diary for headache.\n\nIn clinic visit 2 (day 30), subjects will return to the headache clinic to review their e-diaries and receive the first treatment. The treatment is 225 mg (dissolved in 1.5 ml solution) fremanezumab. Fremanezumab is a monthly dosed anti-CGRP mAb injection.\n\nIn clinic visit 3 (day 60), we will review participants' headache and sleep diaries 1 month after receiving the 1st injection and administer the 2nd injection. This appointment will be conducted by either one of the study physicians or the study nurse.\n\nIn clinic visit 4 (day 90), we will review participants' headache and sleep diaries 1 month after receiving the 2nd injection and and administer the 3rd injection. This appointment will be conducted by either one of the study physicians or the study nurse.\n\nIn clinic visit 5 (day 120), participants will return to the headache clinic to summarize their experience, review their 120-days e-diaries, and provide any feedback they may have about their experience with fremanezumab.\n\nAssessments of headache and sleep:\n\nAt screening (visit 1), headache severity and impact will be assessed based on patients' interviews and HIT-6. Sleep quality will be assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index. (https://cbtscience.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/insomniaseverityindex.pdf).\n\nOn days 30, 60, 90 and 120, baseline and treatment impact on headache and sleep will be assessed using the Headache e-diary and the consensus sleep diary \\[Carney et al., (2012) The consensus sleep diary: Standardizing prospective sleep self-monitoring, Sleep Vol.35, No.2, pp.287-302\\], the latter of which captures total sleep time, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, quality, sleep efficiency, and trouble staying awake."
