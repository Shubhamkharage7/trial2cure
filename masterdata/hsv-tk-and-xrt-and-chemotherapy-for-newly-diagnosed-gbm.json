This study is comprised of newly diagnosed patients with AA or GBM.\n\nClinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing, and imaging studies as well as by histological examination. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological response, blood counts, and liver functions tests. Genetic testing of tumor tissue will be performed, including genetic analysis and cell cultures. Toxicity will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores (see Appendices). Patients will also be followed to assess median time to progression and median survival."
