The cycle will be repeated 3 times. Each cycle is numbered in order. The patient will be treated for up to 3 cycles followed by pembrolizumab single drug until unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression.\n\nThe patient will also complete a survey.\n\nTotal duration of the study is up to two years."
