            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates the impact of a culturally tailored educational video on the perceptions of lung cancer and lung cancer screening in vulnerable communities. Lung cancer is the most common cancer type. African-American communities have a higher rate than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States and accounts for the highest number of deaths among African-Americans. Lung cancer is in the top three causes of cancer death among Asian men and women. Research has shown that low-income, minority and immigrant individuals may be under resourced to make decisions about prevention programs and early detection measures for lung cancer. A culturally tailored educational video may be an effective method to help people learn about lung cancer, susceptibility toward lung cancer and lung cancer screening. This may increase lung cancer screening in vulnerable communities.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To understand barriers and opportunities for engaging three culturally distinct populations in lung cancer screening.\n\nII. To develop three culturally tailored educational videos about lung cancer and the benefits of lung cancer screening.\n\nIII. To test the impact of the videos on susceptibility to lung cancer, knowledge of lung cancer screening, and intentions to undergo lung cancer screening in a diverse sample of at-risk individuals.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I (AIM 1): Participants participate in a focus group over 1 hour in support of the development of a culturally tailored educational video on study.\n\nARM II (AIM 2): Participants watch a culturally tailored educational video over 3-5 minutes and then immediately undergo an interview in support of the refinement of a culturally tailored educational video on study.\n\nARM III (AIM 3): Participants watch a culturally tailored educational video over 3-5 minutes and complete a brief test pre- and post-video over 30 minutes on study."
