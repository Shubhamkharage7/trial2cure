The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Do individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus need to perform resistance exercise with a high degree of effort for their blood glucose to improve?\n* How do they feel (their enjoyment, discomfort) after the sessions with different degrees of effort?\n\nParticipants will perform 3 situations separated by at least 4 days, after being familiarized with all exercises and procedures:\n\n* One control day, when they will not exercise;\n* A high-effort resistance exercise session;\n* A low-effort resistance exercise session Researchers will measure blood glucose levels and psychological responses after these situations to see if the effort was important for the improvement of their blood glucose and how effort affected the way they felt after each situation."

During the experimental periods diet will be strictly controlled and provided to the participants. Glycemic control will be assessed by a continuous glucose monitoring system throughout the experimental periods. The exercise sessions will be identical regarding total volume-load and session density, but proximity to failure in each set will be manipulated so effort will be different between the sessions. The control session will be identical in all procedures as the exercise sessions except that participants will remain sedentary.",

Furthermore, participants will be represented by an ID string generated randomly (https://www.random.org/strings/), and their data will be inserted in the files in a random order, not associated with the order they were enrolled.
