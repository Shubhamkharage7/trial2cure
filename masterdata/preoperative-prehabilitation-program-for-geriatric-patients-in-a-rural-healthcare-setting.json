The goal of the research is to assess the benefit of a prehabilitation program before surgery that includes nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation, and optimization of chronic disease. A group of 10 patients will take part in a prehabilitation program. These patients will be compared to 20 patients who received standard of care.",
