            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to specifically evaluate the effectiveness of PuraGel, a RADA16 polypeptide hydrogel, in expediting post-operative healing and re-mucosalization of the nasoseptal flap harvest site during endoscopic skull base surgery and the impact on patient and sinonasal morbidity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Briefly, multiple agents exist and have been long-studied in endoscopic sinus and septal surgery, which include non-absorbable agents and biodegradable, absorbable synthetic agents including extracellular matrix (ECM) based compounds and synthetic biopolymers. The goal of these agents has often been to reduce sinonasal crusting, postoperative bleeding, and synechia formation. With advancements in postoperative adjuncts, many options now exist for postoperative sinonasal packing including medicated products such as steroid-impregnated stents and chitosan-based absorbable packs.\n\nLastly, with respect to intra-operative adjuncts designed to foster healing in the postoperative period, PuraGel, a RADA16 polypeptide hydrogel, was identified as an ECM-based solution, which aids in wound healing, adhesion prevention, and hemostasis at the completion of the case. In hydrogel format, this agent forms a synthetic matrix that serves as a scaffold for mucosal healing while serving as a mechanical barrier on tissue surfaces, thereby limiting scarring. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the role of this gel-based compound in the postoperative period in endoscopic skull base surgery.\n\nThus, amongst all of these agents that have been previously studied to some degree in patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery, there has been limited study on their role in endoscopic skull base surgery and utility in reducing sinonasal morbidity in the postoperative setting. Therefore, our goal was to investigate and compare the impact of varying sinonasal agents in the nasal cavity following endoscopic skull base surgery. We hypothesize that the absorbable, ECM-based gel compound (PuraGel) demonstrates an improvement on postoperative healing rate and sinonasal crusting with reduced patient morbidity and improved patient comfort when compared to non-absorbable agents."
