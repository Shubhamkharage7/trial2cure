            "briefSummary": "This study will address the question of whether targeting CMV antigens with PEP-CMV can serve as a novel immunotherapeutic approach in pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) as well as recurrent medulloblastoma (MB).\n\nPEP-CMV is a vaccine mixture of a peptide referred to as Component A. Component A is a synthetic long peptide (SLP) of 26 amino acid residues from human pp65. The SLPs encode multiple potential class I, class II, and antibody epitopes across several haplotypes. Component A will be administered as a stable water:oil emulsion in Montanide ISA 51.\n\nFunding Source - FDA OOPD",
            "detailedDescription": "This phase II clinical trial will have 3 strata in order to assess the efficacy of a highly immunogenic CMV-directed peptide vaccines in children with (1) recurrent medulloblastoma (rMB), (2) newly-diagnosed high-grade gliomas (HGG) and (3) newly-diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Each stratum will run independently with a different endpoint and statistical design.\n\nWithin each stratum, the populations that may be used for analysis are defined as:\n\n* Safety Analysis: Patients who receive at least 1 dose of the treatment will be used for safety analyses.\n* Efficacy Analysis: Patients who receive at least 1 dose of the treatment will be used for efficacy analyses.\n\nStratum I: Patients with recurrent medulloblastoma with measurable disease (see eligibility) can be enrolled at any point following recurrence regardless of any prior therapy. For the purpose of this study, recurrence will be defined as a new lesion confirmed by biopsy or resection, positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, or recurrent/progressive tumor on MRI.\n\nStrata II and III: Patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma or DIPG may be enrolled any time within 42 days after completing radiation.\n\nCycle 1 (Induction cycle) is 77\u00b12 days. Patients will receive one course of temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day x 5 days on Days 1-5 of cycle 1 and receive PEP-CMV vaccine intradermally at dose level 1 (250 \u03bcg/m2 ) on Days 21, 35 \u00b12 days, and 49 \u00b12 days. After the induction cycle which is 77 \u00b1 2 days, each subsequent cycle is 28 days. Starting in cycle 2, PEP-CMV vaccine is administered intradermally every 28 days on day 1 of each course. Patient can continue to receive PEP-CMV every 28 days for a total of 24 cycles.\n\nPatients will receive a tetanus (Td) booster (Td 5 flocculation units, Lf) at the time of enrollment. Immunotherapy begins with a Td pre-conditioning vaccine (Td 1 Lf, in 0.4 mL of saline) delivered i.d. at the RIGHT groin site of the vaccine injection 6-24 hours prior to the first vaccine on day 21.\n\nThe PEP-CMV vaccine will be administered as follows: 250 \u00b5g/m2 (up to a maximum of 500 \u00b5g) of Component A mixed with Montanide ISA-51 (1:1 volume ratio) intradermally administered half in the RIGHT groin and half in the LEFT groin."

Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-monarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.\n   2. Pregnancy Prevention Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while being treated on this study and for 3 months after drug cessation.\n2. Study Specific:\n\n   1. Active infection requiring treatment\n   2. Patients with malignancy related to HIV or solid organ transplant: known history of HIV, HBV surface antigen positivity or positive HCV antibody are not eligible. Viral testing is not required unless clinically indicated in patients without a known history\n   3. Known immunosuppressive disease\n   4. Patients with active renal, cardiac (congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, myocarditis), or moderate to severe pulmonary problems generally defined by need for medical intervention (e.g., oxygen, medications) and/or limiting activities of daily living (generally CTCAE Grade 2 or higher) or shortness of breath with limited exertion are not eligible. Pulmonary conditions include (but are not limited to) COPD, asthma, and hemi-pneumectomy\n   5. Patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive agents for medical conditions; inhaled corticosteroids for asthma are allowed.\n   6. Patients receiving concomitant tumor-directed therapy\n   7. Patients receiving any other investigational drug therapy.\n   8. Patients on dexamethasone \\> 0.1 mg/Kg/day up to maximum dose of 4 mg/day or equivalent.\n   9. Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction).\n   10. Patients with inability to return for follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to therapy\n   11. Patients at high risk for imminent neurologic decline due to extensive bulk disease, midline shift, or herniation on MRI. These patients should be discussed with the study chairs.",
