This trial will include 120 clinicians and 480 students, and it is designed to test the cost effectiveness and impact of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) in a new setting that increases access to mental health care - schools (Aim 1); test the cost effectiveness, immediate impact, and sustained impact of the Beliefs and Attitudes for Successful Implementation in Schools (BASIS) implementation strategy on proximal mechanisms and implementation outcomes (Aims 2a, 2b, 2d); and conduct sequential mixed-methods data collection to explain residuals (i.e., clinicians whose implementation behavior is unaccounted for by the mediation model) (Aim 2c)."
