            "briefSummary": "Meniere's disease (MD) is a chronic disease with a variety of fluctuating signs and symptoms, which include vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing noise in the ear), aural pressure (feeling of ear fullness), and disequilibrium (lack of stability). Vertigo represents one of the most common and distressing problems in MD patients, and it causes various somatic and psychological disorders that interfere with the patient's quality of life. Despite the large economic and emotional impact of symptoms in MD patients, there is no FDA-approved medication to treat this debilitating condition. As such, our objective in this study is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel medications in treating MD that have previously shown astonishing promise in our clinical practice.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is 8 weeks in duration. There are two arms in the experiment: the first is nortriptyline (7.5 mg) plus topiramate (10 mg), the second is hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) plus triamterene (37.5 mg) with placebo being added in case of a dosage increase. This is a double-blinded trial. Participants will be randomized to one arm for the duration of the trial using simple randomization with a computer-generated number. Both groups may receive dosage increases weekly if symptoms do not improve. Symptomatic survey scores from each arm will be obtained before and after treatment and weekly. An unblinded clinical researcher will also become involved with patients' treatments as they start to report changes in symptoms in order to monitor their safety and provide advice on change in dosage if patients have questions."
