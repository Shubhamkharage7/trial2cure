Hypothesis 2: CBT-I participants, as compared to those in an active control condition, will show significantly greater increases in mental and physical health functioning on the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey at post-treatment and at a 6-month follow-up.\n\nAim 3: Evaluate the process that underlies the relationship between insomnia severity and functioning in Veterans with psychosis and insomnia.\n\nHypothesis 3: The effect of CBT-I on mental and physical health functioning at post-treatment will be mediated by reductions in insomnia severity at week 5 of treatment.\n\nHypothesis 4: The effect of CBT-I on mental and physical health functioning at the 6-month follow-up will be mediated by reductions in insomnia severity at immediate post-treatment.\n\nExploratory Aim: Explore whether psychiatric symptoms 1) moderate the impact of CBT-I on insomnia and functioning and/or 2) change as a result of participation in CBT-I."
