The study will be conducted in up to N=18 participants, recruited in three cohorts of six participants each and receive therapy sessions throughout their participation in these group cohorts.",

This novel treatment package consists of two once-monthly open-label MDMA Sessions combined with non-drug preparatory and integrative therapy administered in both individual and group sessions. The Primary Clinical Outcome measure, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), evaluates changes in PTSD symptom severity and is assessed by a blinded centralized Independent Rater (IR) pool. The therapeutic approach will combine manualized MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD with group therapy components."
