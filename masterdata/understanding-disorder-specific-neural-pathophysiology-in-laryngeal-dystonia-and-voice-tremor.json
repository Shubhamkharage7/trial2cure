            "briefSummary": "The researchers will examine functional neural correlates that differentiate between laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor and contribute to disorder-specific pathophysiology using a cross-disciplinary approach of multimodal brain imaging.",
            "detailedDescription": "Laryngeal dysphonia (LD) and Voice Tremor (VT) are neurological voice disorders that impair speech production. The characteristic feature of LD (i.e., occurring during speaking but not laughing or crying) and the lack of physical laryngeal abnormalities suggests that LD is likely a disorder affecting the task-specific control of phonation by the central nervous system (CNS). Similarly, VT is often observed without any clear peripheral laryngeal etiology, also suggesting a central origin but distinct from that affected in LD. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the common and distinct features of CNS pathophysiology in the neurological voice disorders, LD and VT. The act of speech is a dynamic process, including initial glottal movement, voice onset, and compensatory responses to sensory feedback fluctuations during sustained phonation. Identifying specific functional impairments in LD and VT requires a clear understanding of when in the process of phonation, as well as where in the CNS, aberrant activity occurs. Due to their poor temporal resolution, prior neuroimaging studies have not been able to address the question of when abnormal CNS activation occurs relative to specific phonation events. As a result, critical clues about the underlying etiologies in these disorders have likely been missed. A multimodal brain imaging will asses CNS abnormalities associated with LD and VT, specifically 1) Spatial and temporal CNS pathophysiology during speech and other vocal tasks; 2) Sensorimotor modulations on CNS pathophysiology; and 3) Motor learning and CNS pathophysiology. Future treatments for LD and VT can be developed by targeting CNS pathophysiological mechanisms identified in this project."

Pregnant or breastfeeding women until a time when they are no longer pregnant or breastfeeding. All women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test performed before MRI, which must be negative for participation in the imaging studies;\n3. Subjects with a past or present medical history of (a) neurological problems, such as stroke, movement disorders (other than specified LD and VT in the patient groups), brain tumors, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases; (b) psychiatric problems, such as schizophrenia, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcoholism, drug dependence; (c) laryngeal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis, paresis, vocal fold nodules and polyps, carcinoma, chronic laryngitis;\n4. Patients with any other form of dystonia;\n5. Patients who have dystonia symptoms at rest or have a presence of mirror dystonia;\n6. Patients who are not symptomatic due to treatment with botulinum toxin injections into the affected muscles. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin varies from patient to patient but lasts, on average, for 3-4 months. All patients will be evaluated to ensure that they are fully symptomatic and are at least 3 months post-injection before participation;\n7. To avoid the confounding effect of centrally acting drugs, all study participants will be questioned about any prescribed or over-the-counter medications as part of their initial screening. Those patients who receive medication(s) affecting the central nervous system will be excluded;\n8. Patients will be asked whether they have undergone any head or neck surgery, which resulted in changes in regional anatomy or innervation. Because brain or laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to brain structure and function re-organization, all patients with such a history will be excluded;\n9.
