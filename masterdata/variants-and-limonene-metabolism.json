However, individuals with genetic variants of CYP2C19, such as CYP2C19\\*2 and CYP2C19\\*3, are poor metabolizers of these drugs. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether the investigators can develop a non-invasive assay to identify genetic variants of CYP2C19 by using a substrate for CYP2C19 found in citrus fruit, limonene. The purpose of the study is to examine changes in limonene levels in human breath after drinking orange peel extract for people with CYP2C19\\*2 and CYP2C19\\*3 genetic variants versus those that do not."
