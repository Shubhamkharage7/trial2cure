            "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND:\n\nAutomatic post-hospitalization follow-up visits are commonly recommended by hospital-based pediatricians. The intuitive appeal of automatic follow-up visits is that they might decrease hospital readmissions and promote continuity of care. However, automatic follow-up visits result in missed work for parents, missed school for children, and expenses like co-pays and transportation costs. The principal alternative strategy to automatic follow-up is PRN (pro re nata, \"as-needed\") follow-up, a patient and family-centered approach that empowers parents to monitor their child's symptoms and decide if a follow-up visit is necessary.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nCompare the effectiveness of automatic vs as-needed (PRN) post-hospitalization follow-up for children who are hospitalized for common infections.\n\nDESIGN:\n\nThe Follow-up Automatically vs As-Needed Comparison (FAAN-C, or \"fancy\") trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial\n\nPOPULATION:\n\nChildren hospitalized for pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, acute gastroenteritis, or urinary tract infection will be eligible for enrollment.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTION:\n\nRandomization to a recommendation for PRN post-hospitalization follow-up\n\nCONTROL INTERVENTION:\n\nRandomization to a recommendation for automatic post-hospitalization follow-up\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\nThe primary outcome is hospital readmission within 14 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes are medical interventions and child health-related quality of life. Exploratory outcomes are cost burden, child time, parent time, symptom duration, total additional ambulatory visits, non-primary care ambulatory visits, parent self-efficacy, parent anxiety, satisfaction with care, telephone and electronic communications with medical providers, well-child visits, immunizations, usual place of medical care, and medical interventions related to the index infection. Safety outcomes are medical errors and hospital readmissions related to the index infection.\n\nTRIAL SIZE:\n\nA total of 2,674 patients (1,337 patients in each group) will be randomized, providing 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of a recommendation for PRN follow-up compared to a recommendation for automatic follow-up."
