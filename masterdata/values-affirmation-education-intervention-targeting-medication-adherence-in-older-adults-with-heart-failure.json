            "detailedDescription": "Heart failure (HF) represents a significant public health concern. Medication non-adherence is a modifiable contributor to costly hospital readmissions in older adults with HF. Educational interventions improve, but do not eliminate, non-adherence. Values affirmation interventions which invite individuals to reflect on core values may encourage better engagement in health behaviors by increasing the personal relevance of targeted behaviors. This study tests a values-affirmation intervention targeting medication adherence in older adults with HF enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nThe objective of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures and the values-affirmation intervention in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants will complete a baseline assessment including 30 days of medication monitoring using electronic medication monitoring devices. After the baseline medication monitoring period, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition. Intervention participants will be asked to complete a brief intervention with tailored education relevant to medication information, motivation, and behavioral skills in additional to their usual cardiac rehabilitation care. Control participants will continue with their usual care. Participants will be asked to continue using the medication monitoring devices and to complete a final assessment 30 days later."
