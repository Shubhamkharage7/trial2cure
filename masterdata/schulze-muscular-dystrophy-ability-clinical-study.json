Functional outcomes will include documenting active range of motion and the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) using the standardized Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Role Evaluation of Activities of Life (REAL) assessments. Secondary objectives are to assess the safety record and report on adverse events (AEs) and parameters related to device usage, including device usage time and the time required to don/doff the device. Secondary objectives also include characterization of user upper limb performance based on etiology."

The device augments a user's native arm function to provide lift assistance. Software customizes the spring tension for the level of assist required. The user can turn the system ON/OFF and toggle and adjust the level of assist (e.g., low, medium or high assist) using a pushbutton controller.",

Average PERFORMANCE and SATISFACTION scores can be calculated by summing individual problem scores and dividing by the number of problems. Change in scores for both PERFORMANCE and SATISFACTION can be calculated after a reassessment interval and a comparison of individual's score differences from Time 1 (assessment) to Time 2 (re-assessment).
