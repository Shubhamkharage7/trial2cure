The drugs are already standard treatment for people with prostate cancer, and the drugs will be used as described in their label.\n\nThe names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Leuprolide (type of ADT)\n* Relugolix (type of ADT)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial comparing patient-reported Quality of Life (QOL) among men with localized or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer treated with relugolix versus leuprolide depot therapy.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of the study groups leuprolide versus relugolix. Randomization means that a participant is put into a study group by chance.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved leuprolide and relugolix as treatment options for prostate cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits, ECGs, and blood tests.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last 12 months.\n\nIt is expected about 110 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe Prostate Cancer Foundation and Pfizer are supporting this research study by providing funding. Myovant is supporting this study by providing the drug, Relugolix."

For participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\n* Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.\n* The effects of relugolix and leuprolide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because GnRH agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of relugolix or leuprolide depot administration.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of major adverse cardiac event, including myocardial infarction, new congestive heart failure (CHF) or CHF exacerbation, or stroke, within the past 6 months.\n* Participants who have prior or planned concurrent treatment with second generation AR targeted therapies (such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, apalutamide).\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with brain metastases will be excluded from the study as intermittent hormonal therapy is not standard of care treatment for this population.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to leuprolide depot or relugolix.\n* Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.\n* Participant is unable to swallow pills.",
