A pathologic diagnosis of NSCLC may be confirmed preoperatively with biopsy, intraoperatively with frozen section, or postoperatively on final pathology.\n* Patients must undergo segmentectomy for a peripheral lesion \u22642 cm to be included in the primary analysis. Individual ligation of the segmental artery(s) and segmental bronchus is the minimum definition for a segmentectomy. Division of the segmental vein and intraoperative frozen section to assess surgical margins and N1 lymph nodes are strongly encouraged, but the absence of either is not a criterion for exclusion.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n* Patients with ground-glass opacities will have their tumor size recorded on the basis of the size of the solid component.\n* Any non-lung cancer treated in the past with no obvious recurrence or ongoing treatment is not a criterion for exclusion.\n* The registry study will be monitored by Thoracic Surgery team at MSK.\n* This study will be in collaboration with the Thoracic Surgical Oncology Group (TSOG) of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Actively receiving lung cancer treatment or a history of lung cancer in the previous 5 years\n* History of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for a previous lung cancer\n* Synchronous secondary cancer in the lung or elsewhere in the body at the time of surgery\n* Carcinoid tumors\n* History of other malignancies within the past 3 years, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n* Actively receiving treatment for other malignancies\n* Cases of lobectomy in conjunction with segmentectomy from another lobe and \u22652 segmentectomies from different lobes either en bloc or separate will be excluded from the primary analysis.\n\n  * Multi-segmental resection from the same lobe is not a criterion for exclusion.",
