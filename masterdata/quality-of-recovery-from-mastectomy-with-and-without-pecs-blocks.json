Investigators want to understand post-operative recovery for patients undergoing mastectomy at NorthShore University HealthSystem. Some of these patients receive PECS blocks with Liposomal Bupivacaine and some do not receive a block. Investigators want to know whether patients who receive a block have better post operative recovery and pain control than patients who do not receive one. Investigators also want to understand whether PECS blocks with Liposomal Bupivacaine improves quality of recovery at 72 hours post operatively.",

Investigators will assess their quality of recovery using the QoR 15 survey at 72 hours post operatively. In addition, investigators will also record VAS scores immediately postoperatively and at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. The study team will also calculate the total morphine equivalents (MMEs) required for each patient after 72 hours."
