            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the Conjoint Behavioral Consulting (CBC) intervention under real-world conditions as an IES Efficacy Replication trial. CBC is a family-school partnership intervention proven efficacious for children with serious emotional and behavior problems. The investigation will conduct a systematic efficacy replication of CBC to identify important process and context variables in need of attention prior to a CBC effectiveness study. School-based specialists (SBSs) will implement CBC and will be responsible for working directly with parents and teachers who have a student with or at risk for severe emotional disturbance, with more implementation support (i.e., non-routine conditions) than would be expected under routine conditions to ensure adequate fidelity of implementation. The research questions examine the impact of CBC, when implemented by SBSs, on student, parent, and teacher outcomes, as well its effect on mediational pathways. In addition, the research team will gather stakeholder feedback in focus groups to provide information about factors that stakeholders perceive as impeding or promoting CBC adoption, implementation, and sustainability.",
            "detailedDescription": "Sixty schools will be recruited for this impact evaluation (20 from Madison Metropolitan School District, and 40 from Milwaukee Public Schools). The population for this evaluation will consist of the 12 children from grades k-4 in each participating school who demonstrate the highest levels of behavioral and/or emotional difficulties in school, based on teacher ratings on the BASC3-BESS screening (and whose families consent to participate in the evaluation). The total population for this evaluation will include 720 students. Baseline will take place at the beginning of the intervention school year, outcome 1 at the end of the intervention school year, and outcome 2 at the end of the subsequent school year. At all three timepoints, the research team will gather parent questionnaires (covering competence in problem solving, parenting strategies, parent-teacher relationships, and their child's social and behavioral functioning), teacher questionnaires in relation to each study child (covering the parent-teacher relationship, teacher competence in problem solving, and the student's social and behavioral functioning), direct observations of teacher and student behavior in the classroom, and student records related to discipline."

In CBC, problems are identified, defined, analyzed, and treated through strengths-based, mutual, collaborative interactions between parents and teachers with the support of a consultant. Through CBC, parents and teachers are taught evidence-based procedures to address behavior problems in their respective settings. Parents and teachers assume complementary roles and shared responsibility for identifying student goals and addressing challenging behaviors.",
