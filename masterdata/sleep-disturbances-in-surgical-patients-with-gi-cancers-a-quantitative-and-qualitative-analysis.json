Patients will be asked every 24 hours while at the hospital (before and after surgery) to fill out this questionnaire. The mean RCSQ score at each time point (i.e., before and after surgery) will be calculated for each patient. The overall mean (across all patients) will be calculated and reported along a 95% CI.",
