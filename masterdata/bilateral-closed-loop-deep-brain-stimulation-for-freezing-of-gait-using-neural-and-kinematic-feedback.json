            "briefSummary": "Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has become a standard of care, FDA-approved treatment for Parkinson's disease, with stimulation delivered at a constant amplitude and voltage, operating in an open-loop fashion that does not respond to a patient's current state. Although gait deficits and freezing of gait may initially respond to continuous open-loop deep brain stimulation (olDBS) and medication, the symptoms often recur over time.\n\nThe episodic and predictable nature of FOG makes it well suited for adaptive DBS (aDBS) and a device that overcomes the limitations of traditional high frequency olDBS and is capable of adapting therapy either in the frequency or intensity domain transiently to treat FOG while also treating other PD signs such as tremor and bradykinesia.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of an adaptive DBS system, that responds to patient-specific neural and kinematic variables with customized DBS parameters."
