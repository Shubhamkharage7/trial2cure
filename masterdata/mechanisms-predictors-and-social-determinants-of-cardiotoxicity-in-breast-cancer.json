The study will help the investigators learn more about how these medications affect the heart and how those effects relate to patients' medical history and social determinants of health (such as race, gender identity, education, occupation, access to health services and economic resources). Patients on this study will have echocardiograms, blood draws, and answer questions about their symptoms and activity level. Patients will be followed on this study for up to 15 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose a prospective longitudinal cohort of breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab to determine the associations between social determinants of health (SDOH) and cardiotoxicity risk and to determine whether associations between SDOH and cardiotoxicity risk differ according to race. Patients will be followed with serial echo, blood draw, and surveys every 3 months for the first year, then annually for two years. After 3 years following start of cancer therapy, patients will have study visits every other year for up to 15 years."
