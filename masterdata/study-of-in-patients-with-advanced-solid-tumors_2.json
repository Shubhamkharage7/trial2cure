The study will occur in two phases. The first phase will be a dose escalation phase, enrolling patients with various types of solid tumors that express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The second phase will include a dose expansion using the best dose selected from the first phase of the study. Multiple cohorts will be opened with eligible patients having either HER2 activated non-small cell lung cancer, hormone receptor (HR) positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer, or HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. DF1001-001 will be administered as monotherapy or in combination; combinations are DF1001 + nivolumab, DF1001 + Nab paclitaxel, and DF1001 + sacituzumab govitecan-hziy."
