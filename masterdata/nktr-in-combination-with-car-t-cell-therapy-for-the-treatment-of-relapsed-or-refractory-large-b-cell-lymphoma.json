            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial studies the effects of NKTR-255 in combination with chimeric antigen (CAR)-T cell therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). NKTR-255 is an investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer. T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. Lisocabtagene maraleucel is a CAR-T cell product that consists of genetically engineered T cells, modified to recognize CD19, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CD19-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill CD19-positive cancer cells. Giving NKTR-255 together with lisocabtagene maraleucel may work better in treating large B-cell lymphoma than either drug alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive standard of care lymphodepletion therapy consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5 to -3 followed by liso-cel CAR-T cell infusion on day 0. Patients then receive NKTR-255 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks starting on day 10 or 14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo chest x-ray and echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) during screening. Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample collection during screening, on the study and during follow-up as clinically indicated. Patients also undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) throughout the trial. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection and may optionally undergo tissue biopsy throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days then every 3 months up to 12 months after the CAR-T cell infusion."
