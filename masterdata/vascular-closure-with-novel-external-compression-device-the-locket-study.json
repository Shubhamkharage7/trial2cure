            "detailedDescription": "The volume of catheter ablation procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias are on the rise in the United States and worldwide. Despite refinement in ablation tools and techniques which has led to a significant decline in complication rates, achieving vascular hemostasis following femoral access with large bore sheaths remains a challenge. Manual compression (MC) the current standard of care, requires bedrest, often up to 8 hours. This prolonged bedrest is associated with longer length of stay and at times complications from indwelling catheters.\n\nOther methods of vascular closure include figure-of-eight (F-8) a, subcutaneous suture or Z-stitch or fellow's stitch has been evaluated as a means to achieve homeostasis following major cardiovascular procedures. One pooled meta-analysis of six studies including 982 patients demonstrated that F-8 is safe and effective means of achieving hemostasis. In comparison to MC time to hemostasis was significantly lower and overall access site complications like hematoma, bleeding was also noted to be lower in F-8 group.\n\nIn recent years, invasive, vascular closure devices have become popular. However, results continue to suggest that the risk versus benefit has not been definitively demonstrated. LockeT is a new suture retention device designed to closely mimic manual compression without the need for a healthcare professional to stand bedside."
