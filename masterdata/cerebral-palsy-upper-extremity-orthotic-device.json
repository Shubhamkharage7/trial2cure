            "briefSummary": "Upper extremity therapies for children with cerebral palsy (CP) have been validated for improving function in higher functioning patients. Those who function at the lowest end of the scale, on the Manual Ability Classification System scale (MACS) III-V, comprise 34-54% of the population, but as yet have no evidence-based interventions specific to their needs. Lower functioning children often retain some voluntary control of the elbow in spite of limited finger motion. A dynamic splint, or exoskeleton, could utilize the tenodesis effect from elbow motion to drive finger release while retaining flexor tone for grasp, potentially creating a portable, home-based therapeutic tool. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an upper extremity orthotic device in improving the upper extremity function of children with cerebral palsy who have limited use of their hands."

Each child's test performance is video recorded for subsequent scoring.\n\nScoring is completed across the 30 score items using a three, four or five point scale and individually defined scoring criteria. Item scores relating to each element of movement measured are summed within the corresponding sub-scale.
