            "briefSummary": "A Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) is being developed to provide early proof-of-concept that experimental infection with the intestinal nematode, Trichuris trichiura, is feasible and safe. The proposed model consists of enrolling consenting, healthy, trichuriasis-na\u00efve adults and challenging them with the investigational product, Trichuris trichiura Egg Inoculum, to assess their ability to result in detectable infection. The proposed study will be a feasibility study that will consist of administering different doses of the Trichuris trichiura Egg Inoculum to healthy adult volunteers to determine the optimal dose (i.e., number of T. trichiura eggs) that is safe, well-tolerated and results in consistent infection.",

In Cohort 2, six (6) volunteers will receive an inoculum of 300 embryonated Trichuris trichiura eggs. In the optional Cohort 3, six (6) volunteers will receive an inoculum of 450 embryonated Trichuris trichiura eggs.\n\nThe cohorts will be enrolled in a staggered fashion with safety data assessed prior to larval dose escalation. Cohort 2 will be inoculated no earlier than 16 weeks after the last volunteer is inoculated in Cohort 1. The optional Cohort 3 will be inoculated no sooner than 16 weeks after the last volunteer is inoculated in Cohort 2. Cohort 3 will be enrolled only if the tolerability of the experimental infection of Cohort 2 is acceptable and does not result in significant adverse events.\n\n* Egg administration schedule: Study Day 0 (single administration)\n* Route: oral\n* Doses of T. trichiura Egg Inoculum to be tested: 150, 300 and 450 embryonated eggs (high dose optional)\n* Study duration: approximately 10 months per study participant"
