            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy (via a micro-randomized trial \\[MRT\\] design) of augmenting Enhanced-Replicating Effective Program (E-REP) with engagement strategies to increase and sustain reach by healthcare providers (e.g., nurses, social workers) during implementation of the SafERteens program across multiple healthcare settings.",
            "detailedDescription": "This proposal examines whether augmenting the Enhanced-Replicating Effective Program (E-REP) implementation strategy with theory-based engagement strategies (ES) for healthcare providers (i.e., nurses; social workers) improves reach during the implementation of SafERteens across multiple healthcare settings.\n\nSafERteens is a single-session behavioral intervention combining motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive-behavioral skills training (CBT) shown to reduce multiple violence outcomes, including non-partner (i.e., peer) aggression, non-partner and partner victimization, and violence consequences (e.g., truancy) among emergency department (ED) youth with recent fighting and drinking.\n\nNo prior studies have examined the effect of adding individual engagement strategies to an E-REP package or examined the effect of repeatedly applying such strategies over time to enhance implementation of an evidence-based intervention.\n\nIn this study, the researchers will test four ES: Narrative Persuasion Strategies, Reciprocity Strategies, Personalized Feedback Strategies, and Commitment Strategies.\n\nThe researchers will employ a micro-randomized trial (MRT) design - - a novel experimental design for constructing time-varying m-health interventions. In MRTs, individuals are randomly assigned to intervention options, repeatedly-- at multiple time points over the course of the trial. The data can be used to examine the causal effects of specific ES on a proximal outcome (i.e., reach), changes in these effects over time, and the individual or contextual factors that moderate ES.\n\nIn this hybrid type 3 trial, the researchers will embed an MRT testing randomized, weekly delivery of three ES strategies outlined above (and a control option -- no ES) and monthly delivery of Personalized Feedback (and a control option -- No feedback) and will examine preliminary efficacy of those engagement strategies at increasing reach of the implemented SafERteens program. The researchers will also explore potential signals for individual (e.g., age, clinical role), within-individual (e.g., prior engagement), and organizational (e.g., implementation climate) moderators of preliminary ES efficacy, as well as examine comparisons between different ES and trends in their efficacy over time.\n\nThis is a portion of a larger study. Although the first consent was signed on February 2023 the clinical trial portion of the study did not start until April 2023."
