            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to see whether kisspeptin, a naturally occurring hormone, can stimulate the release of other reproductive hormones in men and women with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). The investigators are also examining whether kisspeptin can help women release eggs from their ovaries. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) may be administered subcutaneously (SC) for approximately six days in a pulsatile fashion, in order to prime the pituitary gland. Kisspeptin will be administered SC for two weeks in a pulsatile fashion. Ultrasound monitoring of ovarian follicular growth (for women) and frequent blood sampling (every 10 minutes for up to 70 minutes) will be performed to assess the physiologic response to kisspeptin over time.\n\nFunding Source: FDA OOPD",
            "detailedDescription": "Assignment: All study subjects will undergo the same interventions.\n\nDelivery of Interventions:\n\n* Each subject will undergo a review of their medical history, physical exam, and screening laboratories.\n* A pelvic ultrasound will be performed on women to assess baseline follicular size.\n* A pump may be placed to administer pulsatile SC GnRH for approximately six days.\n* A pump will be placed to administer pulsatile SC kisspeptin for two weeks.\n* During the course of kisspeptin administration, subjects will\n\n  * Undergo q10 min blood sampling (approximately 10 sessions, 70 minutes each)\n  * For women, undergo pelvic ultrasounds (approximately 3 sessions)\n* Optional q10 min sampling up to 8 hours may take place before and after the course of kisspeptin"
