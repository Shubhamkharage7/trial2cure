A decrease in the size of the tumor thrombus can potentially lead to decrease in surgical complications, improve patient related health outcomes, and improve long term outcomes such as progression free survival and overall survival.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients will receive the combination of Axitinib 5 mg orally twice daily (can be increased to 7 mg twice daily after 2 weeks, and further to 10 mg twice daily as tolerated) and Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 21 days. This combination will be given for a total of 12 weeks (4 cycles). A radiographic assessment will be done up to 12 weeks (4 cycles of therapy) to evaluate the primary endpoint of IVC TT response. Patients will undergo a definitive surgery per treating urologist within 2 weeks (+/- 7 days) after the end of treatment scan.\n\nDuring the course of the trial, patient-related health outcomes using Kidney Cancer validated questionnaires with FKSI-DRS and FKSI-19 will also be obtained. These are validated paper questionnaires that will be given to each patient on study visits while receiving neoadjuvant therapy."
