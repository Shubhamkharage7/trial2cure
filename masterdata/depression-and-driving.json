The findings indicate that the long preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD), as reflected in amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers among cognitively normal participants, is associated with poorer driving performance on a standardized road test. This project will assess how depression, preclinical AD, and antidepressants affect driving behavior in cognitively normal older adults (65 years)."
