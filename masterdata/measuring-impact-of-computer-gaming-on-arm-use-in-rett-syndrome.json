            "briefSummary": "Using a tele-research approach, we will recruit, enroll, guide and support carers and participants to engage in computer based activities (modified virtual reality) with the primary outcome of reducing stereotypies and increasing independent arm and hand use and secondary outcome of improving quality of living. Because of our virtual approach, we are able to recruit from multiple countries and all states and territories of the USA.",
            "detailedDescription": "Early in life, individuals with Rett syndrome lose purposeful use of their hands and engage in handwringing and handmouthing stereotypies. It is important to pursue interventions that may facilitate the development and sustained use of arms/hands for productive involvement in daily needs that ultimately improve quality of life. Investigators plan to use a tele-research approach to assist caregivers and the participants in playing customized computer generated games that require independent and sustained hand separations and initiated and sustained movement patterns to control the modified virtual reality activity that serves as our intervention. Customization of the games and activities used will require collaboration with the caregivers of each participant to ensure that the level of motivation and interest of the participant matches the game/activities used. Brightly colored wristbands will be worn on each participant's wrist during the one-hour long intervention in which they will be involved 3 days per week for \\~12 weeks. These wrist bands will be detected by the software we developed. As the participants move their arms, our software will detect these position changes and activate the computer-based activities. At 5 different points in the study investigators will test for changes in independent reaching abilities that may result from exposure to the intervention. Specifically, investigators will assess the impact of the intervention on minimizing hand stereotypies and improving the amount and quality of independent arm function. At the start and end of the study, investigators will also assess the impact the intervention had on activities of daily living, and therefore quality of life, via three goals developed in collaboration with the family/caregiver of the participant. Due to the virtual nature (tele-research) of the study, investigators aim to recruit 10-12 participants from multiple countries. Once enrolled, each participant will remain involved for up to 5-6 months. Since all activities are hand selected for each participant in collaboration with the caregivers, risks of involvement in this study are low. Investigators anticipate that this intervention will improve motor planning abilities for arm use and reduce stereotypies."
