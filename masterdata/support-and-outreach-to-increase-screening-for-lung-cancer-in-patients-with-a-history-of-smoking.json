Screenings may help doctors find lung cancer sooner when it may be easier to treat. Education and counseling may be an effective method to help providers and patients learn about lung cancer screening. Providing education and decision counseling to providers and patients may increase lung cancer screening.",

Assess intervention impact on shared decision making (SDM).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Identify mediators and moderators of LCS. II. Assess intervention implementation barriers and facilitators.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess intervention impact on:\n\nIa. LCS referral; Ib. Tobacco treatment services referral; Ic. Repeat annual LCS among participants with a normal initial screening result; Id. Follow-up diagnostic evaluation for participants with an abnormal screening result.\n\nOUTLINE: Providers are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nPROVIDERS:\n\nGROUP A: PROVIDER SUPPORT GROUP: Participants complete survey on study. Participants undergo online educational activity on study. Participants undergo distance learning on study.\n\nGROUP B: PROVIDER CONTROL GROUP: Participants complete survey at baseline and end of study survey.\n\nPATIENTS:\n\nGROUP A: Patients undergo electronic health records (EHR) review on study. Patients undergo educational activity on study. Patients also undergo SDM counseling once on study.\n\nGROUP B: Patients undergo EHR review on study and complete telephone survey throughout the trial."
