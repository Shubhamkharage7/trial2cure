VDPHL01 8.5 mg Tablet is an investigational oral drug to treat male pattern baldness.\n\nThis single center, open-label, study will last about 6 months and includes 7 study visits (screening, baseline (day 1), week 2, month 1, month 2, month 4, month 6). Male subjects that meet the study eligibility criteria will be administered VDPHL01 twice daily for 6 months."
