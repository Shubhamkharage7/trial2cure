            "detailedDescription": "The current study is a mechanistic study to evaluate working memory gains with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in older adults with mild cognitive impairments (MCI) compared to cognitively healthy control. This study is funded by a mentored career award (The University of Florida, Clinical and Translational Science Institute \\[CTSI\\] Pilot Award) and thus the mentors (Drs. Cohen, DeKosky, Woods, Fang) are listed as additional Principal Investigators in this study. The proposed study investigates the effects of acute (one-time) tDCS application on working memory gains (i.e., behavior and functional) by evaluating brain structure and cognitive function relationships. tDCS is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation that directly stimulates brain regions involved in active cognitive function and enhances neural plasticity when paired with a training task. A mechanistic, in-scanner, crossover design tDCS study (active and sham stimulation) with 2milliamps (mA) fixed dosing application will enroll 20 participants comprising 10 cognitively normal/healthy older adults and 10 older adults with MCI. The study will employ multi-modal neuroimaging (structural and functional data), person-specific computational models, and machine learning to elucidate acute tDCS effects on working memory. Change in cognitive function (i.e., working memory performance) will be quantified using working memory tasks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The investigators will compare changes in working memory performance resulting from active tDCS versus sham tDCS during 2-back task compared to 0-back task.\n\nThe investigators will test the following hypotheses:\n\n1. Acute tDCS will increase working memory performance during active tDCS and larger degree of brain atrophy seen in MCI patients will significantly decrease current intensity in stimulated brain regions.\n2. Acute tDCS will significantly increase functional connectivity within the working memory network during active tDCS but not sham.\n\nTo date, no studies have examined acute tDCS application in MCI cohort and directly comparing results to cognitively healthy cohort. The present study will provide insight into mechanisms underlying tDCS application in MCI population for combating cognitive decline in a rapidly aging population in the United States. Information gathered from this study may guide future intervention strategies to combat cognitive decline and improve the quality of life of aging population."
