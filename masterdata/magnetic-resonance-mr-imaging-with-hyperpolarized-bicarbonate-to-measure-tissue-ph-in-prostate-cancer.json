To determine the feasibility of tumor pH measurement in men with prostate cancer using hyperpolarized 13C bicarbonate imaging.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety of administration of hyperpolarized 13C-bicarbonate.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To correlate the measurement of tissue pH with pathologic grade.\n\nII. To correlate tissue pH maps with immunohistochemistry staining (IHC), gene expression (RNA-Seq), and spatial transcriptomics. \\*Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) collaboration\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nMen with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) within 12 weeks of enrollment will receive infusion with hyperpolarized 13C bicarbonate and undergo metabolic MR imaging with endorectal coil. Participants will be followed for 5-9 days after the hyperpolarized 13C-bicarbonate injection, or removal from study, or until death, whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable study related adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization (as determined by the investigator) or until initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first."
