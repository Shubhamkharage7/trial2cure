The purpose of this non-interventional study is to systematically collect data related to patient reported outcomes (pain, function, quality of life, toxicity) with the goal of optimizing approaches to management with radiation therapy and clinical care during follow up. The primary endpoint of this study is a change in visual analog pain scale (VAPS) at 3 months post radiation and a variety of secondary endpoints are aimed at assessing disease control, patient function, avoidance of invasive surgery, and toxicity. Participants will complete patient-reported outcome surveys for pain and joint-specific functional assessment."
