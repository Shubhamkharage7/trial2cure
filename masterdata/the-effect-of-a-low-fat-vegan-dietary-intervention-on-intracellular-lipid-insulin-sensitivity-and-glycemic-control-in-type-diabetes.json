Participants will receive at no cost, study-related weekly nutrition education classes and one-on-one consultation with a registered dietitian.",

Participants will be asked to attend weekly online classes on nutrition and health.\n\nThe study will also require in-person meetings. Participants will travel to the Physicians Committee of Responsible Medicine, Washington, DC, at the beginning of the study (week 0) and the end of the study (week 16) to complete bloodwork (comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and HbA1c) and several medical tests (standard meal test, indirect calorimetry, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry \\[DEXA Scan, an imaging test that measures changes in bone mineral density/bone strength\\], and Advanced Glycation End-products measurement). They will also need to travel to the Magnetic Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT at the beginning of the study (week 0) and the end of the study (week 16) to have a Magnetic Resonance (MR) spectroscopy to quantify liver and muscle fat content."
