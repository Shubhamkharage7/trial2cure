These services provide a basis for collaborative research such as this Registry.\n\nThese Services located throughout the United States (US) and Canada will serve as a source of referrals not only for tildrakizumab-exposed pregnancies but also for similarly ascertained disease-matched comparison pregnant women who have not used tildrakizumab in pregnancy.\n\nThe target follow-up period will be until end of pregnancy and 1 year of age for live born infants."
