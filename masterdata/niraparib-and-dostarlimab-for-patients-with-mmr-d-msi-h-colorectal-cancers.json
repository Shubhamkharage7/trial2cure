This study will examine the combination of niraparib and dostarlimab for a synergistic antitumor effect for patients with MSI-H CRC.",

This study aims to leverage MRE11 deficiency and other HR pathway alterations by using Niraparib and also aims to create potential synergetic effect between dostarlimab with niraparib combination to induce clinically meaningful antitumor benefit. Patients with advanced stage MSI-H CRC who progressed on first line anti-PD1 +/- anti-CTLA4 based therapy will be eligible for this study."
