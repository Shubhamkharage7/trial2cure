            "briefSummary": "As the average age of individuals undergoing stem cell transplant continues to increase, challenges associated with balancing the side effects of cancer treatments while also managing other medical conditions develop. Studies have shown these individuals develop more treatment related side effects and take longer to leave the hospital due to complications. The purpose of this study is to develop a multiple provider clinic that will help identify any additional needs in the more complicated and generally older transplant patient population. If needed, this clinic will recommend interventions or referrals to the appropriate specialties to the participant and the transplant physician for the participant before your transplant procedure. Examples of potential areas of improvement include a course of physical therapy, nutritional supplements, or modifications of medications, among others with the goal to make your transplant safer and to decrease length of time in the hospital.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a supportive interventional study to assess frailty in at risk geriatric cancer patients undergoing stem cell transplant and to determine if specific interventions are feasible and will improve overall outcomes.\n\nA total of 20 participants will be enrolled in this study with the first 10 participants limited to myeloma or lymphoma patients who meet eligibility criteria and are candidates for autologous transplantation. The second 10 participants enrolled will be either allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant candidates who meet eligibility criteria.\n\nThe objectives of this study are as follows:\n\n* To pilot a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric assessment clinic.\n* To determine whether a comprehensive geriatric assessment (outside of physical therapy assessment) can be performed in a time efficient manner. The goal is to complete all questionnaires and the multidisciplinary assessments in \\<90 minutes.\n* To assess participant and physician satisfaction\n* To determine if interventions recommended in the clinic are achievable for each participant\n* Examples of interventions could include, medication changes, management of depression, dietary modifications, physical therapy three times a week, etc.\n* To determine if participation in the transplant wellness clinic reduces length of stay and readmission rate compared to historical controls at our institution"
