The primary hypothesis is that relative to placebo, suvorexant will improve sleep and daytime symptoms. The word \"placebo\" refers to a harmless pill with no therapeutic effect.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will take about six to eight weeks to complete. Participants will have a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) and complete a clinical interview. Participants will also complete a baseline assessment, which will take place over one or two days (about 3 hours total).\n\nDuring the study, participants will complete research questionnaires and cognitive testing at baseline and post-baseline (after treatment). Participants will also complete brief EMA surveys (sleep diary and Daytime Insomnia Symptoms Scale) via mobile device 4 times per day for approximately 16 days; each survey will take about 2 minutes or less to complete. Participants will also wear an actigraph on the non-dominant wrist. This device looks like a wristwatch and measures ambulatory movement, a validated proxy for sleep."
