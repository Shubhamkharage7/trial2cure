            "briefSummary": "This study is an ancillary (add-on) study to the clinical trial entitled \"Effect of Nitric Oxide in Cardiac Surgery Patients With Endothelial Dysfunction\", which has Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT02836899. NCT02836899 trial randomizes cardiac surgical patients to receive either Nitric Oxide (NO) or a placebo during and after cardiac surgery.\n\nThis ancillary study aims to assess the effects of Nitric Oxide on vascular responsiveness and on endothelial function during hemolysis in patients with pre-operative endothelial dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass.",
            "detailedDescription": "Endothelial cells regulate tissue perfusion by releasing nitric oxide (NO), a potent endogenous dilator of vascular smooth muscle cells, which modifies vascular tone. Under normal physiological conditions, vascular NO is released by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Impairment of the eNOS, as seen in patients with atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, is a feature of endothelial dysfunction.The inability to increment eNOS activity is particularly evident in conditions of decreased vascular NO bioavailability, such as during hemolysis associated with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB\\>90 min). During hemolysis, ferrous plasma free hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) is released into the circulation and can be injurious for the endothelial cells by exerting an oxidative and proinflammatory effect. Moreover, plasma free Oxy-Hb can scavenge vascular NO, reducing its bioavailability as ferrous Oxy-Hb is transformed into ferric methemoglobin (Met-Hb). The clinical results of reduced bioavailability of vascular NO have been found to be associated with both systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction, ultimately leading to reduced tissue perfusion.\n\nThe exogenous administration of NO has been shown to prevent the scavenging of endogenous NO by inactivating the highly oxidative-reactive ferrous plasma Oxy-Hb to ferric Met-Hb. Our group is conducting a randomized controlled trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) in patients with signs and symptoms of endothelial dysfunction, undergoing cardiac surgery requiring prolonged CPB and randomized to receive NO or placebo. However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial systemic effects of NO administration have still to be determined. This is an ancillary study that aims to (I) assess the effects of hemolysis on vascular responsiveness and on endothelial function in patients with pre-operative endothelial dysfunction and (II) to determine the vascular protective effects of NO administration."
