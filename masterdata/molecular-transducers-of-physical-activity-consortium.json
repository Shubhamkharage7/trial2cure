            "briefSummary": "The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assess molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity (PA). To achieve this aim, a mechanistic randomized controlled trial (RCT) is conducted, in which adult study participants are randomized to endurance exercise (EE) training, resistance exercise (RE) training, or no exercise Control for a period of approximately 12 weeks. The overarching hypothesis is that there are discoverable molecular transducers that communicate and coordinate the effects of exercise on cells, tissues, and organs, which may initiate processes ultimately leading to the health benefits of exercise. Because this is a mechanistic trial, the main goal is not a single health-related outcome. Rather, the goal is to generate a resource leading to the generation of a map of the molecular responses to exercise that will be used by the Consortium and by the scientific community at large to generate hypotheses for future investigations of the health benefits of PA.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study assessments are completed before and after the intervention period (exercise or control), and at specific interim time points during the intervention. Assessments include measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and body composition (including total body bone mineral content) determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). There is also collection of blood, muscle, and adipose tissue biospecimens, monitoring of free-living PA level using wearable devices, and completion of participant reported outcomes and health status by interview and/or questionnaire. An additional group of highly active (HA) individuals currently active in either EE (HAEE) or RE (HARE) are recruited for a single acute exercise testing session of either endurance or resistance exercise and other study assessments. MoTrPAC participants are recruited, trained, and assessed via six adult Clinical Centers (CC), involving 10 clinical sites. As part of the MoTrPAC functions, participant data and biological samples are transferred from the clinical sites to the Consortium Coordinating Center (CCC) Data Management, Analysis and Quality Control Center (DMAQC)and to the Biological Sample Repository, and later analyzed by the Consortium Chemical Analysis Sites (CAS) and the Bioinformatics Center (BIC).\n\nBiological samples collected in this project undergo molecular phenotyping, including metabolomic, lipidomic, proteomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses. These assays are done at the MoTrPAC CAS.\n\nOverall coordination of the study and analyses occurs at 4 institutions which make up the CCC and the BIC."

Two sessions per week include seven exercises that focus on the hips/thighs, back and biceps, and the other two sessions per week include seven exercises that focus on the chest, shoulders, triceps, calves and abdominal muscles. The first set per muscle group is a warm-up performed at 50-70% of prescribed loads that are based on 10-repetition maximum (10RM). Three sets per exercise are then performed at 10RM intensity. Load increases when a participant can perform 12 repetitions for 2 of 3 sets of an exercise. During all sessions, heart rate is monitored and perceived exertion is recorded.",
