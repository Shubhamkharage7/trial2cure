The effects of this agent on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 90 days after last treatment. (Refer to Pregnancy Assessment Policy MD Anderson Institutional Policy #CLN1114; this applies to patients enrolled at MDA only. External participating sites will follow their own institutional policies/SOP.) This includes all female patients between the onset of menses (as early as 8 years of age) and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following:\n\n    * Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months).\n    * History of hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\n    * Ovarian failure (follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol in menopausal range, who have received whole pelvic radiation therapy).\n    * History of bilateral tubal ligation or another surgical sterilization procedure.\n15. Approved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), Intrauterine device (IUD), tubal ligation or hysterectomy, subject/partner post vasectomy, implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n16. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of treatment.\n17. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has a white blood cell count \\> 10 x 10\u2079/L. Hydroxyurea, and/or cytarabine (up to 2 g/m2 total) used as supportive care is permitted to meet this criterion.\n2. Patients with known symptomatic or uncontrolled CNS leukemia.\n3. Patient has systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection that is exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement despite appropriate treatment.\n4. Patients with the following cardiovascular conditions:\n\n   1. Congestive heart failure, NYHA class \u2265II, cardiomyopathy, active ischemia, or any other uncontrolled cardiac condition such as angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, clinically significant arrhythmia requiring therapy including anticoagulants within the past 6 months or at screening, (stable medical therapy for \\> 6 months is acceptable)\n   2. Clinically significant uncontrolled hypertension at the time of screening,\n   3. Patients with a history of documented pericarditis (any CTCAE grade) or pericardial effusions of at least CTCAE Grade 3 within 3 months before the start of treatment with MT-0169.\n   4. Received chemotherapy with anthracycline agents at the doxorubicin equivalent cumulative dose (sum for all agents combined) of 450 mg/m2 body surface area, or a lower total doxorubicin equivalent cumulative dose that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would increase the risk of cardiomyopathy in this study.\n\n   i. For patients who have received a cumulative dose of an anthracycline of more than 300 mg/m2 , approval must first be obtained from the Medical Monitor\n5. Patients with a history of mediastinal irradiation.\n6. Prior use of any cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotherapy, or other investigational therapies within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to starting MT-0169. All prior therapy related toxicities should have resolved to grade \u22641.\n7. Patients relapsing after allo-SCT may be eligible if they have recovered from all transplant-related toxicities and are off all immunosuppression, with no more than grade 1 chronic GVHD. Physiologic (\"replacement\") dose of steroids (\u226410 mg prednisone or equivalent) may be acceptable. Patients must be off all immunosuppression, including calcineurin inhibitors, for at least 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to enrollment on study.\n8. Known active hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) infection with detectable viral DNA or RNA, respectively, or known HIV infection.\n9. Any other medical, psychological, or social condition that may interfere with study participation or compliance, or compromise patient safety in the opinion of the investigator.\n10. Any previous or concomitant malignancy, except when the patient has completed definitive curative-intent treatment with chemotherapy and/or surgery and/or radiotherapy at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients having completed definitive treatment for the following conditions may be eligible immediately after completion of definitive curative-intent therapy, after healing of wounds, and no evidence of residual disease by examination, imaging, and/or cytology/pathology, e.g., non-melanoma skin cancers, or a carcinoma in-situ, e.g., ductal carcinoma in situ, urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, localized prostate cancer, pre-cancerous colon polyp, etc.\n11. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to screening or a major wound that has not fully healed.\n12. Patients under legal protection measure (guardianship, trusteeship or safeguard of justice) and/or uncontrolled psychiatric comorbidities, ongoing illicit substance abuse, inability, any impairment or unwillingness to comply with the treatments, follow-up, requirements and procedures of this clinical trial.\n13. A known hypersensitivity or severe allergy to study drug components or diluents\n14. Nursing women, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) with positive urine or serum pregnancy test, or WOCBP who are not willing to maintain adequate contraception\n15. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study agents may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.",
