            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to better track smell recovery in people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19). Many people who have been infected by this virus develop changes in their sense of smell (olfaction). We are interested in measuring smell function objectively via smell cards that test odor intensity, identification, and discrimination. Objective and precise olfactory testing that can be performed in the convenience of one's home will help identify people with smell loss after infection by SARS-CoV-2. We will use results from this test to better understand the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery of olfactory function and to learn whether the AROMHA longitudinal smell test is a reliable olfactory function tracking tool to quantify smell loss in the context of COVID infection. These results may inform the design of therapeutic clinical trials to accelerate the recovery of smell function."
