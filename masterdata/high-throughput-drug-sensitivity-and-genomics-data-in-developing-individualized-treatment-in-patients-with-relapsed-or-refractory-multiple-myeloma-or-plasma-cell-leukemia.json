High throughput screen tests many different drugs that kill multiple myeloma cells in individual chambers at the same time. Matching a drug or drug combination to a patient using high throughput screen and genetic information may improve the ability to help patients by choosing drugs that work well for their disease.",

Patients and their treating physicians receive the results of the tests. Treatment decisions are then made by the patients and their treating physicians.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years."
