            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Efficacy of tart cherry juice supplementation in the prevention of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) in breast and ovarian cancer patients undergoing treatment with paclitaxel-based chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Compare the effectiveness of high- dose and low-dose tart cherry juice supplement in reducing the severity of PIPN in breast and ovarian cancer patients undergoing treatment with paclitaxel-based chemotherapy.\n\nII. Assess the impact of tart cherry juice on dose delivery of taxane chemotherapy.\n\nIII. Ascertain the tolerability and side effects of intake of high-dose and low-dose tart cherry juice OUTLINE: Tart cherry juice in both arms must begin \u2264 7 days from start of taxane therapy. During treatment, each participant in the high-dose group will consume 1 oz of tart cherry juice twice per day for up to 14 weeks (maximum cumulative volume of 196 oz). Each participant in the low-dose group will consume \u00bc oz of tart cherry juice twice per day for up to 14 weeks (maximum cumulative volume of 49 oz). Participants will have follow-up visits at the conclusion of chemotherapy and at 12 months."
