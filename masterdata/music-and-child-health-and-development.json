The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does participation in a music enrichment program improve the quality of parent-child interactions?\n2. Does participation in a music enrichment program reduce motivation for food\n3. Does participation in a music enrichment program improve the quality of the language environment?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n1. Be randomly assigned to participate in either 2, 8-week semesters of weekly music enrichment classes or play group sessions.\n2. At the beginning, after the first 8 weeks and after the second 8 weeks, a researcher will come to the participants house and parent-child pairs will:\n\n   1. be video recorded during 10 minutes of playtime and meal time.\n   2. fill out questionnaires\n   3. wear a small wearable language recorder for 16 hours\n3. At the beginning, after the first 8 weeks and after the second 8 weeks, the parent and child will come to the baby lab and will:\n\n   1. Play a computer game to test motivation for food\n   2. have height and weight measurements collected\n\nResearchers will compare the music and play groups to see if there is a difference in the quality of parent child interaction, food motivation or language environment."
