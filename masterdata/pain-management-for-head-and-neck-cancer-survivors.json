Adapt an existing telehealth pain management intervention to target improvement of pain-related physical functioning, mood, substance use, and quality of life in a local sample of veteran head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors.\n\nII. Conduct a pilot of the adapted intervention to examine the feasibility (accrual, adherence, attrition) and acceptability (participant satisfaction) that will form the basis of a well-powered, randomized clinical trial submitted for funding to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), American Cancer Society (ACS), or Veterans Affairs (VA).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients attend 5 sessions of Mobile Pain Coping Skills Training for 45 minutes each over 8 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 months."
