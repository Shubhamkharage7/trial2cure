The study is designed to provide a specimen bank of samples with carefully characterized clinical data. LIINC specimens will be used to examine multiple questions involving the virologic, immunologic, and host factors involved in COVID-19, with a focus on understanding variability in the long-term immune response between individuals.",
            "detailedDescription": "LIINC is an observational, prospective study of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have recovered from acute illness. The overall objective of the study is to investigate the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include the pre-existence and development of medical conditions, measures of immune activation and inflammation, changes in immunologic function, and variability in host responses. There will be a specific focus on demographic differences including age, gender, and race.\n\nEnrolled volunteers are seen at San Francisco General Hospital at baseline, monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. Visits include a detailed interview, saliva collection, and a blood draw. Baseline visits take approximately 90 minutes, and follow up visits take approximately 20-40 minutes. No personal identifiers are used for specimen bank samples."
