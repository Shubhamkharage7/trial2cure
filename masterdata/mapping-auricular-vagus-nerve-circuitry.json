The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how a form of neuromodulation, transcutaneous electro-accupoint stimulation, which is non-invasive and non-painful, affects human brain, stomach, and autonomic activity. We will accomplish this by integrating whole brain functional MRI (fMRI) methodologies with gastric MRI and physiological monitoring.\n\nThis study will comprise 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain-gut scans, all while receiving the neuromodulation with varying parameters. Participants will also have their heart rate, breathing, and gastric activity monitored during all visits."
