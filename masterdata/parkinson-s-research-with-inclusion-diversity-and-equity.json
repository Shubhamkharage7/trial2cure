            "detailedDescription": "Four million LGBTQIA+ adults age 50+ live in the U.S. Very little is known about the needs of the LGBTQIA+ community living with Parkinson's disease (PD). This research will work with the LGBTQIA+ community to learn about the health needs of those living with PD. The researchers will also talk to caregivers about their care experiences, and ask healthcare providers about their work with LGBTQIA+ communities living with PD. LGBTQIA+ adults have more health and care problems. This study will test if LGBTQIA+ adults with PD experience more health and care problems. This study will also see if caregivers have more problems and how providers are caring for the LGBTQIA+ community living with PD. LGBTQIA+ adults living with PD, caregivers and care providers will be asked to fill out a survey. Some caregivers will be asked to participate in an hour interview to learn about their experiences. Surveys and interviews can be done by phone or internet. The study will find ways to improve health and care of LGBTQIA+ people living with PD. The study will share findings so others can help to make care better for the LGBTQIA+ community."
