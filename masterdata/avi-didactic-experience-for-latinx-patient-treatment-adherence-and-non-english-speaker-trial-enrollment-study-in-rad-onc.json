            "briefSummary": "The study aims to develop educational media interventions to prepare Latinx Spanish-speaking radiation oncology patients for a course of breast or prostate cancer radiation therapy and to foster receptivity and informed decision-making around cancer clinical trial participation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Research suggests that utilization of audiovisual educational interventions may help to address health literacy and language barriers as well as suboptimal outcomes and trial enrollment in minority and/or non-English speaking patients. However, this has yet to be demonstrated in the radiation oncology setting, in which educational material is limited to written brochures for non-English speaking patients. Herein, the investigators propose to develop and implement a targeted linguistically and culturally appropriate audiovisual intervention (AVI) for Latinx/Spanish-speaking (SS) patients undergoing curative radiotherapy (RT). Our overall objective is to demonstrate benefit of AVI on RT knowledge, adherence, satisfaction and cancer trial perceptivity and enrollment in Latinx/SS patients. The investigators also aim to identify patient-specific and modifiable system-level factors predictive of quality RT delivery and clinical trial accrual to instruct future demographic-segmentation strategies focused on reducing outcomes disparities within radiation oncology."
