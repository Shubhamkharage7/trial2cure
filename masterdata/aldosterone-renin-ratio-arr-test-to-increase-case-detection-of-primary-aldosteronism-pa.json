            "detailedDescription": "The mission of this project is to increase the detection of Primary Aldosteronism (PA), the most common cause of secondary hypertension, which can either be cured surgically or treated with targeted medications. It is caused by the autonomous secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal glands.\n\nHypertension, elevated adrenal aldosterone secretion, and suppressed renin are the hallmarks of PA. The prevalence of PA varies approximately from 5% up to 20%.\n\nClinicians continue to erroneously learn that PA is a very rare disorder, thus PA continues to be under-recognized and undertreated. PA is a major public health issue, and the current case-detection rate is much below the prevalence rates reported in studies. Correctly identifying PA in patients will enable effective treatment and potential cure for this disease Hypertension by itself is a major driver of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There are \\~ 1 billion people diagnosed with hypertension in the world, and even if we take a conservative prevalence of PA of 5% amongst this population, it would yield a staggering number of 50 million.\n\nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality rates are higher in those with PA compared to patients with blood pressure-matched essential hypertension.\n\nAs per the current Endocrine Society Guidelines, only patients who meet specific clinical profiles are considered to be candidates for screening for PA. Typically screening involves a blood test for calculating aldosterone and renin ratio (ARR). An abnormal test indicates the possibility of PA. It is estimated that only 1% of patients are detected by these screening guidelines.\n\nGiven the underdiagnosed state of this condition, and the high cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal risks it entails, we should broaden the population to be screened for PA. All patients with hypertension who are on at least one anti-hypertensive medication should be screened for PA, especially given the benefits from specific surgical or medical treatment.\n\nThis would help reduce disease burden in a cost-effective manner and will impact the Care of Patients"
