In Part 1, eligible subjects will be assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either emactuzumab or matching placebo in a double-blind fashion, that will be administered in total 5 times as an intravenous (i.v.) infusion once every 2 weeks. This will be followed by an observation period of 3 months leading to a total duration of 24 weeks in Part 1. A number of assessments will be carried out during the course of the study, including physical examinations, blood tests, imaging studies, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires. Part 2 is a long-term double-blind follow-up phase of the subjects on emactuzumab or placebo. Subjects assigned to placebo in Part 1 have the option to crossover under certain circumstances to receive open-label emactuzumab in Part 2. Subjects assigned to active drug in Part 1 have the option to receive open-label retreatment under certain circumstances."
