In addition, a blood sample (for hormonal and immune analyses) will be collected on the day of the surgery and/or postoperative. Surgery-related parameters including postoperative pain, and opioid type and doses during the hospital time will be collected.\n\nIn addition, before or after the surgery, patients and their parents/guardians will be interviewed. The interview will include questions about the surgery and about potential future study assessing the efficacy of sex hormone treatment on opioid use.\n\nLongitudinal measures. At routine follow-up with the surgeons or after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, study staff will contact patients to inquire about persistent pain (location, severity), and persistent opioid use. Based on previous studies, we estimate that \u223c30% will have persistent postoperative pain, and \u223c5% will have persistent opioid use.After signing the consent and assent forms, participants and their parents/guardians will complete several surveys, including demographic, behavioral, pain, substance use and analgesic risk assessment measures, and developmental surveys.
