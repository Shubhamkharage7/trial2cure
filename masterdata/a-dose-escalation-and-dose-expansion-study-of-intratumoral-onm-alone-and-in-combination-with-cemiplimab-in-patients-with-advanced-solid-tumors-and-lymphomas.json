            "detailedDescription": "This Phase 1, multi-center trial will consist of three parts: monotherapy dose escalation; combination therapy dose finding; and combination therapy dose expansion exploring two doses in specific tumor indication(s). Each dosing cycle of ONM-501 will be 21 days. ONM 501 will be administered as intratumoral injections once per week for three weeks (on Days 1, 8, and 15), followed by three weeks without ONM-501 administration. The monotherapy dose escalation will utilize an accelerated titration method.\n\nThe combination agent will be administered according to standard protocol, once every three weeks. This phase will evaluate ONM-501 in combination with approved immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) cemiplimab. Enrollment in this phase will follow a \"Rolling 6\" or 6+0 methodology - up to 6 patients will be enrolled in a staggered format; dose escalation of ONM-501 will be permitted.\n\nOnce the recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) are determined for ONM-501 + ICI combination or ONM-501 monotherapy, the expansion phase of this study will be initiated. The expansion phase will enroll patients in one to three indication-specific expansion cohorts."
