            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of EngAGE (an interactive, voice-activated app) vs usual care on improving older adult physical and social function.",
            "detailedDescription": "Physical activity is essential for all age groups, across all comorbidities and geriatric syndromes; it has been described as the 'ideal' intervention for aging. Increasing physical activity among homebound, multimorbid, African American (AA) older adults (OAs) requires a shift in interventions to target the older adult-care partner (CP) pair (dyad) and to test innovative vehicles for remote intervention delivery. Our research goal is to create an evidence-based intervention that leverages technology to reach multimorbid OA-CP dyads in the home, promotes long-term mobility and social engagement among those least able to access community resources, and empowers informal care partners with tools. We developed a socially-motivated exercise tool for multimorbid OA-CP dyads called EngAGE that leverages voice-activated technology. We propose to conduct a 6-month, randomized, in-home trial of EngAGE (intervention) versus paper exercise handouts (usual care) in 124 multimorbid, homebound, AA OA-CP dyads recruited from 2 hospital systems and the community. Our overall hypothesis is that EngAGE will improve both physical and social function of older adults.\n\nAll OA subjects will undergo an in-home baseline visit where we will collect data about physical function, social function, activity and frailty. OA-CP dyads will be randomized (1:1) to a physical activity intervention: either EngAGE or usual care. All subjects will be asked to complete exercises 3-6 times per week. Care Partners will be instructed to encourage their Older Adult partner to perform physical activities on a regular basis. There is a two week Run-In Period to troubleshoot the EngAGE app and acclimate the OA subjects to the study intervention. OA subjects will be monitored via phone visits on a monthly basis. In home study visits will take place at month 3 and month 6. Data about OA subject physical function, social function, activity and frailty will be collected at these visits."
