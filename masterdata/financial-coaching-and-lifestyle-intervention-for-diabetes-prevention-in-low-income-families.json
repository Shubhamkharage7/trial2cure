It will pull physical activity data (e.g., steps) directly from the health app on smartphones or apps associated with external devices such as Fitbit. Furthermore, Noom stands out from other app-based programs by assigning a personal coach to each user, helping users navigate the emotional and physiological experiences of the Noom weight loss experience.",
