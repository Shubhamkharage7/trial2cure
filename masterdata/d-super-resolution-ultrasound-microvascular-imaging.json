            "briefSummary": "This is a 3-arm single center study of 45 patients. These cohorts will include 15 breast patients scheduled to undergo a biopsy, and 15 thyroid patients scheduled to undergo fine needle aspiration, biopsy, or thyroidectomy that consent to undergo an acoustic angiography in conjunction with b-mode ultrasound prior to their scheduled biopsy. Prior to imaging clinical patients, the third arm will include 15 healthy volunteers that will be imaged to optimize imaging parameters.",
            "detailedDescription": "Increasing the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging in patients at high risk for breast or thyroid cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis, preventing over-treatment, and reducing healthcare costs. Acoustic angiography is a new type of contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging which is specifically sensitive to microvascular structure and density. It evaluates tumor micro-vasculature and may provide a powerful prognostic tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and eventually for treatment evaluation."
