            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of non-invasive brain stimulation in treating adults with symptomatic convergence insufficiency compared to vergence/accommodative therapy. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Can non-invasive brain stimulation shorten the treatment time of office-based vergence/accommodative therapy for convergence insufficiency?\n2. Is non-invasive brain stimulation alone just as effective as office-based vergence/accommodative therapy in treating convergence insufficiency?\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that non-invasive brain stimulation will shorten the treatment time from 12 weeks to 8 weeks of office-based vergence/accommodative therapy and that non-invasive brain stimulation alone would be equally effective as office-based vergence/accommodative therapy in improving symptomatic convergence insufficiency.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of three treatment groups:\n\n1. Non-invasive brain stimulation with office-based vergence/accommodative therapy.\n2. Sham stimulation with office-based vergence/accommodative therapy.\n3. Non-invasive brain stimulation only.\n\nResearchers will compare baseline measurements of near point of convergence (NPC) and positive fusional vergence (PFV) to post-treatment measurements for each group."
