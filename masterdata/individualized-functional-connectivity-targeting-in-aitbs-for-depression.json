            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to estimate the importance of neuroimaging in accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) for depression. Participants will receive aiTBS treatment, but they will not know if their treatment spot was found with neuroimaging or head measurements.",
            "detailedDescription": "Techniques for modulating human brain networks are rapidly evolving. One of the most exciting new developments is accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS), a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol that involves multiple daily treatments rather than gold standard once daily treatment. A specific accelerated iTBS protocol called Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT) was cleared by the FDA in September 2022 based on two pilot studies in which patients with treatment-resistant depression rapidly and robustly improved with SAINT. Many of these patients had been depressed for decades and had not improved with conventional TMS or electroconvulsive therapy. Despite these promising results, two issues may limit SAINT scalability: 1) SAINT has only been tested at a single site in a small number of patients, 2) SAINT has never been tested without individualized resting state functional connectivity (rsfc) targeting, which is not widely available or covered by insurance. In this pilot trial, patients with treatment-resistant depression (n=40) will be randomized to one of two active treatment arms: 1) Real aiTBS with real individualized rsfc targeting, or 2) Real aiTBS with sham individualized rsfc targeting (i.e. conventional TMS targeting based on scalp landmarks). All patients will receive active stimulation, which will facilitate enrollment and reduce ethical concerns about placebo treatment in a vulnerable population when there is existing evidence of treatment efficacy. Patients and clinicians will be blind to group assignment, and blind integrity will be assessed. All patients will undergo MRI scans immediately before treatment and at one month follow up, which aligns with our clinical outcome measures."
