The above suite of selected markers will capture diet-induced systemic changes in inflammation and oxidative stress, while assessing associated microbial changes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Those qualified for enrollment will be randomized into a double-blind crossover study to consume 2 morning servings of a 0.6 cup (150g) of plain yogurt with : A) cane sugar added in an isocaloric level as the honey or, B) 1 tbsp of phenolic-rich honey for 4 weeks. A one-month washout between periods will be used. The participants will be instructed to consume one yogurt in replacement of or as part of breakfast, and as a late morning snack. They will also be instructed to not add any additional items to the yogurt. Therefore, each study participant will consume 2 tbsp. of honey a day for four weeks, which is a realistic amount typically consumed by honey users."
