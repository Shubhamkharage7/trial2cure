Participants are randomized to either 1) LPA+Fitbit intervention or 2) Fitbit Only control condition. Follow-up assessments and EMA data will be collected.",
            "detailedDescription": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant and costly public health problem that affects one-third of the U.S. population in their lifetime. Women develop AUD more quickly and suffer a broader range of adverse alcohol-related health consequences than men. Physical activity (PA) interventions may play an important role as an alternate coping strategy for women with AUD and a means to decrease relapse.\n\nThe primary aim of this project is to test the efficacy of a technology-supported lifestyle physical activity (LPA) intervention for preventing relapse among women with depression engaged in alcohol treatment. A total of 214 women from the Alcohol and Drug Partial Hospitalization Program (ADP) at Butler Hospital with AUD and depression will be recruited and randomly assign them to either a: 1) LPA+Fitbit intervention or 2) Fitbit Only control condition. Follow-up assessments will occur at 6-weeks, end of treatment (EOT) at 3 months, and 6, 9 and 12 months. Participants will also complete 3, 10-day periods of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) during early recovery, at approximately weeks 1 \\& 2, 5 \\& 6, and again at weeks 11 \\& 12."
