            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to examine usability of a locally built adaptive rower for people with spinal cord injury using an established and tested design.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. What exercise intensity of activity do users achieve on the rower for steady state and interval rowing plans?\n2. What assistance is required for setup and usage of the adaptive rower?\n3. What do users think about the ease of use and what is their satisfaction with the adaptive rower?\n\nParticipants will complete a one-time exercise session with two adaptive rower bouts (10-15 minutes each) with a rest period in between.",
            "detailedDescription": "A single group rolling prospective cohort study with a target of 15 participants will evaluate the initial design prototype using the an existing adaptive rower design. Participants will have one visit to the University of South Carolina Rehabilitation lab. Participants will receive an orientation to the rowing machine and available handle, grip and trunk support options. Training will be provided in proper rowing technique and use of the rate of perceived exertion scale. Participants will be fitted with a heart rate monitoring device and resting heart rate established. Participants will perform two bouts of rowing exercise each with a 2-minute warm up and cool down in addition to the following: (1)10 minutes of steady state rowing with goals to achieve moderate intensity exertion levels, followed by a variable rest period to return exertion and heart rate to initial levels, (2) 10 minutes of interval rowing alternating between one minute of low-moderate intensity and 30 seconds of moderate-vigorous intensity. Participants heart rate will be monitored and recorded throughout the testing period, with rate of perceived exertion at start, midpoint and end of steady state period, and at start, at each interval, and at end in interval period."
