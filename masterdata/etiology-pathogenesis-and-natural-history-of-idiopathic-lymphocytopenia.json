            "detailedDescription": "Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a disorder characterized by decreased numbers of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes in the absence of known causes of CD4+ lymphocytopenia. ICL is defined as an absolute CD4+ T cell count of less than 300 cells/microL in a patient with no human immunodeficiency virus infection or known immunodeficiency syndrome. The causes and frequency of the disorder remain unknown. The condition is typically diagnosed when patients present with a serious infection. In this natural history protocol, we will evaluate patients with CD4+ T cell counts below 300 cells/microL. We propose to follow 300 ICL patients for a minimum of 4 and maximum of 20 years, with a particular focus on the association between ICL and autoimmune disease. In addition to the ICL patients, we will enroll blood relatives and household contacts to better understand pathogenesis and etiologies of the syndrome. We will collect blood and other tissues for immunologic, rheumatologic, and genetic testing in an effort to identify and understand the underlying defects that cause ICL and follow its course in a cohort of patients who will receive best standard therapy for opportunistic infections."
