This real-time fMRI neurofeedback therapy uses cloud-based pattern classification to decode a patient's attentional state and dynamically modulate task stimuli (in a closed loop) based on this state.",
            "detailedDescription": "In both the R61and R33 phases we will compare cloud based real time fMRI feedback with placebo (sham feedback) in reducing negative attention bias and depressive symptoms. This study will be the first dose-finding test of real-time fMRI effect on negative attention bias. Measures include: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID), Clinician-administered diagnostic exam, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinician-administered scale used to assess the severity of depression, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Self-report questionnaire used to measure types of anxiety and mood symptoms, Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ), Negative perseveration during a go/no-go task, Go/no-go task with overlaid face/scene stimuli; brain response triggers next stimulus, Negative gaze, Negative gaze collected in gaze data following each real time fMRI feedback session"
