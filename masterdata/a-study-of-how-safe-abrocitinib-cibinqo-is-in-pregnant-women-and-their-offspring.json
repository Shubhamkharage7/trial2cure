The exposed group will consist of pregnant women exposed to abrocitinib during pregnancy. The unexposed group will consistent of pregnant women with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are not exposed to abrocitinib during pregnancy.\n\nThe study will compare the experiences of pregnant women receiving abrocitinib to pregnant women who do not. This will help us determine if abrocitinib is safe during pregnancy.\n\nParticipants will take part in this study until their infant is 12 months of age. During this time, the participant's care will be managed no differently than if she was not taking part in this study. Data will be collected through a virtual research coordinating center at enrollment, the end of the second trimester, and pregnancy outcome (live birth or fetal loss). For live-born infants, data on the infants will be collected at 4 and 12 months of age. No additional visits beyond routine care will be required."
