In addition to treating patients, the primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of using the Medtronic SynchroMed II programmable pump combined with the Intera tapered catheter for hepatic artery infusion (HAI) of a standard chemotherapy (FUDR) drug for adults with a clinical or biopsy-proven diagnosis of colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nAfter successful implantation, the combined pump and catheter system will be evaluated using a nuclear scan in the postoperative period, which is standard procedure to confirm that the pump is functioning prior to HAI of FUDR. Monitoring for safety will include a record of residual pump volume when it is emptied (every 2-12 weeks depending on whether the pump is being used for chemotherapy infusion) to determine if the pump is still working and surveillance of routine cross-sectional imaging (usually every 2-6 months) for any sign of a pump or catheter problem. Patients will be monitored for the safety of the pump/catheter combination for up to 5 years or pump removal/study withdrawal."

Specifically, the Medtronic pump comes with a small connector that ends in a metal flange. During the operation, under sterile conditions, the distal 1 cm of the flange is severed using a scissor. Then, using a Intera connector pin, the end of the Medtronic catheter is connected to the Intera catheter . Two 2-0 silk ties secure the catheters to the pin. The pump and catheter are then inserted into the patient into the abdominal wall or into the chest wall. The catheter is inserted into an artery within the abdomen (usually the gastroduodenal artery but it depends on the exact arterial branching in the individual patient) that feeds the liver.",
