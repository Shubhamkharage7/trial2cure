All subjects will undergo a full gait analysis, functional measures, neurocognitive/cognitive, and pain assessment at baseline utilizing their current passive prosthesis. Subjects will then be randomly assigned into 2 equal groups: Powered device with an 8-session intensive, device-specific PT intervention (Group A); or powered device with current standard of practice (Group B), with includes basic device education, but no PT intervention. Subjects in Group A will undergo a 4-week PT-based intervention, which will isolate the contribution of device specific effects from rehabilitation effects. Group B will receive the current standard of practice, which does not include any formal rehabilitation. All users will undergo a full gait analysis, functional measures, neurocognitive/cognitive, and pain assessment after 4- and 8-weeks of use."
