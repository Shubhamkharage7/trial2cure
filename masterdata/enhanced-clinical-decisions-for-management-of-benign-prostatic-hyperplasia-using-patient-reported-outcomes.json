            "briefSummary": "The goal of this project is to use newly developed patient-reported outcomes to improve the clinical care of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The use of new patient-centered tools will improve evaluation and clinical decision-making by including symptoms not commonly measured in men, such as urinary incontinence, and allow for more frequent assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms through remote surveillance. Through the use of care-coordination checklists, clinicians can be more responsive to post-treatment symptom changes, resulting in reduced bother from lower urinary tract symptoms and higher quality of life in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.",
            "detailedDescription": "The American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) has been the primary patient-reported outcome (PRO) used in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for decades. New symptom indices - the LURN SI-10 and LURN SI-29 - have been developed by the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) to provide a general-use multidimensional symptom assessment in the urology clinic. These tools are relatively new and have yet to be validated in specific disease populations. The overarching goal of this project is to use these new questionnaires to enhance clinical decision-making in men with BPH. This will be achieved by (1) integration of PRO assessments into the evaluation and management of patients with BPH; (2) determination of clinical meaningful differences in LURN symptom indices in men with BPH receiving known effective treatment; and (3) creation of data visualization tools and care-coordination recommendations to facilitate the matching of evidence-based treatments to patients with persistent symptoms using PROs. PROs provide a cost-effective remote management strategy that, combined with advances in electronic medical health record technology, can improve patient care by allowing for more real-time surveillance and intervention, and the monitoring of common comorbid symptoms such as sleep disturbance and depression, in addition to core urologic symptoms of BPH.\n\nIn Aim 1, the investigators will use sophisticated statistical methods to predict changes in urological symptoms and assess associations between lower urinary tract symptoms and measures of sleep, depression, and pain, among others. In Aim 2, the investigators will assess test-retest reliability and other psychometric properties of the LURN symptom indices, using a triangulation of methods to determine minimally important differences. Finally in Aim 3, the investigators will engage stakeholders, including patients and clinicians, and use qualitative methods to create visualization tools and care coordination checklists to improve counseling and follow up for patients undergoing treatment. Aim 3 will also enhance the recovery and routine monitoring of men with BPH after surgery, who can experience distressing side effects and complications such as urinary leakage and pain."
