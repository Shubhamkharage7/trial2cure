The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is bright IDEAS problem solving skills training feasible and acceptable for parents of children referred to pediatric palliative care?\n* Does bright IDEAS reduce psychological distress in parents compared to parents receiving standard palliative care support?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Participate in 6-8 sessions of the bright IDEAS program.\n* Complete self report measures of psychological distress and well being.\n\nIf there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare bright IDEAS to standard palliative care support."
