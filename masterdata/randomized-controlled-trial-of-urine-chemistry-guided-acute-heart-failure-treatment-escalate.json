            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized trial of protocolized diuretic therapy guided by urinary sodium compared to structured usual care in ED patients with AHF. Participants will be recruited following an initial standard evaluation in the ED and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to structured usual care or protocolized diuretic therapy guided by urinary sodium.",
            "detailedDescription": "A standardized protocol driven treatment pathway for hospitalized patients started in the first few hours of ED evaluation and utilizing objective measures of diuretic response is needed. The investigators believe this would maximize diuretic efficiency, facilitate quicker resolution of congestion, avoid WHF and prolonged LOS, and reduce AHF readmissions. Propr data suggests low urine sodium predicts length of stay and outcomes after initial diuretic dosing in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Further, use of our pathway using spot urine sodium to titrate subsequent loop diuretic doses and maximize response in inpatients with AHF has shown compelling improvements in congestion and weight loss. However, a randomized trial is necessary to determine if initiating this protocol ,started in the ED, will improve AHF outcomes relative to structured usual care. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize use of spot urine sodium guided diuretic therapy will result in significant improvement in days of benefit over the 14 days after randomization. Days of benefit combines patient symptoms captured by global clinical status with clinical state quantifying the need for hospitalization and IV diuresis."
