As a result, the study team hopes to influence the broader homeless healthcare initiative",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this program will be to bring 6-8 mobile on site mammography clinics to homeless shelters that house women over a two-year period. Prior to arrival, clinic staff will recruit women to participate in a survey to elucidate beliefs and barriers around breast health and mammography. After the survey, clinic staff will conduct the outreach program, consisting of a brief educational session about breast health and mammography for any participating women. Education will be tailored to be culturally appropriate, and delivered by a female public health educator with experience in the underserved community. The educational session will explain screening options and address common barriers. After education, eligible women who wish to receive a mammogram may receive one from the on-site mobile mammography clinic free of charge. Throughout the day, the community educator will also lead activities and meals will be provided in order to create a festive atmosphere and inspire a sense of community among the women. Spanish speaking staff will be available for the educational sessions."
