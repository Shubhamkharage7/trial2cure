Weight loss surgery has been well studied for patients with body mass index (BMI) 35 kg/m\\^2 or more and those with weight-related medical problems who have a BMI 30 kg/m\\^2 or more. However, outcomes after weight loss surgery in patients with BMI under 35 kg/m\\^2 and without co-morbidities have not been well studied.",

Weight loss surgery has been well-studied for patients with body mass index (BMI) 35 kg/m\\^2 or more and those with weight-related medical problems who have a BMI 30 kg/m\\^2 or more. Weight-related medical problems, also called co-morbidities, can include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, and degenerative joint diseases. The surgery is considered safe and effective. Outcomes after weight loss surgery in patients with BMI under 35 kg/m\\^2 and without co-morbidities have not been well studied. The investigators' purpose is to study patient-reported outcomes after weight loss surgery in patients with BMI between 30 kg/m\\^2 and 34.5 kg/m\\^2 without co-morbidities. These include changes in health, mood, quality of life, health satisfaction, and emotional health."
