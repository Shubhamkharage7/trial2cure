            "briefSummary": "This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation and how well it works with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation targets cancer in bone marrow and blood, instead of applying radiation to the whole body. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation before a donor transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation before donor transplant and cyclophosphamide after transplant may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety/feasibility of combining a total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) transplant conditioning regimen with a post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis strategy, through the assessment of: adverse events: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration and complications: including acute GvHD, infection and delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GvHD at 100 days post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).\n\nII. To estimate the CI of chronic GvHD at 6 months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.\n\nIII. To estimate GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.\n\nIV. To describe the kinetics of immune reconstitution and T cell repertoire in the first year post alloHCT.\n\nV. To estimate overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and CI of relapse, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.\n\nVI. To characterize quality of life using 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT), and M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) or Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) at 100 days, 6 months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.\n\nVII. To assess bone marrow cellularity from bone marrow samples. VIII. To assess the clonogenic potential of cells from bone marrow samples. IX. To assess stromal damage from bone marrow samples. X. To evaluate cytokines and oxidative stress markers.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TMLI.\n\nPatients undergo TMLI twice daily (BID) on days -4 to 0, then undergo bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0. Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus given by continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) on days 5-90, and filgrastim beginning on day 5 until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is at least 1,500/mm\\^3 for 3 consecutive days.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 24 months."
