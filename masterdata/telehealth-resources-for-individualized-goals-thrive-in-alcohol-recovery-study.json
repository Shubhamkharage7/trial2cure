The project will also examine the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of MBRP as an accessible and freely available continuing care option that supports long-term recovery from alcohol use disorder in all communities nationwide, including medically underserved and health professional shortage areas.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) groups delivered via Zoom in promoting whole-person recovery from alcohol use disorder, and to examine how MBRP affects mechanisms of behavior change based on neurobiologically-informed addiction cycle domains. The investigators will use a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to prospectively test the effectiveness of MBRP, as well as identify barriers and facilitators of MBRP group participation to inform future implementation of MBRP continuing care. Individuals (n=430) who have recently engaged in a change attempt to stop or reduce their drinking (via treatment or self-change) will be randomized to either MBRP groups via Zoom or referral to online mutual support. Participants will complete measures of psychosocial functioning, alcohol and other drug use, addiction cycle domains, and previously established predictors of recovery every 6 months for 3 years. Using a mixed methods design in the MBRP group, the investigators will examine facilitators and barriers to participation and engagement in MBRP, and assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of MBRP via Zoom as continuing care in communities nationwide."

The groups will also consist of people in various stages of recovery and familiarity with the material, which can make for richer discussions of the material led by the group members themselves.
