Based on previous data, a risk adaptive treatment approached is proposed in 4 groups: Low risk, standard risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA will be analyzed to identify novel biomarkers that predict chemoradiotherapy (CRT) response and toxicity.",
            "detailedDescription": "After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a risk-stratified dose of treatment (radiation dose and chemotherapy number of cycles) based on predefined clinical and biological biomarkers for anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Radiotherapy will be delivered on the MR-Linac for image-guided-radiation therapy (IGRT). Patients will be followed for up to 5 years after radiotherapy and be required to complete questionnaires and clinic visits. Patients have the option to complete blood and tissue samples during the study."
