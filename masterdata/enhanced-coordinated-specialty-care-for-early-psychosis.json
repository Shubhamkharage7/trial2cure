The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 Does the addition of certain elements of care increase the number of visits in treatment for first-episode psychosis?\n\nParticipants will either:\n\n* Receive care as usual (CSC) or\n* Receive care as usual (CSC) plus five additional care elements (CSC 2.0):\n\n  1. Individual peer support\n  2. Digital outreach\n  3. Care coordination\n  4. Multi-family group therapy\n  5. Cognitive remediation\n\nResearchers will compare the standard of care (CSC) to CSC 2.0 to see if participants receiving CSC 2.0 have more visits to their clinic in their first year."
