TUB-040 is an antibody-drug-conjugate which delivers a topoisomerase I inhibitor to tumor cells which overexpress the target NaPi2b. The study consists of two parts: In dose escalation, ovarian cancer patients and lung cancer patients receive increasing doses of TUB-040 until the maximal tolerated dose is found. In dose optimization, at least two doses are compared with each other to determine which dose is optimal for patients.\n\nTUB-040 is given IV every 3 weeks until the disease progresses or the patient has to stop due to side effects."

Active corneal disease, or history of corneal disease within 12 months prior to enrollment.\n14. Active, uncontrolled impairment of the urogenital, renal, hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurologic, or hematopoietic systems which, in the opinion of the investigator, would predispose the patient to the development of complications from the administration of protocol therapy.\n15. History of another malignancy with ongoing treatment or not yet free from disease for 2 years, except for appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, or other malignancy with a similar expected curative outcome.\n16.
