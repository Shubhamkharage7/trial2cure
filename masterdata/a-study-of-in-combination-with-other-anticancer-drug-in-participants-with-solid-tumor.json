Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive Note: the sponsor has evaluated whether to include participant with HIV. Given that this is the first combination study of E7386 with lenvatinib and that the main mechanism of action of E7386 is immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment along with the fact that several anti-retroviral therapies have drug-drug interaction with cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) substrates, the sponsor has decided not to include these participants at the current time.
