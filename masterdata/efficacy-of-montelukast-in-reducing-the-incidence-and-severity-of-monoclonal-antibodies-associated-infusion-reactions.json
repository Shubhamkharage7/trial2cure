            "briefSummary": "The use of monoclonal antibodies (MA) either alone or as part of chemoimmunotherapy in oncology, benign and malignant hematology is expanding. Of the 17 therapeutic MAs approved in 2017 by FDA, 50% of them are indicated for hematologic and oncologic condition. With increasing number of approved agents, therapeutic MAs have become one of the fastest growing areas in the management of benign and malignant hematologic condition. Advancement of recombinant technology allows development of partially or fully humanized new agents. Despite this, they still carry significant risk of immune and non-immune mediated adverse events. Most of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody related adverse events (MCAAE) The severity of reaction is variable, ranging from mild involvement of single organ to severe and life-threatening reactions requiring hospitalization or even resulting in death.\n\nEven for mild infusion reactions, where re-initiation of infusion is possible, there is resultant delay in delivery of infusions, distress to patients, and additional utilization of health care resources.\n\nDue to unpredictability of standard infusion reaction (SIR), efforts have been focused on premedication to decreasing the incidence and severity of infusion reaction. Most institutions have protocols using corticosteroid, acetaminophen and antihistamine as part of their premedication protocols. This has reduced but not eliminated standard infusion reactions. Most recently, mast cell stabilizers are being added to standard protocols to further reduce the incidence and severity of standard infusion reactions with variable anecdotal success without formal study. Of all the monoclonal antibodies, only Daratumumab has been evaluated using this strategy.\n\nThis study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of mast cell stabilizer Montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg in decreasing the SIR in patients receiving therapeutic MAs either alone or as part of chemoimmunotherapy in hematologic condition. The MAs being studied includes: Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO, Amgen Inc.), Daratumumab (DARZALEX, Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Elotuzumab (EMPLICIT, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), Gemtuzumab (MYLOTARG, Pfizer Inc.), Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA, Genentech USA, Inc.), and Rituximab (RITUXAN, Genentech US); The investigators postulate that 10 mg of Montelukast, when given in addition to standard premedication, will lead to decrease in incidence of MA associated SIR, shorter infusion time and decrease use of additional health care resources",
            "detailedDescription": "Study design:\n\nThis is a Phase II single arm open label study evaluating 10 mg Montelukast given at least 2 hours prior to infusion of monoclonal antibody in addition to standard premedication. Monoclonal antibodies being evaluated include those commonly used to treat hematologic and oncologic malignancies like (Blinatumomab, Daratumumab, Elotuzumab, Gemtuzumab, Obinutuzumab, and Rituximab).\n\nArms/Intervention; Study subjects will be given 10 mg of Montelukast to be orally self-administered at least 2 hours prior to beginning of chemotherapy section Standard premedication will be administered according to institution protocol"
