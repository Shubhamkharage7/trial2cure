Additionally, we will assess changes in fecal microbiome composition, metabolic parameters including a comprehensive lipid panel, glucose, insulin, TNF alpha, IL6, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, IGF1 and IGFBP1 and immunologic function as assessed by T cell and monocyte phenotypic and functional assays in patients with CLL after participation in the behavioral intervention.\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\n-- Identify differences in the metabolic, immunologic and fecal microbiome composition in patients with CLL who have a high CLL comorbidity index score (CLL-CI) compared to patients with CLL and a low CLL-CI score. And, investigate the association of comorbidity score, disease features, CLL-specific prognostic factors and clinical outcomes."
