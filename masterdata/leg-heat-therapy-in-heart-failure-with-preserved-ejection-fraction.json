Our central hypothesis is that HT treatment will lead to improvements in skeletal muscle and microvascular function compared to a control intervention. As a result, we anticipate that patients treated with HT will demonstrate improved skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow and oxygenation resulting in enhanced exercise tolerance. To explore this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aim: Explore the effects of home-based HT on exercise tolerance in patients with HFpEF."
