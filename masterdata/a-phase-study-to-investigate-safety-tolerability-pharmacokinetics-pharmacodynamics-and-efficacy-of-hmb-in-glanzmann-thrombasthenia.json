            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of HMB-001 in Participants with Glanzmann Thrombasthenia.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Parts A, B, and C: To determine the safety and tolerability of HMB-001\n* Part A: To establish the dose level(s) and dosing interval(s) of HMB-001 to be investigated in Parts B and C\n* Parts B and C: To estimate the ability of HMB-001 to prevent the number and severity of bleeds\n\nPart A will assess differing singular doses of HMB-001 in small groups of participants. The dose administered to a newly enrolled participant (or groups of participants) may only increase if analysis of data from previous dosing shows it is safe to do so. The planned duration of participation in Part A is approximately 6 months, which consists of a Screening Period, an optional Run-in Observation Period, and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.\n\nPart B is similar to Part A as it involves testing different dose levels of HMB-001 in small groups of participants. However, in Part B, HMB-001 is given multiple times over a 3-month period, either weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks. Part B consists of a Screening Period, a Run-in Observation Period, a 3-month Treatment Period, and a Safety Follow-up following the last dose of HMB-001.\n\nPart C is open to participants from Part B and consists of approximately a 9-month Treatment Period and a Safety Follow-up following the last dose of HMB-001."
