Part 3 will be comprised of single cohort of participants with an autoimmune disease and will investigate repeat doses of LAD191. Each ascending dose level will be investigated by a sequential cohort, with dose escalation based on satisfactory safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, biomarker and clinical response assessments will be performed throughout.\n\nEach cohort will be randomized to receive LAD191 and placebo.\n\nEach participant will participate for about 14 weeks in Part 1, 17 weeks in Part 2 and 18 weeks in Part 3 of the study."

Congenital or acquired immunosuppressive condition that would put participant at risk during the study, per Investigator judgment.\n15. Neutropenia; defined as a neutrophil count \\<2.0 x 10\\^9/L, at Screening.\n16. Participant has had major surgery (requiring general anesthesia) within 3 months prior to Day -1, or has major surgery planned during the study. For participants with an autoimmune disease may have had incision and drainage of abscesses up to 1 week before Day -1).\n17. Participant has donated plasma or blood or has lost more than 450 ml blood in the 60 days prior to Day -1, or intends to donate blood during the study or in the 60 days after the last scheduled study visit.\n18. Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding (or is planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study or within 90 days after the last dose of study drug).\n19. History of, or positive test result at Screening for, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg), antibody to the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), or antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/2).\n20. Participant has taken any medications, including over-the-counter (OTC) medications, within 14 days (or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) before Day -1. (Note that hormonal contraceptives are allowed, and acetaminophen is permitted at doses \\<=2 g/day up to 48 hours prior to each study visit).\n21. Participant has received any type of live or attenuated vaccinations within 28 days prior to Screening, or is planning to receive any such vaccine during the study (inactive vaccines are allowed) or has received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine within 14 days of Day 1.\n22. Participant has received any investigational drug in any clinical study within 30 days (or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to Day -1, or is on extended follow-up from such a clinical study.\n23. Participant has a history (within 2 years prior to Screening) of alcohol or drug abuse, as per Investigator judgment, or has a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse (opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabinoids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cotinine, phencyclidine) at Screening or on Day -1, or a positive urine alcohol test at Screening or on Day -1.\n24.

Consumption of any foods containing poppy seeds within 48 hours (2 days) prior to Screening and Day -1 as this could result in a false positive drug screen result.\n27. Participant has any other serious or uncontrolled physical or mental dysfunction that, as judged by the Investigator, could place the participant at higher risk derived from his/her participation in the trial, could confound the results of the trial or is likely to prevent the participant from complying with the requirements of the trial or completing the trial.\n28. Participant is an employee or relative of the Sponsor/vendors, clinical study site, or is an individual or employee directly involved with the conduct of the study or is an immediate family member of such an individual.\n\nParticipants with an Autoimmune Disease (Cohort 9 Only)\n\nFor participants with an autoimmune disease, the exclusion criteria for healthy participants listed above apply, with the following additions:\n\n1. Concurrent use of the following medications/treatments:\n\n* Systemic immunosuppressants/immunomodulators or other systemic treatments for autoimmune disease within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before Day -1.\n* Systemic antivirals or antifungals within 28 days prior to Day -1, or systemic antibiotics within 28 days prior to Day -1.\n* Oral analgesics including opioids within 14 days prior to Day -1, except for acetaminophen at doses of \\<=2 g/day for relief of autoimmune disease-associated pain.\n* Prescription and OTC medications other than those used for the treatment of an autoimmune disease within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before Day -1, except for hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement medications, and medications used for the treatment of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (but not metformin), or hyperlipidemia which are permitted provided the medication(s) and dosage (dose and frequency) have been stable for at least 6 weeks prior to Day -1.
