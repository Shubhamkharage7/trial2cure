The investigators' hypothesize that sub-acute (12 weeks) WBV will lead to improvement in the level of knee pain and improve vascular function via a decrease in systemic inflammation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Knee osteoarthritis (KO) is a leading cause of disability and medical cost. Whole body vibration (WBV) has emerged as an exercise alternative that may be more tolerable than traditional forms of exercise, such as treadmill walking/running or cycling. Similar to traditional exercise, research supports that WBV can be very beneficial for your health. In fact, a single bout of WBV increases circulating concentrations of inflammatory markers. WBV is safe and effective, WBV training has been conducted in obesity, elderly, patients with diabetes, patients with lung disease, as well as patients with knee osteoarthritis."

Participants will be instructed to remove any footwear and stand mid-center on the platform in a standing position with feet shoulder width apart. The participant will be asked to step on and off of the vibration plate. During the first four weeks, participants will be asked to complete 5-10 minutes of WBV per day, at least 4-5 days per week. At least 24 hours will be recommended in between sessions during weeks 1-4. Beginning at week 5, participants will be asked to increase WBV time to up to 15 minutes and/or reduce the duration of rest. Beginning at week 9, based on how the participant feels, the study team may adjust the WBV time/duration up to 20 minutes per session, 4-5 days per week.",

PPT is used to measure deep muscular tissue sensitivity. The test determines the amount of pressure over a given area in which a steadily increasing non-painful pressure stimulus turns into an uncomfortable or painful pressure sensation. The subject will lie supine. An investigator will assess PPT at the following sites: a) 2 cm below the medial edge of the patella and b) 2 cm below the lateral edge of the patella. Using the 1 cm2 probe, the investigator will place it perpendicular to each site and apply pressure at a rate of 0.5 kg/cm2/s. Each trial will stop when the subject reports pain. The investigator will take 3 trials at each site; the average of the 3 trials, recorded in kg/cm2, will be used for statistical analysis.",
