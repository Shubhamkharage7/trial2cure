Dietary nitrate supplementation in the form of beet root juice increases NO bioavailability and improves exercise tolerance in younger adults, yet its effects on fatigability in older adults are largely unknown. The proposed research will investigate the impact of increased NO bioavailability on vascular function, skeletal muscle bioenergetics, and fatigability in older (\u226565 yrs) men and women."
