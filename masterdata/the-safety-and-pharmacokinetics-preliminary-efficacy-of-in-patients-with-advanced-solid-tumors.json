The dose-escalation stage is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMP7068 monotherapy. The dose-expansion stage will be conducted with RP2D to further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity, safety and tolerability.\n\nA total of approximately 140-350 patients will be enrolled in the study.\n\nApproximately 60-100 patients will be enrolled into Part 1 dose escalation of IMP7068 monotherapy. A total of 100 patients each with advanced solid tumor will be evaluated in Part 2 dose-expansion of IMP7068 monotherapy."
