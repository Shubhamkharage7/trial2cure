The current exploratory project aims to evaluate and understand how the brain and cognition may improve after a 12-week intervention that combines brain training and aerobic exercise training to improve brain function, both in those with mild cognitive impairment (some with possible prodromal Alzheimer's disease) and with healthy aging. Findings from this pilot project will guide and refine the development of a future larger clinical trial that aligns with the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan of Action (NAPA), especially regarding \"Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by 2025."
