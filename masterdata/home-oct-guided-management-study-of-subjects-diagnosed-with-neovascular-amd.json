            "briefSummary": "During the last 25 years, OCT has become one of the most common imaging technologies used to diagnose and monitor retinal diseases, including AMD. The OCT self-imaging capabilities of the Notal Vision Home OCT (NVHO) system for retinal fluid visualization in the central 10 degrees were validated during several prospective clinical studies1,2,3,4,5. This study is designed to evaluate the retinal fluid exposure of eyes with NV-AMD, using the NVHO system to guide therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design:\n\nThis single arm study will enroll up to 15 subjects diagnosed with NV-AMD in at least one eye. Subjects may have previously participated in Notal Home OCT studies. Both eyes of the subjects will be enrolled unless an eye does not meet the inclusion criteria of VA \u2265 20/320. Subjects will be consented and screened. During screening, clinic staff will provide an overview of the NVHO system to subjects. Subjects who meet all screening criteria will be enrolled.\n\nDefinitions of the 2 data sources by periods:\n\nProspective data collected during NVHO guided management period, termed the study period Retrospective data collection during the preceding reference period\n\nTreatment During the Enrollment Visit:\n\nIt is expected that enrollment will take place during routine visits, therefore regardless of the fluid status at time of enrollment, it may include standard care anti-VEGF treatment.\n\nEyes may be enrolled if they were treated recently, and the subject agrees to enroll prior to the next pre-scheduled office visit. The Notal Home OCT system is a non-significant risk investigational device, and it will be used in addition to standard care. NSR letter will be provided to each site.\n\nAt Home Setup and Tutorial:\n\nSubjects who meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be assigned a NVHO device.\n\nThe device will be delivered to the subjects' homes. The subjects will unpack and install the NVHO according to setup guide instructions attached to the package. Upon first usage the subject will undergo an on-device tutorial, explaining how to operate the device and self-image their eyes.\n\nDaily Self-Testing:\n\nSubjects will be instructed to self-image their study eye(s) daily at home for 6 months.\n\nSelf-imaging data will be automatically transmitted to the Notal Health Cloud at the end of the daily self-imaging. Volume scans containing 88 B-scans with an average separation of 34 \u03bcm over a 3 mm by 3 mm field centered on the fixation point will be generated from the raw scan data for each eye.\n\nPhysician Monitoring:\n\nThe physician will perform a weekly or frequent review of the NVHO output for all the enrolled eyes from their own study site using an online secured viewer. In addition, the investigator will set a fluid volume notification threshold per fluid type (IRF/SRF/TRF).\n\nThe investigator will perform a review within 48 hours from a notification of fluid level reaching the threshold or a time-based review reminder. The details of the flow of the review and corresponding actions are described in the Monitoring Flow Chart Figure 1.\n\nRoutine Care / Surveillance Visits:\n\nA routine care visit is planned after 3 months of participation in the study. Following a NVHO review-driven visit, the next routine visit will be rescheduled for 3 months later or will be cancelled if coincides within 4 weeks of the exit visit.\n\nCommercial OCT scan data will be collected during the routine visits. If during a routine visit, the investigator determines that treatment is required, a dedicated treatment visit will be scheduled one week (+/- 2 days) after the routine visit. This is to support office administration and allow the collection of additional data from the NVHO monitoring prior to treatment. The investigators can override the planned schedule at their discretion and document the reason accordingly.\n\nHigh Frequency Self-Testing Following an Injection:\n\nFollowing a treatment during the study, the subject will be asked to self-image the study eye every 2-3 hours during daytime hours for 3 days."
