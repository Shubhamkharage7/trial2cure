            "detailedDescription": "Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder that accounts for approximately 10 percent (%) of all hematologic cancers, making it the second most common hematologic malignancy. The overall rationale of this study is that talquetamab or teclistamab in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor may lead to enhanced clinical responses in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma through multiple mechanisms of action. The study will evaluate the clinical hypothesis that talquetamab or teclistamab can be safely administered at the selected dose when combined with a PD-1 inhibitor. The study will consist of a screening period, treatment period (Part 1: dose escalation and Part 2: dose expansion) and a post treatment follow-up. End of study is defined as last study assessment for last participant in study. Total duration of study is up to 2 years 5 months. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points."
