Participants randomized to CETA will be assigned to a CETA provider (clinical psychology or social work graduate student or master's degree substance abuse counselor). Enrolled participants will be discussed at weekly supervision meetings. An individualized treatment plan will be designed for each participant including type and order of CETA modules. The counselor will contact the participant by phone to schedule CETA sessions and follow up any missed appointments.
