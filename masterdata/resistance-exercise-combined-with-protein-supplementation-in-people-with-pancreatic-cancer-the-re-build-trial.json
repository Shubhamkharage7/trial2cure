            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to determine whether a virtually supervised resistance exercise (RE) intervention combined with protein supplementation (PS) is feasible in pancreatic cancer patients initiating chemotherapy and if it will improve skeletal muscle mass.\n\nThe names of the study interventions involved in this study are:\n\n* Resistance training and protein supplement intake (RE + PS)\n* Resistance training (RE)\n* Attention control (AC), home-based stretching",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a randomized controlled trial that will assess feasibility and compare skeletal muscle mass, biomarkers of tissue wasting, physical function, and overall quality of life between three groups - exercise and supplement, exercise-only, and attention control. This study intends to evaluate whether resistance exercise and protein supplementation can improve skeletal muscle mass as well as decrease tissue wasting biomarkers in the blood, among patients undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer as there is some evidence that pancreatic cancer patients can experience muscle wasting while on chemotherapy.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including extensive evaluations of participant fitness and body composition including CT, blood tests, fitness and strength assessments, and surveys at study entry, half-way through the intervention, and follow-up visit.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) Resistance exercise and protein supplementation (RE+ PS), 2) Resistance exercise (RE), or 3) Attention control (AC).\n\nThis research study is expected to last for up to a total of 4 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 45 people will take part in this research study."
