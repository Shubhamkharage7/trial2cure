            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this preliminary study is to examine the effects of adult day service use on subjective and physiological measures of stress in 50 Black informal caregivers for individuals with dementia (IWD). The PI of the proposed study has substantial training in primary data collection and complex-survey secondary data analysis, she also has the fundamental knowledge to investigate how sociocultural and behavioral factors can influence psychosocial stress. The proposed study will enroll participants from adult day service (ADS) nationally, to examine the effects of adult day service use on subjective and physiological measures of stress in 50 Black informal caregivers. The proposed study extends the current science on the use of ADS on subjective and physiological stress by 1) examining differential impacts of ADS specifically on subjective measures of stress for Black caregivers, 2) evaluating the impact of ADS use on physiological measures of stress among Black caregivers; and 3) examining the relationship between subjective indicators and physiological processes for Black caregivers."
