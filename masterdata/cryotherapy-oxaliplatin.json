            "detailedDescription": "Peripheral neuropathy often manifests as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, which may be detrimental to the patients' overall safety and quality of life, thereby causing them to stop or delay treatment. Everyday tasks such as walking, buttoning a shirt, or tying shoes can become challenging. Select chemotherapy agents are known to cause significant peripheral neuropathy. Studies have been performed demonstrating efficacy of using cryotherapy, which causes vasoconstriction, to targeted areas of the body, in relation to paclitaxel. These studies have shown drastic differences between those who receive cryotherapy during treatment and those who do not. There are few studies on the use of cryotherapy in the prevention of peripheral neuropathy with the use of oxaliplatin, which will be undertaken in this study."
