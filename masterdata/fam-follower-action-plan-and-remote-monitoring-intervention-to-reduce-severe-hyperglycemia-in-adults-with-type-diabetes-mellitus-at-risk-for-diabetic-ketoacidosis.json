            "briefSummary": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) results in significant morbidity and healthcare utilization and is the main contributor to loss of life expectancy in people with diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) \\<50 years old. This suggests the need to develop interventions to reduce DKA events. Innovative features of newer continuous glucose monitoring devices offer opportunities for novel strategies to reduce DKA. Designating a family member, friend, or caregiver as a Follower was associated with reduction in HbA1C, increased time in range, and improvement in quality of life metrics in people with T1DM. However, the previously published studies are limited as they were either retrospective, survey-based, or do not overlap with our proposed cohort involving adults ages 18-65 with T1DM (prior prospective studies involved either pregnant women with T1DM or adults \u226560 years of age with T1DM). This study is a randomized controlled trial pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention (FAM) using a Follower, Action Plan, and Remote Monitoring of glucose data to reduce severe hyperglycemia, a modifiable risk factor for DKA, in adults with T1DM at high risk for DKA. The intervention uses real-time glucose data sharing with a Follower (family member, friend, or caregiver) and personalized diabetes education provided to the dyad (person with T1DM and their chosen Follower). The study hypothesizes that the FAM intervention will reduce the percentage of time spent with glucose \u2265250 mg/dL compared to standard care alone."
