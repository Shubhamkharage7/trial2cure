However, additional evidence is needed to understand whether menthol flavor in e-cigarettes is important for harm reduction among menthol cigarette smokers in the context of a menthol cigarette ban. The primary aim of this project is to understand how the availability of menthol vs tobacco flavor e-cigarettes influences switching and reduces smoking behavior among adults who currently smoke menthol cigarettes to understand the potential effects in the context of a ban of menthol cigarettes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Menthol cigarette use remains a major public health problem and the FDA has proposed to ban menthol in cigarettes. However, additional evidence is needed to understand whether menthol flavor in e-cigarettes is important for harm reduction among menthol cigarette smokers in the context of a menthol cigarette ban.\n\nThe primary aim of this project is to understand how the availability of menthol vs tobacco flavor e-cigarettes influences switching and reduces smoking behavior among adults who currently smoke menthol cigarettes to understand the potential effects in the context of a ban of menthol cigarettes. The secondary aim of this project is to understand whether smoking behavior outcomes differ by race to understand the impact of these potential menthol ban policies on addressing tobacco-related health disparities.\n\nThis single site study will take place over a 4 year study period; approximately 14 weeks for each participant's completion.\n\n150 adults who currently smoke menthol cigarettes will be enrolled and prospectively randomized using a randomization ratio of 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 groups (N=50 per group). Following an initial baseline period where participants have access to their usual menthol cigarettes (Phase I), participants will receive tobacco products to use for 8 weeks based on their assigned group modeling 3 possible regulatory scenarios (Phase II): 1) no menthol ban (menthol cigarettes and e-cigarettes available), 2) menthol ban in cigarettes only (non-menthol cigarettes and menthol e-cigarettes available), 3) menthol ban in both cigarettes and e-cigarettes (non-menthol cigarettes and tobacco e-cigarettes available). A follow-up survey at week 12 will assess tobacco use outcomes."
