            "briefSummary": "Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a chronic inflammatory condition with severe painful ulcers. We hypothesize that Platelet-rich plasma(PRP) therapy derived from patient's own blood has a high concentration of endogenous growth factors, which will activate the wound-healing cascade stimulating formation of new blood vessels and collagen in PG ulcers.The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous Platelet rich Plasma(PRP) therapy for the treatment of chronic Pyoderma Gangrenosum(PG). Researchers will also compare the efficacy of PRP therapy when used as a topical solution versus injections in and around the target ulcer/s.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, randomized split-ulcer controlled trial that will enroll 10 adult patients with chronic pyoderma gangrenosum. In each participant, up to three separate ulcerations will be randomized into 3 comparative groups in 1:1:1 ratio to either receive monthly intralesional PRP injections or topical PRP therapy at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks while the third target ulcer will receive standard wound care only. In the event that only two ulcerations are present, they will be randomized to 1:1 standard care vs topical and intralesional PRP. All other ulcers, if any, will receive standard wound care during the study period. Participants will be followed up for 4 weeks after the completion of treatment period. The primary endpoint for this study will be the composite proportion of the target ulcers achieving either complete resolution or 50% reduction in the surface area at week 12."

Systemic corticosteroids \\> 20 mg per day (prednisone or prednisone equivalent) within 8 weeks of Day 0 or change in dose within 4 weeks of Day 0. Steroids may be tapered (although not increased above the Day 0 dose) during the trial as determined by the principal investigator.\n   4. Intralesional corticosteroids within 8 weeks of day 0; topical immunomodulators are also not permitted.\n   5. Systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks of Day 0.\n   6. Hyperbaric treatment within 4 weeks of Day 0.\n   7. Investigational drug or investigational device within 4 weeks of Day 0.\n   8.
