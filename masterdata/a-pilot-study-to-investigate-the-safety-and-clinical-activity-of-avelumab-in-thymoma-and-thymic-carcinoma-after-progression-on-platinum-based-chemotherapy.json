            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThymoma and thymic carcinoma are cancers originating in the thymus gland. Platinum-based chemotherapy is standard treatment for them. But not uncommonly, the disease returns and people need more treatment to keep the cancer from growing. The drug Avelumab could help the immune system fight cancer.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test if avelumab is safe and well-tolerated, and is effective in treating relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 18 and older with thymoma or thymic carcinoma that has returned or progressed after platinum-containing chemotherapy\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* Blood, urine, and heart tests\n* Scan: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.\n* Physical exam\n* Medical history\n* Biopsy: a needle removes a piece of tumor. Samples can be from a previous procedure, although it is desirable to undergo a new biopsy.\n\nParticipants will have treatment in 2-week cycles. They will continue until the side effects are not tolerable or their disease gets worse. Visits at the following time points are required per protocol. Patients who respond to treatment or have durable stability after at least 12 months of therapy may undergo a dose de-escalation regimen to continue on therapy.\n\n* Every 2 weeks: Participants will get avelumab by infusion in a vein (IV). They will get diphenhydramine (benadryl) and acetaminophen (tylenol) by mouth or IV before receiving avelumab to decrease the chances of developing a reaction to avelumab. They will have blood, urine, and heart tests periodically.\n* Cycles 4 and 7, then every 6 weeks: Scans will be performed to look for shrinkage or growth of tumor.\n* Cycle 4: Participants will be offered a chance to undergo a biopsy.\n* 2-4 weeks after stopping treatment: Blood, urine, and heart tests will be performed. Participants might undergo a scan.\n* 10 weeks after stopping treatment: Blood, urine, and heart tests.\n* About 6 months after stopping treatment, then every 3 months: Participants will have scans andcan allow genetic testing on their blood and tissue samples.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background\n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymic epithelial tumors (TETs). However more than half of these patients experience disease recurrence and require second-line therapy. There are no approved drugs for treatment of recurrent thymoma and thymic carcinoma and new therapeutic options are needed for patients who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing therapy. The clinical activity of checkpoint blockade targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) has been demonstrated against various tumor types. We have demonstrated the ability of avelumab to induce major responses in patients with advanced thymoma in a phase I dose escalation study. Further investigation of avelumab in patients with TETs is needed to define the clinical activity and safety of immune checkpoint blockade in patients with TETs.\n\nPrimary Objectives\n\nTo determine the safety and tolerability of avelumab in participants with relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\n\nTo determine the objective response rate (ORR) to avelumab in participants with relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\n\nEligibility\n\nParticipants with histologically confirmed, unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma who have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen with progressive disease prior to study entry\n\nPrior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is permitted if the reason for discontinuation was not disease progression or life-threatening adverse events (laboratory abnormalities alone with prior therapy will not exclude participants from this trial)\n\nMeasurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria\n\nAdequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function\n\nNo major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of avelumab\n\nNo prior thymic tumor-associated autoimmune disease with the exception of pure red cell aplasia and vitiligo.\n\nDesign\n\nThis will be a single-arm, pilot study to determine the clinical activity and safety of treatment with avelumab in participants with relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\n\nAvelumab will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously once every two weeks until disease progression or development of intolerable adverse events. The two week period will constitute one cycle.\n\nPer the study team s discretion, participants who respond to treatment or have durable stability after at least 12 months of therapy may undergo a dose de-escalation regimen to continue on therapy.\n\nToxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE version 5.0.\n\nTumor response will be assessed after completion of every third cycle (6 weeks) using RECIST criteria, version 1.1.\n\nWhen possible, a tumor biopsy will be conducted pre-treatment and on C4D43 to evaluate treatment-related, intra-tumoral changes."

Participants with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, pure red cell aplasia, Good s syndrome or hypo- or hyperthyroid diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies will be checked during screening. Participants will be ineligible if results are positive, even if there is no clinical history of autoimmune disease.\n* Participants with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis. However, participants who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease has remained stable for 3 months without steroid therapy may be enrolled.\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy or significant acute or chronic infections including, among others:\n\n  * Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening (positive HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test positive).\n  * Known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n* Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation.\n* Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (NCI CTCAE v5 Grade greater than or equal to 3).\n* Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v5Grade \\> 1) however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade less than or equal to 2, or other Grade less than or equal to 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigator s judgment are acceptable.\n* Pregnancy or lactation period.
