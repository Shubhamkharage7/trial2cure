Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups receiving either LLLT or sham LLLT. Subjects will receive LLLT or sham LLLT weekly over a period of six weeks. At each visit, patients will rate their pain using the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and assess their functionality using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Subjects will have a follow up visit six weeks after the treatment protocol for a final assessment of pain and function. The Phoenix Thera-Lase laser is a Class II, 510k cleared device (#K151521) and is legally marketed in the US. Investigators are using in accordance with its approved labeling and no changes to the approved labeling are being sought.",

Investigators are using in accordance with its approved labeling and no changes to the approved labeling are being sought.\n\nThe Phoenix Thera-Lase System is intended to emit energy in the infrared spectrum to provide topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, muscle spasm, pain and stiffness associated with minor arthritis, promoting relaxation of muscle tissue and to temporarily increase local blood circulation. It is specifically designed as a high-power laser with an output power of 35 Watts and an output wavelength of1064 nm. The study will be utilizing an output power of 74 Watts and an output wavelength of 1275 nm."
