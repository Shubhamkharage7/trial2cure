The study will enroll 30 subjects. The study design is a randomized, controlled, within-subject trial to compare the effectiveness of KeraStat Gel vs. standard of care (SOC), silver sulfadiazine (SSD). Each of two distinct burns will be randomized to the use of KeraStat Gel or SOC. Patients will be seen weekly for the first month and then at months 3, 6, and 12 post burn."
