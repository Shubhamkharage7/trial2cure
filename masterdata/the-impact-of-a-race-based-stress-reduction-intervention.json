Prior to starting the intervention\n2. Mid-way through the intervention (Week 4)\n3. End of the intervention (Week 8)\n4. Six (6) months after the completion of the intervention",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants of both programs - RiSE and Health Education Program (HEP) - will meet weekly for 8 consecutive weeks for approximately 2 hours every week. Two booster sessions will occur one month and two months after completion of the interventions. Classes will meet synchronously over Zoom. RiSE classes will be facilitated by two trained clinical psychologists. Expert speakers will be hired to provide the HEP classes (e.g dietician, pharmacist). The investigators will vary the time of day for each 8- week program in order to meet the scheduling needs of participants. Cohorts of 9-12 participants each and sessions for the treatment and control group will be provided concurrently. Topics for the health education program (HEP) (attention-control) were selected so they would not confound the overall objectives of the RiSE program."

Facilitators provide psychoeducation on intersectionality, structural racism, overt racism, microaggressions, and internalized racism.
