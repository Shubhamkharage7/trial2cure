This will be a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of the IOP program and examine OUD-related outcomes following discharge from the hospital.",
            "detailedDescription": "The aim is to conduct a single-arm pilot study of 20 participants who are hospitalized for serious injection-related infections to complete the newly tailored program. The intervention to be developed and tested has two components: 1) the remotely delivered IOP (\"Smart IOP\"), and 2) a peer recovery coach who will provide support and accountability to the participant. The feasibility of the intervention will be established by evaluating recruitment and the acceptability of the program according to a priori benchmarks. The study team will assess the program's preliminary efficacy by evaluating OUD-related outcomes for up to 28 days after discharge from the hospital. The study will be conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), an urban, 793-bed academic medical center located in Boston, MA, and a major teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School."
