The long-term goals of this research are to improve sound perception with cochlear implants and to better understand the functioning of the auditory system. Information from individuals with and without cochlear implants will be compared.",

This work is expected to provide new insights into the corresponding improvements in perceptual outcomes to these newer strategies have been modest at best and performance has begun to level off."

The process will be repeated in random order until 20 loudness estimates are obtained for each stimulus (3 electrodes x 2 rates x 10 amplitudes) for each subject. The dynamic range will be determined by measuring the maximum acceptable loudness (MAL) and threshold for each of the stimuli.
