            "briefSummary": "More than 30% of Black women with obesity binge eat. Binge eating may increase the risk for the development of metabolic syndrome and binge-eating-disorder (BED), which is associated with severe obesity. Though several effective treatments for binge eating exist, Black women have not fared well. Not only has their inclusion in treatment trials been limited, but when participating, they are more likely to drop out, and/or lose less weight, compared to their White counterparts. Furthermore, treatment for binge eating is often not available in primary care and community-based settings places where Black women are more likely to receive treatment for their eating and weight-related concerns. Currently, there is scant intervention research to treat binge eating in Black women. With the highest rates of obesity (57%) nationally, Black women are in need of culturally-relevant treatments for binge eating and weight gain prevention. Given the established relationship between frequent binge eating and subsequent weight gain, addressing binge eating among Black women with obesity is imperative.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1. Modify and adapt a validated program to be a culturally-relevant digital health tool for binge eating and weight management for Black women (BMI \\> 30 kg/m\\^2) who binge eat.\n\nAim 1a. Identify the barriers and facilitators to detecting and treating binge eating in Black women with obesity, and identify strategies for optimizing digital health tools to engage and retain this population.\n\nAim 1b. Conduct usability testing with a group of stakeholders to guide content and design refinements; refine tool.\n\nAim 2. In a randomized clinical trial, examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the digital health appetite awareness + behavioral weight program in primary care."
