Eligible subjects (N=112) will be randomly assigned to 8 weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for MDD either immediately, or after a 8-week long waiting period (50-50 chance). The investigators hypothesize that Smartphone-delivered CBT for MDD will be feasible and acceptable to individuals with MDD, and that it will lead to greater reductions in MDD symptom severity compared to the passage of time (waitlist control)."
