            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the safety, side effects, best dose and effectiveness of mezigdomide (CC-92480) when given after idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma chimeric antigen receptor \\[CAR\\] T-cell therapy) in patients with multiple myeloma that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed). CC-92480 works by binding to a protein called CRBN that triggers the breakdown of proteins: Ikaros and Aiolos, leading to cell death in multiple myeloma cells. Giving mezigdomide after Abecma CAR T cell therapy may extending the amount of time that the CAR T cells persist in the body in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of mezigdomide (CC-92480) given post idecabtagene vicleucel when administered as a continued therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of mezigdomide (CC-92480) when administered post idecabtagene vicleucel.\n\nII. To determine the persistence of CAR T cells at day 90 (D90), day 180 (D180), and day 365 (D365) after start of mezigdomide (CC-92480) therapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess levels of serum BCMA monthly at day 1 of every cycle. II. To assess the effects of mezigdomide (CC-92480) on non-cancer immune cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow samples.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of mezigdomide.\n\nStarting between 30 and 90 days after infusion of idecabtagene vicleucel, patients receive mezigdomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 or days 1-14 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) during screening. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months within 1 year of start of treatment, and then every 6 months until progression or for up to 2 years."
