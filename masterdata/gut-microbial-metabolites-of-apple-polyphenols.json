It will evaluate how differences in gut bacteria across individuals influence metabolism of polyphenols from foods, which may influence health benefits that people receive from different foods.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, cross-over controlled feeding trial. Thirty healthy adult volunteers will be selected to participate on the basis of urinary screening results measuring a gut bacterial metabolite that is produced following consumption of a soy food: 15 O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) producers and 15 age and gender-matched ODMA non-producers will be included. Participants will be assigned to consume two diets in random order: an apple catechin diet that provides a controlled amount of catechins in apple juice, and a nutritionally-matched low catechin diet. Both diet phases will last 3 days, with a 10 day washout period in between the two diet phases."
