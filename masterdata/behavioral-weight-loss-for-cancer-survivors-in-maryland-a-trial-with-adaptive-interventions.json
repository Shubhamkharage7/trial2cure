The core study design is randomized controlled trial with adaptive intervention.\n\n1. CORE Helpline in all participants (first 2 months)\n2. Extended Helpline in early responders (additional 6 months)\n3. Enhanced Helpline in early non-responders (additional 6 months)\n4. Intensive Helpline in early non-responders (additional 6 months)",
