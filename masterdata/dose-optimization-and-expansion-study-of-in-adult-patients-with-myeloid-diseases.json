The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and recommended dose for single agent DFV890 in patients with lower risk (LR: very low, low or intermediate risk) myelodysplastic syndromes (LR MDS) and lower risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (LR CMML).",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is to find out if study treatment DFV890 is safe and tolerable, and can help patients who were diagnosed with a myeloid disease such as: very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and very low, low or intermediate risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The study seeks to determine the optimal dose of DFV890 that is safe and efficacious in patients with myeloid disease. The effectiveness and safety/tolerability of the study treatment is not yet confirmed in this disease setting.\n\nEligible patients meeting all study entry requirements will be required to provide a sample from their bone marrow at screening and at select study timepoints. All enrolled patients will be dosed for a minimum of twenty-four weeks (6 cycles of treatment) unless they experience side effects related to the study treatment requiring dose interruption/discontinuation, worsening of the disease, and/or if treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or the patient."
