            "briefSummary": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are chronic diseases of the gut comprising Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The symptoms of IBD consist of diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, fatigue and rectal bleeding. However, symptoms and treatment vary between patients. Early management of IBD can lead to better response rates and decrease the risk of irreversible bowel damage and future disease complications such as surgeries. Current clinical tools for diagnosis and or assessing progression of IBD are either invasive (colonoscopy), have low patient acceptance (fecal calprotectin) or low accuracy (C-reactive protein). The purpose of this study is to collect clinical data and samples (including blood, breath and stool) donated by patients with IBD and patients with no IBD (controls) to facilitate research that may result in the development of new non-invasive methods of diagnosing IBD and understand the progression of the disease over time in order to better manage IBD patients."
