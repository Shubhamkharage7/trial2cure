            "briefSummary": "This trial is a limited multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) in pediatric patients with MRD positive CD22-positive B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).\n\nSome patients with newly diagnosed ALL maintain low levels of MRD, despite achieving complete remission with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Others experience re-emergence of low level MRD or increasing levels of MRD on therapy or post-transplant. New approaches are needed to achieve undetectable MRD in these high-risk patients.\n\nInotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized IgG subtype 4 monoclonal CD22-targeted antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent anti-tumor antibiotic. CD22 is expressed in more than 90% of patients with B-cell ALL, making it an attractive target in this patient population. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has demonstrated exceptional activity in adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* Assess the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with MRD positive CD22+ B-ALL with 0.1 - 4.99% blasts in bone marrow.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* Study the safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin when used in patients with MRD - positive CD22+ B-ALL with \\< 5 % blasts in bone marrow.\n* Estimate the incidence, severity, and outcome of hepatotoxicity and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) in patients during inotuzumab ozogamicin and following subsequent treatment, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).",
            "detailedDescription": "The drug will be administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Patients who do not meet the definition of treatment failure after the first cycle may receive up to five additional cycles of therapy. .\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year."
