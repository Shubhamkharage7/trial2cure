            "briefSummary": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disease that causes progressive muscle weakness. There is now substantial evidence that boys with this disease do not demonstrate age-related gains in their cognitive skills.\n\nThe goals of this study are (i) to use a technology-enabled neurobehavioral assessment called National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) to assess brain development over time; (ii) engage with key-stakeholders to understand how neurodevelopmental problems like attention-deficit hyperactivity, autism spectrum affects individuals (and/or) families, so that we can understand meaningful effects of a potential treatment at an individual level, and (iii) to investigate using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in brain connectivity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be asked to do tasks such as solve puzzles, pay attention, and remember things through the NIHTB-CB administered using an IPad as well as complete questionnaires. The NIHTB-CB will be done four times (first visit, within 1 month after first visit, 12 months after first visit, and 18 months after first visit). NIHTB-CB takes about 20 to 35 minutes to complete.\n\nParticipants will also undergo brief assessment of the upper limbs; these tests will be administered by trained physical therapists and will take about 5 minutes.\n\nFocus group: A focus group consisting of families and individuals affected by DMD will be invited to share their journey of cognitive and developmental needs. The focus group will be conducted online via the study team and is planned to last between 1 to 1.5 hours. This is optional for families.\n\nA non-sedated brain MRI will be performed twice; scans will be separated by a one-year interval. (A child has to be age 8 or older to participate in a brain scan.) Brain imaging is optional for families."
