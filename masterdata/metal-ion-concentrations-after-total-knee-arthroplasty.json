Baseline blood examinations for Cobalt, Chromium, Titanium, and Nickel will be performed before TKA implantation at preoperative visits and on the first day following the procedure. The investigation will encompass patients receiving both conventional and robotic-assisted primary TKA, framed within a prospective cohort study design. Baseline characteristics and additional follow-up information will be gathered."
