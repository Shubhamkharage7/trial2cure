This type of treatment approach is called total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT). The researchers will also look at whether the sequence of the treatment approach (NALIRIFOX + ADXRT and capecitabine followed by surgery, when it is possible) is effective and causes few or mild side effects in participants. An important purpose of the study is to see how the study treatment (NALIRIFOX + AD-XRT and capecitabine) affects participants' quality of life. The researchers will measure quality of life by having participants fill out questionnaires"

Postmenopausal women are defined as those who have had an absence of menstruation for at least 2 years. If necessary, follicle-stimulating hormone results \\>50 IU/L at screening are confirmatory in the absence of a clear postmenopausal history.\n   2. Female subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use two effective methods of birth control during the study and for 9 months after the last dose of study medication.\n   3. Male subjects must agree to use condoms during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study medication'\n\nDisease-specific inclusion criteria:\n\n1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed PDAC that has not been previously treated.\n2. Radiographically BR or LA PDAC in accordance with the NCCN 2.2021 definition, without evidence of distant metastases by CT.\n3.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n5. Hematological, biochemical, and organ function inclusion criteria:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651500/mm\\^3 without the use of hemopoietic growth factors within 7 days before treatment\n   2. Platelet count \u2265100,000/mm\\^3 .\n   3. International normalized ratio (INR) \\<1.5 unless the patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, in which case a therapeutic INR is acceptable. Anticoagulation therapy with low-molecularweight heparin or warfarin, whether medically indicated, is permitted.\n   4. Adequate renal function, as evidenced by serum/plasma creatinine level \\<1.6 mg/dL\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Presence of metastatic pancreatic cancer (M1 disease)\n2.

Unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures and/or study visits.\n4. Medical co-morbidities, that preclude major abdominal surgery\n5. Histologic diagnosis other than adenocarcinoma; however, adenosquamous variants are acceptable.\n6. Receipt of chemotherapy, prior abdominal radiotherapy, and/or definitive resection for pancreatic cancer.\n7. Grade \\>2 neuropathy.\n8. Pregnant and/or nursing.\n9. Uncontrolled active infection, which would preclude with the exception of resolving cholangitis which in the investigator opinion would render the treatment hazardous.\n10. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the chemotherapeutic agents\n11. Receipt of concurrent investigational therapy or within 30 days of protocol initiation.\n\n    Additional criterion for the immunoPET imaging sub-study (n=20)\n12. Previous anaphylactic reaction to human, humanized or chimeric antibody.\n13. Refusal or inability to tolerate the scanning procedure (e.g. due to claustrophobia).",
