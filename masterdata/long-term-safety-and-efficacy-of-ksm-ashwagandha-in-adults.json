            "briefSummary": "The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical safety of KSM-66 Ashwagandha (Withania Somnifera) on long-term administration over 12 months. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the laboratory safety of KSM-66 Ashwagandha (Withania Somnifera) on long-term administration over 12 months and to evaluate the efficacy of KSM-66 Ashwagandha (Withania Somnifera) on long-term administration over 12 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "To qualify for this study, participant must be male or female between 18 and 65 years old and prescribed KSM-66 Ashwagandha by their clinicians for a long-term period. Participants must have no plan to commence any other alternative treatment modality for their conditions. Participants must be willing to sign an informed consent document and to comply with all study related procedures. Participants must have a body mass index between 25 and 39.9 kg/m2.\n\nIn this study, a total of 200 subjects will be included across 4-5 study sites, for a total duration of 12 months. At the initial visit, prospective patients will be screened for enrollment based on the requirements of the study, medical history, and clinical examination. Before starting any study related procedures, participants will be explained about the study in detail and a written informed consent will be obtained from participants prior to participation in this study. This document is a part of the written informed consent procedure. A detailed medical history including the associated conditions will be recorded. A general and physical examination will be performed to detect any abnormal parameters. If participants meet the eligibility criteria, they will be enrolled in the study.\n\nAfter enrollment in the study, participants will be asked to consume Ashwagandha 300 mg root extract capsule orally twice daily, morning and evening after breakfast and dinner with a glass of water. At Visit 1 (Screening/Enrollment/Baseline Visit - Day -3 to Day 0), demography and medical history will be taken, physical examination and vital signs will be performed, blood will be collected, study medication will be dispensed, and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale and Quality of Life using the SF-12 QoL scale will be assessed.\n\nAt Visits 2 to 6 (Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), participants will follow up remotely via a phone call. Compliance and concomitant medication will be noted.\n\nAt Visit 7 (Month 7), participants will follow up on site, where a physical examination and vital signs will be performed, blood will be collected, study medication will be dispensed, Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale and Quality of Life using the SF-12 QoL scale will be assessed, and compliance will be assessed.\n\nAt Visits 8 to 12 (Months 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), participants will follow up remotely via a phone call. Compliance and concomitant medication will be noted.\n\nAt Visit 13 (Final Visit - Month 12), participants will follow up on site, where a physical examination and vital signs will be performed, blood will be collected, Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale and Quality of Life using the SF-12 QoL scale will be assessed, and compliance will be assessed. Participants will be monitored throughout the study, including any adverse events."
