            "briefSummary": "This is a pilot study being done to attempt to improve episodic memory problems in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. The pre-supplemental motor area (preSMA) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) have been shown to play a role in episodic memory and language retrieval. Prior studies have suggested that neurostimulation targeting this region can improve episodic memory and word recall. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the preSMA/dACC region and its influence on word retrieval and other cognitive functions in patients with MCI or dementia. Entraining the preSMA/dACC circuit with 10 sessions of HD-tDCS will allow us to study whether neurostimulation may be an effective treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "The research objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of HD-tDCS to the preSMa/DaCC region and its influence on word retrieval and other cognitive functions in patients with MCI or dementia after 10 sessions of HD-tDCS. There will be two treatment arms: active HD-tDCS (1 mA) and a sham group. For Phase 1, participants will receive 10 sessions of active stimulation (1 mA anodal HD-tDCS targeting preSMA/dACC for 20 min) or sham across 2 weeks. Word retrieval and other cognitive tasks will be completed at baseline, immediate follow-up after session 10, and a 2-month follow-up. For Phase 2, participants randomized into the sham group will have the opportunity to return after 2 months and receive the active treatment while being unblinded to their treatment condition. Following 10 active treatment sessions, word retrieval and other cognitive tasks will again be completed immediately following the last HD-tDCS session and then a 2-month follow-up."
