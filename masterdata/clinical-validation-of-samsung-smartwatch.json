            "briefSummary": "Objective:\n\nWearable technology holds promising potential for mental health monitoring and detection. Samsung has developed an algorithm that they believe can detect signs of depression and anxiety in smartwatch users. They have used this algorithm to create a \"Mindfulness Index,\" which is an easily understood visual index of mental health. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of Samsung's Mindfulness Index in identifying those who have received a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from a clinician-administered semi-structured diagnostic interview.\n\nResearch Procedures:\n\nThe target sample size is 75 individuals diagnosed with current Major Depressive Disorder and 75 healthy controls. To meet this target, the recruitment target is set at 215 participants. Participants will be assigned to the MDD condition, or the healthy control condition based on their score on the Beck Depression Inventory. Each subject will be followed for 3 months. Participants will be provided with a Samsung smartphone and Samsung smartwatch. Participants will be asked to wear the smartwatch 24 hours per day, except while charging. This smartwatch will collect data on heartrate, sleep time, and step count. During the study, each day participants will receive texts prompting a link to a \"daily diary.\" These surveys will ask about depression and anxiety symptoms. Additionally, during the first 3 weeks of the study, participants will participate in ecological momentary assessment; texts will be sent 5 times per day prompting participants to fill out a survey about how they currently feel in that moment. These extra surveys will stop after the first 3 weeks of the study, but the daily diary surveys will continue throughout the study. Furthermore, virtual clinician visits will occur at weeks 4, 8, and 12."
