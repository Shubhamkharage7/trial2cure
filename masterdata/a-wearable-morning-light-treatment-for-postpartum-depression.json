In addition to using the Re-Timer light for 5 weeks participants will complete questionnaires at various timepoints, record sleep information, wear an actigraph watch, and provide saliva samples. Additionally, the sleep of the participants' infants will also be monitored using an ankle-worn device (actigraph) and sleep diary at certain time-points as this may influence the mother's mood/sleep, and in turn affect the results.\n\nThe hypotheses regarding the bright light versus the placebo dim light of the study are:\n\n* morning bright light therapy will produce greater improvement from pre- to post-treatment on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression\n* morning bright light therapy will lengthen the Phase angle difference (PAD) and this will mediate change in depression symptoms.\n* morning bright light therapy will produce greater improvements on self-reported depression symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, maternal-infant bonding, social functioning, and sleep-related impairment from pre- to post-treatment."
