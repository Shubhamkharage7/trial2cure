            "briefSummary": "The goal of this Phase I Open-Label study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of VentriGel injection in children with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Whether VentriGel is safe in treating patients with HLHS\n* Whether there are any preliminary improvements in measures of cardiac function following Ventrigel injection",
            "detailedDescription": "HLHS, a type of congenital heart disease, presents a unique challenge where the left ventricle fails to develop, necessitating the right ventricle to manage both systemic and pulmonary blood flow. This condition, once fatal, has become manageable due to advancements in surgical techniques, with reported 5-year survival rates of 70-90%. However, these staged procedures, while lifesaving, can strain the right ventricle, leading to long-term issues such as weakened muscle and reduced cardiac function. Additionally, even with surgical intervention, patients often face a diminished quality of life.\n\nAddressing these challenges, ongoing clinical trials explore regenerative therapies, particularly stem cell injections, aiming to improve heart function. Yet, concerns persist regarding the practicality and efficacy of these treatments, including issues with cell survival and coordination of injections within narrow timeframes.\n\nInnovatively, the investigator and the team propose an alternative approach using VentriGel, an injectable hydrogel derived from decellularized porcine myocardium. Originally designed for treating heart failure post-myocardial infarction in adults, VentriGel has shown promising results in animal models, demonstrating significant improvements in cardiac function. Notably, its shelf-stable nature and flexible timing for administration offer advantages over traditional stem cell therapies.\n\nMoreover, VentriGel's effectiveness in addressing right-ventricular failure, as demonstrated in recent studies, highlights its potential as a solution for HLHS patients. Leveraging approved extracellular matrix devices, such as Alloderm and SurgiSIS, further underscores the feasibility and safety of this approach, paving the way for potentially transformative treatments in congenital heart diseases."
