            "briefSummary": "Patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) confront decisions about how to treat their disease, interact with their health care providers, and modify lifestyle choices that may improve treatment outcomes. With sponsorship support from Janssen and in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, this survey study will seek to understand and examine whether people living with PsA are interested in and motivated to participate in wellness activities. This cross-sectional observational survey study will help researchers and clinicians to better understand what some of the barriers and facilitators experienced by patients are when considering participation in guided online wellness activities.\n\nPeople that qualify for the study and complete a 10-minute survey will be invited to participate in Immune Strength, an online wellness program developed by the Cleveland Clinic. Immune Strength is a free 10-week program for creating better habits for a more resilient immune system. By following this program, participants will have the opportunity to learn about how to develop strategies and implement behavior changes for healthier immune functioning.\n\nParticipants will be recruited by the Global Healthy Living Foundation (GHLF). GHLF is the parent organization of the CreakyJoints\u00ae (CJ) arthritis patient community and primary site for the PCORI-funded Arthritis Patient Partnership with Comparative Effectiveness Researchers (AR-PoWER) Patient Powered Research Network (PPRN), known as ArthritisPower\u00ae. ArthritisPower is a subset of CreakyJoints members who have expressed interest in participating in research and signed an informed consent form to participate in the PPRN and its associated research. Any individuals recruited from CreakyJoints or Facebook, who are not already members of ArthritisPower will be encouraged to join the ArthritisPower registry research app, but will not be required to do so in order to participate in the study."
