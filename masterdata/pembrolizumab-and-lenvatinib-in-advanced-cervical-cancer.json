            "briefSummary": "This is a phase II trial of combination therapy of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cervical cancer that had failed first line of therapy. The hypothesis is the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab will overcome vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated immunosuppression to enhance the response of patients with locally advanced or metastatic cervical cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary endpoint of this phase II study is to determine the objective response rate (partial response \\[PR\\] + complete response \\[CR\\]) of specific pembrolizumab-lenvatinib combination therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cervical cancer. The phase II portion of the trial will follow Simon's minimax two-stage design1.\n\nIn the Stage 1, 11 patients will be accrued. If 1 or fewer patients among these 11 patients achieve an objective response with the pembrolizumab-lenvatinib combination therapy, the combination therapy will be rejected and the trial stopped. However, if there are 2 or more patients who exhibit response in the Stage 1, then an additional 24 patients will be entered into the Stage 2, for a total of 35 patients in this phase II study. If 9 or more patients exhibit response among these 35 patients, then the treatment will be considered for further investigation. Any unplanned interim analysis will utilize the sequential conditional probability ratio test (SCPRT)2, which allows an early assessment of statistical evidence for both efficacy and futility, and provides a discordance probability that early trend could be reversed should the trial continue to enroll all 35 patients."

Has uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (Systolic BP\\>140 mmHg or diastolic BP\\>90 mmHg) in spite of an optimized regimen of antihypertensive medication.\n20. Has electrolyte abnormalities that have not been corrected.\n21. Has significant cardiovascular impairment: history of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months of the first dose of study drug, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment at Screening.\n22. Has bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.\n23. Subjects having \\> 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment indicates that the urine protein is \\<1 g/24 hours.\n24.
