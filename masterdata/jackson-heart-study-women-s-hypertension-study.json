Even when they are aware they have high blood pressure, many people struggle to keep their blood pressure controlled. Research shows a connection between life stress and high blood pressure and heart disease outcomes. Mindfulness training programs can help people regulate their emotions and cope with stress. Research shows that mindfulness programs can also lower blood pressure. This study will compare two programs: MIND-BP, a Zoom-based mindfulness training group; and BOOST, a Zoom-based support group. The aims of the study are to test if the MIND-BP program leads to greater reductions in blood pressure, stress and depressive symptoms than the BOOST program in Black women with high blood pressure who are participating in the Jackson Heart Study. The primary outcome measure is 6-month change in systolic blood pressure. The secondary outcome measures are 6-month changes in perceived stress and depressive symptoms."
