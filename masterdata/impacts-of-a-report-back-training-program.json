The investigators evaluate the training using pre- and post-tests. The training program includes an introductory module on ethical and practical benefits and best practices for report-back. This is followed by a session where researchers gain hands-on practice in report preparation using Digital Exposure Report-Back Interface (DERBI), a digital report-back tool. Pre- and post-tests assess outcomes related to their prior concerns about report-back, knowledge about report-back, shifts in perspectives on its value, novel insights about data from Researcher- DERBI, and willingness to implement report-back in current and future studies."
