Participants with positive study scan results that are suspicious for prostate cancer outside of the prostate gland may be asked to undergo additional diagnostic test(s) and/or recommend certain treatment(s) for prostate cancer within 2 to 90 days after the study scan. Participants will be monitored for up to 12 months to collecting information about treatment they receive for prostate cancer and results of regular PSA blood draws if ordered by doctors for up to 12 months after the study scan."
