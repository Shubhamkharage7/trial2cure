If medical detoxification is required for any patient, patients would be enrolled after medical detoxification. for those not requiring detoxification, they will be enrolled directly without any requirement of alcohol abstinence. All patients will be provided behavioral counseling weekly with a trained counselor to support recovery during the trial. Primary outcomes will be percent of subjects no heavy drinking days (PSNHDD) and %of any drinking and heavy drinking days as well as secondary outcomes of craving, mood, anxiety and sleep problems.",

Subjects will be randomized to 16 mh /day Prazosin (PR) or Placebo (PBO) with a 2 week titration period and week 12 taper. All subjects will be assessed 2X weekly and also provided weekly behavioral counseling to support recovery."
