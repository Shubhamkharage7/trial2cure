            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant radiation therapy plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with treatment-na\u00efve resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nThis research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators are examining this intervention of neoadjuvant radiation therapy plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved atezolizumab, bevacizumab, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma but they have been approved for other uses. Surgery is an accepted and standard treatment option for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma\n\nThe study interventions (atezolizumab bevacizumab, and SBRT) are thought to increase the immune system's (the system in the body that fights against disease) response to cancer cells. These interventions may increase the immune system's response by helping the T cells (an immune cell that identifies and attacks infected cells) recognize and find cancer cells in the body. By increasing the system's response, it is believed the chances of recurrence of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be less than when only standard of care surgery is used.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment, including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as they and their doctor believe they are benefitting from the study interventions and will be followed for 5 years or until participants withdraw their consent to be contacted.\n\nIt is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study"

Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., to prevent a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) are eligible for the study.\n* Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications.\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation or on the wait list for liver transplantation.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment. The rationale for this exclusion is the unknown toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitors on developing fetuses and the known placental risk conferred by treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (such as bevacizumab).\n* Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab.\n* History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or recombinant human antibodies.\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of their excipients.\n* Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and interleukin 2 \\[IL-2\\]) within 4 weeks or 5 drug-elimination half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF-alpha agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after Medical Monitor confirmation has been obtained.\n  * Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n* Since this study aims to enroll only resectable (with curative intent) hepatocellular carcinoma subjects, patients with brain (or other sites of distant) metastases are excluded.\n* Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.",
