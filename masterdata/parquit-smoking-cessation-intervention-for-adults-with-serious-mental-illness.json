Additionally, participants will be randomly selected to participate in either a game-based physical activity group or a game group where the participants sit to play the games.\n\nParticipants will be in this study for 12 weeks total. There are 3 assessment visits (2 hours each) at the beginning of the study, 6 weeks after starting, and at the end of the 12 weeks. There will be 8 30- minute counseling sessions during the 12 weeks. The hour-long videogame groups will be held 3 times a week for 12 weeks (36 sessions). Upon completion of the 12-week program, there will be a 1-2 hour group interview. The total time commitment is 48 hours over the course of the 12-week study."
