            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to take a picture of the participants brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and then use an investigational way of imaging the brain, called Individualized Network-based Single-frame Coactivation Pattern Estimation (\"INSCAPE\") to capture the participants brain activity. This method uses a computer program to understand which parts of the participants brain communicate with each other and creates a map of the brain areas that are connected.\n\nThe participants may take part in this study either because they are planning to receive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (\"TMS\") for Major Depressive Disorder (\"MDD\"), or because they are healthy volunteers. If the participants agree to take part in the study, they will attend three experimental visits in which they will undergo MRI scans. The interval between each experimental visits is about 3 weeks. The study itself does not provide TMS treatments, as it is only to attempt to observe the effects of TMS on the brain.\n\nDuring each experimental visit, the investigators will conduct a brain scan for about 30 minutes in total. During the MRI scan, the participants will need to stay still, relax, and keep eyes open in the scanner. The purpose of this study is to explore whether this investigational brains can protocol, referred to as INSCAPE, can detect brain changes over the course of depression treatment while patients are receiving TMS. This method uses a computer program to understand which parts of the participants brain communicate with each other and creates a map of the brain areas that are connected."
