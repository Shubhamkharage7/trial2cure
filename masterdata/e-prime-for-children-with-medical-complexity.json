As a result, all CMC have multiple chronic conditions and need care from many specialists and services. While there are important benefits to the child and family in living at home, the continuing need for complex medical care places a profound burden on caregivers. Telehealth has long been considered a potential solution to barriers in access to care for children. The purpose of this research is to test whether telehealth can help pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) as they treat, monitor, and manage children with medical complexity (CMC). Additionally, it is to reduce caregiver and child burden as well as improve care coordination between multiple providers.",
            "detailedDescription": "The specific aims of this study are to: compare the effectiveness of Enhanced Primary Care via Telehealth (E-PRIME) verses usual care in improving child-level appointment and outcome measures; compare the effectiveness of (E-PRIME) verses usual care in reducing caregiver stress and improving caregiver satisfaction in primary care and care coordination services; evaluate how acceptable, appropriate, and feasible E-PRIME is from the perspective of practice providers and staff, and caregivers. Telehealth has long been considered a potential solution to barriers in access to care for children.
