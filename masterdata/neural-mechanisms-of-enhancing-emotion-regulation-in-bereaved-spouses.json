            "briefSummary": "This study investigates the underlying mechanisms of a novel emotion regulation intervention among recently bereaved spouses. More specifically, this study examines how thinking about an emotional stimulus in a more adaptive way can affect the relationship between psychological stress, psychophysiological biomarkers of adaptive cardiac response, and brain activity. The emotion regulation strategy targeted is reappraisal, specifically reappraisal-by-distancing (i.e., thinking about a negative situation in a more objective, impartial way) versus reappraisal-by-reinterpretation (i.e., thinking about a better outcome for a negative situation than what initially seemed apparent).\n\nThe study seeks to determine if relatively brief, focused reappraisal training in bereaved spouses will result in reduction of self-reported negative affect, increases in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a measure of heart rate variability reflecting adaptive cardiac vagal tone), reduction in blood-based inflammatory biomarkers, and changes in neural activity over time. Reappraisal-by-distancing is expected to lead to greater changes in these variables relative to reappraisal-by-reinterpretation. Additionally, it is expected that across time decreases in self-reported negative affect, increases in RSA, reductions in blood-based inflammatory biomarker levels, and changes in neural activity will in turn lead to reductions in depressive symptoms and grief rumination. Finally, it is expected that distancing training will lead to reductions in depressive symptoms and grief rumination that are mediated by changes in the targeted neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to use an experimental medicine approach to evaluate the basic psychological, psychophysiological, and neural mechanisms underlying a novel cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological outcomes (e.g., reducing depressive symptoms and grief rumination) in recently bereaved spouses. Cognitive reappraisal (i.e. the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way) represents a highly promising target for psychological intervention in bereavement. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial observer) and reinterpretation (i.e. imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The current study builds upon promising preliminary work to investigate the effectiveness and underlying neurobiological mechanisms of a novel, five-session cognitive reappraisal intervention in bereaved spouses.\n\nRecently bereaved participants (i.e. approximately 6 months post-spousal loss) will be randomly assigned to receive training in either distancing or reinterpretation, with five sessions occurring every 1-3 days, with longitudinal collection of affective, psychophysiological, physiological (i.e., blood draws to assess inflammatory biomarkers) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Follow-up questionnaire assessments will occur at one- and two-months post-intervention. The study aims to mechanistically relate changes in psychological, psychophysiological, physiological, and neural function during a novel emotion regulation intervention never before implemented in this stressed, high risk group. This research represents a Phase I, Stage I clinical trial. The primary endpoints are the assessments of the psychological, psychophysiological, physiological, and neural mechanisms mediating behavior change as a function of the cognitive emotion regulation intervention. The secondary endpoint is testing the efficacy of the intervention via assessment of psychological outcomes (i.e., the behavior change, as represented in changes in depressive symptoms, stress, and grief rumination)."
