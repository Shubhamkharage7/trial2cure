Recent data has shown that gut dysbiosis is present in individuals with sickle cell disease. Gut dysbiosis has been linked to inflammation in certain diseases. Omega -3-fatty acids (fish oil) has been shown to improve pain outcomes in individuals with sickle cell disease, but its acceptance is variable. The aim of this study is to determine if a plant-based omega-3-fatty acids will be more acceptable and also improve outcomes in individuals with sickle cell disease",

The aim of this study is to determine if a plant-based omega-3-fatty acids will be more acceptable and also improve outcomes in individuals with sickle cell disease.\n\nChildren aged 5-18 years will be randomized to receive a diet rich in omega-3-fatty acids versus a regular diet for 12 weeks after which there will be a cross over of arms after a 4-week wash out period. We will compare outcomes (including patient reported pain outcomes and improvement in inflammation markers) while on the omega-3 fatty acid rich diet."
