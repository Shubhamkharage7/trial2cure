In phase I of the study, up to 6 dose levels will be tested to find the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), after which patients enrolling to phase II will be treated at that dose level to assess efficacy. Although safety and tolerability has been previously determined in the sarcoma population, dose de-escalations of the chemotherapies in that patient population were required. Therefore, a phase I portion will be incorporated to determine the RP2D of the triplet in this population."
