Development of an acceptable, effective, and feasible screening approach will result in improved recognition of SD in AYA patients with and surviving childhood cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "Detailed Description:\n\nTo adhere to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Adolescent and young adult (AYA) and Survivorship Guidelines, the Investigator will be developing and implementing a standardized screening approach for sexual function using the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for Sexual Function and Satisfaction (SexFS) Brief. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and pilot test a patient-centered approach to assessing AYA patients with and surviving childhood cancer (age 15-24) for SD.\n\nPrior to the clinical trial, Aim 1 of this study will integrate patient and provider feedback to refine an approach to standardized sexual function screening. Once Aim 1 has been completed, the study protocol will be amended to update intervention details prior to proceeding with implementation across all clinics as routine clinical care.\n\nAims 2 and 3 involve a pilot type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial using a pre-post design. Prior to implementation of the intervention, data on sexual function screening and patient satisfaction will be collected through surveys and medical record review. Subsequently, the sexual function screening intervention will be implemented clinic-wide as standard of care for patients age 15-24 years with or surviving childhood cancer. Following implementation of the screening approach, post-implementation data (effectiveness and implementation outcomes) will be collecting via survey and EHR review in consenting patients. After effectiveness data collection is complete, implementation outcomes will also be assessed via surveys and interviews with consenting provider stakeholders."
