            "briefSummary": "As adults with type 2 diabetes age, they are increasingly vulnerable to treatment-related hypoglycemia and its related complications (including hospitalization and death). This study proposes to evaluate, in a randomized clinical trial, a strategy of expanded advance care planning to support older adults in value-aligned re-assessment of diabetes treatment regimens with their primary care team. If the aims of this project are achieved and incidence of clinically-significant hypoglycemia is reduced, this Prepare for Your Diabetes web-based patient educational care strategy could be scaled and applied in a wide variety of healthcare settings and chronic conditions in which evolving risks, benefits, and consequences of treatment require re-assessment with age.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this pragmatic, clinical efficacy, parallel group randomized clinical trial, the study will enroll eligible Kaiser Permanente Northern California members (age 75 years or greater, type 2 diabetes, prescribed insulin or sulfonylureas \\[SUs\\], and last measured HbA1c \\<=8%). Participants randomly allocated to the intervention arm will view the Prepare for Your Diabetes Care web-based educational module that is designed to help them prepare to discuss their diabetes medication regimens with their primary care providers and receive an Action Plan handout. Participants randomly allocated to the control arm will continue with usual care. All participants will complete baseline, 6-month, and 12-month surveys. The hypothesis is that empowering high-risk patients to engage in values-based discussions about diabetes treatment intensity will result - when clinically appropriate - in decreases in diabetes regimen intensity leading to decreased incidence of hypoglycemia over the 12-month study period. If successful, this study will provide evidence to support strategies for safer treatment in older adults with type 2 diabetes."
