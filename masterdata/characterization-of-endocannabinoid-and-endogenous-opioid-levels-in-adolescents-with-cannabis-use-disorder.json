Measure endocannabinoid (eCB) and endogenous opioid (endorphin) levels in the blood of adolescents who use cannabis regularly and adolescents who never use cannabis. We expect eCB and endorphin levels to differ significantly in adolescents who use cannabis regularly compared to adolescents who do not.\n2. Characterize circulating eCB and endorphin levels at baseline, during abstinence, and after natural resumption of cannabis use.\n3. Collect data to evaluate cannabis craving and to test for association of craving with eCB and endorphin levels in adolescents who use cannabis regularly. We expect that larger changes in eCB and endorphin levels will be associated with higher craving scores."
