Patients with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded.\n* Unstable angina, or new-onset angina within 3 months prior to initiation of cobimetinib\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure, defined as New York Heart Association Class II or higher\n* Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to initiation of cobimetinib\n* Known chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* History of \u2265 Grade 2 central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage or history of any CNS hemorrhage within 28 days of study entry\n* Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.
