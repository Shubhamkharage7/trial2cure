Demonstrate the usability and acceptability of a smart watch in parents to remotely monitor stress responses or symptoms in individuals participating in prevention or treatment interventions. 2. Examine the association between heart rate variability (HRV) data and momentary self-reports of stress by parents. 3. Conduct a feasibility study to establish the effectiveness of wearables and apps to improve emotion regulation in the short term (minutes, hours) and concomitant social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes over the longer-term (weeks)."
