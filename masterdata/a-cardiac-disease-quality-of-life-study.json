            "detailedDescription": "While physicians and patients may be aware of the physical limitations that result from a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), thoracic aortic dilatation (TAD) or radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD), there is little research on the impact on quality of life from the limitations imposed with these diagnosis. This study aims to address these unknowns in patients with HCM or TAD as well as radiation-induced heart disease in first-time patients at the Cleveland Clinic. Knowledge gained from this study will provide us the ability for better management of the chronic impacts of the disease by identifying potential risk factors of low quality of life or changes in quality of life over time.\n\nThis is a prospective, longitudinal, non-comparator, non-randomized survey study describing QOL outcomes for patients with HCM, TAD, or RIHD. Patients being seen for the first time at the Cleveland Clinic for cardiac disease with no previous or scheduled surgery for HCM or TAD will electronically complete a Cardiac Quality of Life Survey at 3 time points (baseline, 3 month \\& 9 month). The Cardiac Quality of Life Survey measures the participant's health status in five domains - global, physical, emotional, social, and spiritual - as well as self-efficacy and resilience."
