            "detailedDescription": "A study to evaluate subjects with fibrosis-inducing medical conditions that are known or suspected to cause tissue fibrosis (e.g. cancer-associated, post-infection, post-radiation, pre or post-transplant, cardiac, liver, kidney or pulmonary fibrosis). This protocol is intended to expand as needed with imaging arms designed to evaluate the use of Fibroblast Activating Protein (FAP) PET/ CT in imaging the presence fibrosis caused by medical conditions where fibrosis is believed to lead to pathological effects and poor prognosis.\n\n\\[18F\\]-FAPI-74 is a positron emitting radiolabeled FAP inhibitor that will be used with a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan that will be completed in each subject who has a clinical suspicion of fibrotic disease.\n\nPET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate the distribution of fibroblast activating protein (FAP) in major organs and other tissues affected with fibrotic diseases or conditions. This is an observational study in that \\[F-18\\]-FAPI-74 PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment decisions. While patients and referring physicians will not be blinded to the \\[F-18\\]-FAPI-74 PET/CT results, any medical or treatment decisions related to their underlying clinical diagnosis will be made by the treating physicians based upon clinical criteria.\n\nAfter injection of \\[F-18\\]-FAPI-74, patients will undergo a vertex to mid-thigh scan, starting at approximately 60 minutes post injection. PET/CT imaging sessions will include an injection of approximately 8.0 mCi (expected range of doses is expected to be 6.0-8.0 mCi) of \\[F-18\\]-FAPI-74 intravenously. Data will be collected to evaluate uptake of \\[F-18\\]-FAPI-74 in sites of suspected fibrosis and in major organs.\n\nAn optional second PET/CT using \\[F-18\\]-FAPI-74 can be considered at the request of the investigators at any clinically relevant time point. This second scan may be used to quantify the changes in fibrosis over time as part of the natural progression of the fibrotic condition, or to observe changes in \\[F-18\\]- FAPI-74 uptake in response to therapeutic interventions."
