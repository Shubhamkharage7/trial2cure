            "briefSummary": "Oropharyngeal dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a devastating condition that affects physiological and psychosocial functioning in 1 in 25 adults. Many dysphagia treatments exist, but our ability to adequately measure treatment outcomes is limited. Pharyngeal high-resolution manometry (pHRM) directly measures swallowing pressures, providing an objective measurement of physiology that characterizes the basic mechanisms of swallowing. pHRM is well-poised to measure outcomes of dysphagia treatments due to its direct, objective, and reproducible measures of swallowing function.\n\nThis proposed project will address a central hypotheses that objective swallowing measures (including (pHRM) will reveal treatment-mediated swallowing changes, will align with patient-reported outcome measures, and will be able to predict who will benefit from treatment. The investigators will follow a cohort of participants with oropharyngeal dysphagia as they undergo either pharyngeal strengthening therapy or relief of upper esophageal sphincter outlet obstruction at three time points: baseline, mid-treatment (4-6 weeks) and post-treatment (10-12 weeks). The investigators will compare participants to healthy controls using pHRM, videofluoroscopy, diet assessment, functional reserve tests, and patient-reported outcome measures."
