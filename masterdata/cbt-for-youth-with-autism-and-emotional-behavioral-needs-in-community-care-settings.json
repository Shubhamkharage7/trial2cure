We will randomly assign 50 mental health clinicians, each treating 2 youth (N = 100 youth total), to CBT program for emotional dysregulation and core autism symptoms with weekly live consultation with an expert or to usual clinical care augmented by self-instruction in CBT, in a 1:1 allocation. The CBT manual is well-supported in our efficacy research, has been replicated in other centers, is free/open-access (meya.ucla.edu), and has user-friendly digital and traditional print materials for mental health clinicians (e.g., psychologists, counselors) to use in preparing for and conducting therapy sessions. The primary outcome measure will be assessed weekly. Additional assessments will occur at Screening, Mid-treatment, Post- treatment and 3-month Follow-up."

Additional eligibility criteria are as follows:\n\n1. Youth will have a pre-existing clinical diagnosis of ASD made by an appropriate licensed professional (e.g., clinical psychologist, developmental pediatrician) which will be documented in a report or medical note provided by the family, or confirmed telephonically by the diagnosing professional.\n2.
