            "briefSummary": "Smokers believe that cigarettes with the \"natural\" or \"organic\" descriptors are less harmful than cigarettes without these descriptors, but we do not know if these beliefs are associated with how smokers interpret the experience of smoking a \"natural\" or \"organic\" cigarette, nor whether these beliefs are predictive of changes in smoking behavior or biological exposures. The primary goal of this study is to examine the relationship between exposure to \"natural\" or \"organic\" descriptors in cigarette advertising and smoking health risk expectancies, subjective effects, topography, and biological exposures. To accomplish this goal, we will enroll 250 adult daily cigarette smokers of Natural American Spirit (NAS) or non-NAS brands (125 in each group) in a within-subjects human laboratory study manipulating four expectancy conditions (own brand comparator, \"natural\" advertising, \"organic\" advertising, \"conventional\" advertising)."
