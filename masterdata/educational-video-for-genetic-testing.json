            "detailedDescription": "As over 15% of pediatric cancers are associated with a cancer predisposition, it is increasingly becoming standard of care for children with cancer, as well as those with suspected hereditary risk, to be evaluated for germline cancer predisposition. Unfortunately, the increase in pediatric genetic testing has exceeded the pace of research establishing best practices to optimize delivery of care for patients undergoing testing and their families. Tumor/normal genetic testing (testing of both tumor tissue and a paired normal sample) at time of cancer diagnosis or relapse is now widespread in pediatric oncology to improve cancer diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment; this testing also has potential to uncover underlying cancer predisposition syndromes with lifelong implications. Disseminating information at the time of cancer diagnosis is difficult, and is best done by a provider with expertise in cancer genetics. Thus, Investigators will develop an informational video for use prior to tumor/normal genetic testing to augment genetic counseling resources to support patients and families.\n\nIn this study, Investigators will develop and evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of an informational video on paired tumor/normal testing for children and adolescents with a new diagnosis of cancer, tumors or other diagnosis. Investigators will use a non randomized trial whereby a convenience sample of patients/families will be recruited to be controls in Year 1, followed by a convenience sample that will be allocated the video intervention In Year 2. To evaluate the impact of the video intervention, Investigators will compare assessments of two cohorts- an unexposed (no video intervention, Year 1) and exposed (video intervention, Year 2)."
