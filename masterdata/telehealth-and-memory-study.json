            "briefSummary": "The overall purpose of this trial is to confirm the efficacy of Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treatment of chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction among (female or male) breast cancer survivors. This is a multi-center, multi-clinician randomized control trial (MAAT vs. supportive therapy attention control condition). This trial will also evaluate a sub-sample of survivors pre-and post treatment with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a working memory task to evaluate pre-to-post treatment brain activation patterns to elucidate underlying mechanisms of clinical therapeutic change.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary aim of this multi-site, multi-clinician randomized controlled trial is to determine if Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention, can improve self-reported and objectively measured cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors who previously received chemotherapy. Breast cancer survivors (Stage I-III) who were treated with chemotherapy 1-5 years prior to enrollment and who have subjective cognitive complaints may be eligible for this study. After eligibility is confirmed, participants will complete baseline assessments of subjective and objective memory and attention functioning as well as behavioral rating scales, and will be randomized to MAAT or Supportive Therapy (ST; to control for therapist time and attention) for 8 weeks. Both treatments (MAAT and ST) will be delivered through videoconferencing using mobile (smartphone, laptop or other electronic device) in order to reduce survivor travel or time away from work or family. Data collection methods will include telephone- and web-administered measures of subjective and objective cognitive function, as well as various behavioral ratings. Outcome assessments will be conducted post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. It is hypothesized that MAAT participants will have significantly improved scores of self-reported cognitive impairments and objective neurocognitive test scores (on verbal memory and processing speed) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up compared to participants randomized to ST. In addition, willing and eligible participants will be asked to complete a functional MRI working memory task at baseline and post-treatment, to examine whether those who receive MAAT show greater increase in brain network activation than those who receive ST. This may advance understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying improvement of objective and self-reported cognitive function after chemotherapy. The sample size (n=100/group) will allow for a 10-15% drop out-rate and still provide 80% power to detect group differences using two (Group: MAAT vs. ST) by 3 (time: baseline, posttreatment, 6-month follow-up) ANCOVA at alpha=0.05. Potential baseline differences between MAAT and ST groups on primary outcome variables or other factors that may affect cognition (e.g., anxiety, fatigue or depression) will be evaluated as potential covariates, although such differences due to randomization are not anticipated."
