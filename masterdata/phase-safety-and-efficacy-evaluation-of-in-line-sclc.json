Patients will be randomized to 3 different dosing groups in OBD finding cohorts. Each cohort will enroll 6-12 SCLC patients who need \u22652nd line treatment without or with brain metastasis which is controlled with no active hemorrhage. This OBD finding cohort will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of AL8326.\n\nA phase 2 expansion cohort will be continued if a positive clinical result would have been observed after OBD determination for 40-60 patients. Upon FDA's approval the Phase 2 expansion cohort clinical study will be further expanded to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AL8326 in patients individually with SCLC who need = or \\>2nd line treatment without or with brain metastasis which is controlled with no active hemorrhage."
