            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm phase 2 study of etrasimod plus corticosteroids versus placebo plus corticosteroids for the treatment of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Diarrhea and Colitis (IMDC) CTCAE v5.0 grade \u2265 2 due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy alone or combined with another ICI or ICI plus chemotherapy that in the opinion of the treating physician requires treatment with corticosteroid-based immunosuppression and does not require immediate secondary immune suppression.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to improve the treatment of IMDC in people taking ICIs and find out if etrasimod combined with corticosteroids is more effective than a placebo combined with corticosteroids at lowering the total number of corticosteroids needed to treat IMDC.\n\nIMDC is one of the most common Immune Related Adverse Events (irAEs) from treatment with ICI. Current guidelines recommend steroid treatment for IMDC CTCAE grade \u2265 2, which requires that ICI therapy be stopped. Corticosteroids may interfere with ICIs and cannot be given at the same time, Strategies are needed to reduce the dose and duration of corticosteroids needed for IMDC treatment and minimize the duration that patients have to be off ICI therapy. (ICIs are a type of immunotherapy.)",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be screened as soon as IMDC is suspected but will not be randomized and administered the first dose of etrasimod or placebo until results from Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and other intestinal infection assays are confirmed to be negative. Due to the acute nature of some cases of IMDC (e.g., grade 4 IMDC), some participants may require initiation of corticosteroids before enrollment. Participants will undergo endoscopy within the first 7 days of starting study drug, which will be repeated 7 to 14 days after completing the last dose of study drug. Peripheral blood and stool will be collected prior to starting study drug (and before starting corticosteroids, if possible), 14 to 21 days after starting treatment with etrasimod or placebo, 7 to 10 days after completing etrasimod or placebo, and for patients who restart ICI treatment, 14 to 21 days after 1 cycle of ICI retreatment. In situations in which it is not feasible to collect and process peripheral blood prior to starting etrasimod or placebo, the sample should be collected and processed as soon as possible, and no longer than 72 hours after starting etrasimod or placebo."
