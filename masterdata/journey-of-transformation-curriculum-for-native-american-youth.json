            "detailedDescription": "This study assesses a new curriculum that will be available to students in the tenth grade. The lessons will include traditional storytelling and other Native American cultural arts activities (i.e., drum making, film making, field trips), as well as Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) activities. This study also assesses how well the curriculum explains leadership skills, Native American cultural arts, the natural environment, and promotes healthy decision-making around health and relationships.\n\nParticipants are randomly assigned to a health class that starts the curriculum in the fall or to a health class that will start the curriculum in the winter. Participants will:\n\nWeek 1. Complete a 15-20- minute online survey about healthy relationships, drug use, youth leadership skills, and connecting with Native communities.\n\nWeeks 1 - 3. Meet with a study educator up to two times to set goals around health, healthy relationships and how to reduce or avoid alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use.\n\nWeeks 1 - 12 (months 1-3). As part of the class, attend up to ten health sessions on healthy behaviors and health promotion. Learn new skills around youth leadership, storytelling, and traditional health practices. The sessions will highlight connection to tribal traditions.\n\nMonth 3. Complete an online check-in survey via a link sent to participants' email address.\n\nMonth 6. Complete an online check-in survey via a link sent to participants' email address.\n\nMonth 12. Complete an online check-in survey via a link sent to participants' email address.\n\nOptional after school activities:\n\nWeeks 9 - 16 (months 3-4). Attend a once-a-month activity to help build leadership skills. Activities are between 1-2 hours after school and include drum making, film making, creating a storytelling vest that incorporates their own cultural symbols, and up to two outdoor field trips. The field trips are to places of cultural significance near the school and involve a 30-45 minute hike.\n\nWeek 16 (month 4). Meet with the study educator for a session to revise goals for health and community leadership.\n\nWeeks 9 - 24 (months 3-6). Attend a 2-hour digital storytelling training and three monthly planning sessions to prepare for an optional digital storytelling leadership night. Stories can be about what participants have learned about health promotion, traditional health practices, and to celebrate their health leadership journey.\n\nWeek 25 (month 6). Attend the leadership night and present digital stories if participants would like. Help prepare a traditional feast and giveaway that will honor community culture and values."
