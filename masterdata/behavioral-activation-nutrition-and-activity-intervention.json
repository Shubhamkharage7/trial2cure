The program includes physical activity and nutrition guidance and is led by remote coaches. Investigators will recruit participants from the University of Maryland THRIVE program and other HIV centers in Baltimore. Investigators will test the program with 10 people aged 50 and above with HIV to see if it works. If it proves to be helpful and accepted, investigators might move on to a larger study to evaluate it more thoroughly."
