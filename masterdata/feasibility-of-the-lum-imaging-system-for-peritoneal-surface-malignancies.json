This feasibility study consists of two parts: (a) a dose escalation phase to select the optimal dose followed by (b) enrollment of additional patients to develop the tumor detection algorithm.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects will be recruited and screened at a single institution, Massachusetts General Hospital. All subjects will have an established diagnosis of metastases to the peritoneum from primary colonic, appendiceal, or ovarian cancer or mesothelioma and are scheduled for surgical debulking. This study consists of a dose escalation and timepoint evaluation phase and an evaluation and improvement phase following tumor detection algorithm development.\n\n30 patients will be enrolled into this study. 18 into a dose escalation arm and 12 in the algorithm development phase."
