The primary objective of the study is to test relationship between SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine) supplement on liver function. The hypothesis is that SAMe supplement will improve liver function in patients with alcoholic liver disease. The improvement in liver function will lead to the reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in those who receive SAMe supplement when compared to those receiving placebo."
