Subjects will be provided 21 days of standardized plant-based low fat/ high-fiber meals and complete a food diary up until lunch on the day prior to surgery. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and on the day of surgery. Stool samples will be collected throughout the dietary intervention period at specific timepoints, on the day of surgery, and 30 days post-surgery. Tissue from the tumor resection will be isolated for organoid cultures. Subjects will be followed per standard of care for up to 5 years or disease recurrence, whichever comes first. Subject may be treated for their cancer prior to surgery and/or during the follow-up period."
