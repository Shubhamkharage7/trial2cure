Enrolled subjects will receive a combination of isatuximab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IsaRD) for 12 28-day cycles. The primary objective of this study is to determine bone marrow (BM) MRD \u22641x10\\^5 negativity rate, as measured by the clonoSEQ\u00ae next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, at the end of 12 months of IsaRD treatment. Other objectives will further assess efficacy, tolerability, and molecular response to the IsaRD regimen."

Major surgery within 14 days prior to start of study treatment (Note: vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are not considered major surgery).\n11. Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14 days prior to start of study treatment.\n12. Participation in other clinical trials, including those where a subject received an investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives of the investigational drug prior to start of study treatment, whichever is longer.\n13. Any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, would expose the subject to excessive risk or may interfere with compliance or interpretation of the study results.\n14. Hypersensitivity or history of intolerance to steroids, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, sodium stearyl fumarate, histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt), arginine hydrochloride, poloxamer 188, sucrose or any of the other components of study intervention that are not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers or would prohibit further treatment with these agents.\n15.
