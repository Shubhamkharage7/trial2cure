            "briefSummary": "Investigators will recruit up to 10 patients with Anxiety comorbid with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from the outpatient clinics at MUSC. This pilot trial will be an open-label investigation of the safety and feasibility of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) as a nonpharmacological wearable intervention used to manage anxiety and other neuropsychiatric symptoms at home, with patients/caretakers self-administering treatments. Each subject will undergo an initial in-person screening and be consented prior to participating in the study. This will be followed by an in-person training session with the subject (and caretaker if applicable), where they will learn how to self-administer taVNS and ask any pertinent questions. Participants will self-administer taVNS at home twice daily for 4 weeks. These treatments will not interfere with other aspects of their mental health care. Our investigators, over the prior 8 years, have demonstrated that taVNS is safe and feasible in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, investigators have recently demonstrated that taVNS is well tolerated and safely self-administered at home with remote monitoring. The investigators hypothesize that taVNS will be safe and feasible to administer at home in this new population. Results from this study may lead to further exploration of taVNS in this unique population.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a research study to find out if anxiety in patients with autism spectrum disorder are affected by a form of ear stimulation called transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation, or taVNS. Participants will learn how to self-administer ear stimulation treatments at home before starting the study. Over the course of a month, participants will self-administer ear stimulation treatments twice a day for a month. Each treatment will last up to 60 minutes (1 hour) and there will be a break of at least 30 minutes in between treatments. The study team will ask participants to complete a group of questionnaires at the beginning and end of the study. There will also be a smaller number of questionnaires completed electronically on a weekly basis. The questionnaires will ask questions about mental health symptoms that subjects may or may not be experiencing, including questions about mood, anxiety, and sleep."
