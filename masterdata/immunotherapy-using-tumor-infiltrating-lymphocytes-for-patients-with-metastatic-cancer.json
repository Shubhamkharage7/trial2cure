            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Adults age 18-72 with upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy.\n\nDesign:\n\nWork up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.\n\nSurgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.\n\nLeukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)\n\nTreatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n\nFollow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Metastatic digestive tract cancers, in particular esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary carcinomas, are associated with poor survival beyond five years and poor response to existing therapies.\n* Data from the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) and from the literature support that metastatic cancers are potentially immunogenic and that tumor-infiltrating\n\nlymphocytes (TIL) can be grown and expanded from these tumors.\n\n* In metastatic melanoma, TIL can mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when administered to an autologous patient with high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen.\n* The recent young-TIL approach, in which TIL are minimally cultured in vitro, not selected for tumor recognition, before rapid expansion and infusion to metastatic melanoma patients, has led to objective response rates comparable to previous trials relying on TIL screened for tumor recognition, with no added toxicities.\n* In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody enhances the anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.\n* We propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TIL adoptive transfer therapy in combination with pembrolizumab, administered either prior to cell administration or at the time of progressive disease, for metastatic cancers.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-Primary objective:\n\n--With Amendment BB, to determine the rate of tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer who receive autologous, minimally cultured TIL in conjunction with a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen, high-dose aldesleukin, and anti-PD-1.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients must be/have:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 72 years\n* Metastatic upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or endocrine tumors including neuroendocrine tumors refractory to standard chemotherapy\n\nPatients may not have:\n\n* Concurrent major medical illnesses\n* Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden\n* Unpalliated biliary or bowel occlusion, cholangitis, or digestive tract bleeding\n* Any form of immunodeficiency\n* Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients may undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines, and for frozen tissue archive. Lymph nodes, ascites,peritoneal implants, and normal tissue adjacent to metastatic deposit will also be obtained when possible for ongoing and future research as described in the NCI-SB cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).\n* With the approval of Amendment BB, patients will be enrolled on Arm 3 or Arm 4. All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by the infusion of autologous TIL and high-dose aldesleukin. Patients enrolled on Arm 3 will receive pembrolizumab prior to cell administration and three additional doses every three weeks following the cell infusion. Patients enrolled on Arm 4 will receive pembrolizumab within four weeks after meeting progressive disease by RECIST criteria, continuing for up to 8 doses every 3 weeks.\n* Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 6 weeks after cell infusion and periodically thereafter.\n* Twenty-one patients will initially be enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and tumor responses. If two or more of the first 21 patients per groups shows a clinical response (partial response or complete response), accrual will continue to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response.\n* Up to 332 patients may be enrolled."

Patients must have at least one lesion that is resectable for TIL generation with minimal morbidity, preferentially using minimal invasive laparoscopic or thoracoscopic surgery for removal of superficial tumor deposit.\n* Confirmation of diagnosis of metastatic cancer by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology.\n* Refractory to approved standard systemic therapy. Specifically:\n\n  * Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer must have received oxaliplatin or irinotecan.\n  * Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma must have received sorafenib (Nexavar(R)), since level 1 data support a survival benefit with this agent.\n  * Patients with breast and ovarian cancer must be refractory to both first- and second-line treatments and must have received at least one second-line chemotherapy regimen.\n* Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are \\< 1 cm in diameter and asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic radiosurgery must be clinically stable for one month after treatment for the patient to be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 72 years.\n* Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.\n* Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and 12 months after the last dose of combined chemotherapy for women and for four months after treatment for men.\n* Women of child-bearing potential must be willing to undergo a pregnancy test prior to the start of treatment because of the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.\n\nSerology\n\n* Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive may have decreased immune-competence and thus may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)\n* Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.\n\nHematology\n\n* ANC \\> 1000/mm\\^3 without the support of filgrastim\n* WBC greater than or equal to 2500/mm\\^3\n* Platelet count greater than or equal to 80,000/mm\\^3\n* Hemoglobin \\> 8.0 g/dL.
