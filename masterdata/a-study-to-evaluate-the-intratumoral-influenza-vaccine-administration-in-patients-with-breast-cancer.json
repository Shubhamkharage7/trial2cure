If the tumor is palpable (able to fee by touch), the vaccine will be administered by a Surgeon/oncologist in the outpatient floor - both experienced and trained. If not palpable, the procedure will be done via guided Ultrasound by our Breast Radiologist -- both experienced and trained. Women with triple-negative (TNBC) and HER2+ types of breast cancer will be eligible for enrollment. Up to 18 subjects may be enrolled at Rush. Successive groups of 3 subjects per breast cancer type will be given increasing doses of vaccine. There are 3 potential dosing groups (half-dose, full dose, and high dose). Blood, stool (optional), and tumor tissue samples will be collected and tested. The active participation period is from one week prior to starting chemotherapy through three months post surgery."
