            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1. Determine the baseline neuromuscular/dual-task performance characteristics among a sample of active-duty military service members compared to physically active young adult civilians.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that active-duty military service members will have similar baseline gait and dual-task abilities as civilians, demonstrating translation potential between populations.\n\nThe investigators also hypothesize that baseline gait and dual-task abilities will be influenced by history of prior mTBI injuries among military Service Members.\n\nAim 2. Examine the efficacy of a smartphone-based vNDTT intervention to reduce musculoskeletal injury and improve neuromuscular/dual-task performance after a recent mTBI.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that those randomized to the intervention within three weeks of mTBI will have a lower risk of MSK injury in the 3-month period following mTBI, relative to standard-of-care.\n\nThe investigators also hypothesize that those randomized to the intervention within three weeks of mTBI will have better post-intervention gait and dual-task performance than those assigned to standard-of-care, despite similar baseline performance."
