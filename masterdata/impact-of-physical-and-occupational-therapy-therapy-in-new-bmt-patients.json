The purpose of this study is to investigate whether consultation with physical and occupational therapists as part of the general admission order set for patients scheduled for bone marrow transplant will result in reduced complications, morbidity, length of inpatient stay, 30-day readmission and 90-day mortality. Baseline data collection will be used to determine eligibility. This study will be partially retrospective (pre-implementation of physical and occupational therapy consultation order) and partially prospective."
