Therapy will be alternated at t=30, t=60, t=90 minutes, and then maintained for 180 minutes.\n\nAfter each treatment change, and at 180 minutes, investigators will: 1) perform echocardiograms to determine how oxygen affects right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) and, 2) draw blood for metabolomic analyses to determine the metabolic pathways that change in response to oxygen therapy."
