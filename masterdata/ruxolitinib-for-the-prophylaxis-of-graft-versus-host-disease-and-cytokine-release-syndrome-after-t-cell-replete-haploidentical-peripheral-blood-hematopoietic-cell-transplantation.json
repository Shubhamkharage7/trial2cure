HLA-matched sibling donors have historically offered the best clinical results but are unavailable for the majority of patients, while most patients do have readily available haploidentical donors. One of the risks of a haploidentical HCT is graft vs. host disease (GVHD), but it is difficult to reduce the incidence of GVHD without compromising the graft vs. leukemia (GVL) effect.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that JAK inhibition with haploidentical HCT may mitigate GVHD and cytokine release syndrome while retaining the GVL effect and improving engraftment."

Additionally, tacrolimus may increase risk of hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight; and mycophenolate mofetil is considered to be teratogenic. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study and for the duration of the study.\n* Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior allogeneic transplant (regardless of whether donor was related, unrelated, or cord). Prior autologous transplant is not exclusionary.\n* Presence of donor specific antibodies (DSA) with Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of \u2265 2000 as assessed by the single antigen bead assay.\n* Known HIV or active hepatitis B or C infection. Known current and/or history of active tuberculosis.\n* Known hypersensitivity to one or more of the study agents.\n* Planning to receive antithymocyte globulin as part of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen.\n* Currently receiving or has received any investigational drugs within the 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug (Day -3).\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, autoimmune disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or unstable cardiac arrhythmias.\n* Immunosuppressive doses of steroids.
