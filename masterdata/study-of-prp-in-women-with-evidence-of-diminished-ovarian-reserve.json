            "briefSummary": "The hypothesis of the study is that ovaries of women with a history of poor response to ovulation induction may benefit from exposure to growth factors known to be present in Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP). Since even ovaries from women with poor response still contain primordial follicles (which, however, no longer undergo recruitment), it is hoped that PRP injections into ovaries will activate follicular recruitment pathways and, subsequently, result in follicle growth. Should such growth be observed, follicles will be supported with routine daily gonadotropin stimulation until hCG trigger.",
            "detailedDescription": "The hypothesis of the study is that ovaries of women with a history of poor response to ovulation induction may benefit from exposure to growth factors known to be present in PRP.\n\nAutologous Platelet Rich Plasma (A-PRP) is plasma with a concentration of platelets above the blood baseline. A-PRP is developed from autologous blood. Within A-PRP, the concentration of platelets delivers an increased number of growth factors. In this study A-PRP will be prepared using Regen Lab PRP Kit which is approved by US-FDA for preparation of PRP.\n\nPRP is becoming widely used in a variety of medical procedures seeking tissue remodeling and/or healing as an intervention. To date, applications in orthopedics, wound healing, dermatology and plastic surgery have gained general acceptance, primarily as the role of platelets and their activation in tissue repair and recovery has become better understood at a cellular and molecular level. This knowledge base provides a foundation for the present study because of the ready availability of FDA-approved kits for autologous PRP preparations and the recognition that the aging ovary acquires tissue pathologies in the form of wound healing and fibrosis as a result of repeat ovulations over the reproductive lifespan of women. Since PRP is an autologous blood product, and is widely used via injection into various organs and tissues, safety concerns are minimal.\n\nThis study will involve only adult women with a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve. All consenting participants will receive injections of autologous Platelet RIch Plasma (A-PRP) in both ovaries under ultrasound guidance performed after induction of IV sedation.\n\nAssumption of this study is that in women with previous poor response to ovulation induction will show limited follicle growth. The study will try to estimate effect of PRP on this condition by comparing post-PRP response to the previous response. The investigators recognize that there will be a possibility of apparent response based on regression to the mean. The investigators expect that study of fifty patients should be enough to determine if there is a potential clinical effect and to allow estimation of that effect for power calculations for future studies."
