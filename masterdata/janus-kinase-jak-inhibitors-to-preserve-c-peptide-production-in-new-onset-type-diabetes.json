Within the shared placebo arm, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive placebo matched to abrocitinib or placebo matched to ritlecitinib. Randomization will be stratified by the following two age categories: 12-17 years old, and 18 years or above. Within each stratum, participants will be randomized to either the abrocitinib arm, ritlecitinib arm, or the shared placebo arm using random block sizes. The total number of enrolled participants from the older age stratum (18 years or above) will be limited to 33 to replicate the age distribution in previous new-onset trials.
