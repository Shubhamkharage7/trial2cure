Doctors leading this study hope to learn if combining durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide with hyofractionated ablative radiation therapy (radiation focused on certain parts of the body) will help treat your cancer and improve how long you can live with extensive-stage small cell cancer without it getting worse (progression-free survival). Your participation in this research will last about 48 months.\n\nDurvalumab along with chemotherapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of small cell lung cancer along with chemotherapy. This study is testing the addition of radiation to durvalumab and chemotherapy."

Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to 30 days after the last dose of IP.\n18. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy.\n19. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n20. Prior randomisation or treatment in a previous durvalumab clinical study regardless of treatment arm assignment.\n21.
