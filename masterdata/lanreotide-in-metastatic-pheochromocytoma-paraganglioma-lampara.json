            "detailedDescription": "Lanreotide is FDA approved for certain kinds of neuroendocrine tumors. This study seeks to determine if lanreotide is beneficial for patients with paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.\n\nGiven the rarity of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma that precludes the conduct of a randomized clinical trial in a timely manner, a novel method for assessing efficacy is being proposed. Efficacy will be assessed by estimating the tumor growth rate while a patient is enrolled on study and comparing the growth rates on lanreotide to the pre-enrollment growth rates. The method of analysis that will be used has been previously described. For this assessment a minimum of three tumor measurements will be required."
