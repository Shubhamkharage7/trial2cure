            "briefSummary": "This is a study to provide much-needed experimental data on the efficacy of a brief alcohol Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) pre-group intervention for Veterans receiving group treatment for IPV perpetration. The investigators will compare those assigned to receive this MET intervention to those receiving a 4-session Alcohol Education (AE) intervention or a standard treatment as usual (TAU) telephone monitoring intervention. The investigators will examine whether MET leads to greater reductions in alcohol use problems and IPV perpetration, and increased help-seeking behavior for alcohol use problems. Participants will be 300 male Veterans drawn from the Strength at Home IPV intervention program at three locations: the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, the Phoenix VA Healthcare System, and VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System.",
            "detailedDescription": "Veterans exposed to trauma are at elevated risk for perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) and for the development of alcohol-related problems. Despite commonly found associations between alcohol misuse and IPV, the investigators are aware of no prior research in Veterans examining the impact of adjunctive alcohol interventions for those receiving IPV intervention. The investigators propose to provide much-needed experimental data on the efficacy of a brief alcohol Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) pre-group intervention for Veterans receiving group treatment for IPV perpetration. More specifically, the investigators propose to examine whether those assigned to receive this MET intervention, relative to those receiving a 4-session Alcohol Education (AE) intervention or a standard treatment as usual (TAU) telephone monitoring intervention, evidence greater reductions in alcohol use problems and IPV perpetration, and increased help-seeking behavior for alcohol use problems. Participants will be 300 male Veterans drawn from the Strength at Home IPV intervention program at three locations: the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, the Phoenix VA Healthcare System, and VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System. Participants will be randomized to their pre-group conditions and then assigned to Strength at Home groups for IPV, and will receive referrals for substance use treatment in the VA system or the community. Participants with clinically relevant alcohol use problems, as determined by baseline screening measures, will complete assessments of alcohol use, readiness to change, IPV and help-seeking behavior at baseline, post IPV intervention group (3 months after completion of 4-session alcohol intervention), and four separate 3-month follow-ups after the post-treatment assessment. Differences between conditions on the major outcome variables involving alcohol use, IPV, help-seeking, and treatment engagement will be examined with random-effects regression models using an intent-to-treat approach. Study findings may assist in enhancing the efficacy of IPV interventions for the Veteran population to help ensure the safety and well-being of Veterans and their families."

The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 8. Higher scores represent higher rates of IPV, except for 7 and 8, which represent year and lifetime use and experience of IPV. Variety scores will be calculated for the CTS2 so that scores reflect the number of positively endorsed IPV behaviors (rather than estimates of IPV frequency).
