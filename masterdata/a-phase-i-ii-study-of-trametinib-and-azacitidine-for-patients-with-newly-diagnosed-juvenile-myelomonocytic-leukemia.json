This must be reviewed and approved by the study chair or vice chair.\n\nAdequate Cardiac Function Defined as:\n\n* Ejection fraction of \\> or = to 50% by echocardiogram, OR\n* Ejection fraction of \\> or = to 50% by radionuclide angiogram (MUGA).\n\nReproductive Function\n\nA. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test confirmed within 2 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\nB. Female patients with infants must agree not to breastfeed their infants while on this study.\n\nC. Male and female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use an effective method of contraception approved by the investigator during the study and for a minimum of 6 months after study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients cannot have a known allergy to any of the drugs used in the study.\n* Patients cannot have a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment.

Note: patients with either neurofibromatosis type 1 or Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) syndrome (also known as Noonan-like syndrome), are eligible to enroll. Patients with Down syndrome are excluded from the study.\n* Patient cannot have had prior use of hematopoietic growth factors, biologics (anti-neoplastic agent), or XRT.\n* Patients cannot be taking any medications for treatment of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n* Patients cannot have a history of or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR).\n* Patients cannot have had prior use of any MEK inhibitor.",
