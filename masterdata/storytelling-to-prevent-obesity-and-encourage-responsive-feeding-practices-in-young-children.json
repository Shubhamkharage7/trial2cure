The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* How many parents were approached and consented to participate?\n* How many parents viewed the videos via link versus viewed the video with a discussion in group sessions?\n* How did parents feel about the process of being recruited and interventions that they participated in?\n* How did the providers feel about the intervention recruitment and delivery?\n* How did the facilitators feel about their delivery of the material? Participants will complete a survey and an interview after completing second part of the intervention.\n\nResearchers will compare handout, online-only video, and group class interventions to see if an intervention delivery is useful and accepted by parents or providers.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a pilot randomized trial to assess feasibility and acceptability of STORY. The study will recruit 30 parents. Parents will complete a questionnaire and dyad's heights and weights will be measured. Families will be randomized to the control group or 1 of 2 intervention delivery approaches (IA). Parents will be given a handout (controls), links to the videos to watch independently (IA 1), or information on how they will be contacted to schedule their intervention sessions (IAs 2). After 2 video/sessions, all parents will complete a written survey assessing their experience with the intervention and any change same at home; the written survey will reassess baseline measures. Intervention parents will also complete a semi-structured interview to assess the family's experience with the STORY trial.\n\nSub aim 2a: Feasibility: number of parents approached, number of parents consented Sub aim 2b: Adherence: number of parents who complete videos or sessions Sub aim 2c: Acceptability to parents and providers"
