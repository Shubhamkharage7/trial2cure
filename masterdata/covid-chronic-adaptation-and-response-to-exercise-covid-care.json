            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPeople who are recovering from COVID-19 may continue to have problems that affect their daily life. For instance, they might feel overly tired. Researchers want to learn if exercise can help people recover after COVID-19 infection.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study if participation in a rehabilitation exercise program can help people recovering from COVID-19.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18-80 with a lab-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19), and are still having some symptoms.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have a medical history and physical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will have tests to measure heart and lung function. Their blood vessels will be assessed.\n\nParticipants will have a computed tomography scan of the body. They will have an ultrasound of the muscles in their arms, legs, and chest.\n\nParticipants will take a 6-minute walk test. They will take other balance and movement tests.\n\nParticipants will walk on a treadmill while hooked up to a monitor. Then they will be interviewed. It will be audio-recorded.\n\nParticipants will complete surveys about their symptoms and daily activities.\n\nParticipants will take a smell test. For this, they will identify different smells. They will also have memory, attention, and mental functioning tests.\n\nParticipants will wear an activity monitor on their wrist 24 hours a day. They will exercise 3 times a week for 10 weeks by moving vigorously on a track or treadmill for 30 minutes. They will attend education classes once a week for 10 weeks.\n\nParticipants will be contacted by phone or email every 3 months for 1 year after they complete the exercise part of the study. They will wear an activity monitor for up to 2 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis randomized controlled trial will determine whether aerobic exercise training has a beneficial effect on physical function, health-related quality of life, free-living physical activity and sleep quality among survivors of COVID-19. Participants will be randomized to either an aerobic exercise training and education (AET+) group or a control education only group (CON) for 10 weeks. Assessments for physical function, self-reported health outcomes for quality of life (QOL), free-living physical activity and sleep quality will be measured at baseline and following the 10-week intervention period. Participants in the CON group will then crossover and perform AET after the 10-week follow-up visit. All participants will be monitored for one year to capture free-living physical activity, sleep quality and health-related QOL outcomes over time. It is hypothesized that following 10 weeks, physical function, health-related QOL, free-living physical activity and sleep quality will show greater improvement with AET+.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo examine the effect of aerobic exercise training on physical function in participants recovering from COVID-19.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo examine the effect of aerobic exercise training on patient reported outcomes and other health-related QOL components in participants recovering from COVID-19; To examine the effect of aerobic exercise training on free-living physical activity and sleep quality in participants recovering from COVID-19.\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\nTo explore the effect of aerobic exercise training on clinical outcomes, cardiorespiratory function, cognition, biomarkers, metabolomics, ultrasound-based muscle measurements, and vascular function in participants recovering from COVID-19; To explore the feasibility of conducting the AET program remotely in the crossover CON group of participants recovering from COVID-19; To explore follow-up physical activity, sleep quality and health-related QOL outcomes over 1 year in participants recovering from COVID-19.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\nPhysical function as measured by distance walked during the 6 minute walk test after 10 weeks post-randomization with AET+ and CON.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nPatient-reported outcomes and other health-related components after 10 weeks post-randomization with AET+ and CON; Free-living physical activity and sleep quality after 10 weeks post-randomization with AET+ and CON.\n\nExploratory Endpoints:\n\nClinical outcomes, cardiorespiratory function, cognition, biomarkers, metabolomics, ultrasound-based muscle measurements, and vascular function after 10 weeks post-randomization with AET+ and CON; Collection of initial feasibility data to conduct exercise sessions remotely; Explore relationships between the physiological variables and post-study health outcome variables over time."
