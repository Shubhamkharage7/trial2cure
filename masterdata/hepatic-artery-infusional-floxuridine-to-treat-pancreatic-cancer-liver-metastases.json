This can be accomplished using minimally invasive or open techniques with an anticipated hospital stay of approximately 3-5 days. Prior to discharge from the hospital or at the first postoperative visit the pump is filled with FUDR according to the following equation: 0.12 mg/kg/d (using ideal body weight). This fill initiates day 1 of a 4-week cycle. The chemotherapy is infused by the pump continuously over 14 days. On day 15 (+/-4 days), the remaining chemotherapy is removed from the pump which is refilled with heparinized saline (30,000 units). This remains for an additional 2 weeks until the pump is refilled with FUDR at the start of the next cycle. Treatment is continued for a maximum of 6 cycles or as limited by toxicity. This regimen has been utilized with an acceptable safety profile in the setting of colorectal liver metastases.",
