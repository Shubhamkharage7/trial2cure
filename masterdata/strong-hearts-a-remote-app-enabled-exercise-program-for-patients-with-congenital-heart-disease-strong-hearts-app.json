Pilot trials will consist of a remote exercise program with app-embedded exercise modules designed to promote and encourage safe and healthy exercise habits across a range of CHD anatomies. This app-enabled program will allow for real time data collection integrating wearable devices, as well as compliance and safety monitoring to enhance research capabilities. The app-enabled program will be versatile and may be applied in the future to patients with non-cardiac conditions."
