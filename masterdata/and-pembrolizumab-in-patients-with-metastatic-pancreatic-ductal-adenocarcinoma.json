patients with hepatitis C status-post treatment with undetectable viral load are eligible.\n* Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.).\n* Patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications during the study.\n* Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormalities, including any of the following:\n\n  * History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty, or stenting) or symptomatic pericarditis within 6 months prior to screening\n  * History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification III-IV)\n  * Documented cardiomyopathy\n  * Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) \\<50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) at screening\n  * Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high-grade AV block (e.g. bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third-degree AV block)\n  * Long QT syndrome or family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome, or any of the following:\n  * Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia.\n  * Concomitant use of medication(s) with a known risk to prolong the QT interval and/or known to cause Torsades de Pointe that cannot be discontinued (within 5 half-lives or 7 days prior to starting study drug) or replaced by safe alternative medication\n  * Inability to determine the QT interval on screening\n* Patients with history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension within 3 months prior to enrollment, defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of \u2265 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of \u2265 10 mmHg with assumption of an upright posture.\n* Patients with a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, current pneumonitis, or those who have a history of interstitial lung disease.\n* Patients who have received a live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start date.\n* Patient must not have active known or suspected autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Subjects with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g., celiac disease) are permitted to enroll.\n* Patient must not have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of randomization.
