            "briefSummary": "This is a phase 1b/2 study of a single dose of intravenous (IV) bacteriophage in males and non-pregnant females, at least 18 years old, diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and microbiological activity of bacteriophage product WRAIR-PAM-CF1, directed at Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinically stable CF individuals chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa. WRAIR-PAM-CF1 is a 4 component anti-pseudomonal bacteriophage mixture containing between 4 x 10\\^7 and 4 x 10\\^9 Plaque Forming Units (PFU) of bacteriophage. Enrollment will occur at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States. In stage 1, two eligible subjects will be assigned to each of the three dosing arms receiving a single dosage of the IV bacteriophage therapy (4 x 10\\^7 PFU, 4 x 10\\^8 PFU, and 4 x 10\\^9 PFU; total of 6 sentinel subjects), followed by 30 \u00b1 7 days observation period. If no SAEs (related to the study product) are identified during the 96 hours after bacteriophage administration for all Sentinel Subjects in Stage 1, the study will proceed to Stage 2. In Stage 2a, 32 subjects will be enrolled into one of 4 arms (placebo IV, 4 x 10\\^7 PFU, 4 x 10\\^8 PFU, and 4 x 10\\^9 PFU) in a 1:1:1:1 allocation. An interim analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed follow up visit 7 on Day 30 to select the IV bacteriophage dose with the most favorable safety and microbiological activity profile. During Stage 2b, subjects will be randomized into the bacteriophage (dose selected based on Interim Analysis following Stage 2a) or placebo arm. The final sample size is expected to be up to 72 subjects total with up to 25 subjects in the placebo arm and up to 25 subjects in the Stage 2b bacteriophage dose.",

Female surgical sterilization procedures include tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.\n   2. Female is considered postmenopausal if she is \\>45 years old and has gone at least 12 months without a spontaneous menstrual period without other known or suspected cause.\n   3. Effective methods of contraception include (a) abstinence, (b) partner vasectomy, (c) intrauterine devices, (d) hormonal implants (such as Implanon), or (e) other hormonal methods (birth control pills, injections, patches, vaginal rings).\n6.
