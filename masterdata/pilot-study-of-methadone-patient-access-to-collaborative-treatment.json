Determine MPACT implementation feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect on MMT practice change and culture.\n2. Determine MPACT preliminary effect on MMT retention, in-MMT overdose, and patient PTSS.\n3. Characterize staff trauma history, PTSS and vicarious trauma, and explore their relationship with MPACT acceptability and implementation fidelity.\n\nAIM 3: Characterize MPACT acceptability, likely adoption, and recruitment feasibility among directors, case managers and counselors from a national random sample of 500 OTPs."
