            "briefSummary": "In this study the primary aims are to investigate the effect of resistance exercise training with different degrees of effort on glycemic control and psychological variables in individuals living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. As a secondary aim, investigate adherence and dropout rates and reasons for dropping out and adhering or not to the protocols.",
            "detailedDescription": "Resistance exercise training can be both effective for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and appealing for individuals living with T2DM, and has been shown to be a viable exercise prescription option for this population. It has been suggested that the degree of effort is important for acute improvements in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in individuals living with T2DM, although direct evidence of that is lacking. However, performing resistance exercise sets with a high degree of effort is associated with higher perceived exertion and discomfort, increased muscle soreness, negative perceptual responses, and higher neuromuscular fatigue and muscle damage. Taken together, these negative perceptual and physiological responses to resistance exercise sets performed with high degree of effort might negatively affect enjoyment, self-efficacy, and motivation during a resistance exercise session, ultimately reducing long-term adherence.\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to assess the effects resistance exercise training with different degrees of effort on glycemic control and psychological responses in individuals living with T2DM. Also, perceptual responses will be assessed to investigate how feelings experienced during resistance exercise training are altered relative to different degrees of effort. The hypothesis is that glycemic control will not be affected by the degree of effort, and improvements will be observed regardless of that. Also, it is hypothesized that the degree of effort will be associated with better psychological responses. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate and report adherence rate and reasons for adhering or not to the protocols. It is anticipated that adherence will be associated with the degree of effort and psychological responses experienced during training."

Load will be set at 10-RM load (75% 1-RM). Participants will be instructed to perform the concentric (lifting) phase of the repetition as fast as they can (\\~0.5 seconds), and to perform the eccentric phase in 2 seconds. Psychological responses (perceived exertion, enjoyment, feeling scale, discomfort, and self-efficacy) will be assessed. Anthropometrics will be repeated after training, and before and after the training period, glycemic control will be assessed via a continuous glucose monitoring device. The main outcomes will be compared between training interventions, pre-training data will used as comparator.",
