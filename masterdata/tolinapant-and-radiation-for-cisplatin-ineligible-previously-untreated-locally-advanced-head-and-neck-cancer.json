            "briefSummary": "This early-phase trial tests the safety and side effects of a tolinapant given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer for which the patient has not received treatment in the past (previously untreated), has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and cannot receive cisplatin (cisplatin-ineligible). Tolinapant may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving tolinapant and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objective:\n\nTo evaluate the safety and tolerability of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tolinapant when given in combination with radiation.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo assess preliminary efficacy of the combination of tolinapant and radiation in cisplatin ineligible patients with head and neck cancer as determined by locoregional control, two year progression-free survival (PFS), and two-year overall survival (OS).\n\nExploratory Objective:\n\nTo compare immune cell infiltrates following the first cycle of tolinapant + radiation, compared with baseline biopsy tissue and peripheral blood.\n\nTERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the effects of the combination of tolinapant + radiation on immune cells in blood and tumor.\n\nII. To assess the association between immune responses and FADD expression in tumors.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo standard of care radiation therapy for a total of 35 fractions over 6-7 weeks and receive tolinapant orally (PO) daily for 7 days during weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 of radiation therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months."

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n5. Significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, arterial thromboembolism, cerebrovascular thromboembolism) within 3 months prior to start of study therapy; angina requiring therapy; symptomatic peripheral vascular disease; New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure (or ejection fraction \\<50%); or uncontrolled Grade \u22653 hypertension (diastolic blood pressure \u2265100 mmHg or systolic blood pressure \u2265160 mmHg) despite antihypertensive therapy.\n6. Contraindications to radiotherapy (e.g. uncontrolled connective tissue disorder).\n7. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.\n8. Vulnerable populations including prisoners and adults who are unable to consent.\n9. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or seropositive results consistent with active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\n10. Grade 3 or greater neuropathy.\n11. Known distant metastases (i.e., outside of the neck).\n12. Known significant mental illness or other conditions such as active alcohol or other substance abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, predisposes the subject to high risk of noncompliance with the protocol treatment or assessments.\n13. Concurrent second malignancy requiring active therapy.\n14. Patients with a history of allogenic transplant must not have \u2265Grade 3 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or any clinically significant GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppression.\n15.
