            "briefSummary": "Despite recreational cannabis now being legal in 23 states, where more than 100 million Americans reside, studies on the actual health effects are limited. This study is a randomized trial, where each participant will be instructed to consume or avoid cannabis on randomly assigned days during a 14-day monitoring period. The goal of this study is to answer the question:\n\n\"Does cannabis use increase the frequency of 'early' and abnormal heart beats?\"\n\nDuring the 14-day period, participants will wear an external heart monitor, a glucose monitor, and a fitness tracker to track heart rhythm, glucose levels, step counts, and sleep health. Participants will use a mobile app or a text messaging service for daily instructions/reminders on cannabis use, and short surveys. The investigators ask that participants smoke or vape cannabis at least once on days they are instructed to consume cannabis. Compelling evidence of heart and other health effects would be important to the clinical care of our patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is designed as a case-crossover randomized trial, where each participant will be instructed to consume or avoid inhaled cannabis on randomly assigned days during a 14-day monitoring period. Participants will be asked to smoke or vape cannabis at least once on days they are instructed to consume cannabis. Participants will also wear an external electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor, a continuous glucose monitor, and a fitness tracker for up to two weeks while utilizing a mobile application or text messaging service to receive daily instructions/reminders on cannabis use, and short surveys. The investigators will compare participant self-report of cannabis consumption, glucose monitoring, fitness levels, sleep health, and heart rhythm data in order to better understand the relationship between acute cannabis consumption and heart rhythm changes. A total of 100 participants will be enrolled at the UCSF study site."
