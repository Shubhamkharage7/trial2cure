            "briefSummary": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of congenital and heritable bone disorders that currently affects at least 50,000 people in the United States. OI varies in severity from perinatally lethal to mild forms. The majority of cases is caused by a dominant mutation in type I collagen genes (COL1\u03b11 and COL1\u03b12), altering the quantity or quality of type I collagen.\n\nAlthough OI is typically characterized as a disease of the bone, it is perhaps more accurately described as a connective tissue disorder. Type I collagen is a major constituent of lung connective tissue. Respiratory insufficiency is the leading cause of death in patients with OI. Thus, it is important and necessary to understand the etiology of the restrictive pulmonary physiology in the OI population.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is cross-sectional. At the participant's one study visit, data will be obtained at a single point in time and reflect the patients' current condition. Evaluations will include family and medical history, self-report questionnaires, physical evaluation, diagnostic studies, and radiographic studies. Eighteen participants will be enrolled, ideally within one year. Participants will be enrolled regardless of OI type since Bronchial Wall Thickening, a finding we are attempting to validate, was observed in all types of OI. Interested males with OI will be preferred over females to compensate for our highly female original cohort and determine if sexual dimorphism exists for cardiopulmonary outcomes in people with OI. Smokers will not be excluded."
