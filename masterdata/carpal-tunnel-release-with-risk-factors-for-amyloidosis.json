One study has been performed in which patients with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome underwent tissue biopsy (either tendon sheath or transverse carpal ligament) at the time of carpal tunnel release to determine the strength of association as well as most common subtypes. However, no study has been done demonstrating whether or not patients with amyloid-positive carpal tunnel biopsy would benefit from an early referral to cardiology for a work-up of potential cardiac amyloidosis. In our study, patients with bilateral carpal tunnel symptoms who are indicated for carpal tunnel release would be identified in clinic and undergo biopsy for congo red staining at the time of surgery. All patients with positive biopsy results would be referred to cardiology. Outcomes would include the rate of amyloid positivity, common subtypes, and echocardiographic findings after cardiac referral."
