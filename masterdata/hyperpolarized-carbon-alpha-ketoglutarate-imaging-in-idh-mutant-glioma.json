To assess the safety and feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C-aKG magnetic resonance (MR) metabolic imaging as a new and unique tool for evaluating tumor burden in patients with IDH mutant glioma.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nThis imaging study will involve one MR scan with the administration of HP 13C-aKG. Patients will be assigned to one of 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 (Participants with IDH mutant glioma for sequence development) and Cohort 2 (Participants with recurrent IDH mutant glioma before receiving surgical resection)."
