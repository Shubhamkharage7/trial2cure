A secondary objective is to compare rates of emergence delirium and total recovery time between the two groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "In sinus surgery, TIVA has been described as a possible advantage in the use of endoscopic ear surgery. However, to date, there are no studies that examine blood loss, surgical field quality, and recovery in TIVA compared to inhalational anesthesia in the setting of endoscopic ear surgery. The hypothesis is that in patients who undergo endoscopic tympanoplasty, those who receive TIVA will have reduced intraoperative blood loss, improved surgical field quality, and reduced emergence agitation than those who receive inhalational anesthesia. This study will be a prospective double-blinded randomized control trial consisting of subjects undergoing endoscopic tympanoplasty surgery to assess intraoperative blood loss, surgical field quality, rates of emergence delirium, and recovery time."
