To demonstrate the Synergy Disc is at least as safe and effective as conventional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to treat cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) in subjects who are symptomatic at two levels from C3 to C7 are and are unresponsive to conservative management. Patients will be evaluated preoperatively, at the time of surgery, and at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Follow-up will continue annually until the last patient reaches 24-month follow-up. The primary analysis will occur at 24 months.",

A total of 200 patients will be enrolled to the investigational group .The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the two-level Synergy Disc compared to conventional two-level ACDF in skeletally mature patients for reconstruction of two contiguous discs from C3 to C7 following discectomy at two contiguous levels for intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit) with neck pain or myelopathy due to abnormalities localized to the levels of the two contiguous disc spaces that are unresponsive to conservative management."

The operation is performed by reaching the cervical spine through a small incision in the front of the neck. The soft tissues of the neck are then separated allowing for the disc to be removed. Anterior cervical discectomy has proven to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. The anterior approach allows direct visualization of the entire interspace and wide decompression of the anterior aspect cervical spinal cord and nerve roots. It may be undertaken in cases of multilevel disease and interbody fusion may be performed if required",
