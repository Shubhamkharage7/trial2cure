The overall hypothesis, drawn from previous literature, is that exposure to NIR stimulation will have positive effects on brain health and will result in better cognitive and mood performance.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a pilot study of the efficacy of NIR stimulation for enhancing cognition and mood in nondemented older adults including individuals with Parkinson disease. Prior research suggests that NIR exposure may be neuroprotective and increases energy available to neurons. The current study will test whether age-related cognitive and mood changes in older adults and those with Parkinson disease will be affected by near infrared (NIR) stimulation.\n\nThe study team will randomize older adults and those with Parkinson disease into treatment groups and evaluate neuroimaging and cognitive outcome measures, before and after an 12-week intervention involving transcranial and intranasal NIR. The protocol will involve both \" lab\" and \" home-based\" NIR stimulation. The overall hypothesis, drawn from previous literature, is that exposure to NIR stimulation will have positive effects on brain health and will result in better cognitive and mood performance."

No history of brain surgery. Exceptions are a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease for the PD subgroup.\n* Unstable and uncontrolled medical conditions (metabolic encephalopathy, HIV, moderate to severe kidney or liver disease)\n* Current or past history of major psychiatric disturbance including schizophrenia, or active psychosis, bipolar disorder, current major depressive episode, current alcohol or substance abuse or history thereof within the past six months. The study team is not excluding individuals who are taking antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, however, use of antidepressants and anxiolytics will be recorded and data will be analyzed in post-hoc analyses\n* Use of antipsychotics, sedatives, or other medications with significant anticholinergic properties (due to potential influence on memory)\n* Use of photo-sensitive medications such as steroids or retin-A within 15 days of the study intervention\n* Diagnosis of active cancer\n* Significant motor or visual disturbance that would prevent one from using a computer or detecting colors\n* Previous participation in a cognitive training study within the last 3 months or current involvement in another study involving cognitive training or intervention at the time of participation\n* Inability to undergo brain imaging due to claustrophobia or implants such as pacemakers, heart valves, brain aneurysm clips, orthodontics, non-removable body jewelry, or shrapnel containing ferromagnetic metal\n\nAdditional criteria for participants in Parkinson group\n\n* Participants must have a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease by a movement disorders specialist based on UK Brain Bank criteria\n* No previous history of brain surgery (DBS, pallidotomy, thalamotomy, or fetal cell implants).\n* May have difficulties with activities of daily living, but this is due to physical symptoms of Parkinson disease and not because of cognitive problems\n* Hoehn-Yahr staging between .5 and 3.5",
