            "briefSummary": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a condition that causes inflammation (swelling, redness) of the lining and wall of the small intestine, large intestine, or both. CD may be associated with abdominal cramps/pain, diarrhea, blood in the stool, weight loss, or delayed growth in children. While the exact cause of CD is not certain it is thought that the immune system located in the intestine reacts abnormally to the large number of bacteria contained there. The investigators think that diet, exposure to antibiotics early in life, and having a family history of CD puts people at increased risk for developing CD. In order to decrease the inflammation doctors use what is called biologic therapy with anti-TNF molecules that can be given through an intravenous or shots. TNF is a chemical made by white blood cells that is involved in inflammation. When this type of treatment is given early after diagnosis it is more effective than when it is given later. The investigators have learned that it is important to give the optimum (ideal) amount of this medicine guided by certain blood tests. The investigators also know that not everyone responds to this therapy but do not understand the reasons for this variability between people. The CAMEO study has been started to help understand what factors are important in determining whether a child with CD completely heals the inflammation after anti-TNF therapy. The investigators will do that by measuring certain markers of inflammation in the blood and stool and by looking at a person's genes (DNA) and how inflammation is controlled in the intestine. These inflammation tests will be done before, during, and after one year of anti-TNF therapy. The investigators will determine how much healing has taken place by comparing the results of the colonoscopy and a special type of MRI that are both done before anti-TNF and then again one year later. The goal in treating CD is to heal both the lining and the wall of the intestine. Children ages 6-17 years who are thought to have CD and are about to undergo their diagnostic colonoscopy are eligible to be enrolled. If they are found to indeed have CD and start an anti-TNF medicine within 6 months they can continue in the study. There are no increased risks of participating in this study beyond those normally associated with having CD and its treatment. By better understanding why the bowel does or does not heal, doctors will be better able to provide personalized care.",
