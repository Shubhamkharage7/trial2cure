The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Whether the test is as effective and reliable as the standard test\n* Whether there is a link between the results of the smell test and the structure of the back of the eye\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* complete a short questionnaire\n* have pictures of the inside of their eyes taken\n* perform two smell tests"
