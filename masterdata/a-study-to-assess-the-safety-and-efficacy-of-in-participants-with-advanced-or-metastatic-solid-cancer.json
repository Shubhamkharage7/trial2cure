Part B Dose-expansion Cohort B4, medication-resistant ascites requiring drainage in the last 28 days prior the start of AZD7789 and/or the occurrence of active gastro-intestinal bleeding, as judged by the Investigator.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (eg, colitis or Crohn's disease), diverticulitis (with the exception of diverticulosis), systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome (granulomatosis with polyangiitis), Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.. Some exceptions have been specified in the protocol\n* Past medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis requiring steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to the first dose of study intervention or still recovering from prior surgery\n* Other invasive malignancy within 2 years prior to screening\n* Congenital long QT syndrome or history of QT prolongation associated with other medications that cannot be changed or discontinued based on a cardiologist assessment\n* Any previous treatment with anti-TIM-3 therapy in any setting is not permitted. For Part A, Cohorts B1 and B3:treatment with investigational therapy prior to initiation of study treatment except where the most recent line of therapy was investigational agents added to approved anti-PD-1/PD-L1 as part of standard care. Investigational agents may be given as prior lines of therapy (other than the most recent line) and as monotherapy. Where investigational agents are the most recent line of therapy, they must be given in combination with approved anti-PD-1/PD-L1. For Part B Dose-expansion Cohort B4: investigational agents, other than investigational immune checkpoint inhibitors or other IO agents, may be given as any prior lines of therapy.\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first dose of study intervention\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for noncancer-related conditions is acceptable.\n* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention Note: Participants should not receive live vaccine while receiving study intervention and up to 30 days after the last dose of study intervention\n* Radiotherapy treatment to the lung within \u2264 4 weeks of the first dose of AZD7789. Palliative bone radiotherapy is allowed if \u2265 2 weeks prior to the first dose of AZD7789.",
