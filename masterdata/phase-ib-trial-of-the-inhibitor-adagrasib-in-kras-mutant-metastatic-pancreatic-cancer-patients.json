Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a pancreatic cancer with KRAS G12C mutation. Patients are eligible based on detection of KRAS G12C mutation in tumor tissue or plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by any CLIA-certified lab assay.\n2. Unresectable or metastatic disease.\n3. Presence of tumor lesions to be evaluated per RECIST 1.1. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease\n4. Age \u2265 18 years old\n5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n6. No more than one prior therapy. Prior systemic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy or, investigational agent) and radiation therapy discontinued at least 2 weeks before first dose date.\n7. Recovery from the adverse effects of prior therapy at the time of enrollment to \u2264 Grade 1 (excluding alopecia and neuropathy).\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status in 0 to 2.\n9. Laboratory values within the screening period:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count 1000/mm3 ( 1.0 x 109/L)\n   2. Platelet count 75,000/mm3 ( 75 x 109/L)\n   3. Hemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL, in the absence of transfusions for at least 2 weeks\n   4.

Second malignancy that either requires active concurrent systemic therapy or involves a lesion that may confound assessment of the pancreatic cancer under study.\n11. Known active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B or C. Note that the following are permitted:\n\n    1. Patients treated for hepatitis C with no detectable viral load;\n    2. Patients treated for HIV with no detectable viral load for at least 1 month prior to enrollment while on a stable regimen of agents that are not strong inhibitors of CYP3A4; and\n    3. Patients with hepatitis B (HBV) receiving prophylaxis against reactivation of hepatitis B (either \\[HBsAg-positive with normal ALT and HBV DNA \\< 2,000 IU/mL or \\< 10,000 copies/mL\\] or \\[HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive\\]).\n12. Pregnancy. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test documented within the screening period prior start of study drug.\n13. Breast-feeding or planning to breast feed during the study or within 6 months after study treatment.\n14.
