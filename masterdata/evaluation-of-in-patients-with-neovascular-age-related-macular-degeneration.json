This study is composed of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A is a single ascending dose study, and Part B is a multiple ascending dose study. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple intravitreal injection(s) of OLX10212 in patients with neovascular AMD. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of single and multiple intravitreal injection(s) of OLX10212 in patients with neovascular AMD, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple intravitreal injection(s) of OLX10212 in patients with neovascular AMD.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single- and multi-dose, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of OLX10212 in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study is composed of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A is a single ascending dose study, i.e. participants will receive one intravitreal injection of OLX10212 at different dose levels and Part B is a multiple ascending dose study, i.e. participants will receive up to three intravitreal injections of OLX10212. Up to 42 individuals with AMD will be invited to participate in this study. The mechanism of action of OLX10212 holds promise to treat AMD by improving inflammation in the retina which is typically observed in patients with AMD. This is the first time OLX10212 is used in patients with AMD. Safety and tolerability of OLX10212 will be assessed via detailed ophthalmologic evaluations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory testing. In addition, plasma concentrations of OLX10212 will be measured and evaluations of the therapeutic effects of OLX10212 will be performed.\n\nPart A uses a dose-ascending, sequential design to evaluate up to five doses of OLX10212, starting with the lowest dose of OLX10212 in a 50-\u03bcL injection. Up to six patients will be enrolled at each dose level. Each of the enrolled patients will receive a single intravitreal administration of OLX10212. The safety and tolerability evaluation period will encompass the first 14 days following OLX10212 administration. The effects of OLX10212 will be observed up to 24-weeks after injection. Based on the safety and tolerability evaluation, a decision will be made whether or not to increase the dose to the next higher dose levels for the subsequent patient cohorts. Therefore, a total of up to 30 patients (up to 5 dose levels and up to 6 patients/dose level) will be enrolled in Part A of this study.\n\nPart B of this study uses a dose-ascending, sequential design to evaluate 2 dose levels of OLX10212 (750 and 950 \u03bcg/eye/50 \u03bcL), starting with the 750 \u03bcg/eye/50 \u03bcL dose. Three patients will initially be enrolled in each cohort. Each of the enrolled patients will receive a total of up to three intravitreal injections of OLX10212, each four weeks apart (Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8). The DLT evaluation period will encompass the first 10 weeks following the first OLX10212 administration (ending 2 weeks following the third OLX10212 administration), during which safety and tolerability will be assessed at each visit. In addition, the plasma concentrations of OLX10212 will be measured and therapeutic effects will be evaluated. A total of up to 12 patients with AMD (3 dose levels and up to 6 patients/dose level) will be invited to participate in Part B of this study."

Scar or fibrosis in the study eye involving \\>50% of the total lesion size\n5. Retinal pigment epithelial tears or rips in the study eye involving the macula within 6 months prior to Day 0\n6. History of any vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye within 4 weeks prior to Day 0\n7. Presence of other causes of CNV in the study eye, including pathologic myopia, ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, or multifocal choroiditis\n8. Clinical evidence of moderate or severe diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or any other inflammatory or occlusive vascular disease affecting the retina (other than AMD) in either eye\n9. History of stage \u22652 macular hole in the study eye\n10. Any prior intraocular or periocular surgery on the study eye within 3 months prior to Day 0 (lid surgery is allowed if it took place at least 1 month prior to Day 0 and is unlikely to interfere with OLX10212 injection). Prior vitrectomy in the study eye, surgery for retinal detachment in the study eye, and prior trabeculectomy or other filtration surgery in the study eye are not permitted at any time\n11. Uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as IOP \u226525 mmHg despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) in the study eye\n12. Glaucoma in the study eye requiring treatment with 3 or more antiglaucoma medications\n13. Active intraocular inflammation or history of uveitis in either eye\n14. Presence or history of ocular or periocular infection in either eye within 2 weeks prior to Day 0\n15. Presence of scleromalacia in the study eye\n16. Aphakia or absence of posterior capsule in the study eye (unless due to yttrium aluminum garnet \\[YAG\\] posterior capsulotomy)\n17. Prior therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye or planned use at any time during the study\n18. Significant media opacities, including cataract, in the study eye that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with visual acuity, assessment of safety, or fundus photography\n19. Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (eg, cataract) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could (1) require either medical or surgical intervention during the 24- or 32-week study period (Part A or Part B, respectively), (2) increase the risk to the patient beyond what is to be expected from standard intraocular injection procedures, or (3) otherwise interfere with the injection procedure or efficacy or safety evaluation\n20. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that might affect interpretation of the results of the study or renders the patient at high risk for treatment complications\n21. Participation as a patient in any clinical study or prior systemic or ocular treatment with an investigational agent within 12 weeks prior to Day 0\n22. Prior systemic or intraocular treatment with long-acting steroids within 6 months prior to Day 0 or planned use at any time during the study\n23. History of allergy to povidone iodine\n24. Known allergy to fluorescein sodium for injection in angiography\n25. Unwillingness among females who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing potential to practice adequate contraception throughout the study. Adequate contraceptive measures include oral contraceptives (stable use for \u22652 cycles prior to Day 0), intrauterine device, Depo-Provera\u00ae (Pfizer, Inc., New York) or Norplant System\u00ae (Pfizer, Inc., New York) implants, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy, and condom or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly. A female is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is premenstrual, 1 year postmenopausal, or 3 months post-surgical sterilization. All females of childbearing potential, including those with post-tubal ligation, must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at Day 0 and every 4 weeks as outlined in the Schedule of Activities. A negative serum pregnancy test must be obtained at Screening.",
