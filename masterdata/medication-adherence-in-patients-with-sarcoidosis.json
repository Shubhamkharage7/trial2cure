The overall hypothesis is higher medication adherence will be associated with better clinical outcomes in sarcoidosis. The investigators will enroll 150 patients with biopsy proven pulmonary sarcoidosis for at least one year who are on any oral treatment regimen for at least six months into a 12-month longitudinal study."
