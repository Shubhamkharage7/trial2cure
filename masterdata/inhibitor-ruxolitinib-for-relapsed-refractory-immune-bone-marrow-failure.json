            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nImmune bone marrow failure is a condition that occurs when a person s immune system attacks the cells of the bone marrow. This can lead to diseases including different types of anemias and blood cancers. Some of these diseases can be deadly. Better treatments are needed.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a drug (ruxolitinib) in people with different types of immune bone marrow failure.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 and older with an immune bone marrow failure.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam. They will give samples of blood and saliva. They will have a bone marrow biopsy: A large needle will be inserted into a small cut to remove a sample of the soft tissue inside the bone. Some participants may have a skin biopsy: A small piece of skin will be removed. Some may have a computed tomography (CT) scan: They will lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine that uses X-rays to make pictures of the inside of the body.\n\nRuxolitinib is a tablet taken by mouth. Participants will take the drug twice a day for up to 6 months.\n\nParticipants will have blood tests every week while they are taking the drug. These tests can be done by the participant s own physician and the results sent to the researchers.\n\nParticipants will have clinic visits after taking the drug for 3 months and 6 months and then after 1, 2, and 3 years. The blood tests and bone marrow biopsy will be repeated.\n\nParticipants who improve while taking the drugs may go on to an extension phase of the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study description:\n\nThis is a prospective, non-randomized, phase I/II study in which participants with relapsed/refractory immune marrow failure (severe aplastic anemia, moderate aplastic anemia, single lineage cytopenias, T-LGL, and hypoplastic MDS) will be treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Our hypothesis is that JAK1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib will result in hematologic improvement in participants with immune marrow failure.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objectives are to assess safety and efficacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in immune marrow failure.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to assess early and long-term hematologic response, depth of response, development of transfusion independence, rate of relapse, rate of clonal evolution to myeloid malignancy and Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH), 3-year overall survival, response after re-initiation of therapy in relapsed participants, maximum tolerated dose.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThe primary endpoints are: (a) the primary safety endpoint will be number of participants who complete a full course of ruxolitinib without cessation required by hematologic toxicity in the 6 months following treatment initiation; (b) The primary efficacy endpoint is overall response (OR) rate by 6 months.\n\nThe secondary endpoints are time to OR, OR at 3 months, development of transfusion independence at 3 and 6 months, type of response at 3 and 6 months, rate of relapse up to 3 years, rate of clonal evolution up to 3 years, 3-year overall survival (OS), and number of participants tolerating maximum ruxolitinib dose."
