To accelerate the learning curve of newly enrolled trainees to assess and secure airway, the investigators propose supplementing current training techniques with access to an airway video library consisting of real- life clinical videos of airway and endotracheal intubations.",
            "detailedDescription": "Timely and correctly performed endotracheal intubation is important. It can be stressful especially among beginners and requires significant expertise. Studies suggest that endotracheal intubation success rates are below 50% for the first 10 intubations among novices and the learning curve of laryngoscopy does not plateau above a 90% success rate until a mean of 57 attempts. Although simulation, which is currently the mainstay of training for airway management help orient a novice user, it is siloed from the actual experience. Endotracheal intubation requires significant training and expertise. This experience can be quite stressful for novice users. To accelerate the learning curve of newly enrolled trainees to assess and secure airway, the investigators propose supplementing current training techniques with access to an airway video library consisting of real- life clinical videos of airway and endotracheal intubations."
