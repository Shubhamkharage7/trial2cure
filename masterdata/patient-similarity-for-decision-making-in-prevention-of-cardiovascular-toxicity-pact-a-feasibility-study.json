            "detailedDescription": "For this feasibility study, the researchers will create the clinical decision aid and test the central hypothesis that this novel clinical decision aid accessed via the electronic health record will be acceptable to both cancer survivors and their cardiologists and will favorably impact appropriate medication use and cardiac imaging surveillance. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data suggesting that an initial and rudimentary version of the clinical aid increases appropriate medication use and imaging follow-up in cardio-oncology patients. Success will be determined by \u226585% of clinic visits using the clinical decision aid resulting in pursuit of medication use and cardiac imaging surveillance patterns commensurate with recommendations specific to cancer survivors, with overall rates the same or higher than the group without the clinical decision aid, as well as overall favorable patient and physician focus group comments and survey responses."
