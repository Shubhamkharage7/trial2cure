            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the side effects and best dose of total marrow lymphoid irradiation along with chemotherapy, with fludarabine and melphalan, with or without thiotepa, in combination with Orca-T cells for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation is a targeted form of total body irradiation that uses intensity-modulated radiation therapy to target marrow, lymph node chains, and the spleen. It is designed to reduce radiation-associated side effects and maximize the radiation therapeutic effect. Giving chemotherapy with medications such as thiotepa, fludarabine, and melphalan before a treatment with stem cells helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. Orca-T cells take cells from a donor and remove some of the T cells and replace them with partially engineered T cells in order to induce better tolerance in patients. Giving total marrow and lymphoid irradiation and chemotherapy followed by Orca -T cells may be an effective treatment for patients with AML, ALL or MDS.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Describe toxicities attributable to total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) by dose level in patients with high-risk acute leukemias or MDS, in the context of partially engineered T-regulatory cell donor graft TRGFT-201 (Orca-T) from a matched or haploidentical donor.\n\nII. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of TMLI with an Orca-T for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine incidence of acute and late HCT-related immune complications (infections, etc.) at 100 days and 1 year.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety of the regimen, at each dose level, by assessing the following: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration of adverse events in dose limiting toxicity (DLT) window of 28 days at each dose level, including acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection and delayed engraftment within the first 100 days and chronic GVHD incidence at 1 year.\n\nIII. Measure incidence of acute and chronic GVHD at 100 days and 1-year post-HCT, respectively.\n\nIV. Measure GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1-year post-HCT.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.\n\nII. Evaluate the effect of TMLI as conditioning for Orca-T HCT on immune reconstitution at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after alloHCT.\n\nIII. Evaluate GVHD biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines on days +7, +14, and +30, (all patients) and upon GVHD onset/resolution.\n\nIV. Investigate the temporal effect and bone marrow residual damage and regeneration on days +30, +100, and 1-year post-alloHCT by using longitudinally collected biological samples and imaging.\n\nV. Monitor effects of TMLI as conditioning on gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and T cell signaling pathways.\n\nVI. Monitor effects of TMLI on GI microbiome diversity.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TMLI followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients undergo TMLI twice a day (BID) on days -8 to -5, followed by fludarabine intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and melphalan IV on day -2. Patients receiving the lowest dose of TMLI also receive thiotepa IV on days -4 and -3.\n\nHCT: Patients receive Orca-T CD34+hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and T-regulatory cell (Treg) products IV on day 0, followed by the Orca-T conventional t-cell (tcon) product IV on day 2.\n\nGVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients undergoing haploidentical (haplo)-HCT receive tacrolimus starting on day 14 and continuing until day 90 with a taper per treating physician's discretion.\n\nPatients also undergo echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scans, dual energy computed tomography (DECT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, bone marrow biopsies/aspirates, and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years from enrollment."
