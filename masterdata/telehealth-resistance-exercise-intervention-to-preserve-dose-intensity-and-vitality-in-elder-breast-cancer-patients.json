            "detailedDescription": "The research study procedures include screening for eligibility. After participants are determined to be eligible and have signed consent, they will participate in a baseline visit to collect measurements (e.g., weight/height/waist measurements) and questionnaires, a memory test, functional movement and strength testing, and a physical activity assessment. After baseline measures are collected, participants will be randomized to either the THRIVE Exercise and Diet Intervention or the Heath Education and Support Program during chemotherapy. There is a follow up visit up to 4 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy to repeat measurements and questionnaires.\n\nThe duration of the study will be 10-26 weeks, depending on the type of chemotherapy participants are receiving.\n\nThe THRIVE Intervention will involve:\n\n* Exercise: Participants in the THRIVE Intervention arm work with an exercise coach to participate in both muscle strengthening exercises and aerobic exercises. There is one in-person exercise session at the beginning of the study. The remainder of the exercise sessions are done twice weekly via telehealth throughout chemotherapy treatment.\n* Protein intake support: Participants in the THRIVE Intervention will meet with a dietitian to make sure they are eating enough protein throughout their chemotherapy treatments. Participants will be asked to keep a daily protein checklist and share this with the exercise coach each week.\n\nThe Health Education Support Program will involve:\n\n- Health education tablet: Participants in the Health Education Support program will receive a tablet with information regarding mediation, stretching and gentle movement, relaxation and creative arts throughout chemotherapy."
