            "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NKTR-255 following CD19-directed chimeric antigen (CAR)-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL).\n\nNKTR-255 is an investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer. T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. Chimeric antigen (CAR)-T cell product consists of genetically engineered T-cells, modified to recognize CD19, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CD19-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill CD19-positive cancer cells. Giving NKTR-255 following the treatment with CD19 CAR-T cell therapy may work better in treating large B-cell lymphoma than either drug alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients will be treated with lymphodepletion chemotherapy (as recommended by the CAR-T cell manufacturer) and soon after will receive a one-time CD19-directed CAR-T cell infusion (as per product label). Study drug (NKTR-255 or placebo) will be administered intravenously approximately 14 days after CAR-T cell infusion and administered every 3 weeks for up to 7 cycles or 5 months (whichever is earlier) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed-up at 30 days, and then at 9,12,18, 24, and 36 months after CAR-T cell infusion.\n\nThe study will be conducted in two stages: Stage 1 (Phase II) is expected to complete the enrollment of 56 patients by the end of 2023. Primary endpoint data will be available in the second half of 2024. Stage 2 (Phase III) is expected to initiate before the end of 2024."
