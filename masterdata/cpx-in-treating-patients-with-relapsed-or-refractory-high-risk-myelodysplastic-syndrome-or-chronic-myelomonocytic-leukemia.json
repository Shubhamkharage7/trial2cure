Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the safety and tolerability of CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (Dose Escalation Stage) II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS. (Dose Escalation Stage) III. To further characterize the safety and tolerability of CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS. (Dose-Expansion Stage) IV. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS. (Dose-Expansion Stage)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess overall response (OR) rate. II. To assess overall survival. III. To assess duration of response. IV. To assess relapse-free survival. V. To assess safety profile.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nINDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 2-5 weeks, patients who do not achieve a complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi)/CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), have acceptable or no toxicity, and have stable disease and no disease progression may receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients who achieve at least a hematological improvement (HI) response, receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 5-8 weeks, patients who do not show clinically significant disease progression or unacceptable toxicity may receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine for up to 12 additional cycles.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6 months thereafter."
