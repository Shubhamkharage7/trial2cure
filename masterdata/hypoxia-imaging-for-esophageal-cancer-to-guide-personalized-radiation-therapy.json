            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase I trial evaluating the safety of personalized radiation therapy based on levels of hypoxia identified on FMISO-PET and MRI. All patients will receive a baseline FMISO positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI to identify levels of hypoxia. Patients with tumor hypoxia will receive a higher dose of radiation therapy. Subjects who do not have hypoxic tumors will be treated with the standard-of-care radiation regimen. After fraction 10 of radiation therapy, an additional MRI will be performed. If this interim MRI demonstrates little or no response (as defined in Section 6), an optional boost radiation dose can be administered.\n\nTrial enrollment will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, eight patients will be enrolled. After all eight patients have completed the 30 day dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period, enrollment will be placed on hold and safety will be evaluated. During the interim analysis, one additional patient will be allowed to be enrolled in the trial. If the trial meets stopping rules as described in Section 11.3, the trial will be re-evaluated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and the Principal Investigator. However, if the rate of DLTs remains below the unacceptable toxicity rate, enrollment will open to the enrollment of eight more patients."
