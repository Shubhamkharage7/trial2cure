The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if pain rehabilitation programs have impacts on physical function in patient reported outcomes and objective measures of physical activity or sedentary time with a wearable Fitbit. Additionally, we will examine the associations between movement, pain acceptance, and related health factors, such as pain severity, sleep, functional status, depression, and anxiety. The addition of biometric data will allow for further investigation of the association between objective measures and patient self-report measures.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic pain has high impact on societal function as well as an individual person's mood, physical function, disability, and quality of life and their health. The purpose of the study is to collect objective outcome measures on movement, activity, biometrics and patient reported outcome measures for participants of behavioral treatment groups of 6-8 weeks duration at Stanford Pain Management Center. Group participants learn skills and develop a personalized plan to use the skills throughout the program. The study will follow participants with a removable wearable device on the wrist for 2 weeks pre group to establish movement activity baselines, during the group intervention (6-8 weeks) and 2 weeks post group to determine which groups have benefits across various aspects of health including: sleep, psychological processes of pain acceptance, physical mobility, quality of life and the impact of supervised movement and physical activity in the treatment groups."
