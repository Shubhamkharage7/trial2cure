Matrion is composed of placental membrane derived from donated human birth tissue containing both the innermost amniotic layer and the outermost chorionic layer, inclusive of the trophoblast layer. Matrion is minimally processed and disinfected using a proprietary decellularization technology and terminally sterilized that safely renders the placental membrane acellular and sterile for its intended surgical applications."
