            "detailedDescription": "The prevalence of trauma exposure, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in particular, among individuals living with HIV (30-74%) is higher than the general population (7-10%). Individuals with co-occurring PTSD and HIV are at high-risk for negative HIV-related outcomes, including low adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), faster disease progression, more hospitalizations, and almost twice the rate of death, as well as increased mental health problems. In addition to PTSD resulting from traumatic events, such as sexual and physical assault/abuse, negative reinforcement conceptual models suggest that the avoidant behavior (a hallmark symptom of PTSD) tied to HIV status-related PTSD can also contribute to poor ART adherence and to less success of viral suppression (e.g., by avoiding cues, such as ART medications, that serve as reminders of the HIV status). Despite the high rates of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) who report PTSD - and the poorer HIV patient outcomes among this population versus those without co-occurring PTSD- evaluation of the impact of evidence-based treatment for PTSD among populations living with HIV on HIV outcomes has been highly neglected in clinical research. In other words, no research to date has examined the critical question of whether HIV outcomes can be improved among the large number of PLWH with co-morbid PTSD and related consequences (e.g., substance misuse) by treating PTSD symptoms.\n\nTo address this tremendous void in the field, we propose to adapt and examine the acceptability and feasibility of an evidence-based PTSD treatment that has reduced other HIV transmission behavior (e.g., sexual risk), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), at an HIV clinic as a strategy to improve HIV outcomes in this population."
