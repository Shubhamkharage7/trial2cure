            "briefSummary": "GERD, is a common and chronic world-wide disease. Cardinal symptoms of this condition are heartburn-regurgitation, and sometimes with extra-intestinal symptoms that can affect patients' quality of life. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) potently inhibit gastric acid secretion and are widely used for treatment of acid-related diseases. This class of medications is the most widely used for the management of GERD. H2 Receptor Antagonists (H2RAs) are another type of medication used to of uncomplicated GERD, gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastric hypersecretion, and for mild to infrequent heartburn or indigestion. H2RAs decrease gastric acid secretion by reversibly binding to histamine H2 receptors located on gastric parietal cells, thereby inhibiting the binding and action of the endogenous ligand histamine.\n\nDietary modification is endorsed by the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Gastroenterology as a first-line therapy for patients with GERD. The Gracie Diet is thought to play an important role in the prevention of GERD. The concept behind this diet is that the consumption of proper food combinations promotes optimal health by preventing unhealthy chemical reactions in the digestive process such as fermentation and acidity.\n\nThis diet describes the benefits of combining different foods together and the downsides of combining others. It provides guidance on avoiding specific foods and combinations of foods that may aggravate GERD, and adopting meal spacing habits to improve overall health outcomes. The idea is that such dietary changes support more efficient digestion and encourage healthier lifestyles (i.e. smoking cessation, elimination of alcohol intake, avoidance of soda consumption and desserts). This diet also supports the acquisition of healthy eating habits characterized by higher consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and encourages a reduction in the intake of saturated fat, sodium, added sugars, and canned foods. Limiting beverage consumption of water or fresh coconut water between meals is also encouraged. In this pilot study, the investigators hypothesized that the Gracie diet it could be an alternative option to improve GERD symptoms in those patients who do not respond to standard doses of PPI and/or H2 receptor antagonists."
