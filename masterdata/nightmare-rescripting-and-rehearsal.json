            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective Randomized Controlled Trial to determine if a standard of care sleep hygiene handout plus a brief 10 minute intervention for recurring nightmares (Nightmare Rescripting and Rehearsal Therapy) reduces scores on the Nightmare Distress Questionnaire and Nightmare Frequency Tool, when compared to patients solely receiving a handout outlining sleep hygiene techniques. Individuals with a minimum score on the Nightmare Distress Questionnaire and Nightmare Frequency Tool of 15 out of a possible 52 who meet all other inclusion criteria will be invited to participate.\n\nA clinically significant reduction will be considered if a decrease in Nightmare Distress and Frequency measures is greater than or equal to 25% from baseline. Secondary outcomes will include PCL-5 (PTSD), PHQ9 (Depression), GAD7 (Anxiety), ISI (Insomnia Severity Index) scores."
