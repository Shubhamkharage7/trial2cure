These findings may help explain the broad spectrum of clinical characteristics and outcomes seen in people with epilepsy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Many individuals with epilepsy experience seizures which respond well to treatment. Some types of epilepsy, however, are characterized by seizures which begin very early in childhood and are associated with severe intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. These conditions are often difficult to treat.\n\nThe investigators' research effort is focused on identifying genetic changes (known as \"DNA variants\") that cause epilepsy. By doing so the investigators hope to improve diagnosis and treatment for this epilepsy.\n\nWe have two specific aims:\n\n1. Identifying genetic findings in patients with epilepsy and related disorders.\n2. Correlating genetic findings with epilepsy phenotypes."
