            "briefSummary": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor among adults. As the diagnosis is generally considered terminal, patients with GBM often suffer from anxiety and other comorbid conditions, including depression, pain, and sleep disturbance, all of which significantly impact their quality of life. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of cannabinoids, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), to improve the aforementioned symptoms without conferring significant risks or side effects. Further, recent in-vitro and in-vivo work suggests potential cytotoxic and anti-tumor effects of CBD and other cannabinoids.\n\nThis study includes a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of a custom formulated, full-spectrum, hemp-derived ultra-high CBD product on measures of anxiety, pain, and quality of life in newly-diagnosed GBM patients undergoing standard of care (SOC) treatment; the impact of this product vs. placebo on tumor progression will also be assessed. The proposed clinical trial will provide important information that does not currently exist regarding the potential efficacy of a novel full-spectrum, ultra-high CBD product to address clinical symptoms in patients with GBM."
