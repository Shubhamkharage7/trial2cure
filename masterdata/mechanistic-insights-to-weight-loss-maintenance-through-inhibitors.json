            "briefSummary": "Obesity increases the risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Weight loss interventions such as low-calorie diet and physical activity are effective for weight loss in the short term, but weight loss maintenance (WLM) with low-calorie diet and physical activity is challenging. Weight loss is associated with a reduction in the amount of calories needed to maintain the body at rest, called the resting energy expenditure (REE), which may be a probable mechanism for this lack of WLM. Most individuals are unable to adequately change their diet and increase their physical activity levels to overcome this decrease in REE which prevents WLM. Therefore, techniques that increase REE may promote WLM in these individuals. Pre-clinical studies for Empagliflozin - Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor have shown an increase in REE. Thus, in addition to reducing the cardiovascular risk, SGLT2 inhibitor may promote WLM by increasing REE. This study aims to promote WLM in obese individuals by increasing the REE using SGLT2 inhibitor therapy."
