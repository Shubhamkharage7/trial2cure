            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, controlled, six-way crossover clinical study to characterize the nicotine PK (pharmacokinetic) and subjective effects of HTPs (Heated Tobacco Products) comprised of 2 menthol varieties and 2 tobacco flavor varieties (Ploom\u00ae HTPs, Japan Tobacco Inc.) in adult menthol and non-menthol combustible cigarette smokers (males and females between the ages of 22 and 65). The study will include participants' UBCC (Usual Brand Combustible Cigarette) and a nicotine gum (Nicorette\u00ae) as high and low abuse liability reference products, respectively, to the HTP. Study participation is expected to last up to 34 days, including a 28-day screening period (that includes a 5-day at-home HTP product trial period), and a 6-day in-clinic confinement period (from Check-in \\[Day -1\\] through the end-of-study \\[EOS\\] visit on Day 6).",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, controlled, six-way crossover clinical study to characterize the nicotine PK and subjective effects of HTPs (2 menthol varieties, Products A and B; 2 tobacco flavor varieties, Products C and D) in adult menthol and non-menthol combustible cigarette smokers. The study will include participants' UBCC (Product F) and a nicotine gum (Product E) as high and low abuse liability reference products, respectively, to the HTP. The study will include generally healthy adult males and females who smoke factory manufactured combustible cigarettes. This study will recruit approximately 60 participants (composed of approximately 30 menthol and 30 non-menthol adult smokers) in an attempt to obtain approximately 48 study completed participants (approximately 24 menthol and 24 non-menthol smokers). Adult participants will be between 22 and 65 years of age at screening, inclusive. Participants must have a history of smoking \u2265 10 to \u2264 30 menthol or non-menthol cigarettes daily for at least 12 months prior to screening.\n\nEnrolled participants will be randomized based on sex and their UBCC (menthol or non-menthol) to one of 6 product use sequences.\n\nScreening will occur within 28 days prior to Day 1 and includes administering the FTCD (Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence), standard safety procedures, collection of baseline information, and a 5-day at-home HTP product trial period.\n\nEnrollment visit (Day -6) will occur 5 days prior to Check-in (Day -1). Participants will receive the Ploom\u00ae HTP products for at-home product acclimation to become familiar with the product during the next 5 days. Training on how to use the Ploom\u00ae HTP device will be provided to each participant at the Enrollment visit. Participants will receive all four varieties of HTS on Day -6 and begin the at-home product trial. Participants are required to use each HTS variety at least once a day ad libitum for a minimum of 20 HTS uses over 5 days.\n\nParticipants will check-in on the morning of Day -1. Product use sequence randomization and assignment will also occur on Day -1. Participants will be randomized based on sex and their UBCC (menthol or non-menthol) to one of six product use sequences. Once participants are randomized to a product use sequence, product use sessions in confinement will start. Participants will remain in confinement at the clinic until completion of all study activities on Day 6.\n\nStarting on Day -1 (following Check-in) through Day 5, depending on the randomized product use sequence, participants will use their assigned product (HTP, UBCC, or nicotine gum) during an afternoon product use session. Participants will use the same assigned product to be tested during the next day's morning ad libitum product use PK test session (e.g., if a participant is assigned to Product A \\[HTP\\] as the product to be used in the morning ad libitum product use PK test session on Day 1, the participant will use Product A \\[HTP\\] during the afternoon product use session on Day -1). The afternoon product use session should be no more than approximately 6 hours long. Participants will be required to use the assigned study product at least once, but no more than six HTS, UBCC, or nicotine gum ad libitum per daily afternoon product use sessions. Participants will then be required to abstain from any tobacco- or nicotine-containing products for at least 12 hours prior to the start of the following morning's ad libitum product use PK test session. Morning ad libitum product use PK test sessions will occur on the mornings of Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (for a total of 6 morning ad libitum product use PK test sessions).\n\nDuring the morning ad libitum product use PK test session, participants will use the assigned study product per their assigned product use sequence. Participants will use a single UBCC or HTP for 5 minutes ad libitum or use the nicotine gum for 30 minutes per product use instruction. Blood samples for PK will be collected prior to and for 3 hours following the start of each morning ad libitum product use PK test session. Heart rate measurements will be taken at specified time points during each morning ad libitum product use PK test session. In addition, participants will complete subjective effects questionnaires (Product Liking, Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal, Direct Effects of Product, Use Product Again, and mCEQ) at designated time points during each morning ad libitum product use PK test session. Participants will remain in confinement starting with Check-in on Day -1 until discharge after all study activities are completed on Day 6. Participants will not be forced to use the tobacco/nicotine products at any time during the study."
