            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to develop and test a 12-week sedentary behavior reduction intervention (\"Sit Less\" program) for patients with cardiovascular disease. The program aims to reduce and break sitting times among this population using an objective activity monitor and mHealth. The investigators will test the program to help cardiovascular disease patients break up sitting time, reduce daily sitting time, and move more. The investigators will also study whether the program leads to improvements in heart disease risk factors, and whether cardiovascular disease patients like the program and can follow it.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose to develop and conduct a pilot 2-arm RCT to test a wearable technology-based sedentary behavior reduction intervention in cardiovascular disease patients. Participants will be randomized to either the control group or the sedentary behavior reduction intervention group. The intervention group will target a 120 minute per day reduction in sedentary behavior using an objective activity monitor and mHealth.\n\nSpecifically, the study aims to: determine the feasibility and acceptability of the sedentary behavior reduction intervention in cardiovascular patients by evaluating reach, retention, satisfaction, and compliance with the intervention; evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the sedentary behavior reduction intervention on changes in sedentary time; and explore preliminary effects of the sedentary reduction intervention on physical activity, cardiometabolic markers and patient-centered outcomes."
