Nausea and vomiting are one of the most prevalent and problematic side effects associated with chemotherapy treatment, effecting numerous patients.\n\nAutonomic nervous system (ANS) and the vagus nerve are important modulators of nausea and vomiting and are responsible for conveying visceral sensory information to the central nervous system responsible for nausea and vomiting. The aim of the study is to determine if stimulating a branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear would reduce the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting for patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to receive active vs sham (non-active) neurostimulation therapy which would be applied for maximum of 5 days at the onset of inpatient admission for moderate to severe emetogenic chemotherapy cycle. They will then cross over to the other group (active vs sham) during the admission of the following identical chemotherapy cycle. Nausea, vomiting, the need for additional antiemetic support and potential side effects will be monitored during the entire study."
