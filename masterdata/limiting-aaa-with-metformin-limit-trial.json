            "briefSummary": "In this research, the investigators are looking at the effects of a drug called metformin may have on the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)s. AAA is an abnormal enlargement of the aorta, which is the large artery in the abdomen (stomach area). The enlargement of the aorta carries a risk that it will rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding in the abdomen (belly). In this study the investigators hope to learn how metformin is associated with the enlargement or change in size of the AAA in study participants. Smaller studies have suggested that metformin may reduce the rate at which aortic aneurysms enlarge. This study will test this question: does metformin prevent AAAs from growing larger?"
