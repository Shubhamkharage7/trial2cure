Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of the study, and 30 days after completion of the study\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior treatment with cetuximab for recurrent or metastatic disease (however, prior cetuximab given as a component of multimodality therapy for newly diagnosed, locally advanced, non-metastatic HNSCC is allowable).\n* Prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor for RM-HNSCC.\n* Rb (retinoblastoma) loss: mutation or homozygous deletion described on genomic sequencing report.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents.\n* A history of other malignancy with the exception of malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 1 year before registration and the patient has no evidence of recurrent/persistent disease.\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) during the screening period\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to palbociclib or other agents used in the study (excluding cetuximab).\n* Prior grade 3 or 4 (per CTCAE 5.0) hypersensitivity reaction to cetuximab.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* QTc \\>500 msec (using Bazette formula).\n* Patients with HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are \\< 350 cells/mcL or they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months prior to registration.

Recommend exclusion of specific ART agents based on predicted drug-drug interactions (i.e. for sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, concurrent strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir and cobicistat) or inducers (efavirenz) should be contraindicated).",
