Only mid-life adult binge drinkers will enter Phase 2 and be randomized to the exercise training group and non-exercise control group. After 8 weeks of intervention, we will re-measure blood pressure, microvascular function, and sympathetic nerve activity (post-intervention assessment) in mid-life adult binge drinkers."
