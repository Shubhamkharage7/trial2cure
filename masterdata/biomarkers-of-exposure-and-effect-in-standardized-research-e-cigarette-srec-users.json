In the environment of continuously changing e-cigarette market, SREC was developed as a model e-cigarette that will remain available for an extended period of time and can be used as a bridging element in various studies aimed at evaluating the value and limitations of e-cigarettes as tobacco risk reduction tools. Our overall goal is to generate initial reference data on chemical exposures and associated effects in smokers switching to SREC."

The concentration of nicotine in e-liquid is 15 mg/mL, and the vehicle composition is 50:50 propylene glycol and glycerin. The device uses a battery that can be recharged via a micro USB port. A single charge is designed to sustain more than 400 puffs, which is more than the capacity of an e-liquid cartridge. The e-liquid and the aerosol are well-characterized in terms of chemical impurities and by-products (such as aldehydes), which are minimal.
