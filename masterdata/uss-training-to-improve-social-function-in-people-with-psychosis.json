            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two training courses. All participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires, engage in interviews, and complete paper and pencil tasks at the beginning of the study, at the halfway point of the training course (1 month), and end of the training course (2 months), and another 2 months later. One training focuses on how to make good judgments about what other people may be thinking or feeling in social situations, and why people might act in certain ways in different situations. The other training focuses on different strategies for handling everyday problems and stressors. Both trainings are done in one-on-one sessions with a research staff member. There will be 16-20 training sessions, each about 45-60 minutes long. The investigators will ask participants to attend 2 training sessions per week, so the total training time should be about 2 months."
