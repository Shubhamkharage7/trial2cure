            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this project is to collect initial human data on the effects of novel compounds on safety (interactions with an opioid drug, e.g., buprenorphine) and early efficacy signals (subjective effects on negative affect, craving, and opioid withdrawal) in OUD subjects currently in MOUD treatment with buprenorphine. The compound to be studied in this protocol will be a pre-configured combination of 45mg dextromethorphan with 105 mg Bupropion (AuvelityTM, hereafter referred as Auvelity). Notably, other NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine have also been shown to rapidly improve mood and reduce suicidality. OUD has also been linked to histories of trauma and syndromes of negative mood, where opioid use in many individuals was initially motivated by a desire to alleviate a negative mood state. Lastly, using the NIDA Phenotyping Battery, our group has also found negative emotionality to be part of a constellation of neurofunctional domains that are associated with SUD severity. Taken together, providing AUVELITY as an adjunctive treatment to buprenorphine could be an avenue to target crucial underlying mechanisms of OUD and improve OUD treatment outcomes."
