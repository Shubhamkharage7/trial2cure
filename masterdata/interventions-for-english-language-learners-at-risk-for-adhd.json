The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n- Which intervention is better for the students: the behavioral intervention, the language intervention, or a combination of the behavioral and language interventions?\n\nParticipants will be asked to do the following:\n\n* Participants' parents and teachers will be asked to complete questionnaires about their behavior.\n* Participants will be asked to complete tests assessing language, cognitive, and academic abilities.\n* Members of the research team will complete classroom observations for the participating students.\n* Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: a school as usual group, a language group, a daily report card group, and a combined daily report card and language group.\n\n  * If assigned to the language group, participants will receive an 18-week language intervention.\n  * If assigned to the daily report card group, a behavioral consultant will work with participants' parents and teachers to set up a home-school behavior plan called a daily report card.\n  * If assigned to the combined daily report card and language group, participants will receive both the language intervention and the daily report card.\n  * If assigned to the school as usual group, participants will no study interventions.\n\nResearchers will compare the language group, the daily report card group, the combined language and daily report card group, and the school as usual group to see which group has the best language learning and classroom behavior at the end of the program."

Dialogic Reading is designed to increase vocabulary knowledge through shared reading of picture books. The content involves reading of 9 children's books with 108 targeted vocabulary words. Language in Motion is designed to increase syntax and grammar knowledge using science manipulatives. Daily lessons are highly scripted to introduce primary syntax targets through narrative text. Manipulation props are used to reinforce syntax targets and basic science topics.",
