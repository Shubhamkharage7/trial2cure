All participants will have one \\[18F\\]NOS positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan performed, unless this has been performed as part of another study. AUD participants enrolled in a companion treatment study #851593 \"A Randomized, Double-blind Placebo-Controlled Study of Ibudilast for Treating Alcohol Use Disorder\" will be asked to undergo a second \\[18F\\]NOS PET scan after the initiation of the study treatment.\n\nFor each PET/CT scan, patients will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic scanning starting at the time of injection of \\[18F\\]NOS. PET/CT imaging sessions will include an injection of \u2264 6.5 mCi (approximate range for most studies is anticipated to be 3.5-6.5 mCi) of \\[18F\\]NOS. Data will be collected to evaluate uptake of \\[18F\\]NOS in the brain and other organs (e.g., lungs, heart, and liver), and measurements will be compared between groups.\n\nEach participant will undergo a 1-hour brain MRI to measure brain inflammatory markers using GluCEST and spectroscopic imaging, unless this has been performed as part of another study and deemed acceptable by an investigator. On the PET day, a blood sample will be collected to measure established peripheral inflammatory biomarkers to be correlated with \\[18F\\]NOS uptake. AUD participants who are enrolled in the companion treatment study will be asked to undergo a second brain MRI, PET/CT scan, and blood draw for inflammatory markers after the initiation of treatment."
