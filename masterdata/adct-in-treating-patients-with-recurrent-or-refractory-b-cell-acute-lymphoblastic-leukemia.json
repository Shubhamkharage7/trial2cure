Monoclonal antibodies, such as ADCT-602, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ADCT-602 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell (B)-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Phase 1.\n\nII. Determine the recommended dose of ADCT-602 for Phase 2. III. Evaluate the efficacy (complete response \\[CR\\] with incomplete marrow recovery \\[CR/CRi\\] rate) of ADCT-602 in Phase 2.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the clinical activity of ADCT-602, based on duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nII. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ADCT-602. III. Evaluate the immunogenicity of ADCT-602. IV. Characterize the effect of ADCT-602 exposure on the QT interval.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Obtain preliminary data on the correlation between the clinical activity and PK profile of ADCT-602 with the baseline expression of CD22 and other cluster of differentiation (CD) markers in peripheral blood.\n\nII. Assess the impact of soluble CD22 (sCD22) on ADCT-602 PK.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive ADCT-602 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve CR/CRi receive ADCT-602 every 28 days.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year."
