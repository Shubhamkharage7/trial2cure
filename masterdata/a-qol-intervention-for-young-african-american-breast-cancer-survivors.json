Patients also participate in 3, 20 minutes telephone reinforcement calls to discuss how they are doing and discuss any concerns that they are still managing at months 2, 3, and 4.\n\nARM II (ATTENTION CONTROL): Patients receive three themed education sessions over 1 hour each, written materials, and videos at month 1.
