            "briefSummary": "Considerable heterogeneity in the aging population has been observed. The exceptional longevity of individuals reaching 100 years old, so-called centenarians may be an example of life-long healthy aging, or added years may be spent in poor health with decreased physical and cognitive functioning. Current knowledge of the aging experience and the trajectories of physical and cognitive decline across various age groups are not well-understood, yet crucial to prevent spending added years in disease. Hence, the study objective is to develop the metabolic profile associated with aging-related disorders measured as the incidence of impaired functional capacity, cognitive function, and/or well-being.",
            "detailedDescription": "Our lab developed a pulse method combining multiple stable tracers to study multiple metabolic pathways in the same individual simultaneously. By measuring whole-body metabolism in a large group of older adults, we may be able to unravel age-related deterioration in protein turnover (synthesis and breakdown) that contributes to impaired functional capacity. Metabolic profiles could explain differences in pathways in the aging process with a special interest in the metabolism of amino acids as they have been associated with aging-related disorders. Studies on the effect of aging on metabolism might serve as potential therapeutic targets."
