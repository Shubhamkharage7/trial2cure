The 3,200 participants to be enrolled will be current smokers who are Black, Hispanic, and/or have low socioeconomic status (defined as household income \\<200% of the federal poverty line or a high school education or less) or rural residence who are referred for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening at 4 large health systems. All adult patients with LDCT orders will be further screened for eligibility. Eligible patients will enroll with opt-out consent and complete the study using the NIH-funded Way to Health online research portal. The primary outcome will be biochemically confirmed, sustained abstinence from smoking tobacco for 6 months following participants' selected quit dates. Relapse rates will be tracked at 12 months."
