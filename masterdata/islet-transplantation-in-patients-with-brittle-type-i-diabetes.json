Such management must be under the direction of an endocrinologist, diabetologist, or diabetes specialist with at least 3 clinical evaluations during the 12 months prior to study enrollment.\n* Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia as defined by a Clarke score of 4 or more OR a HYPO score greater than or equal to the 90th percentile (1047) during the screening period and within the last 6 months; OR marked glycemic lability characterized by wide swings in blood glucose despite optimal diabetes therapy and defined by an LI score greater than or equal to the 90th percentile (433 mmol/L2/h -wk1) during the screening period and within the last 6 months prior to randomization; OR a composite of a Clarke score of 4 or more and a HYPO score greater than or equal to the 75th percentile (423) and a LI greater than or equal to the 75th percentile (329) during the screening period and within the last 6 months.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Body mass index (BMI) \\>30 kg/m2 or patient weight \\<50kg.\n* Insulin requirement \\>1.0 IU/kg/day or \\<15 U/day.\n* Untreated proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\n* Blood Pressure: SBP \\>160 mmHg or DBP \\>100 mmHg.\n* Measured glomerular filtration rate \\<80 mL/min/1.73m2 (using iohexol or calculated using the subject's measured serum creatinine and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI equation) or based on 24-hrs urine collection. Strict vegetarians (vegans) with a calculated GFR \\<70 mL/min/1.73m2 are excluded. The absolute (raw) GFR value will be used for subjects with body surface areas \\>1.73 m2.\n* Presence or history of macroalbuminuria (\\>300 mg/g creatinine).\n* Presence or history of panel-reactive anti-HLA antibodies above 30% or history/presence of donor specific anti-HLA antibodies in order to avoid unacceptable antigen(s) (Campbell PM 2007).\n* For female subjects: Positive pregnancy test, presently breast-feeding, wishes to be pregnant at any time point in the future, which includes during or after the completion of the study even if study participation is ended early, or unwillingness to use effective contraceptive measures for the duration of the study and 4 months after discontinuation.
