People with PAD have poor blood circulation because of narrowing or blocks in blood vessels caused by fat or calcium deposits (atherosclerosis). The study researchers think that PAD may lead to worse outcomes in cancer treatment, but people with cancer are not routinely tested for the disease.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find out how common PAD is among people with cancer who have risk factors for blood circulation disease, and to compare how often PAD is diagnosed in different racial groups"
