Anticipated concomitant use of non-study antimicrobial drug therapy between randomization and the LFU visit that would potentially effect outcome evaluations of cUTI/AP.\n6. Receipt of more than a single dose of a potentially effective antimicrobial within 72 hours prior to study randomization.\n7.
