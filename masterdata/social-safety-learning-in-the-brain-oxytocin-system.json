            "briefSummary": "The investigators are conducting this research study to examine whether oxytocin enhances social safety learning (learning safety through the experience of another individual) in people with social anxiety disorder (SAD) compared to healthy volunteers. Oxytocin is a hormone that can also act as a chemical messenger in the brain. Oxytocin plays a role in a number of functions, including responding to fear and social interactions. In this study, the investigators would like to compare the effects of oxytocin and placebo nasal sprays in adults with SAD and healthy adults. This research study will compare an oxytocin nasal spray to a placebo nasal spray. About 120 people will take part in this research study, all at the University of Washington (UW).",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of the current study is to examine the potential role of oxytocin in enhancing social learning in SAD. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that vicarious extinction learning will contribute to safety learning and that oxytocin will potentiate vicarious extinction learning in patients with SAD, compared to healthy controls (HC). The investigators will directly test the effect of intranasal oxytocin and matching placebo on the brain mechanisms underlying vicarious extinction learning using a novel task. 60 adults with SAD and 60 healthy control participants will perform a task that involves three phases: (i) a standard social fear acquisition procedure while in a mock scanner, followed by (ii) a vicarious extinction and (iii) fear reinstatement test procedure, while being scanned during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will receive oxytocin or placebo prior to the extinction phase. The investigators will also measure skin conductance responses as an index of learning in each phase."
