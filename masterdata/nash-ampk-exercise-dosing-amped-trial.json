            "briefSummary": "There is no known cure or regulatory agency approved drug therapy for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of liver disease worldwide, and its progressive type, NASH. This places increased importance on using exercise to treat NAFLD.\n\nWhile physical activity is recommended for all with NAFLD, how to best prescribe exercise as a specific treatment remains unknown, including what dose of exercise is most effective.",
            "detailedDescription": "The mechanism explaining how exercise training benefits patients with NAFLD and NASH is unclear. The AMPK pathway may be responsible for the benefits seen with exercise training because: 1) AMPK has a liver-specific role in hepatic de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, 2) AMPK activity is abnormally low in NAFLD and 3) NAFLD animal models demonstrate exercise changes the liver-specific AMPK pathway, leading to less liver fat accumulation by reducing lipogenesis and increasing fatty acid oxidation (This has not been studied in patients). Importantly, exercise-induced AMPK activation appears to be dose dependent."
