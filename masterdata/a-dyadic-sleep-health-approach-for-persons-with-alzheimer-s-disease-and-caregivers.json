We will evaluate the efficacy of the sleep intervention program (Care2Sleep) on sleep, health status measures, and quality of life (for dyads), and inflammation (for caregivers only). Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to in-person Care2Sleep, telehealth Care2Sleep, or to an in-person education control group. The Care2Sleep programs and the control education program will consist of five sessions. The intervention and control programs will begin after baseline assessment and randomization. Posttreatment assessments will be performed immediately after the last session and at 6-month follow-up."
