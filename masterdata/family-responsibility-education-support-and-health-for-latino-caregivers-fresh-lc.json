Investigators will provide 6 months of a group program (PBT-AC or HE) and will follow participants at 12-months post-treatment (total time = 18 months). Investigators will recruit children with overweight or obesity and two caregivers. Families will be assessed at 5 timepoints: baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Assessments will include the following for the child and primary caregiver: anthropometry, blood sample collection, eating behaviors, and family relationship measures. The other caregiver will complete surveys about eating behaviors and family relationships. This program of research has the potential to advance the standard of practice for Latino children with overweight or obesity by developing tailored interventions which can be easily disseminated."
