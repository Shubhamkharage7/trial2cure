Baseline Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level \\> 10 ng/mL or confirmed or suspected prostate cancer (subjects with a PSA level \\> 2.5 ng/mL or whose PSA levels fall outside age-specific or local reference ranges, should have prostate cancer excluded to the Investigator's satisfaction in conjunction with shared decision making \\[SDM\\] with the study subjects).\n7. Confirmed or suspected bladder cancer.\n8. History of cystolithiasis, kidney stone, or kidney disease within the prior 3 months.\n9. History of neurogenic bladder.\n10. Previous episode of AUR, i.e., post hernia repair or other condition or disease that might cause urinary retention.\n11.

Subjects with life-threatening disease in which life expectancy is foreshortened are excluded.\n18. Desire to maintain fertility post-treatment.\n19. Anticipated need for additional major surgery or treatments for comorbidities during the study period (e.g., valve repair, organ transplant).\n20. Prostatic urethral length \\< 25 mm or \\> 60 mm, as measured from bladder neck to verumontanum, using cystoscopy just prior to randomization.\n21. Any concurrent medical condition or illness that might prevent study completion or that could impact the study results such as:\n\n    * severe cardiac arrhythmias uncontrolled by medications or pacemaker.\n    * congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) III or IV.\n    * uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n    * significant respiratory disease in which hospitalization may be required.\n    * known immunosuppression (i.e., AIDS, post-transplant, undergoing chemotherapy).\n22. Inability to stop taking anticoagulants and/or antiplatelets for at least 3 days prior to the procedure or coumadin for at least 5 days prior to the procedure.\n\n    Note: Low dose aspirin therapy is acceptable.\n23. Unable or unwilling to complete all required questionnaires and follow-up assessments.\n24. Participating in any other investigational study for either drug or device which can influence collection of valid data under this study.\n25. Subject is in custody or institution, or, in the Investigator's opinion, has a physical, psychological, or medical impairment that might prevent study completion or would confound study results (including subject questionnaires).",
