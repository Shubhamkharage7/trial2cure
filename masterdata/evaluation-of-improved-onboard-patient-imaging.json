            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of radiation therapy is to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation precisely to the target while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissues. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) involves acquiring cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans just before or during treatment sessions. By comparing the CBCT images with the reference images from the treatment planning process, clinicians can make necessary adjustments to ensure precise targeting and account for any changes that may have occurred since the initial planning. Conventional CBCT technology is, however, limited by several factors including long acquisition times that result in motion artifacts in the image, smaller fields of view that limit the volume of anatomy that can be imaged, poor image quality that limits soft tissue visibility, and artifacts created by dense metal implants. This study will evaluate a novel CBCT imaging solution (\"HyperSight\") that has the potential to address the challenges of conventional CBCT."
