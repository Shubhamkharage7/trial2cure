            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPyrimidine and purine metabolism disorders (DPPMs) affect how the body metabolizes chemicals called pyrimidines and purines. DPPMs can cause dysfunctions throughout the body, especially in the brain, blood, kidneys, and immune system. People with DPPMs might have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or they may have severe, chronic symptoms, that can be fatal. DPPMs are not well understood, and researchers want to learn more about what causes them and how to treat them.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about factors that affect DPPMs by comparing test results from affected, uaffected family members, and healthy people.\n\nEligibility:\n\nThree types of participants are needed: people aged 1 month and older with DPPMs; their family members who do not have DPPMs; and healthy volunteers.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants with DPPMs will come to the clinic once a year; some may be asked to come more often. At each visit, all affected participants will have a physical exam and give samples of blood, urine, saliva, and stool. Depending on their symptoms, they may also have other procedures, such as:\n\nSwabs of their skin and inside the mouth.\n\nTests of their heart, kidney, brain, and nerve function.\n\nQuestionnaires about what they eat.\n\nDental exams, and exams of their hearing and vision.\n\nTests of their learning ability.\n\nMonitoring of their physical activity.\n\nImaging scans.\n\nPhotographs of their face and body.\n\nThese tests may be spread over up to 7 days. Affected participants may remain in the study indefinitely if they wish to.\n\nHealthy volunteers and family members will have 1 study visit. They will have a physical exam and may be asked to give blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will explore the natural history and mechanisms of novel or known but incompletely characterized disorders of pyrimidine and purine metabolism (DPPMs). Eligible participants will be ascertained by identifying biochemical abnormalities in the levels of purines, pyrimidines and related compounds in body fluids, abnormal activity of enzymes, and/or identifying pathogenic variants in genes linked to purines and pyrimidine metabolism. We will collect participants DNA for genetic and genomic analyses, body fluids for biochemical analysis, blood and tissue samples for enzyme analysis, gastrointestinal samples for microbiome analysis. Some participants may undergo skin biopsy. Study subjects will be offered medical, laboratory, and imaging studies at the NIH Clinical Research Center consistent with the standards of care. Collected data will be analyzed to improve understanding of the natural history, develop statistical prediction models, identify and validate novel biomarkers.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To describe features of novel and poorly characterized DPPMs.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To identify genomic, clinical, pharmacological, laboratory, and dietary factors associated with variable outcomes in subjects affected by DPPMs.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Identify genomic variants, laboratory parameters, image findings, microbiome variables, nutritional and medication history of DPPMs.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Identify disease parameters associated with variable clinical outcomes (e.g., frequency of hospitalizations, survival, quality of life, function)."
