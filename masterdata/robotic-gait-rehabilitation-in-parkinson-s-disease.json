            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the implementation of a novel gait rehabilitation stimulus (G-EO System) that could advance current clinical practices. The goal is to establish the safety and feasibility of gait training using the G-EO System as well as investigating the impact on mobility, function, quality of life, and participatory outcomes.\n\nResearch Design: We propose a single-blinded, randomized trial of electromechanically-assisted gait training using the G-EO System in patients with Parkinson's disease with gait disability.\n\nSpecific Aim 1 will establish the safety and feasibility of gait training using the G-EO System.\n\nSpecific Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of gait training using the G-EO System for improving mobility, function, and quality of life",
            "detailedDescription": "Individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) often suffer from difficulties with gait initiation, maintaining a consistent kinematic gait pattern, and transitions between gait environments. Focused gait training that provides an environment that can emphasize motor control improvement in these deficits would be ideal for building a rehabilitative foundation for gait recovery for individuals with PD.\n\nOne approach that has been used to maintain and restore function in other neurological populations with severe disability is gait rehabilitation using treadmill training. This approach allows for specific and repetitive practice of walking movement and can involve therapist or electromechanical assistance. There is preliminary evidence from two small, uncontrolled studies supporting the benefits of therapist-assisted treadmill training on walking, balance, fatigue, spasticity, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with PPMS and SPMS. Nevertheless, therapist-assisted gait training can require up to three trainers per patient making it burdensome and inefficient in the clinical setting. The intensity of manual treadmill training is low (i.e., \\<1.5 METs) based in part on the physical capacity and fitness level of the trainers, yet physiological adaptations for optimizing outcomes require moderate or vigorous intensity exercise.\n\nRobotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) addresses many of the limitations of therapist-assisted gait training and can be performed using either exoskeleton or end-effector devices. Exoskeleton devices involve programmable drives or passive elements which physically move the lower limbs, whereas, end-effector approaches involve driven footplates that have trajectories that simulate the stance and swing phases. The G-EO System (Reha Technology AG: Olten, Switzerland) is a novel end-effector robotic gait training system that was developed for regaining mobility and independence in stroke survivors. This system involves minimal therapist and patient burden (e.g., quick set-up, single operate usage), there is the unique capacity for practicing walking and stair climbing movements, and the patient can receive real-time visual feedback. Gait training using the G-EO System has been applied in patients with stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cerebral palsy (CP). These studies have established safety and feasibility, and preliminary evidence for benefits on mobility and function. For example, two studies involving 4 weeks of G-EO training with conventional physical therapy in non-ambulatory subacute stroke patients reported improved gait, stair climbing ability, leg strength, and activities of daily living (ADL) compared to physical therapy alone. There is limited RAGT studies evaluating the impact of this type of training for individuals with PD. The potential focus on improved gait kinematics may be of particular benefit for PD patients who often struggle with maintain step length and initiation.\n\nThe logistic advantages and advanced training capabilities of the G-EO System, as well as the benefits reported in other populations, support this strategy as an effective rehabilitation tool for restoring and maintaining function in Parkinson's disease. This approach represents an opportunity for improving current clinical practices for patients with Parkinson's disease. If successful, this project will provide initial evidence for increasing patient access to the G-EO System, and this could be accomplished through \"regional technology centers\" using a rural health-delivery approach.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the implementation of a novel gait rehabilitation stimulus (G-EO System) that could advance current clinical practices. The goal is to establish the safety and feasibility of gait training using the G-EO System as well as investigating the impact on mobility, function, quality of life, and participatory outcomes.\n\nResearch Design: We propose a single-blinded, randomized trial of electromechanically-assisted gait training using the G-EO System in patients with Parkinson's disease with gait disability.\n\nSpecific Aim 1 will establish the safety and feasibility of gait training using the G-EO System.\n\nSpecific Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of gait training using the G-EO System for improving mobility, function, and quality of life."
