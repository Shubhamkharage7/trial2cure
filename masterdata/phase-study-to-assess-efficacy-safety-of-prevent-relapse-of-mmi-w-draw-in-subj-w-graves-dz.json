All subjects enrolled in this study will receive Methimazole treatment in titration period.\n\nDuring the titration period, subjects will receive WP1302 or placebo by subcutaneous (S.C.) injection every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 12 weeks while continuing MMI (see \"Dosing\" below). The dose of WP1302 will be titrated up to the target dose assigned to the subject during this period (see \"Dosing\" below). Thyroid symptoms and function tests will be evaluated every 2 weeks. The investigator may adjust the frequency of thyroid function tests based on safety considerations. If a subject does not maintain euthyroidism, which is defined as total T3 60-180 ng/dL, free T4 0.8-1.8 ng/dL, and TSH 0.5-5 mU/L, during the \"WP1302 titration period\", the subject will be discontinued from Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (i.e., WP1302 or placebo) and the subject is still required to complete the end-of study visit.\n\nDuring the 26-week full dose of WP1302 with Methimazole tapering period, subjects who have maintained euthyroidism during the \"WP1302 titration period\" will be dosed with WP1302 at 400, 800, or 1200 \u03bcg with down-titrated Methimazole. Thyroid symptoms and function tests will be evaluated every 2 weeks. The investigator may adjust the frequency of thyroid function tests based on safety considerations. Subjects who experience disease relapse will be treated with Methimazole as first-line therapy (see \"Management of Relapse and Rescue Medication\" below).\n\nAt the end of the full dose of WP1302 with Methimazole tapering period, subjects will have 4 weeks of follow-up, and complete an end-of-study visit at Week 42. All the subjects will subsequently be enrolled in an extended safety follow-up period for an additional 6 months. Subjects who remain euthyroid will continue to be monitored for efficacy during the long-term follow-up."

Subjects with history of cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack, or other cerebrovascular disease who maybe at increased risk of neurologic adverse events from treatment or recurrence of hyperthyroidism.\n12. Prior treatment with immunotherapies (including rituximab), any cytokine or anti-cytokine therapy.\n13.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\&lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2, calculated as individual eGFR derived from Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.\n17. Receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or microdialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration or continuous venovenous hemodialysis.\n18. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.\n19. Known history of active or chronic infectious disease or any disease which compromises immune function (e.g., HIV+, HTLV-1, active Lyme disease, latent or active TB, viral hepatitis).\n20. Major surgery within 6 months prior to the screening visit or requiring ongoing active treatment after surgery irrespective of the time since surgery.\n21. Active thyroid eye disease (clinical activity score \\[CAS\\] \u22653) with functional visual impairment sufficient to cause poor quality of life, or dysthyroid optic neuropathy likely to require immunosuppressive treatment during the 30 weeks of the study.\n22. Any vaccination within 30 days prior to screening, except for influenza and coronavirus vaccines.\n23. Being pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study.\n24. Documented presence of immunodeficiency or an immunocompromised condition including hematologic malignancy, bone marrow transplant, or known human immunodeficiency virus infection with a CD4 count \\&lt;200/mm3.\n25. Currently actively moderate-heavy using tobacco (\u226510 cigarettes a day).\n26. Participating in any clinical study of any investigational medication (i.e., unauthorized medication) within 90 days prior to randomization.\n27. Any other significant medical illness or psychiatric conditions that in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study or impair the ability to give informed consent; any other clinically apparent autoimmune disease currently requiring disease-modifying or anti-inflammatory treatment; or significant illness which has not resolved within 4 weeks prior to the planned date of first dose of WP1302.\n28. Any other conditions or prior therapies, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for this study.",
