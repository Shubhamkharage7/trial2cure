            "briefSummary": "Nearly 1 million individuals in the United States have multiple sclerosis, which causes fatigue and problems with walking. Fatigue and walking problems are poorly treated, but exercise training, particularly high-intensity walking exercise, may help. This provide insight into whether high-intensity walking exercise can improve fatigue and walking problems in people with multiple sclerosis, which could improve quality of life and reduce economic burden.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system with a prevalence of nearly 1 million adults in the US. The pathophysiology of this disease results in two of the hallmark features of MS, namely symptomatic fatigue and walking impairment. These two features of MS are inter-related as symptomatic fatigue is often a driver of declines in walking and worsening of disability over time, and both compromise quality of life and independence. To date, fatigue and walking impairment are poorly managed through conventional disease modifying medications or rehabilitation therapy in MS.\n\nOne approach for improving fatigue and walking in MS is an appropriate dose of exercise training. Current recommendations of 30 min/day 2 days/week of low to moderate exercise training can improve symptomatic fatigue, aerobic capacity, strength, and walking endurance, and other symptoms in people with MS. This prescription is often delivered using moderate-intensity, continuous training (MCT) walking. However, improvements in fatigue and walking outcomes have been small, suggesting that MCT may not be the optimal approach. In people with stroke, high intensity, interval-based walking exercise has provided a greater stimulus than MCT for improving outcomes, but this approach has not been researched in MS.\n\nThere are a few field-wide limitations of research on exercise training, fatigue, and walking outcomes in MS. Often, researchers have (a) enrolled people with MS regardless of symptomatic fatigue and/or walking dysfunction, and this yields floor effects in outcomes and prevents conclusions on exercise as a treatment approach; (b) included people with mild disability, but not moderate or severe disability; and (c) applied exercise modalities not based on the principle of specificity (i.e., using walking training to improve fatigue and walking impairment). This project overcomes these field-wide limitations and compares effects of moderate and high intensity treadmill training on symptomatic fatigue and walking in people with MS with elevated fatigue and walking dysfunction."
