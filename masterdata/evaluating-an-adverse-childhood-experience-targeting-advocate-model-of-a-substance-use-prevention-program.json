            "briefSummary": "Primary Objective: Conduct a rigorous evaluation of a prevention-based intervention designed to mitigate the harms of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) exposure and prevent future ACEs, substance use, and overdose within 36 communities experiencing a disproportionate burden of substance use and ACEs.\n\nThe study has three aims: (1) use a cluster randomized controlled trial to test effectiveness of the Strengthening Families Program (SFP) + Family Advocate (FA) intervention on substance use, overdose, and ACEs in 18 communities compared with SFP-only in 18 communities; (2) conduct a robust process evaluation informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to explore implementation barriers and facilitators; and (3) conduct a cost evaluation to accurately estimate the costs required to implement SFP and SFP+FA and assess the cost-effectiveness of SFP+FA relative to SFP alone. Findings will provide a roadmap about the best ways to help disproportionately affected communities prevent substance use, overdose, and ACEs.",
            "detailedDescription": "Early exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), such as parental substance use, increases the likelihood of future substance use and drug overdose, resulting in an intergenerational cycle of substance-related ACEs that can continue indefinitely if left uninterrupted. Community-level interventions may moderate the relationship between ACEs and substance use by providing an array of family support services and treatments to reduce disparities and improve reach and service linkages in the community. Although research suggests that effectively decreasing the prevalence and impact of ACEs and substance use requires addressing both family- and community-level factors in tandem, there is a critical gap within the evidence base pertaining to interventions that effectively integrate the two factors to prevent substance use and ACEs. RTI International and its partners, the New Jersey Prevention Network and RWJBarnabas Health, will evaluate an intervention integrating New Jersey's established, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program (SFP) with clinically trained, trauma-informed Family Advocates (FAs) who will assist families (i.e., parents/caregivers and youth between the ages of 12 and17) in accessing community resources. Specifically, this study will use a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation design across 36 New Jersey communities experiencing a disproportionate burden of substance use and ACEs."
