To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio in detecting intra-tumoral hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate/lactate signal using metabolic MR imaging in participants with advanced solid tumors.\n\nPhase II/Part B\n\n1. To determine the mean percent change from baseline in peak intra-tumoral hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio and pyruvate-to-lactate kinetic constant (kPL) after initiation of SOC treatment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nPhase I/Part A\n\n1. To further characterize the safety profile of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate.\n2. To determine the reproducibility of intra-tumoral HP lac/pyr ratio with same-day repeated dose studies.\n\nPhase II/Part B\n\n1. To study the association between clinical outcomes and the percent change from baseline in peak intra-tumoral hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio and kPL after initiation of SOC treatment.\n2. To further characterize the safety profile of hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate.\n3. To determine the reproducibility of intra-tumoral HP lac/pyr ratio with same-day repeated dose studies.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants will be enrolled in Part A which is the feasibility, run-in study which includes the iterative adjustment of coil design to optimize imaging parameters within the target tumor lesion(s). If the data from Part A supports further investigation, additional participants will be enrolled in Part B which is a biomarker cohort which includes participants who are planning on being treated with either standard-of-care (SOC) or investigational therapies and will be followed until discontinuation of the treatment regimen outside of this protocol."
