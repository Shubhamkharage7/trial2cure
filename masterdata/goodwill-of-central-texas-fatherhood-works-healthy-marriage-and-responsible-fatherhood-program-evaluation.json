            "detailedDescription": "This evaluation seeks to understand the positive and/or negative impacts of the virtual administration of an evidence-based core curriculum, as compared to in-person administration. Because there are pros and cons with each service delivery format, is not clear whether a particular service delivery method will be more effective for program participants. Virtual services may reduce barriers to program enrollment and retention, such as transportation or childcare challenges, that could increase the likelihood that participants are able to complete curriculum aimed at improving parenting, relationship, employment, and financial behaviors. However, virtual services may not be as effective as in-person services if participants are not getting the same peer bonding and support in a virtual setting.\n\nGCT seeks to understand if the format of delivery (in-person as compared to virtual) of an evidence-based, core skill-based curriculum impacts parent-child relationship quality for low-income fathers and father figures in Central Texas. This research will make a significant contribution to the evidence base for the field of fatherhood, because effective approaches to social service programming in a post-COVID-19 environment of increased social distancing must be identified in order to prepare for ongoing and future challenges."
