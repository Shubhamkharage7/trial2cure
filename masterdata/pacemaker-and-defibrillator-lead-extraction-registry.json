            "briefSummary": "Implanted cardiac devices are commonly used to treat a wide variety of heart diseases, including arrhythmias, cardiac resynchronization in select heart failure patients, and life threatening heart rhythms. Approximately 400,000 devices are implanted annually, and more than 3 million patients currently have implanted devices1.\n\nImplanted cardiac devices are made to 2 components, the can and the leads. The can contains the electric circuits and the battery, which must be replaced every 5-10 years. The can is connected to external leads which pass through the subclavian vein, and depending on the device, into the vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and/or coronary sinus. Leads typically last longer than the battery, and are simply reconnected to a new can at the time of replacement.\n\nCertain clinical situations necessitate lead removal, including pocket infection, device related endocarditis, venous stenosis or occlusion with the need for new access, and removal of abandoned or malfunctioning leads. Removing the leads is technically difficult due to fibrosis, and requires specialized equipment. Compared to lead implantation, extraction of leads is relatively rare, with a life time risk of a device patient needing an extraction in the 1-5% range. Given that this is a relatively rare procedure and is only done at a few centers, documentation of our experiences with lead extraction can lead to ongoing improvements in both procedural techniques and outcomes.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Procedures\n\nThis is a retrospective review of data on patient characteristics (such as age, gender, co-morbidities), procedure specifications and indications, and outcomes of lead extraction done at OHSU.\n\nPatients who have undergone either pacemaker or defibrillator lead extraction will have their charts reviewed for the desired data, which will then be compiled into a database. All procedures will be part of routine clinical care.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nThis is an observational registry study; there are no primary or secondary outcomes. Data will be analyzed to determine patient and procedural characteristics, procedure indications, complications and outcomes"
