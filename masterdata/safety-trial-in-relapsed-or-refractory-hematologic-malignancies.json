            "briefSummary": "The drug that will be investigated in the study is an antibody, GEN3014. Since this is the first study of GEN3014 in humans, the main purpose is to evaluate safety. Besides safety, the study will determine the recommended GEN3014 dose to be tested in a larger group of participants and assess preliminary clinical activity of GEN3014. GEN3014 will be studied in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (also known as RRMM) and other blood cancers. The study consists of 3 parts:\n\n1. The Dose Escalation will test increasing doses of GEN3014 to find a safe dose level to be tested in the other two parts.\n2. Expansion Part A will further test the GEN3014 dose determined from the Dose Escalation Part.\n3. Expansion Part B will compare intravenous (IV) GEN3014 with the subcutaneous (SC) daratumumab in ex-US countries.\n\nParticipants will receive either GEN3014 or daratumumab; none will be given placebo. The study duration will be different for the individual participants. Overall, the study may be ongoing up to 5 years after the last participant's first treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This trial will be conducted in 3 parts: Dose Escalation (phase 1), Expansion Parts, A and B (phase 2).\n\nIn the dose escalation phase GEN314 will be evaluated in RRMM and relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML). The participants will receive GEN3014 administered at various dose levels in 28 day cycles. Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle and the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined.\n\nIn Expansion Part A, GEN3014 will be further evaluated in 4 cohorts: anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-naive RRMM, anti-CD38 mAb-refractory RRMM, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL), and R/R AML at the RP2D identified from the Dose Escalation per protocol. In Expansion Part B, GEN3014 IV will be compared to daratumumab SC, head-to-head (H2H) to evaluate whether GEN3014 may be more potent in anti-CD38 mAb-na\u00efve RRMM participants."
