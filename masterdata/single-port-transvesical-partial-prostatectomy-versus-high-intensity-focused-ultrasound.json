The Koelis software is utilized to fuse MRI and ultrasound images to identify the target lesion in real-time, allowing for intraoperative guidance. The ultrasound probe rotates automatically, allowing for localization of the tumor intraoperatively. Then depending on the area of the tumor, a Hemi or quadrant resection is completed while preserving the nerves, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. The urethrovesical anastomosis is then performed.",
