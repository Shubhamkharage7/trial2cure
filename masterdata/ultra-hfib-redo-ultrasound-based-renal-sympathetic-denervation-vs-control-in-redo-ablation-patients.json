The purpose of the study is to determine the role of adjunctive renal sympathetic denervation in the prevention of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) recurrence in patients with hypertension scheduled for a redo AF ablation procedure for paroxysmal or persistent AF. Patients will be randomized to either i) AF ablation (Control) or ii) AF ablation + renal sympathetic denervation (Intervention).",

Once the clinical sites are up and running (expected to take 6 months), accrual is expected to take an additional 9 months, and all patients will be followed for 12 months post randomization. Patients, the Clinical Events Committee and the ECG core lab will be blinded during the trial. Patients will be unblinded at the 12-month visit."
