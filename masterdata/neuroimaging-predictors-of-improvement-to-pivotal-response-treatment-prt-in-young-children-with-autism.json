The goal of this pilot investigation is to apply a biologically-based approach to identify predictors of treatment response in children with ASD who are receiving Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an evidence-based behavioral intervention. Specifically, the investigators propose to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of treatment response to a PRT program (PRT-P) targeting language deficits in young children with ASD who will be randomized to either PRT-P or to a delayed treatment group (DTG)."
