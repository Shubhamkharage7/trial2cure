Patients will be confirmed to have sufficient expression of Claudin 18.2 as part of a prescreening. The study comprises a dose-escalation component (Part A) and a dose-expansion component (Part B). In part A, patients with gastric, GEJ, or esophageal adenocarcinoma will be treated with LB1908 at protocol-defined dose level, with escalation to higher doses in subsequent patients guided by evaluation of protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Part A will identify the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) to be tested in part B in two cohorts: a gastric, GEJ and esophageal adenocarcinoma cohort as well as a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cohort. Part B will aim to identify the recommended dose for phase 2 (RP2D)."
