The main objective is to follow the progress of these wounds over time from initial visit to each follow-up visit.\n\nParticipants will be asked to wear Mepilex Up dressing for up to 6 weeks of treatment or until healed, changed at every one-week interval.",
            "detailedDescription": "This investigation is designed as a prospective, open, multi-center, interventional, non-comparative investigation with the aim to follow exuding chronic wound progression for 6 weeks according to local standard of care. Wound progress is a summary endpoint of the total effect of treatment using Mepilex Up as the absorbent dressing and includes the changes in an objectively measured wound area and subjectively evaluated wound condition. Two indications will be included: Venous Leg Ulcers (VLU) and Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU). A total of n=68 participants, approximately 34 per indication, will be recruited at up to 8 centers in the US.\n\nThere will be a total of seven (7) visits to the investigation site for participants during the treatment period: baseline, followed by weekly visits up to six (6) weeks post baseline. During visits, evaluations will be performed to assess wound progression and status, wound dressing properties, as well as Subject pain, comfort, and quality of life. Safety will be assessed at all visits. One target wound per participant will be included in this investigation."
