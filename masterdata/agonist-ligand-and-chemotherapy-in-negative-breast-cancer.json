            "briefSummary": "This research study is being done to find out if the immunotherapy drugs called CDX-301 and CDX-1140 in combination with the standard chemotherapy treatment pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, Doxil) are safe and effective at controlling the cancer in patients with metastatic triple Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer, and to determine a safe dose and treatment schedule of the three drugs. This research study will also test how your immune system responds to these treatments alone and in combination.",
            "detailedDescription": "The immunotherapy drugs CDX-301 and CDX-1140 in combination with the standard chemotherapy treatment PLD work by kickstarting the immune response against cancer cells. CDX-301 increases the antigen presenting immune cells needed to kickstart the immune response, CDX-1140 activates these cells, and chemotherapy helps release antigens from the cancer cells to train these antigen presenting immune cells to recognize the cancer for the immune system to attack it.\n\nMetastatic or unresectable triple negative breast cancer patients will receive this triplet combination that has been shown in preclinical studies to be more effective than the individual treatments or doublet combinations. To understand how the immunotherapies are working, some patients will receive the immunotherapy or chemotherapy only for one cycle prior to receiving the full triplet combination therapy. Ultimately, all patients will receive the triplet combination to study safety and how effective this treatment is at controlling triple negative breast cancer and improving survival outcomes.\n\nThe original design of the project includes 3 cohorts (arms). In February 2024 Cohort B (experimental arm) was closed to further enrollment.\n\nCohort B includes the following design:\n\nPLD chemotherapy will be administered 40 mg/m2 as intravenous injection once per cycle starting on cycle 2 until toxicity or progression.\n\nCDX-1140 will be administered 1.5mg/kg as intravenous injection once per cycle until toxicity or progression for up to 24 months.\n\nCDX-301 will be administered 75\u00b5g/kg as subcutaneous injection daily x 5 days cycles 1 and 2 only."

Brain MRI required on screening to document lack of progression.\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment.\n* Active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications within the preceding 6 months, except for patients with vitiligo, endocrinopathies, or type 1 diabetes, Patients with mild asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) who have not been hospitalized for asthma in the preceding 6 months will not be excluded from this study.\n* Significant cardiovascular disease including unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV or EF\\<50%) related to primary cardiac disease, uncontrolled ischemic or severe valvular heart disease or any of the following within 6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack.\n* Prior anthracycline therapy with a cumulative doxorubicin-equivalent dose greater than 240 mg/m2. 240 mg/m2 anthracycline is equivalent to 4 doses of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the localized setting (generally 60 mg/m2 per dose). Notes from physicians demonstrating 4 prior cycles/doses of anthracycline or if less than 60 mg/m2 specifying as such to estimate the total anthracycline dose is sufficient. Exact calculation based on mg received originally is not required.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. The COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are not live vaccines and are allowed if the final vaccine dose (of a regimen that requires more than 1 dose) is received at least 1 week prior to study enrollment.\n* History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis or has current pneumonitis. This includes asymptomatic infiltrates on screening chest CT scan that are felt by the investigator to potentially be an inflammatory process (i.e. grade 1 pneumonitis).\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy, known HIV infection, or positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C (antibody screen and if positive confirmed by RNA analysis). If positive results are not indicative of a true active or chronic infection, the patient can be enrolled after discussion with and agreement by the Investigator.\n* Any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that could increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration or could interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the trial.\n* Evidence of acute or chronic infection on screening chest radiography.",
