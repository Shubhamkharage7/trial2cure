            "briefSummary": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a severe and complex chronic pain condition in children. Many psychosocial factors impact its development and recovery. CRPS has a strong central component, which is reflected by structural and functional changes in the brain. However, the interaction between these cerebral changes and trajectory of recovery has been seldom investigated to date. Furthermore, interactions between cerebral changes and psychosocial factors, which might affect trajectory of recovery, are unknown. The aim of this study is to identify the psychosocial factors and cerebral changes that predict the trajectory of recovery from CRPS.\n\nChildren between the ages of 10 and 17 years will be enrolled with one of their parents or legal guardians for this study. Three populations will be recruited: patients with CRPS undergoing treatment at the Functional Independence Restoration Program (FIRST), patients with CRPS undergoing treatment at the Pain Management Center and matching healthy controls. Participants will undergo three sessions: the first session will be scheduled immediately before or as soon as possible at the beginning of the patients' treatment; the second session will take place at the end of the patients' treatment; the last session will be scheduled six months post-treatment. The timing of the sessions of the healthy participants will follow a schedule similar to the FIRST patients. Each session will last approximately three hours and include acquisition of psychosocial, psychophysical, and brain imaging data in the child participants, as well as acquisition of psychosocial data in the parent participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a basic science investigation of potential psychosocial, sensory, and brain markers predicting trajectory of short-term and long-term recovery in pediatric CRPS following both inpatient and outpatient treatment.\n\nThe usual inpatient treatment lasts on average three weeks and includes physical, occupational, and recreational therapy, as well as psychotherapy, while patients keep their regular pharmacological treatment. The usual outpatient treatment lasts on average several months and includes physical therapy and psychotherapy, in addition to pharmacotherapy. For both inpatients and outpatients, the primary anti-neuropathic pharmacotherapy typically includes gabapentin, pregabalin, or amitriptyline, or, less frequently, duloxetine. It is important to note that this study is not designed to investigate the efficacy of treatment per se, instead it aims to predict trajectory during the course of treatment as usual. This study is primarily mechanistic and does not include any intervention or modification of treatments. Therefore, patients, who are scheduled for regular inpatient or outpatient treatment of CRPS, are free to refuse to enroll without any consequences for the scheduled treatment.\n\nThe investigated markers will be assessed in patients undergoing inpatient or outpatient treatments. To define potentially relevant markers, measurements in patients will be compared to the same measurements in healthy children. For this purpose, participants will undergo a testing session just before the beginning of their treatment or as close as possible from the beginning of their treatment.\n\nTo establish the influence of potential markers on short-term recovery, patients will undergo an additional session upon completion of their treatment. To investigate the effect of the previously defined markers on long-term recovery, patients will complete a third session at six months after treatment. For comparison purposes, healthy control children will undergo sessions following the same schedule as the patients. To assess the association between symptoms of CRPS in children and social environment, at least one parent of each enrolled child will be asked to complete three sessions following the same schedule as their child.\n\nEach testing session will include self-reported questionnaires for the children and their parents and a brain imaging session for the children."
