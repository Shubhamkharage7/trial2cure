Pre-blood is drawn right before the patients eat the meal, then post-blood will be drawn every 15 minutes for the first hour after completion of the meal, then every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours (total of 4 hours).\n* Then patients will be sent home with the skin patch and study mobile device.\n\nCommunity 7-day observation period:\n\n* Patients will be asked to apply a study patch each morning before their first meal of the day. The patch should be removed at the end of the day and put under water.\n* The study device will monitor the patient's UA, glucose, heart rate, blood pressure, daily steps, and sleep. Patients will be asked to enter before and after meal uric acid levels and may be asked to take a picture of their meals using the study mobile device."
