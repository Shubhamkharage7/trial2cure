Neck morbidity after radiation therapy and surgery includes difficulty swallowing, neck or shoulder pain, stiffness, swelling, or changes to the appearance of the treated area. In addition, the researchers will find out whether the study procedure is effective at reducing neck morbidity and improving quality of life after cancer treatment. The researchers will measure quality of life by having participants answer questionnaires."
