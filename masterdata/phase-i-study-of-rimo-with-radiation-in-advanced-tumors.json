A single escalation dose of RiMO-301 is intratumorally injected in a 3 + 3 study design to identify the recommended dose and dosing volumes.\n\nCondition or Disease:\n\nPatient with advanced tumor which is clinically accessible for intratumoral injection\n\nIntervention/Treatment:\n\nDrug - RiMO-301\n\nRadiation - Radiotherapy\n\nPhase:\n\nPhase 1",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objectives:\n\n\u2022 The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RiMO-301 as determined by toxicity observed in patients treated with palliative radiation doses\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To determine clinical response after RiMO-301 and radiotherapy as assessed by clinical response rate using clinical evaluation, imaging and/or symptom relief\n* To characterize adverse events of RiMO-301 in patients with advanced cancers\n* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RiMO-301 with radiation\n\nThe target population is patients with clinically accessible lesions for intratumoral injection. Up to 3 dose levels (5%, 10%, and 15% of the total baseline tumor volume, respectively) will be tested in a 3 + 3 dose escalation study design. MTD will be defined as the dose associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at the dose level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events occurring from the intratumor injection of RiMO-301 to 30 days after the completion of radiation treatment:\n\n* Grade 4 or greater treatment related hematologic or dermatologic toxicity\n* Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting or diarrhea without maximal medical intervention)"
