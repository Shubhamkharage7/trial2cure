HER2+ overexpression (3+ immunohistochemistry \\[IHC\\]) by an FDA-approved HER2 IHC test following the package insert's interpretational manual for gastric cancer\n  2. HER2 2+ IHC is eligible if the tumor is amplified by an FDA-approved HER2 in situ hybridization assay (FISH or chromogenic in situ hybridization \\[CISH\\]) following the package insert's interpretational manual for gastric cancer\n  3. HER2 (ERBB2) amplification by CLIA-certified Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) sequencing assay.\n* Tumor specimen that demonstrates intact mismatch repair enzymes by immunohistochemistry or microsatellite stability as demonstrated by NGS or PCR.\n* Tumor specimen that indicates RAS wild-type based on expanded RAS testing including KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146)\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction \\>=50 assessed by echocardiography\n* Negative pregnancy test done within 14 days prior to beginning treatment, for women of childbearing potential only. Subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception. Appropriate methods of birth control include abstinence, oral contraceptives, implantable hormonal contraceptives, or double barrier method (diaphragm plus condom). Contraception is required for the course of the study starting with the first dose of study medication through 150 days after the last dose of study medication.

Patients on warfarin may be included on a stable dose with a therapeutic INR \\<3.5\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Recurrent rectal cancer.\n* Prior pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery for rectal cancer.\n* Tumor is causing symptomatic bowel obstruction (patients who have a temporary diverting ostomy are eligible).\n* Other invasive malignancy \u2264 5 years prior to registration. Exceptions are non-melanoma skin cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy and in situ cervical carcinoma.\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Other Anticancer or Experimental Therapy. No other experimental therapies (including chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal treatment, antibody therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, thalidomide, anti-VEGF/Flk-1 monoclonal antibody or other experimental drugs) of any kind are permitted while the patient is receiving study treatment.\n* Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies)\n* Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HbsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected).\n* Any known chronic (non-transient) liver disease in the patient's past medical history such as (but not limited to) cirrhosis, NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) or NAFLD.\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or men expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening visit through 150 days after the last dose of study medication.\n* Concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease which, in the investigator's judgement, would make them inappropriate candidates for entry into the study. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days) myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n* Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study medication.\n* Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Inability to swallow pills or any significant gastrointestinal disease which would preclude the adequate oral absorption of medications\n* Use of a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C8 inhibitor that is not adequately cleared (five half-lives of elapsed time) before study initiation. In addition, use of a strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducer that is taken within 5 days prior to the first dose of study will also be an exclusion criteria.",
