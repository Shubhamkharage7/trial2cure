            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, phase Ib study of oral Inqov-decitabine/cedazuridine, given as maintenance therapy following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients with myeloid neoplasms\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Inqovi for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) relapse but it has not been investigated in the post-transplant setting.\n\nInqovi is made up of the two study drugs decitabine and cedazuridine. Decitabine is believed to work by stopping cancer cells from growing and spreading. Cedazuridine is believed to work by slowing down how quickly the body breaks down decitabine, which normally breaks down too quickly to be effective.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment, including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nAs the study is looking for the highest dose of Inqovi that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects not everyone will receive the same dose of the study drug. Dosage will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before and how well they have tolerated their doses.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for up to 12 months and will be followed for up to 24 months after starting the study drug.\n\nIt is expected that about 22 people will take part in this research study.\n\nTaiho Oncology, Inc., a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the study, including the study drug."
