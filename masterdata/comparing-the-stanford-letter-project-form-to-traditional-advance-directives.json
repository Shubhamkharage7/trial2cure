Only after they read the consent and click on the participation link will they be able to enter the study.Those who are willing to participate will be randomly assigned to either the letter or traditional advance directives in Spanish and study measures. They will also answer questions as to how much they liked and understood the documents.\n\nStep 4: The investigators will collect data until the investigators reach an n=1000\n\nStep 5: The investigators will analyze the results and submit for publication.\n\nIn this protocol, we are assessing whether patients prefer the traditional advance directives or the letter directive. As it is just an questionnaire based study, there no risk for patients."
