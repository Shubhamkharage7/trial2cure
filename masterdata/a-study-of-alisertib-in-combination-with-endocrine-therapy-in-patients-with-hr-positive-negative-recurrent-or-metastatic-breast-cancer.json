This study is intended to evaluate the optimal alisertib dose administered in combination with the selected endocrine therapy. The study is also planned to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of alisertib in combination with endocrine and to identify the biomarker-defined subgroup(s) that may benefit most from combined alisertib and endocrine therapy."
