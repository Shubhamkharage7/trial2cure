            "briefSummary": "This Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study follows a 3+3 ascending dose escalation design to determine the MTD/RP2D and to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, and antitumor effects of LNS8801 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The study will include a dose escalation phase, a dose expansion phase, and phase 2A cohorts. Up to 200 patients will be accrued for this study. Up to 15 study sites in the United States will participate in the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "In this Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open-label, multi-center study. Dose escalation cohorts enrolled at least 3 patients in accordance with a traditional dose escalation 3+3 design, and the study will determine the MTD/RP2D of LNS8801. LNS8801 will be administered orally 3 days/week or once or twice a day during 21 day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.\n\nSafety assessments will be performed on all patients at screening, throughout their participation in the study, and for 30 days (90 days in combination cohorts) following the last dose of study drug. Throughout the study, imaging of tumors for evidence of tumor response and/or progression will be performed; biopsies will be performed on accessible lesions.\n\nAfter the RP2D of LNS8801 is identified and the safety of dosing LNS8801 with pembrolizumab has been established, expansion cohorts and Phase 2A cohorts will open. Any 2 dose escalation cohorts may be expanded to 8 to 10 patients to include additional patients to further explore PK and PD.\n\nPhase 1B expansion cohorts include a monotherapy cohort (LNS8801 alone) of melanoma patients (not uveal) who are now not eligible for additional anti-PD-1 therapy in the judgement of the investigator because of prior severe immune related adverse events and a combination therapy (LNS8801 + pembrolizumab) cohort in anti-PD-1/L1 refractory advanced cancer patients who have previously had clinical benefit on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy alone or in combination (complete response or partial response of any duration, or confirmed stable disease for at least 16 weeks) but have since relapsed and not had an intervening cytotoxic chemotherapy. Up to 28 evaluable patients may be studied in each cohort.\n\nThe study will also include the following 8 Phase 2A cohorts.\n\nMonotherapy with 125 mg LNS8801 PO:\n\nCOHORT M2: 20 evaluable patients with no remaining SOC therapies with pancreatic, gastric, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or colorectal cancers.\n\nCOHORT M3: 10 evaluable patients with no remaining SOC therapies with advanced malignant cutaneous melanoma having received as their immediate prior line of therapy a PD-1/L1 targeted immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO), alone or in combination, and who are now not eligible for anti-PD-1 treatment in the judgement of the Investigator due to prior severe immune related adverse events.\n\nCOHORT M4: 10 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies and no remaining SOC therapies, other than cutaneous melanoma, having received as their immediate prior line of therapy a PD-1/L1 targeted immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO), alone or in combination, and having been forced to discontinue IO therapy due to an immune-related adverse event (irAE).\n\nCOHORT M5: 10 evaluable patients with metastatic uveal melanoma and no remaining SOC therapies that have 2 or fewer prior lines of systemic therapy.\n\nCombination therapy cohorts treated with 125 mg LNS8801 daily PO + 200 mg Q3W Pembrolizumab IV:\n\nCOHORT C2: 20 evaluable patients with no remaining SOC therapies with pancreatic, gastric, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or colorectal cancers.\n\nCOHORT C3: 10 evaluable patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 (Tumor Proportion Score \\[TPS\\] \u22651% and \u226449%) as determined by an FDA-approved test will be treated with the combination of LNS8801 plus pembrolizumab. Eligible patients must either have no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations or have not demonstrated disease response on or following FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with those criteria specified above.\n\nCOHORT C5: 10 evaluable patients with metastatic uveal melanoma and no remaining SOC therapies that have 2 or fewer prior lines of systemic therapy.\n\nCOHORT C6: 10 evaluable patients with advanced malignant cutaneous melanoma and no remaining SOC therapies.\n\nUp to 200 patients will be accrued for this study at up to 15 study sites in the United States."

Highly effective contraception is defined as a method of contraception that has a \\<1% failure rate when used consistently and correctly (as defined by the International Council for Harmonization Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Research M3 \\[R2\\]). These methods include implants, injectables, combined hormonal contraceptives (eg, combined oral contraceptives \\[excluding estrogen-based contraceptives\\], patch, and vaginal ring), some intrauterine devices (IUDs) (eg, IUD or intrauterine system), sexual abstinence, or a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner.\n\n    a. True abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug (ie, 60 days after discontinuing study drug or 5 times the terminal elimination half-life, whichever is longer). Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n14.

Except in anti-PD-1/L1 refractory cohorts, where patients may start LNS8801 therapy at what would be the beginning of the next cycle of their immunotherapy cycle (eg, LNS8801 may be dosed 3 or 6 weeks after the last dose of pembrolizumab depending on cycle, or 4 weeks after nivolumab) if that is shorter.\n4. Has unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy. Anticancer therapy toxicities are defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 \u2264 Grade 1, or baseline (participants with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible).\n\n   * Note: Patients in an LNS8801/pembrolizumab combination cohort must not have undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within the last 5 years. (Participants who have had a transplant greater than 5 years ago are eligible as long as there are no symptoms of acute graft versus host disease \\[GVHD\\])\n5. Patients must not be participating in another study of an investigational agent or have used an investigational device within 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug.\n\n   Note: Patients who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n6. Has a symptomatic primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor, symptomatic CNS metastases, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, or untreated spinal cord compression.\n\n   Note: Patients are eligible if neurologic symptoms and CNS imaging are stable and steroid dose is stable for 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug and no CNS surgery or radiation has been performed for 28 days (14 days if stereotactic radiosurgery).\n\n   a. In a LNS8801/pembrolizumab combination cohorts, has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n7. Requires the use of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies, such as infliximab, or has received treatment with anti-TNF therapies within 5 half-lives of that therapy.\n8. Has an active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of disease-modifying antirheumatic agents or immunosuppressive drugs).\n\n   Note: Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal, thyroid, or pituitary insufficiency) is permitted.\n9. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency, is on immunosuppressive therapy, or is receiving chronic systemic or enteric steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n\n   Note: At screening, patients may be using systemic corticosteroids (dose 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) or topical or inhaled corticosteroids.\n10. Is receiving any other investigational agent(s) or has received an investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, of the first dose of study drug.\n11. Has had major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks prior to the planned start of LNS8801.\n12. Has had radiotherapy with a limited field for palliation (less than 2 weeks) within 1 week of the first dose of study drug to non-CNS disease, with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation, which must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis.\n13. Has evidence of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.\n\n    a. For pembrolizumab combination cohorts, has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis\n14. Has any of the following known infections:\n\n    1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (ie, hepatitis B surface antigen-positive), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) (ie, detectable HCV ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\]).\n\n       Note: Patients with a prior history of treated HBV infection who are antigen-negative or patients with a prior history of treated HCV infection who are HCV RNA-undetectable may be enrolled.\n    2. Active infections requiring systemic therapy (including asymptomatic infections with positive virus titers and the Investigator's judgment that worsening of the condition is likely with study drug or the condition would impair or prohibit a patient's participation in the study).\n15. Has active malabsorption syndrome or other condition likely to affect gastrointestinal absorption of the study drug.\n16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of the planned start of study drug.\n17. Has a corrected QT interval (QTc) by Fridericia method \\>450 msec for male patients or \\>470 msec for female patients, or a history or risk factors for or use of medications known to prolong the QTc or that may be associated with torsades de pointes.\n\n    Note: Isolated right bundle branch block and incomplete right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock are acceptable.\n18. Has had any prior treatment for the present solid malignancy with GPER agonists (eg, tamoxifen, raloxifene, or estrogen hormone replacement therapy). History of oral contraceptive use is permissible.\n19. Is using a strong inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4.\n20. Requires treatment with a proton pump inhibitor.\n21. Has received estrogen treatment since cancer diagnosis or the presumed initiation of their cancer, including estrogen-based contraceptives.\n22. Has a cancer that was treated with estrogen hormone therapy.\n23. Is currently using estrogen hormone replacement therapy, was diagnosed while on estrogen hormone replacement therapy, or has used estrogen replacement therapy since diagnosis.\n24. Is pregnant, lactating, has been pregnant within the last 2 years, or is planning to attempt to become pregnant or impregnate someone during this study or within 90 days after dosing of study drug (120 days for LNS8801/pembrolizumab combination cohorts).\n25. Has a history of another active malignancy (a second cancer) within the previous 2 years except for localized cancers that are not related to the current cancer being treated, are considered cured, and, in the opinion of the Investigator, presents a low risk of recurrence. These exceptions include, but are not limited to, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.\n26. Has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n27. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n28. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study in the medical judgement of the investigator.\n29. Has received radiation therapy to the lung that is \\>30 Gy within 6 months of the first dose of trial treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n30. In the LNS8801/pembrolizumab combination cohorts, has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137), and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher irAE.\n31.
