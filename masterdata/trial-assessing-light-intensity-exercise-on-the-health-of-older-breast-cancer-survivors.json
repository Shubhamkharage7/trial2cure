            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will recruit 56 obese, older adult breast cancer survivors at least 1 year, and up to 10 years post-breast cancer treatment, and randomize them to either a 15 week light-intensity physical activity intervention, or usual care group.\n\nIntervention: The participants will receive weekly support calls, and instructed to increase their light-intensity physical activity, to achieve at least 150 minutes per week. The frequency, intensity, time, and type of physical activity will be modified to maximize adherence and compliance. The support calls developed for this trial target older adults' capabilities, opportunities, and motivations for physical activity."
