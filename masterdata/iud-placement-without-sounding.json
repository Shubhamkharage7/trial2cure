            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a uterine sound sparing technique for levonorgestrel 52 mg intrauterine device (IUD) placement. This study will be conducted in three phases. In phase one, the IUD will be placed in standard fashion with a uterine sound to obtain baseline data. Phase two and three are interventional phases that will investigate IUD placement without the use of a uterine sound. In phase two, the IUD will be placed without the use of a uterine sound, but under abdominal ultrasound guidance. In phase three, the IUD will be placed without the use of a uterine sound and without ultrasound guidance. An ultrasound exam will be completed at the end of phase two and three to determine if the IUD was successful placed. To answer the secondary objectives, for all study phases the investigators will measure the procedure time, the participant-reported maximum pain during and 5-minutes post placement and the provider assessment of ease of placement. To determine the exploratory objective of IUD expulsion and perforation rate for a uterine sound sparing IUD placement technique, participants in phases two and three will complete a 30-day phone follow up and 90-day in clinic follow up to evaluate for IUD expulsion or perforation. The investigators hypothesize that the levonorgestrel 52 mg IUD can successfully be inserted without uterine sounding."
