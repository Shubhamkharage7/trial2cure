            "detailedDescription": "SENTINEL VIV-TAVR is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, unblinded pilot trial. A total of 20 subjects with severe symptomatic bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration, who are deemed to be at high or prohibitive mortality risk related to surgical aortic valve replacement, and are undergoing VIV-TAVR and BVF, will be enrolled at the Mid-America Heart Institute, St-Luke's Hospital of Kansas City. Subjects will initially have an aortic arch angiogram done to confirm appropriate anatomy, followed by the SENTINEL device implanted through right radial artery approach. After that, patients will undergo VIV TAVR, using a commercially available transcatheter heart valve, followed by bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF) as indicated."
