Information from this study may help evaluate the effectiveness of using technology to help improve patient care by recording consultation recommendations.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the patient's perception of the usefulness of the audio recording in helping to recall information given to him/her in the visit along with the perception of usefulness in the dissemination of information to family member(s) and/or caregiver(s) not present at the clinic visit.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the number of times the recording is listened to. II. To assess the ease of use of the technology. III. To assess the ability to share the information with the patient's family member(s) and/or caregiver(s) if he or she chooses to do so.\n\nIV. To assess the patient perception of whether the audio recording caused any disruption to the clinic.\n\nV. To estimate the participation rate of patients. VI. To explore association between patient's perception of the usefulness of the audio recording and patient's demographic/clinical characteristics.\n\nVII. To explore the association between age and sex of the caregiver and frequency of caregiver's use of the audio recording.\n\nVIII. To explore the association of the ease of use of the technology and the type of device and application used.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients audio record the recommendations and instructions given to them by the doctor record as part of their clinic visit at the Supportive Care Center."
