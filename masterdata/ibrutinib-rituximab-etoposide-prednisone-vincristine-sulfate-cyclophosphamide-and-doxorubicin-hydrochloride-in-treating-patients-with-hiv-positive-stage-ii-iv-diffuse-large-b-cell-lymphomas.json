            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effect and best dose of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive stage II-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ibrutinib and etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with HIV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib and rituximab (R)-dose adjusted (da)-etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (EPOCH) in participants with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphomas (ARL).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rates of ARL to ibrutinib and R-da-EPOCH.\n\nII. To measure the 1-year and 2-year overall and progression-free survival of participants with ARL treated with combination ibrutinib and R-da-EPOCH, including preliminary comparison of non-germinal center B-cell (GCB) with historical controls treated with R-da-EPOCH.\n\nIII. To categorize and compare the cell-of-origin by gene expression profiling (GEP) gene expression-based classification (GCB, activated B-cell-like, unclassifiable) to immunohistochemistry (IHC) classification (GCB, non-GCB), estimate the discordant classification, and correlate each biological classification (IHC and GEP) with treatment response rates and survival.\n\nIV. To calculate the percentage of participants who receive two or more cycles of R-da-EPOCH, and are able to continue on a minimum dose level of cyclophosphamide of -1 and above after dose adjustments for hematologic toxicities.\n\nV. To determine the average number of days per cycle participants are able to stay on planned dose of ibrutinib at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).\n\nVI. To assess the effect of ibrutinib and R-da-EPOCH on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long-term latency reservoir.\n\nVII. To assess the effect and degree of ibrutinib and R-da-EPOCH on T-cell receptor signaling via ITK inhibition.\n\nVIII. To assess the effect of ibrutinib and R-da-EPOCH on B-cell receptor signaling pathway including BTK activity in ARL.\n\nIX. To evaluate the soluble cytokine response to ibrutinib and R-da-EPOCH. X. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine in the presence of ibrutinib, and vice versa, and assess the clinical relevance of any drug-drug interaction and correlate with pharmacodynamics outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ibrutinib.\n\nPatients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 (for CD20 positive patients only), etoposide IV over 96 hours on days 1-4, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 96 hours on days 1-4, vincristine sulfate IV over 96 hours on days 1-4, prednisone orally (PO) daily on days 1-5, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 5, and ibrutinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) from 1 calendar day up to 48 hours or filgrastim SC beginning on day 6 for up to 10 days until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is satisfactory.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years."
