            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects of survivin long peptide vaccine and how it works with the immune system in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Tumor cells make proteins that are not usually produced by normal cells. The body sees these proteins as not belonging and sends white blood cells called T cells to attack the tumor cells that contain these proteins. By vaccinating with small pieces of these proteins called peptides, the immune system can be made to kill tumor cells. Giving survivin long peptide vaccine to patients who have survivin expression in their tumors may create an immune response in the blood that is directed against neuroendocrine tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess safety, tolerability and toxicity of SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine (SurVaxM) in emulsion with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (montanide ISA 51) and given subcutaneously with sargramostim (granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor \\[GM-CSF\\]) in combination with a somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate (Sandostatin LAR) in patients with survivin positive metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine clinical benefit (including complete response, partial response and stable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] version \\[v\\]1.1) at 6 months, 9 months and 12 months from study entry.\n\nII. To evaluate the immunogenicity of SurVaxM in NETs by measuring anti-survivin antibody levels and anti-tumor T-cell responses in peripheral blood.\n\nIII. To determine time to progression (TTP) compared to prior to study entry, in patients with metastatic NETs treated with SurVaxM.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore immune markers associated with clinical responses to SurVaxM in peripheral blood of NETs patients.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive a SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously (SC) and sargramostim SC on day 0. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 0. Cycles of octreotide acetate repeat every 28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who remain free of tumor progression at 6 months and do not develop any regimen-related toxicity or serious adverse events will be eligible to receive additional doses of the vaccine and sargramostim every 3 months, for up to 1 year from the start of treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months."

For subjects who received local therapy prior to randomization, there must be documented growth of measurable disease within the embolization field prior to study.\n* Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.\n* Systemic corticosteroid therapy \\> 2 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent per day at study entry.\n* Any condition which in the investigator's opinion deems the participant an unsuitable candidate to receive study drug.\n* Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment.\n* Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, bradycardia, tachycardia that would compromise patient safety or the outcome of the study.",
