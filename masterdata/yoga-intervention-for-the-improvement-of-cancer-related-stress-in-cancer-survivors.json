The online hatha yoga intervention of breathing and movement incorporates both restorative poses, breathing techniques, guided meditation and may reduce stress levels and improve overall quality of health in cancer survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To develop and test the feasibility of a standardized 12-week online hatha yoga intervention (n=30) of breathing and movement incorporating both restorative poses, breathing techniques, guided meditation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the yoga intervention in relation to self-reported levels of stress and quality of life in cancer survivors (n=30).\n\nII. Feasibility of collecting blood and saliva at baseline and post-intervention for stress biomarkers, including cortisol and norepinephrine.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine how behavior change, quality of life (QoL), and biomarkers of adrenergic stress, inflammation, and immunosuppression are affected by a 12-week online yoga program completed by cancer survivors.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive online yoga intervention once a week (QW) for 12 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months."
