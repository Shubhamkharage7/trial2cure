Dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts will be enrolled to evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, and further define a RP2D. The total length of the study, from screening of the first participant to the end of the study, is expected to be approximately 60 months.",

The escalation stage will investigate single agent IGM-2644 safety and tolerability in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The dose expansion cohort(s) will further evaluate safety, PK/PD, and preliminary efficacy of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).\n\nIGM-2644 will be administered intravenously (IV)."
