            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate whether a positive psychology intervention (PATH-C) can improve psychological well-being, quality of life, and physical activity in caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).",
            "detailedDescription": "Family and friend caregivers are vital care providers throughout the entire care continuum for patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These caregivers must manage multiple time-consuming responsibilities, including monitoring vital signs and side effects of treatment, administering medications, and coordinating transportation to and from medical appointments. The substantial caregiving burden among caregivers of patients undergoing HSCT is associated with increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Symptoms such as fatigue and depression in HSCT caregivers may undermine attempts to maintain regular physical activity routines, which may impact essential health outcomes such as cardiovascular health.\n\nWith persistent shortages in the mental health workforce needed to address these psychological needs of HSCT caregivers adequately, remotely-delivered psychosocial interventions offer an innovative approach to overcome the unmet psychological needs of this population. Hence, the investigators developed a remotely-delivered positive psychology intervention, Positive Affect in the Transplantation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells for Caregivers (PATH-C), tailored to the unique psychological needs of HSCT caregivers. With this study, the investigators will establish the impact of PATH-C on participant-reported outcomes compared to usual care.\n\nThe study will use validated questionnaires to measure caregivers' quality of life, caregiver burden, psychological distress symptoms, positive psychological well-being (e.g., positive affect, gratitude), and self-management targets (e.g., coping, self-efficacy). The study will also use the validated ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer to measure minutes/day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, light activity, and sedentary leisure time."
