            "briefSummary": "Study Description:\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs predominantly in women and is driven by type I interferon dysregulation and neutrophil hyperresponsiveness. Neutrophils in females have reduced mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity which affects immunometabolism. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ boosting with nicotinamide riboside blunts type 1 IFN activation in-vivo in monocytes of healthy subjects and ex-vivo in SLE subjects. These findings support the proposal of the hypothesis that NAD+ boosting by NR supplementation will modulate metabolic pathways in lupus and blunt type 1 interferon signaling. Moreover, as type 1 interferon drives endothelial dysfunction, linked to increased cardiovascular risk, the effect of NR on endothelial function will be examined.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: Evaluate the effect of NR vs. placebo on immunometabolic and inflammatory remodeling in female SLE subjects:\n\nExploratory Objective: Compare and characterize myeloid cell bioenergetic and immunometabolic profiles in healthy control and SLE female subjects\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nThe primary end point will be to assess the effect of NR on blunting type I IFN signaling by measuring monocytic secretion of IFN-beta secretion compared to baseline in response to placebo vs. NR supplemented in SLE study subjects.\n\nExploratory Endpoints:\n\nHealthy control vs. SLE subjects:\n\n* Compare type I IFN transcript profiles in monocytes and neutrophils at baseline and in response to activation.\n* Assess cell bioenergetics including: 1) monocyte and neutrophil metabolic flux mass spectroscopy of 13C-glucose and 13Cglutamine analysis to investigate their metabolic fates; (iii) Mitochondrial oxygen consumption (using glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid substrates) and glycolysis rates.\n\nSLE baseline vs. NR/placebo supplementation:\n\nBaseline vs. 6 weeks of NR/placebo:\n\n-Assess effect of NR on bioenergetics by measuring steady-state metabolite levels comparing changes in placebo vs. NR groups in monocytes and neutrophils.\n\nBaseline vs. 12 weeks of NR/placebo:\n\n* Whole blood NAD+ levels (batched and measured at the end of study enrollment period)\n* Explore effects of NR on gene regulation using monocyte and neutrophils by RNA-seq and chromatin remodeling analysis.\n* Determine the effect of NR vs placebo on endothelial dysfunction in SLE subjects",
