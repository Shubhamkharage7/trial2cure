One group will see their child's primary care provider to talk about healthy lifestyles for 6 months.\n\nThe other group will be in our Healthy Lifestyle program for 6 months. This will include:\n\n* Check-ins with lifestyle specialists and community health workers,\n* A mobile app to help support a healthy lifestyle, and\n* Access to community programs and activities.\n\nThe main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n* Do children in the Healthy Lifestyle program have better weight outcomes?\n* Do more families in the Healthy Lifestyle program stay in the study?\n* Does the Healthy Lifestyle program work better for families from certain communities?"
