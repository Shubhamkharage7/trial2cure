            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this basic research study is to determine the contribution of endogenous ascorbic acid (AA)turnover to urinary oxalate excretion in both normal BMI and obese adult non-stone formers and calcium oxalate stone formers. The studies proposed will use diets of known nutrient composition, a stable isotope of AA, 13C6-AA, and mass spectrometric techniques to quantify AA turnover to oxalate.\n\nAdults (\u226519 years) with and without a history of calcium oxalate kidney stone disease will be recruited from within the greater Birmingham area, and divided into normal BMI (BMI\\<25 kg/m2) and obese (BMI\u226530 kg/m2) groups. Following consent, subjects will meet with a dietitian to ensure willingness to consume controlled diets, and provide fasted blood and 2 x 24 hour urine specimens to determine general health status and adequacy of 24-hour urine collections, respectively.\n\nEligible subjects will consume a low oxalate controlled diet for 6 days, which will involve 2 days of dietary equilibration followed by oral ingestion of 1 mg/kg carbon-13 AA with breakfast on day 3 and subsequent collection of 4 consecutive 24-hour urine specimens. After the carbon-13 AA load, subjects will return each morning to the Clinical Research Unit for a fasted blood draw, to drop off their 24-hour urine collection, and receive their prepared food. In addition, on day 4, 24 hours after ingesting carbon-13 AA, subjects will collect hourly urine and 1/2 hourly blood samples for 5 hours in the Clinical Research Unit."
