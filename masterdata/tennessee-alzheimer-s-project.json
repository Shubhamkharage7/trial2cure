            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of the Vanderbilt Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (VADRC) is to provide local and national researchers with access to a well-characterized and diverse clinical cohort, including participant referrals, biosamples, clinical data, and neuroimaging data. The VADRC Clinical Core will create an infrastructure to support research efforts of both local and national investigator studies to develop early detection, prevention, and treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. The Clinical Core intends to enroll up to 1000 participants, including individuals who are cognitively unimpaired, have mild cognitive impairment, or have Alzheimer's disease. This cohort of about 1000 participants will be called the Tennessee Alzheimer's Project. Participants will be seen annually for comprehensive clinical characterization and then referred to other studies to enhance Alzheimer's disease research activities.",
            "detailedDescription": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health crisis affecting 5.8 million Americans. With the aging population, AD prevalence is expected to double by 2040. Successful AD prevention and effective therapies require distilling complexities of the disease to better model disease onset, progression, and treatment response. The purpose of the Vanderbilt Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (VADRC) is to provide a better understanding of AD and related dementias, and to serve as the institutional hub of clinical, research, and educational initiatives in AD. The Center will play an essential role in expanding AD discoveries and reducing the burden of AD locally and nationally. To do so, the VADRC will support multiple human studies and model systems research over the coming years. For the Tennessee Alzheimer's Project, the team will establish, phenotype, and annually follow a cohort of adults age 60 and older with and without memory problems. Phenotyping will include standardized protocols implemented across the entire national ADRC network as part of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center as well as protocols specific to our local site, including (but not limited to) venous blood draw, questionnaires, physical examination, echocardiogram, neuropsychological assessment, multi-modal neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid acquisition via lumbar puncture. As part of the Center's autopsy program, the investigators will ask all Tennessee Alzheimer's Project participants to consider post-mortem donation of their brain, eyes, and a small skin sample. While fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers exist for some neuropathologies associated with AD and related dementias, postmortem characterization is the only current way to definitively confirm the presence and severity of disease. Locally, a robust tissue bank with excellent ante-mortem phenotyping will provide invaluable tissue for analyses distilling the complexities of AD."
