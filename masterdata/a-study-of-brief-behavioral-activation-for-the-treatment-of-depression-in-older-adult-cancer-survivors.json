Respondents rate each item on a four-point scale (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3=nearly every day). Its reliability and validity have been established in diverse general and medical populations. Total scores range from 0-27; In outpatient cancer settings, psychometric research suggests that a score of \u22658 indicates clinically significant depressive symptoms and should be used as a clinical cut-off .",
