            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the research study is to trial a smart phone application, the GUIDE App, to better understand its impact on social connectedness, personal growth and mental health/wellness among first responders, soldiers, and veterans. The research team will also investigate workplace metrics (e.g., engagement and burnout), implementation outcomes and technical merit. The investigators plan to run a three-armed randomized waitlist pilot feasibility trial with up to 150 participants.",
            "detailedDescription": "There is an urgent need to address mental wellbeing, isolation, and burnout among first responders, military personnel and veterans. Research shows that these groups are at a greater risk for suicide, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the general civilian population, and that their occupations make them more likely to feel isolation and burnout. Despite these risks, first responders, soldiers and veterans tend not to seek help due to stigma, time burden and other barriers to entry. The GUIDE App was designed with this population in mind. The lessons and exercises take only minutes to complete, and the group chats are anonymous, so users can share their thoughts with likeminded peers, without the stigma. In a 4-week pilot study with 16 participants from the Wilkes Barre Police Department, the GUIDE App showed promising results in promoting wellbeing, reducing anxiety and encouraging personal growth. This clinical trial builds off the pilot study. The investigators will use a three-armed randomized waitlist pilot feasibility trial with 150 participants (first responders, soldiers, and veterans) to test whether use of the GUIDE App will lead to increased social connectedness, personal growth, and mental health/wellbeing; and whether these outcomes will in turn increase work engagement and reduce burnout. The investigators will also investigate implementation outcomes (e.g., the feasibility of using the app) and technical merit (e.g., how user-friendly the app is)."
