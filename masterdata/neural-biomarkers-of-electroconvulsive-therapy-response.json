Our study will recruit patients who are beginning treatment with bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (N=75). Our design will be longitudinal where patients will be followed up until their 8th week electroconvulsive therapy clinically. The primary measure of interest will be the slope of clinical change estimated with mixed effect modeling (see Approach). Secondary measures will be the cognitive performance change between baseline and the 8th week electroconvulsive therapy time point."
