            "briefSummary": "The ICONICC Study is a randomized controlled clinical trial designed to compare the proportion of successful treatment outcomes between children assigned to standard concussion care only, standard concussion care plus simple convergence procedures, or standard concussion care plus office-based vergence/accommodative therapy in children aged 11 to 17 years with symptomatic post-concussion syndrome. Children with post-concussion syndrome (4-12 weeks post-concussion injury) and symptomatic CI will be randomized to a 12-week treatment program of either standard concussion care (SC), SC plus simple convergence procedures (SC+), or SC plus office-based vergence/accommodative therapy SC+OBVAT (1:1:1 ratio).\n\nThe study will also compare the effect of treatment on clinical measures of both accommodation and vergence, symptom level/burden, health-related quality of life, clinical measures of saccadic eye movement, and objective eye movement measurements of disparity vergence, saccadic function, and accommodative function. The attainment of objective eye movement measures provides an opportunity to understand the underlying neurophysiology of the vergence and accommodative systems. Objective eye movement recordings are powerful because of the rich foundation from primate single-cell recordings that show a direct correlation with vergence and accommodative parameters in the supraoculomotor area of midbrain2, 3 and the oculomotor vermis of the cerebellum.4, 5 Thus, a combined approach of acquiring both clinical vision function measures and objective eye movement recordings in children with PCS-CI may lead to better characterization of the oculomotor phenotype with subsequent improved and personalized therapeutic interventions.",
