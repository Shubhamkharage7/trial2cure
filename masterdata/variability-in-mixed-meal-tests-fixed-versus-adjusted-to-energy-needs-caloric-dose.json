            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nResearchers use mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTTs) to look at how people s bodies respond to eating a meal. However, researchers do not agree on how to decide the number of calories to give in each meal. Some use fixed meals, which are the same size for everyone, and some use adjusted meals, based on the size of the person s body. Researchers want to know which MMTT is best to use for future research.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn how fixed vs adjusted meals affect blood glucose levels in healthy people.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy people aged 18 years or older.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 3 or 4 clinic visits of up to 8 hours in 8 weeks.\n\nParticipants will have baseline tests:\n\nTheir height, weight, and waist size will be measured.\n\nThey will have an oral glucose tolerance test: A needle attached to a tube (IV) will be inserted into a vein in the arm. They will have a sugary drink. Blood samples will be taken from the tube at intervals up to 3 hours after the drink.\n\nThey will have a body scan.\n\nParticipants will have 2 MMTT visits. One will include a fixed meal and one will include an adjusted meal. They will have tests at both visits:\n\nResting metabolic rate: A clear hood will be placed over the participant s head while they rest for 20 minutes. This will measure the oxygen they breathe in and out.\n\nMMTT. Participants will have 5 minutes to drink a liquid meal. Blood samples will be taken at intervals for the next 4 hours....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study will be an outpatient study completed in 3-4 separate visits. We will compare two methods of dosing (fixed and adjusted) a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) to determine which results in greater physiological variability in hormone response. Ultimately, the goal is to determine which method of dosing is more appropriate in a research setting.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine whether an adjusted energy dose MMTT or a fixed dosed meal will result in greater variability in glucose area under the curve (AUC) within the same participants across a range of BMIs.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo determine whether baseline body composition, blood parameters (lipids, hormones, etc), and resting metabolic rate are associated with MMTT responses and whether this association is moderated by MMTT condition (fixed vs. adjusted).\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Glucose area under the curve (AUC)\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Area under the curve (AUC), incremental area under the curve (iAUC), value and timing of the absolute maximum (peak), value and timing of the inflection point after the absolute maximum value, value and timing of the maximum rate of incline, value and timing of the maximum rate of decline, total number of critical points with body composition, blood parameters, and resting metabolic rate as predictors."
