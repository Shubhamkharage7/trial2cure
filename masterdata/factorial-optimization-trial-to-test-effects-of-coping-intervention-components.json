            "briefSummary": "This study will identify components for inclusion in a coping intervention package to reduce mental health problems among children exposed to high interparental conflict after parental separation/divorce. Reappraisal, distraction, and relaxation coping strategies are related to fewer mental health problems among children, making intervention components based on these strategies key candidates for inclusion in an optimized coping intervention. The primary aim is to experimentally assess the main and interactive effects of three digital intervention coping components (reappraisal, distraction, relaxation) on children's coping efficacy, emotional security, and internalizing and externalizing problems. Secondary aims are to assess indirect effects of the intervention components on children's coping efficacy, emotional security, and internalizing and externalizing problems through their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions to post-separation/divorce interparental conflict events.",
            "detailedDescription": "A randomized and counterbalanced 2x2x2 factorial trial (N = 144 children, ages 9-12) will be conducted to assess the individual effects of the three digital coping intervention components. The three components to be tested will be: (1) Reappraisal (No vs. Yes), (2) Distraction (No vs. Yes), (3) Relaxation (No vs. Yes). Components that meet a priori thresholds for meaningful change will be combined to form an intervention package that will be evaluated in a subsequent randomized controlled trial."
