            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multicenter, registry of stable patients with ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) evaluated by coronary angiography, intravascular imaging, and physiologic measurements obtained on the Coroventis Coroflow Cardiovascular System.\n\nThe Coroventis Coroflow Cardiovascular System and PressureWire\u2122 X Guidewire (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) are a device combination consisting of a physiology wire with wireless transmitter (Wi-Box), CoroHub Receiver, and CoroFlow Software. The PressureWire\u2122 X guidewire is a hydrophilic-coated wire with pressure and temperature sensors that is capable of measuring physiologic indices including fractional flow reserve (FFR), resting full cycle ratio (RFR), coronary flow reserve (CFR), and the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR). The guidewire wirelessly transmits pressure and temperature data via the Wi-Box to the CoroHub Receiver and CoroFlow Software, which is a software interface designed to display pressure measurements, thermodilution curves, and physiologic indices. This registry will enroll 500 subjects at up to 10 sites in the United States that use the Abbott Coroventis Coroflow Cardiovascular System.\n\nThe overall objective of this multi-center registry is to identify specific phenotypes of INOCA with both an anatomic evaluation (coronary angiography and intravascular imaging) and physiologic assessment with the Abbott Coroventis Coroflow Cardiovascular System, and to determine long-term outcomes. Specific goals include:\n\n* Describe the prevalence of the following INOCA phenotypes: coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), vasospastic angina, mixed CMD/vasospastic angina, other disorders of coronary physiology, and non-cardiac chest pain;\n* Characterize the burden of epicardial coronary artery atherosclerosis and myocardial bridging (MB) by angiography and intracoronary imaging (intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography) in patients with INOCA;\n* Characterize the natural history and outcomes of patients with INOCA and determine variables associated with major adverse cardiovascular events"
