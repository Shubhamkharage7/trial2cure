            "briefSummary": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Systemic cancer treatments are an important contributor to dramatic improvements in the long-term survival of women with BC. However, cancer treatment can lead to cognitive impairment and declines in quality of life in women with BC. Many cancer survivors experience memory and brain function decline following chemotherapy which can last for years. A newer diet pattern, Mediterranean-DASH \\[Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\] Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), was shown to help with protecting brain functions. The MIND diet is high in anti-inflammatory nutrients (e.g., omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), carotenoids, B-vitamins, and polyphenols) and limits the intake of brain-unhealthy foods (i.e., butter/margarine, cheese, red meat, fried foods, pastries, and sweets), which may help alleviate negative cognitive outcomes from cancer treatments. This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the effect of the MIND diet on cognitive functions in women with invasive BC starting systemic therapies."
