            "detailedDescription": "To determine whether the parasagittal approach to lumbar medial branch (LMB) nerve radiofrequency ablation (RFA) will have greater efficacy than the traditional approach to lumbar medial branch nerve radiofrequency ablation.\n\nThis will be accomplished by comparing the results between the newly proposed parasagittal approach and the traditional approach of medial branch RFA done on the same patient (different sites) with bilateral low back pain (LBP).\n\nTraditional approach:\n\nThe electrode is introduced at a 15-20 degrees' ipsilateral oblique angle to the sagittal plane toward the junction of the superior articular process (SAP) and transverse process (TP) of the vertebral body to target the traversing medial branch nerve. The reason for the proposed angle is to avoid the mamillo-accessory ligament (MAL) that may be ossified in up to 10% of the normal spine and, in such cases, potentially prevent proper coagulation of the medial branch nerve during the RFA procedure.\n\nParasagittal (new) approach:\n\nRecently, Tran et al. showed that MAL is located more dorsally than it was thought earlier and, therefore, can't interfere with nerve coagulation during the RFA. Consequently, they proposed abandoning the 20-degree angle used for the traditional approach and placing the radiofrequency cannula parasagittally and more dorsally. It is proposed that, in order to achieve maximum nerve coagulation, the electrode should be placed as parallel to the nerve as possible, and placing it parasagittally helps achieve this goal. The remainder of the procedure does not differ from the traditional method."
