            "briefSummary": "Enhancing patient monitoring in SNFs and ALFs is crucial due to challenges in recognizing deteriorating health. Gaps in vital sign checks lead to missed indicators and adverse outcomes. Turtle Shell Technologies' Dozee Pro NX offers continuous non-invasive monitoring, alerting healthcare providers of vital sign changes. This clinical study aims to evaluate Dozee Pro Nx's impact on patient outcomes, practitioner efficiency, and healthcare costs in SNFs and ALFs, addressing gaps in care delivery.",
            "detailedDescription": "In skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and assisted living facilities (ALFs), managing patient health presents considerable hurdles in accurately identifying and responding to deteriorating conditions. The intricacies of care within these settings are compounded by a high patient-to-healthcare provider ratio, often leading to infrequent vital sign checks with significant time gaps between assessments. This monitoring gap may result in overlooking early signs of health decline, potentially causing adverse patient outcomes. A February 2014 report by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) underscored this issue, revealing that around 22% of Medicare beneficiaries experienced adverse events during their stays in SNFs, with an additional 11% facing temporary harm events. Notably, 59% of these incidents were considered preventable, largely due to insufficient patient monitoring, care delays, and substandard treatment. In response to these challenges, Turtle Shell Technologies (TST) Private Limited has developed Dozee Pro NX, an innovative system tailored to improve patient monitoring in these healthcare settings. This system employs non-invasive sensors to continuously monitor crucial parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, and SpO2. Distinguished from traditional patient monitoring devices, Dozee Pro Nx offers advanced functionalities, including customizable notifications to alert healthcare providers of vital sign deterioration, thereby enabling prompt intervention. The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the potential impact of the Dozee Pro Nx system on patient outcomes, healthcare practitioner efficiency, and overall healthcare costs. This investigation aims to ascertain whether the implementation of this advanced monitoring technology can effectively address the identified gaps in patient care within SNFs and ALFs, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and enhanced care delivery."
