            "briefSummary": "The current study is a clinical trial, meaning a research study in which human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related behavioral outcomes. Specifically, male and female adolescents with current suicidal intent will be randomly assigned to receive either a 1-hour session of virtual crisis response planning (CRP), a 1-hour session of in-person CRP, or a 1-hour session of standard crisis risk management (treatment as usual). The feasibility and acceptability of the virtual CRP, compared to in-person CRP, will be assessed 14 days post-treatment. Additional assessments of changes in mood, behavior, and suicidality will be collected daily for 14 days post-treatment via ecological momentary assessments. The investigators hypothesize the following: 1) Virtual CRP will be rated as more feasible and acceptable compared to traditional CRP and treatment as usual interventions; 2) Both versions of CRP will be associated with changes in frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to treatment as usual; 3) Virtual CRP will be equally as effective as traditional CRP at reducing suicide risk, suggesting that virtual CRP is a promising scalable intervention adaptation."

The virtual CRP is primarily text-based, instead of verbal, and utilizes the chat feature on doxy.me. CRP involves the following standard suicide intervention strategies: supportive listening, provision of crisis resources, and referral to a mental health professional (if not already established). The CRP active component involves a collaborative process in which the therapist invites the participant to share the events, symptoms, and contextual factors leading up to and surrounding their suicidal crisis. Next, the participant identifies their personal warning signs, self-management coping skills, reasons for living, and sources of social support. The participant types the components on a template via the white board feature on doxy.me. The CRP will be saved and serve as a concrete reference for participants in the real-world.",
