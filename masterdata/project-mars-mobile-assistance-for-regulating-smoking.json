            "briefSummary": "This study aims to identify states of vulnerability for lapse, identify states of receptivity for engaging in self-regulatory activities, and investigate approaches to capitalize on states of vulnerability and receptivity to deliver real-time self-regulation prompts among smokers.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1: Identify states of vulnerability for lapse: Self-reported and sensor-based measures will be used to identify empirically-based and theoretically-grounded features across multiple time scales that are most predictive of lapse. Operationalizing vulnerability in terms of the predicted level of risk for lapse, the investigators hypothesize that (H1) current vulnerability is represented by current and/or recent high negative emotions, low positive emotions, high craving, low self-efficacy, low self-regulatory capacity (SRC), and risky context (e.g., specific locations, such as a bar; cigarettes available; others smoking).\n\nAim 2: Identify states of receptivity for engaging in self-regulatory activities: Self-reported and sensor-based measures will be used to identify empirically-based and theoretically-grounded features across multiple time scales that are most predictive of engagement (i.e., usage of self-regulatory activities). Operationalizing receptivity in terms of the predicted likelihood of engagement, the investigators hypothesize that (H2) current receptivity is represented by high positive activating emotions (e.g., happy, grateful), low negative deactivating emotions (e.g., sad, boredom), low craving, high self-efficacy, high SRC, and low risk contexts (e.g., specific locations, such as home).\n\nAim 3: Investigate approaches to capitalize on states of vulnerability and receptivity to deliver real-time self-regulation prompts. Investigate whether, what type, and under what conditions (e.g., current state of vulnerability and/or receptivity) a prompt to engage the individual in self-regulatory activities increases engagement, hence reduces vulnerability.\n\nThe proposed research will help build a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Interventions (JITAIs) based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. In the micro-randomized trial (MRT), Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) are administered before and after JITAIs with items that are designed to measure different indices that may be related to participants' engagement of the JITAIs."
