            "detailedDescription": "3.1 Problem Statement At the present time, there are no side-by-side comparison studies of GoGoband\u00ae vs SNEA. Since many of the prior studies were conducted using variable outcome parameters that makes direct comparisons of studies difficult it would be beneficial to obtain comparable data from the 2 groups and compare dry night rates for the 2 devices.\n\n3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact Our preliminary quality improvement data indicates that the GoGoband\u00ae is more efficacious than both medication and SNEA in an uncontrolled environment when deidentified data was analyzed off our servers. Our present database does not allow us to discern if patients are monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) or non monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE). Without this ability as well as for controlling for behavioral and academic problems which are known to affect outcomes in nocturnal enuresis studies, the investigators are not able to compare our results definitively and accurately to other treatment modalities.\n\nHypothesis Our hypothesis is that the GoGoband\u00ae is more effective than SNEA and Desmopressin in the treatment of Nocturnal Enuresis Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the GoGoband\u00ae\\] is as effective or more effective in comparison to children who use SNEA in a population of MNE patients with no underlying Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a 3 month period.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo ascertain if familial incidence of nocturnal enuresis has an effect on outcomes\n\n5.1 General Design Description The investigators propose the following study in patients who have been evaluated for primary nocturnal enuresis in our Yale New Haven Clinics.\n\n* All patients to be evaluated for nocturnal enuresis will undergo standard evaluation and initial treatment for nocturnal enuresis which includes:\n* Assessment Of Bowel Habits,\n* Fill Out A Questionnaire To Evaluate For Voiding Dysfunction\n* Treatment with routine bedwetting protocol of:\n\n  1. Stopping drinks 1 HR before bedtime, meals at least 3 hrs before bedtime, eliminating milk and ice cream from dinner and on, making sure that bowel movements are occurring 4 times per week and treating appropriately if necessary.\n  2. On return visit bedwetters and parents will be given the option of using medication , no further treatment, or alarm therapy.\n  3. If patients choose alarm therapy, they will be asked if they wish to participate in the Randomized study comparing GoGoband\u00ae vs SNEA.\n  4. Alarms will be provided to the patients free of cost to participants\n  5. Patients in the alarm group will be treated for 3 months continuously.\n  6. Patients in the SNEA group will record nightly if they wet their clothes and the report will be recorded and reviewed weekly\n  7. GoGoband\u00ae patients' data will be automatically saved on the HIPPA Compliant servers and subsequently reviewed at the end of the week."
