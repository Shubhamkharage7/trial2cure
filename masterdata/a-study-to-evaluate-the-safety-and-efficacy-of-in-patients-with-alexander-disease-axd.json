Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive zilganersen (ION373) or matching placebo for a 60-week double-blind treatment period; then all participants will receive zilganersen for a 60-week open-label treatment period followed by a 120-week open-label, long-term extension period, and a 28-week post-treatment follow-up period. Multiple dose cohorts will be evaluated in the study. Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially. The initial participants in each dose cohort must be at least 8 years of age at the time of Screening.\n\nThe study will include an optional open-label sub-study in participants \\<2 years of age at some sites.\n\nTreatment extension period was added to provide continued access to open label zilganersen for patients completing the main study and sub-study until the drug may be commercially available."
