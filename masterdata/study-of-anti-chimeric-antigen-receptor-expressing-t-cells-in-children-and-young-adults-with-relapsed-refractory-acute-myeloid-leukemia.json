The trial will be done in two phases: Phase 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of CD33CART cells using a 3+3 trial design, with dose-escalation for autologous products separated from dose-escalation for an allogeneic arm. Phase 2 is an expansion phase designed to evaluate the rate of response to CD33CART.",

Recipients have evidence of ongoing active GVHD and are taking immunosuppressive agents (\\>0.5 mg/kg/methylprednisolone equivalents or other immunosuppression for GVHD treatment) OR\n   3. Recipients have received DLI within 30 days prior to enrollment OR\n   4. Recipients are on active immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis (must be off for 30 days prior to enrollment)\n   5. Recipients who enroll to the ALLO-CD33CART arm must not have had any prior history of \\> grade 3 acute GVHD or severe chronic GVHD\n9. HIV/HBV/HCV Infection:\n\n   1. Seropositive for HIV 1 or 2 (Recipients with HIV are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in recipient receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in the future should study results indicate effectiveness)\n   2. Seropositive for Hepatitis C or positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAG)\n10. Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness including but not limited to infection, congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness, or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or in the opinion of the site PI would pose an unacceptable risk to the recipient\n11. Active second malignancy will not be eligible with the following exceptions:\n\n    1. Treatment-related or secondary CD33+ myeloid malignancy which may potentially benefit from CD33CART (which may be considered for enrollment),\n    2. Carcinoma in situ of the cervix (which may be considered for enrollment),\n    3. Recipient is in remission from a prior second malignancy (which may be considered for enrollment)\n12. History of severe, immediate hypersensitivity reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to any agents used in study or in the manufacturing of the cells (i.e. gentamicin).\n\nDonor inclusion criteria\n\n1. Must be the same donor whose cells were used as the source for the patient's most recent stem cell transplant\n2. Donors \\> 18 years of age must have the ability to give informed consent according to applicable regulatory and local institutional requirements. Legal guardian permission must be obtained for donors \\< 18 years of age. Pediatric donors will be included in age-appropriate discussion in order to obtain assent;\n3. HLA-matched related sibling (or alternative fully matched relative)\n4. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or without a contradiction to undergoing temporary line placement.\n\n   1. For donors who have previously undergone collection for DLI and have a cryopreserved unmobilized product, this may be considered for use as the starting material\n\nDonor exclusion criteria\n\n1. Pregnancy (negative serum or urine pregnancy test must be obtained at time of enrollment for females of childbearing potential and to be repeated 72 hours prior to apheresis)\n2. HIV/HBV/HCV Infection:\n\n   1. Seropositive for HIV 1 or 2\n   2. Seropositive for Hepatitis C or positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAG)\n3. Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness including but not limited to infection, congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness, or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or in the opinion of the site PI would pose an unacceptable risk to the donor",
