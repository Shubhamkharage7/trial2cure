            "briefSummary": "Recurrent Clostridioides difficle infection (rCDI) is a very significant problem in its own right and current fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) -based therapeutics will benefit from their optimization for this indication. It is likely that appropriate nutritional support coupled with microbiota-based drugs will yield superior clinical outcomes. However, both diet and gut microbiome are very complex. This project, which is based on a wealth of FMT experience, both clinical and investigational, over the past decade along with the novel techniques developed to identify dietary patterns and food groups that explain the most variation in gut microbiome, offers an ideal platform for performing systematic research in nutritional support that promotes gut microbiota health. The purpose is to Generate preliminary data with regards to tolerability of the Microbiota enhancing and nourishing diet (MEND) and its effects on the fecal microbiota in rCDI patients following FMT with the goal of developing larger clinical trials aimed to optimize post-FMT dietary management."
