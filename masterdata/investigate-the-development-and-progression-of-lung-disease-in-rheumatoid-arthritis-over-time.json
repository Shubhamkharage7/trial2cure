Additionally, those at heightened risk of developing RA such as in the pre-RA period. This is a prospective and retrospective study, which 420 patients will be enrolled into the study. In-person participation will be up to 4 years, completing different standard of care assessments yearly. Additionally, quality of life questionnaires will be completed every 6 months at 4 time points. Lastly, an extended follow-up will be performed yearly for an additional 6 years, an overall 10 year participation."
