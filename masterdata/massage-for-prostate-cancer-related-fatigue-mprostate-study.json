This trial aims to find out if massage and touch therapies reduce fatigue due to cancer, and to learn if these therapies are better than traditional medicine or psychology for cancer related fatigue.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To conduct a preliminary study to evaluate whether a 6-week Swedish Massage Therapy (SMT) intervention decreases cancer-related fatigue (CRF) significantly more than Light Touch (LT) or Wait List Control (WLC) among prostate cancer (PCa) survivors who have received both radiation and androgen deprivation therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate whether the hypothesized decrease in cancer-related fatigue with SMT is associated with modulation of specific immune system factors underlying chronic inflammation.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate whether SMT improves self-reported fatigue, quality of life, depression, and anxiety significantly more than LT or WLC.\n\nII. To gather preliminary data about the sustained actions of 6 weeks of SMT versus LT on CRF, at 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nArm I: Patients receive SMT over 45 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks.\n\nArm II: Patients receive LT over 45 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks.\n\nArm III: Patients receive no intervention for 6 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 and 18 weeks."
