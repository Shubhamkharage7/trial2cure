The objective of this GION study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KUS121 intravitreal (IVT) injection in participants with acute non-arteritic CRAO.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase II, double-masked, sham-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KUS121 intravitreal (IVT) injection in patients with non-arteritic Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) diagnosed and treated within 3-48 hours of disease onset. Participants will be randomized to high dose KUS121, low dose KUS121, or sham in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants will receive daily intravitreal injections of KUS 121 or sham, which mimics an injection, from Day 1 through Day 3. Primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants who gain 15 letters or more in BCVA compared with baseline and will be assessed at Week 12. Safety evaluation will continue until a 12-month follow up."
