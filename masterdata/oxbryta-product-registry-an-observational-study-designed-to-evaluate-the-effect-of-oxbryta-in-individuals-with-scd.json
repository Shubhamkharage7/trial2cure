Any participant who is currently taking Oxbryta, or has been prescribed and will initiate treatment with Oxbryta, is eligible to participate. Eligible participants will receive treatment with Oxbryta as prescribed by their physician, as part of their usual care. Participants will be treated and evaluated per standard of care (SOC) and at the physician's discretion. This study will collect data that are recorded in the participants' medical records and other secondary data sources. Study data will be collected at regular intervals and entered in case report forms (CRFs) via an electronic data capture (EDC) system by the study staff. Participants will be considered to be on study for up to 5 years after their first dose of Oxbryta treatment, or until they withdraw their consent to participate, or are discontinued from the study. Treatment, including interruptions and restarting treatment, will continue at the discretion of the treating physician, and there are no pre-defined treatment requirements. Participants may receive any additional medications prescribed by their treating physician, or have any medical interventions that are deemed appropriate by the treating physician or study doctor. The participant or treating physician may discontinue Oxbryta at any time. Participants who discontinue treatment with Oxbryta earlier than 5 years will continue to be followed on study to collect clinical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes for up to 5 years after their first dose of Oxbryta treatment. Participant safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study data collection period by the study doctor and reported to the Sponsor."
