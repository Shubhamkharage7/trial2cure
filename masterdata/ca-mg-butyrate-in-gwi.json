            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine if treatment with Butyrate formulation that consists of butyric acid as calcium and magnesium derivatives (Ca-Mg Butyrate) improves the physical function of men and women Veterans suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI). The primary outcome measure is a change from baseline on the Short Form Health Survey 36-item (VSF-36), with respect to physical functioning and symptoms. The secondary outcome will focus on the drug's role in (a) restoring gut microbiome and virome, (b) decreasing gastrointestinal disturbances (constipation, diarrhea, pain), (c) decreasing chronic fatigue, (d) decreasing systemic inflammation, and (e) a decrease in cognitive deficits.",
            "detailedDescription": "Nearly one third of 700,000 military personnel deployed during Desert Shield and Desert Storm (Aug 2, 1990 to July 31, 1991) in the Kuwaiti War Theater are suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI), an unexplained chronic illness characterized by multiple symptoms. The illness has taken a heavy toll on deployed Veterans' overall quality of life. Recent research has revealed the host gut microbiome's role in gastrointestinal disturbance, systemic inflammation, and neurotrophic abnormalities in Gulf War Illness mouse models. Also, short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate restored a healthy microbiome and improved gut microbial metabolism apart from attenuating GWI symptom persistence in preclinical studies. Butyrate, a nutraceutical endogenously produced in the host gut following bacterial fermentation, has shown promise in gastrointestinal disturbances such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\nThis is a randomized, two-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II clinical trial. The treatment group will receive microencapsulated butyrate capsules (600 mg twice a day for 18 weeks). The placebo group will receive a matching placebo formulation twice a day for 18 weeks. However, after two weeks of the treatment (20 weeks) there will be a follow up virtual visits. The primary outcome measure for this clinical trial is a change from baseline of VSF-36 and CVLT III test scores with respect to physical and mental functioning and symptoms. The secondary outcome measures include changes from baseline of host-microbiome signature, intestinal permeability assessment, peripheral pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and GWI-associated symptoms IBS, chronic pain, fatigue, sleep issues, and cognitive impairment."
