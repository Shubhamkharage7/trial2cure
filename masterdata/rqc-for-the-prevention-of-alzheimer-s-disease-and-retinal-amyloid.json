            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether oral resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin (RQC) can prevent the accumulation of retinal amyloid-\u03b2 and/or cognitive decline over 24 months in adults aged 50-90 with Stage 1 or 2 Alzheimer's disease as described in FDA-2013-D-0077. The trial will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RQC. Curcumin, which binds to amyloid-\u03b2, will act as a fluorescent label to identify retinal amyloid-\u03b2 in vivo using optical coherence tomography (OCT)-autofluorescence imaging. The investigators will longitudinally evaluate the effect of RQC on retinal amyloid-\u03b2 load cognitive outcomes including the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and potential microvascular biomarkers. The investigators will also evaluate associations between retinal amyloid-\u03b2 and progression to early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment). The investigators will compare RQC, taken daily for 24 months, with curcumin alone, taken only during the 7 days preceding each of the six study visits to see if RQC can prevent (or reduce) amyloid-\u03b2 and prevent the onset of mild cognitive impairment."
