Project ALERT is a widely used drug prevention program for middle school youth. Though it has an evidence-base for effectiveness, the program (like most evidence-based programs in schools) is not run with adequate fidelity representing a large gap between what is developed and tested for effectiveness and what is used in actual practice. Thus, the study will conduct an updated randomized controlled trial of PA and test GTO as a tool to increase adoption and adequate fidelity of the program in schools. GTO's previous evidence suggests it could be effective in public schools, yet this remains an empirical question. A successful demonstration of PA and GTO could fundamentally transform evidence-based prevention's delivery, reach, and thus impact, in the US."
