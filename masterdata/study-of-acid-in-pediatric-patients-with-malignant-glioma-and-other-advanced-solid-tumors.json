If the MTD is well tolerated in the expanded safety cohort, that dose becomes the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).\n\nGlioma patients and other solid tumor patients (including non-glial brain tumors) will be treated as a single cohort. Patients with either tumor type will be allowed to enroll on the study as positions are made available. No tumor type will be given priority over another and there is no minimum number of glioma patients or solid tumor patients that must be enrolled on the trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "The dose of LAM561 each patient will receive will depend on the dose cohort into which they are enrolled.\n\nOnce a patient is allocated a dose of LAM561 (either in the dose escalation phase or the expanded safety cohort), it is planned that they will continue to receive the same dose on a daily basis in treatment cycles of 21 days (3 weeks), which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption, until any criterion for discontinuation is met (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another \"general\" discontinuation criterion is met as defined in Section 5.5). In the event of significant gastrointestinal toxicity, the treatment schedule may be modified from continuous dosing to an intermittent regime (e.g. 1 week of dosing followed by 1 week not dosing), except during Cycle 1 of the dose escalation phase.\n\nIn the case of toxicity, the dose of LAM561 may be reduced or delayed by no more than 14 days at the discretion of the Investigator. Treatment \"holidays\" of no more than 14 days are also permitted for reasons other than toxicity, except during Cycle 1 of the dose escalation phase.\n\nIntra-patient dose escalation may be permitted in certain specific circumstances (and only if \u2264 Grade 2 toxicity was observed during previous treatment cycles), but toxicity will not be considered for definition of DLT.\n\nIt is expected that most patients will receive between one and 6 cycles of LAM561 for a treatment period of 3 to 18 weeks. The treatment period may be extended provided that no DLT has been observed and if in the opinion of the Investigator the patient is showing benefit from treatment with LAM561.\n\nPatients demonstrating clinical benefit from LAM561 will have the option of continuing treatment under compassionate use once the study has concluded."
