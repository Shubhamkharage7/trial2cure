            "briefSummary": "The investigators are piloting a 3 month community-based lifestyle medicine program that incorporates experiences and education in urban agriculture, nutrition, culinary arts, and physical fitness to test the hypothesis whether this improves clinical and socio-behavioral outcomes of participants with Cardiovascular Kidney Metabolic (CKM) syndrome (high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, and obesity) in comparison to the current medical care model (usual care) or providing healthy produce (medically tailored groceries).",
            "detailedDescription": "Many chronic conditions can be prevented, treated and improved, or even reversed through lifestyle modification. The practice and application of lifestyle medicine offers tremendous potential to restore health and reduce healthcare costs. Lifestyle Medicine is the use of evidence-based lifestyle therapeutic intervention-including a whole-food, plant-predominant eating pattern, regular physical activity, restorative sleep, stress management, avoidance of risky substances, and positive social connection-as a primary modality, delivered by clinicians trained and certified in this specialty to prevent, treat, and often reverse chronic disease. Lifestyle Medicine interventions have been applied in clinical, community, and workplace settings to drive health restoration and disease prevention.\n\nIn recent times there has been tremendous interest in the development and study of \"Food Is Medicine\" interventions as evidenced by the creation of a Food is Medicine initiative and inaugural Food is Medicine Summit, by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in fiscal year 2023. Historically Food is Medicine interventions have been applied using 3 modalities:\n\nProduce Prescriptions: Vouchers or restricted debit cards that can be redeemed for produce or direct distributions of produce that are made available to recipients based on a health condition or risk. Produce prescriptions are sometimes paired with services provided by RDNs, such as nutrition education, nutrition resources, supermarket tours, cooking classes, and medical nutrition therapy.\n\nMedically Tailored Groceries: Distributions of unprepared or lightly processed foods that recipients are meant to prepare for consumption at home; the contents are sufficient to prepare nutritionally complete meals or provide a significant portion of the ingredients for such meals, including produce, whole grains and legumes, and lean proteins.\n\nMedically Tailored Meals: Fully prepared meals made available through a referral from a medical professional or healthcare plan that are tailored to the medical needs of the recipient by a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). Nutrition assessment, nutrition counseling and medical nutrition therapy are offered along with the meal program.\n\nFood is medicine interventions suggest there is promise in improving not only food security, but health outcomes associated with diet related diseases. Addressing food insecurity with healthful food improving nutrition security is important, however \"Food Is Medicine\" interventions may not achieve the expected improvements in health outcomes if patient's lifestyle behaviors are not targeted comprehensively within their unique circumstances. This clinical aspect is often missing from the conversation in terms of chronic disease. Relative to \"Food is Medicine\" interventions, lifestyle medicine interventions are comprehensive expanding beyond nutrition, encompassing physical activity, stress management, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, adequate sleep, and social connectivity to treat disease and drive health restoration.\n\nThe investigators research question is: Does a comprehensive lifestyle medicine intervention (involving culinary education, health education, physical activity, and urban agriculture) more effectively improve cardiometabolic risk factors in participants compared to those who only receive produce food boxes or usual care?\n\nIn a pilot pragmatic randomized control trial (pRCT), the investigators hypothesize that a comprehensive lifestyle medicine intervention can improve clinical outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, body mass index) of people are living with a lifestyle-related non-communicable disease such as obesity, heart disease, or diabetes compared to a medically tailored groceries cohort and usual care (acting as a control)."

It can affect the individual's ability to adhere to study protocols, attend follow-up appointments, or impact the generalizability of the study findings. The investigators recognize the importance of addressing these social determinants of health, typically in clinical practice the investigators focus on helping the patient stabilize and resolve health related social needs prior to engaging in a comprehensive therapeutic lifestyle change program.",
