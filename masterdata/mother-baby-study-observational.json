The outcome measures are not measuring dependent variables based on the interventions; rather the interventions are experiments to categorize infant responses for the purpose of grouping infants according to their behaviors. There are small trials associated with the grant at National Clinical Trial numbers (NCT #s): NCT06072664, NCT06072651, and NCT06072638 to analyze behaviors at 18 and 36 months of age. However, because the NIH grant covering this study needs to be linked to a trial for computer smart logic purposes, and this overarching study connects with the most complete enrollment numbers, the record was modified in 2024 to show it as a trial."

The researchers anticipate, based on prior experience and the slightly more restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study compared to our prior work, needing to screen about 600 mother-infant dyads to achieve the target sample size of 120. The researchers anticipate that the sample will be 63% non-Hispanic white, 13% non-Hispanic black, 4% non-Hispanic Asian, 12% non-Hispanic multiracial, and 8% Hispanic (any race). The researchers expect that 50% of the infants will be male and 50% female, and all of the biological mothers will be female sex. Infants will be 0.5-1.5 months at enrollment and the researchers estimate that mothers will be between 18.0 and 50.0 at enrollment (upper age limit is estimated due to menopause ).",

Family plans to move outside 1.5 hour driving distance from the University of Michigan before end of age 36-month data collection window. This is necessary to ensure study feasibility.\n9. Child is product of multiple gestation (i.e., twins, triplets)\n10. Significant complications for mother or infant during the pregnancy as assessed by PI Lumeng (e.g., eclampsia, preterm premature rupture of membranes)\n11. Significant complications for mother or infant during the perinatal period as assessed by PI Lumeng (e.g., sepsis, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn)\n\nAll participants must be enrolled in all parts of the Mother-Baby study (1 Observational study and 4 Clinical Trials)",
