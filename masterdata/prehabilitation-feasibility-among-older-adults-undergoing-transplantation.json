The primary outcomes will be feasibility and secondary outcomes include changes in physical function at the time of transplant and at 12 weeks follow up.",

Eligible participants will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to one of two study conditions: 1) an 8 week long home-based prehabilitation exercise program delivered using a telehealth format or 2) an 8-week long nutrition counseling (attention control group). Assessments will occur at baseline, post-intervention (during transplant) and at 12-weeks post-transplant. Investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of our program as well as preliminary impact of the program on physical functioning during these time-periods."
