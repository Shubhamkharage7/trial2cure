            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies how well CBX-12 works in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread from where they first started (primary site) to started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). CBX-12 works by binding to a protein called TOP1 that is present inside the cells. This allows CBX-12 to kill the cancer cells by damaging their DNA, resulting in cancer cell death. This trial is being done to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for advanced cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess the effects of CBX-12 on biomarkers of DDR in biopsy specimens from patients with advanced solid tumors at baseline and 24-30 hours post-first dose to establish the degree and duration of CBX-12 target engagement.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the effects of CBX-12 on tumor TOP1 molecular response at baseline and 24-30 hours post-first dose.\n\nII. Determine any association between tumor TOP1 and DDR modulation and plasma exatecan concentrations.\n\nIII. Evaluate the effects of CBX-12 on CD8 T cell infiltration and activation in tumor.\n\nIV. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with advanced cancers to CBX-12 using RECIST v 1.1.\n\nV. Assess safety and tolerability of CBX-12.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Measure the effects of CBX-12 on molecular markers of apoptosis. II. Examine any genomic or gene expression characteristics in tumor that may be associated with sensitivity or resistance to CBX-12.\n\nIII. Examine any genomic alterations in circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) that may be associated with sensitivity or resistance to CBX-12.\n\nIV. Measure changes in levels of any anti-drug antibodies that may develop during CBX-12 therapy (Cybrexa assay).\n\nV. Examine the molecular context of drug sensitivity or resistance (e.g., SLFN11 expression).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive CBX-12 intravenously (IV), over 60 minutes, on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy and computed tomography (CT) scans on study and undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients follow up at 30 days."

Patients on substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 should be excluded unless they can be transferred on alternative medication. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CBX-12 (e.g., other topoisomerase I inhibitors) or the inactive ingredients in the drug product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CBX-12 is an investigational agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) for the duration of study participation and for at least 4 months after the last dose of the study. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother and because it is not known if the agent can be excreted in human milk, breastfeeding should be discontinued while the mother is taking CBX-12 and for 4 months after cessation of treatment",
