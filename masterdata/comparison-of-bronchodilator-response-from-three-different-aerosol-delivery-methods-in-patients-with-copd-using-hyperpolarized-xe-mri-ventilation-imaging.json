The main question it aims to answer is whether there are differences in lung ventilation following treatment with each of the three methods as measured using hyperpolarized Xe 129 with MRI.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nReceive a standard dose of albuterol delivered using each of 3 aerosol delivery devices. In total, participants will receive three treatments separated by at least 1 week each.\n\nFollowing each treatment, participants will have inhale an MRI contrast agent called hyperpolarized Xe 129 and will have images of their lungs taken with an MRI.\n\nResearchers will compare the different lung images taken after each treatment to see if there are differences in the distribution of air in the lungs (known as ventilation)."

Pulmonary function tests (PFT) value of forced expiratory volume at 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV\u2081 / FVC) \\<70%\n5. Receiving standard of care (SOC) background drug therapy as per current guidance for COPD for at least 6 months to screening Visit 1.\n6. Participants enrolled as bronchodilator responder:\n\n   a. Increase of \u226512% and \u2265200 mL as an absolute value compared with a baseline measure in either forced expiratory volume at 1 second or FVC at screening.\n7. Participants enrolled as non-bronchodilator responder:\n\n   a. Increase of \u226412% and \u2264200 mL as an absolute value compared with a baseline in either FEV1 or FVC at screening.\n8. Stable baseline conditions and no medication changes within 6 weeks of planned imaging visit.\n9. Female participants of childbearing potential must be confirmed non-pregnant via serum or dip-stick urine test at baseline (Screening) and prior to each Xe MRI.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participant with life expectancy \\<1-2 years or significant diseases other than COPD.\n\n   A significant disease is defined as a disease or condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or may influence either the results of the study or the patients' ability to participate in the study.\n2. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make it unsafe or unsuitable for the patients to undergo MRI (for example: presence of an implanted or external MRI unsafe device that cannot be removed, body weight exceeding table limitations, inability to lie flat, or severe claustrophobia).\n3. Inability to hold breath 10-15 seconds for required imaging or for completion of diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) measurements.\n4. Respiratory infection of exacerbation of COPD within the 6 weeks prior to screening.\n5. Malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation, or chemotherapy within the last 5 years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed.\n6. Known hypersensitivity to any of the study products.\n7. Known or planned pregnancy.\n8.
