To evaluate completeness of the intervention content.\n2. To identify barriers and facilitators for using the intervention.\n\nStage 2:\n\n1. To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention among Black or African American men with prostate cancer.\n2. To evaluate change in participant knowledge about tumor genetic testing among Black or African American men with prostate cancer.\n3. To evaluate change in patient attitudes toward tumor genetic testing among Black or African American men with prostate cancer.\n4. To evaluate change in participant expectations of tumor genetic testing among Black or African American men with prostate cancer.\n5. To evaluate patient perspectives on the intervention.\n6. To evaluate the rate of TGT among Black or African American men with prostate cancer who have received the tumor genetic pre-test counseling tool.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nThis is a two-stage study. In Stage 1, Adult Black or African American men with metastatic prostate cancer who have not made a decision about TGT, or who have decided to undergo TGT, or patients who have decline TGT about tumor genetic testing will participate in development by answering questionnaires and utilizing the pilot application for up to 60 days. The investigators will then refine the tool to be piloted in Stage 2.\n\nStage 2: A pilot study of participants who are planning to have a discussion about undergoing tumor genetic testing with their oncology provider will be invited to join and utilize the tool, and answer questionnaires about the tool."
