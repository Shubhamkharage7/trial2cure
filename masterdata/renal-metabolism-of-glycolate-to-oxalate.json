            "detailedDescription": "It is known that glycolate, an intermediary molecule in normal metabolism, can be converted into oxalate. The origin of urinary oxalate is of interest as calcium oxalate is a main component of kidney stones. In the rare disease primary hyperoxaluria, excessive production of oxalate by the body results in frequent kidney stones and can cause loss of kidney function. Primary hyperoxaluria is caused by deficiencies in one of several enzymes involved in the glycolate pathway.\n\nThis study will seek to determine how much oxalate is formed from glycolate in normal subjects. After consuming a controlled diet, subjects will either ingest or have an intravenous infusion of carbon 13 glycolate, a stable isotope of glycolate that can be tracked and will also label downstream metabolic products. Blood and urine samples will be assessed for their amounts of labeled glycolate and labeled oxalate to provide an accurate measure of how much oxalate is made from normal glycolate breakdown in healthy human subjects."
