The study will take place in simulated home environments which will be set up within or near active clinical settings (e.g., urgent care facilities). This will be a prospective study conducted at three or more investigational sites located within the United States for the clinical validation of the Metrix COVID/Flu Test for the differential detection of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B in AN swab or saliva samples. Additional sites may be added to the study in order to meet minimum subject/sample enrollment requirements and geographic prevalence of respiratory virus infections. One or more investigational sites outside of the US (at which participants are required to be fluent in English) may also be included in the study depending on enrollment needs and geographical/seasonal prevalence of respiratory virus infections. Comparator testing will be performed to determine the infection status of each sample for comparison to results generated by the candidate test. The primary comparator for the study will be an FDA-cleared assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, and/or Flu B.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Metrix COVID/Flu Test will be evaluated for OTC use in a home use testing environment utilizing the clinical study design described herein. The study will take place in simulated home environments which will be set up within or near active clinical settings (e.g., urgent care facilities). This will be a prospective study conducted at three or more investigational sites located within the United States for the clinical validation of the Metrix COVID/Flu Test for the differential detection of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B in AN swab or saliva samples. Additional sites may be added to the study in order to meet minimum subject/sample enrollment requirements and geographic prevalence of respiratory virus infections.

Comparator testing will be performed to determine the infection status of each sample for comparison to results generated by the candidate test. The primary comparator for the study will be an FDA-cleared assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, and Flu B.\n\nThe candidate device, Metrix COVID/Flu Test, will be evaluated with two specimen types - saliva and AN swab. Each Metrix COVID/Flu Test kit contains all supplies needed to test either a saliva or AN swab sample, including a corresponding QRI for each specimen type. It is possible for participants to elect to provide only a single sample type for the study; however, both sample types should be collected when possible. If participants will be testing both saliva and AN swab samples, the AN swab test should be conducted first. If participants elect to provide only a single sample type, the AN swab will be prioritized.\n\nThis OTC study will take place in simulated home environments which will be set up within or near clinical settings (e.g., urgent care facilities). The study will enroll symptomatic subjects only. Candidate samples will be self-collected by participants (or collected by a guardian for participants under the age of 14 years) and comparator samples will be collected by a healthcare practitioner with informed consent and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Each sample will be coded for confidentiality.\n\nFor each participant, a comparator NP swab sample will be obtained by a healthcare practitioner after testing with the candidate device. This NP swab will be tested with the FDA-cleared SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, and Flu B assay according to the IFU and will serve as the primary comparator for both saliva and AN swab samples. An additional saliva sample will also be obtained for SARS-CoV-2 analysis via a secondary comparator method, which will be used for informational purposes only. An additional AN swab sample will be collected and stored frozen and dry for later analysis to support future research validation studies.\n\nNo results from the investigational test or comparator testing will be used for clinical diagnosis, management of study participants, or to make treatment decisions.\n\nTest results from the Metrix COVID/Flu Test (investigational test) will be compared to the test results generated from the comparator assay.\n\nNo investigational test results will be reported to a third party or used for any treatment decisions.\n\nThis work is supported by funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)."
