This study will specifically compare the effectiveness of three implementation strategies: (1) training materials only, (2), training materials and direct training from our expert trainers, and (3) training materials, direct training, and local supervision from a clinical supervisor. The proposed prospective study will utilize a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. This design is used to compare the impact of two or more implementation strategies while also gathering effectiveness data and is recommended when there is already strong evidence for the intervention's effectiveness, strong basis that the implementation strategies are feasible, and strong implementation momentum. Randomization will occur on the center-level, so that MHPs working in the same center will receive one of the three types of training.\n\nOutcomes include mental health providers' changes in demonstrated skills in providing LGBTQ-affirmative CBT from baseline to 4-, 8-, 12-, and 24-months post-baseline. This study will also investigate determinants of successful implementation of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT and examine the impact of the implementation strategies on client mental health."
