This information will allow a more definitive description of GBE deficiency to be developed, which will permit development of treatment strategies for this disease.\n\nDuke will be the only site where this study takes place. However, since this is a rare disorder, participants who receive care for GBE deficiency at other institutions will be included. We will collect retrospective data from patient charts on diagnosed individuals, as far back as necessary to capture the clinical course of the disorder. Prospective data collected from patient charts after enrollment will be captured as well. Participant's medical records will be continually reviewed for the duration of the study.\n\nData will be collected from medical records and will only pertain to clinically relevant information, including, but not limited to: demographic and diagnostic information, tissue biopsy results, medical and family history, review of systems, imaging studies, results of liver, muscle, and nerve function testing, and urine and blood laboratory results."
