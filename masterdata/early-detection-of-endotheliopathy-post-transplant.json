            "briefSummary": "The goal of this research study is to learn more about possible risk factors that might be associated with side effects from stem cell transplants in people between the ages of 0 to 26 years old. Specifically, this study is looking at complications that arise from injury to the endothelium, a small layer of cells lining the blood vessels and heart. These complications can affect the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and intestines and increase risk of severe illness needing care in the intensive care unit.",
            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objectives:\n\n* To evaluate the proportion of pediatric patients undergoing Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) who develop critical illness (defined by admission to the pediatric intensive care unit at St. Jude for reasons other than observation after procedure) within 100 days of such therapies.\n* To evaluate the proportion of pediatric patients undergoing HCT who experience development of endothelial-related organ dysfunction syndromes.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To report the baseline (pre-conditioning and post-conditioning but pre-cellular therapy) levels of specified circulating biomarkers, vascular reactivity as measured by reactive hyperemia index (RHI), and to describe baseline clot structure in patients age 0-26 years of age planned to undergo HCT.\n* To compare the levels of circulating biomarkers between the cohort of patients that experience critical illness (defined by admission to the pediatric intensive care unit at St. Jude for reasons other than observation after procedure) any time during the first 100 days of HCT following cellular infusion and the cohort of patients that do not ever experience critical illness in the first 100 days of HCT following cellular infusion.\n* To evaluate the time to development of any complications including development of endotheliopathies, development of critical illness (defined by admission to the pediatric intensive care unit at St. Jude for reasons other than observation after procedure), development of abnormal vascular reactivity by RHI, development of abnormal clot structure, and time to peak (or trough, if applicable) level of circulating biomarkers.\n\nThe study will require a minimum of 1 blood draw before transplant and 6 blood draws throughout the first 100 days following transplant. If participants are admitted to the intensive care unit or are diagnosed with specific complications additional blood draws will be done. Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) testing will also be done around the same time as the blood draws."
