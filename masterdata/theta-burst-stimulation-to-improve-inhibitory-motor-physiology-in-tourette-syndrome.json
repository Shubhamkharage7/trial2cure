            "briefSummary": "Decades of Tourette Syndrome (TS) neuroimaging research has revealed abnormal cortical and subcortical motor system network, hypothesized to result from maladaptive plasticity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (\\[r\\]TMS) is a promising technology that utilizes the concept of neuroplasticity to modulate brain circuits. TMS modulation has the distinct advantage in terms of its non-invasive nature. Furthermore, unique stimulation paradigms such as intermittent theta-burst repetitive TMS (iTBS) allows for short stimulation time (\\<3 min).\n\nUsing a sham-controlled protocol, the investigators propose modulating pre-SMA output using iTBS, based on our prior data of abnormal pre-SMA-mediated motor system regulation. hypothesize pre-SMA modulation results in increased pre-SMA-mediated motor inhibition. Enhancing these inhibitory measures with pre-SMA-iTBS provides the basis for improving inhibitory function in TS patients, leading to our long-term goal of neuro-stimulation to achieve clinical tic reduction."
