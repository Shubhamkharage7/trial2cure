            "detailedDescription": "Participants receiving cooling cap therapy will receive scalp hypothermia as delivered by the scalp cooling system and as per the manufacturers recommendations. Scalp cooling will begin at least 30-45 minutes prior to administration of each chemotherapy (45 minutes for those with thick or coarse hair types). Scalp temperature will be maintained at +3\u00b0C (37\u00b0F) throughout drug administration and for at least 120-180 minutes after discontinuing the infusion.\n\nA trained study staff member will be present to place the cool cap on the participant, ensure proper fit, begin the cooling process, and ensure functionality. The bedside nurse on the inpatient unit will monitor the participants during the duration of cool cap therapy while also receiving chemotherapy infusion. A trained study team member will be available for any questions or issues that may arise during this time. When the participant is ready to remove the cooling cap a trained study team member will return to shut off the device, remove the cap, and assess the participant."

Any patient receiving the following drugs may experience complete alopecia (dose and schedule dependent). If they are receiving such a drug for a non- malignant indication or solid tumor, they may be suitable for inclusion in the study and may benefit from the use of a scalp cooling device. Of the commonly used intravenous single cytotoxic agents, those most likely to cause complete alopecia (dose and schedule dependent) include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, thiotepa), antitumor antibiotics (dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin), antimicrotubule agents (paclitaxel, docetaxel, ixabepilone, eribulin), and topoisomerase inhibitors (etoposide, irinotecan). Alopecia is less common or incomplete with bleomycin, low-dose epirubicin or doxorubicin (especially \\<30 mg/m2), oral cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, gemcitabine, melphalan, methotrexate, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, the platinums (oxaliplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin), topotecan, and the vinca alkaloids. Antibody-drug conjugates are also associated with variable hair loss, which is agent specific.\n2. Diagnosed with a non-malignant condition (such as Sickle Cell Disease or Aplastic Anemia) OR Diagnosed with a solid tumor (non-brain tumor)\n3. Patients must be at least 7 years old\n4. Patients should have a head circumference of 50 cm or greater\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients receiving a chemotherapeutic agent for a hematologic malignant/neoplastic condition.\n2. Patients with neoplasm of the brain or scalp, or present scalp metastasis, or high risk of metastatic disease to the brain or scalp (for example, neuroblastoma, melanoma or other skin malignancies, or patients who have had or are scheduled to undergo cranial irradiation.)\n3. Patients who are unfit for the study based on the opinion of the primary investigator and/or the patient's primary team.\n4. Patients with a previous history of adverse event associated with the Paxman scalp kit or scalp cooling device\n5. Patients with cold agglutinin disease or cold urticaria\n6. Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian/representative to give written informed consent\n7.
