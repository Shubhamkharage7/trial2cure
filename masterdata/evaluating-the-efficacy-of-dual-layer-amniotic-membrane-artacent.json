Multi-center, open label, randomized controlled trial. Study is estimated to require 12 months from first subject enrolled to last subject visit.",
            "detailedDescription": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) challenge the most experienced wound care specialist. The US Wound Registry reports that only 40% of DFUs heal in 12 weeks1. Woundologists have adopted the phrase, \"time is tissue.\" This adage reminds clinicians that the longer a DFU remains open, the greater the risk of infection, major amputation and death. The diabetic with a foot ulcer has a mortality rate of 47% which exceeds the mortality2 from most common cancers3. Beyond patient suffering, the treatment of DFUs cost the US health care system more than 15 billion dollars annually4.\n\nIn recent years, several clinical trials have demonstrated that products derived from human placental membranes promote the healing of DFUs5. Research has confirmed that growth factors present in amniotic membrane induce angiogenesis, stimulate human dermal fibroblast proliferation, and recruit stem cells important to wound repair and regeneration to the DFU6. All these factors are highly desirable properties in the healing of chronic DFUs.\n\nA novel dual layer amniotic membrane (DLAM, Artacent\u2122, Tides Medical. Lafayette, LA) potentially can increase the delivery of growth factors due to its double layer of amniotic membrane. A prospective case series demonstrated good healing rates in DFUs: 65% healing at 12 weeks7. The current study is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of DLAM in DFUs."
