            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to develop a technique called real time fMRI neurofeedback.\n\nThis technique uses a regular MRI scanner, except that special software allows the researchers to measure activity in participants brain, using fMRI, and then give information, in the form of a feedback signal, which indicates brain activity in real time, while in the MRI scanner. The larger goal of this study is to develop ways to help people, including those with depression, better regulate brain activity. The researchers think that this may be helpful in managing psychiatric symptoms.\n\nThis study design has three phases, however, only two phases (phase 2 and 3) are considered to be a clinical trial. Phase 2 (part 2) was registered and is NCT05934604. This is the phase 3 (part 3) for this project and is funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
            "detailedDescription": "Part 3/Phase 3 study hypothesis are:\n\n* Rest Focus Task (RFT) will activate brain networks at the individual subject level to provide a viable signal for Neurofeedback (NF)\n* At the group level, RFT in the Active\\>Passive contrast will activate canonically defined salience network\n* Neurofeedback-reinforced practice over the session will increase RFT activation over the course of the training session, comparing RFT activation, without NF, before and after NF runs.\n* Valid Neurofeedback will increase RFT activation more compared to sham NF (assessed during the no-NF session)."

In this controlled condition, subjects will see the circular pattern change, and the study team will ask participants to try and increase the size, except that the changing size will not actually be determined by your brain activity.
