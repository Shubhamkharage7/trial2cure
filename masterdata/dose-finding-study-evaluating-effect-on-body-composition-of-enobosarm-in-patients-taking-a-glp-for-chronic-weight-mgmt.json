Subjects will be randomized to the three treatment arms (GLP-1 receptor agonist plus either enobosarm 3mg dose group, enobosarm 6mg dose group, or placebo group) in a 1:1:1 fashion. All patients randomized into this study will be medically indicated for use of GLP-1 receptor agonist for weight management. NOTE: First dose of GLP-1 receptor agonist will be Day 1 of this study.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be the change from baseline in total lean mass at 4 months (112 days). Subjects will continue enobosarm (or matching placebo) monotherapy treatment from Day 112 to Day 196 to assess the effect of enobosarm on total lean mass, total muscle mass, maintenance of weight loss, and rebound fat gain after discontinuation of GLP-1 receptor agonists. A safety follow up visit will occur approximately 30 days after last dose of study drug.\n\nThe safety of enobosarm compared to the placebo control will be evaluated by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)."
